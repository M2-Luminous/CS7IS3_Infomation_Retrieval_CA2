FR940524-0-00029 FR940524-0-00007 (2) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 60 days pending the filing of an application for such regular operation; (3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the same service as previously authorized; or (4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the public interest and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public interest. (c) Temporary authorizations of operation not to exceed 180 days may be granted under the standards of section 309(f) of the Communications Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the temporary authorization for a period of 180 days each may also be granted, but the renewal applicant bears a heavy burden to show that extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension. (d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger to life or property or due to damage of equipment, or during a national emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by the Congress or during the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency where the Commission finds that it would not be feasible to secure renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow normal licensing procedure, the Commission will grant radio station authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof, during the emergency found by the Commission or during the continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special temporary licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, without the filing of formal applications. §24.426 Receipt of application; applications in the narrowband Personal Communications Services filed on FCC Form 175 and other applications in the narrowband PCS Service. (a) All applications for the initial provision of narrowband PCS service must be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175&hyph;S. Mutually exclusive initial applications in the narrowband Personal Communications Services are subject to competitive bidding. FCC Form 401 (``Application for New or Modified Common Carrier Radio Station Under Part 22'') must be submitted by each winning bidder for each narrowband PCS license applied for on FCC Form 175. In the event that mutual exclusivity does not exist between applicants filing FCC Form 175, the applicant will also file FCC Form 401. The aforementioned Forms 175, 175&hyph;S, and 401 are subject to the provisions of 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q (``Competitive Bidding Proceedings'') and subpart F of this part. Blanket licenses are granted for each market frequency block. Applications for individual sites are not needed and will not be accepted. See §24.11. (b) Applications received for filing are given a file number. The assignment of a file number to an application is merely for administrative convenience and does not indicate the acceptance of the application for filing and processing. Such assignment of a file number will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found to be not in accordance with the Commission's rules. (c) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has been the subject of a preliminary review as to completeness. Such acceptance will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found to be defective or not in accordance with the Commission's rules. (See §24.413 for additional information concerning filing of applications.) §24.427 Public notice period. (a) At regular intervals, the Commission will issue a public notice listing: (1) The acceptance for filing of all applications and major amendments thereto; (2) Significant Commission actions concerning applications listed as acceptable for filing; (3) Information which the Commission in its discretion believes of public significance. Such notices are solely for the purpose of informing the public and do not create any rights in an applicant or any other person; (4) Special environmental considerations as required by part 1 of this chapter. (b)(1) The Commission will not grant any application until expiration of a period of thirty (30) days following the issuance date of a public notice listing the application, or any major amendments thereto, as acceptable for filing. Provided, that the Commission will not grant an application filed on Form 401 filed either by a winning bidder or by an applicant whose Form 175 application is not mutually exclusive with other applicants, until the expiration of a period of forty (40) days following the issuance of a public notice listing the application, or any major amendments thereto, as acceptable for filing. See also 47 CFR 1.2108. (c) As an exception to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (b) of this section, the public notice provisions are not applicable to applications: (1) For authorization of a minor technical change in the facilities of an authorized station where such a change would not be classified as a major amendment (as defined by Sec. 24.423) were such a change to be submitted as an amendment to a pending application; (2) For issuance of a license subsequent to a radio station authorization or, pending application for a grant of such license, any special or temporary authorization to permit interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the same service as would be authorized by such license; (3) For extension of time to complete construction of authorized facilities, see §24.103; (4) For temporary authorization pursuant to §24.425(b); (5) [Reserved] (6) For an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of section 308(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 308(a)); (7) For consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer of control of a radio authorization; or
