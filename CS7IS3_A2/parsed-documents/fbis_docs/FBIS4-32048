Honorary Chairman Rudolf Mosny has proposed the abolition of the Ministry for Administration and Privatization of National Property. What do you think about his proposal? It is possible to assume, to a certain degree, that it was put forward by a man of some experience. Moreover, he says that, in our country, privatization has become a political instrument. I am, in fact, asking two questions. [Moravcik] I agree with both of them. As far as turning privatization into a political issue is concerned, we spoke out about this already some time ago, and we are striving to depoliticize privatization. From this viewpoint, it is possible to agree with this idea. However, as far as the activities of our Cabinet are concerned, we strive to respect the above principle strictly--that is, we would not like privatization to be an arena of political influence by individual parties, to be carried out so that supporters of one or the other party gain some unfair advantages. This will have a very negative impact. If privatization is being linked to policy, it should be only economic policy. This is our aim. This means that privatization should support the Cabinet's economic policy. The measure we adopted today is aimed at this--we proposed releasing 3.5 billion korunas of the money we gained or are going to gain through privatization of national property. We want to release this money to give an impetus to the development of our economy. [Bartisek] However, your reaction to the call for the abolition of the Ministry for Privatization was positive. [Moravcik] At present, there are still reasons for the existence of the ministry, given the current concept of privatization as outlined in the Privatization Act. If we change this concept, which is defined by the current norms, we might even imagine abolishing the Ministry for Privatization. It is, of course, possible to discuss this issue. However, the implementation of this idea before the elections can be excluded. [passage omitted]
