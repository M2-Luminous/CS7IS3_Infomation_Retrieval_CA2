FBIS4-66987 "jptdd019__l94049" JPRS-TDD-94-019-L JPRS Narcotics 3 May 1994 EAST ASIA INDONESIA Minister Expresses Concern Over Drug Trafficking Situation Minister Expresses Concern Over Drug Trafficking Situation 94WD0308A Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA in Indonesian 1 Mar p 16 94WD0308A Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA Indonesian CSO [Text] Coordinating Minister for Police and Security Soesilo Soedarman said that the State Intelligence Coordinating Board (BAKIN) must take a more serious view of the dangers posed by narcotics because Indonesia is no longer just a transit point for the international drug trade but it has become a target for drug dealers. For that reason BAKIN must reexamine the organization, authority, tasks and procedures of the Executive Coordinating Board (BAKOLAK) set up by Presidential Instruction Number 6 of 1971 concerning narcotics, controlled substances and alcoholic beverages, he added. "This is important because things are developing so rapidly and some of its regulations are no longer relevant," Soesilo said yesterday after delivering a report to president Suharto at his residence on Cendana Street. "Regulations which were a product of 1971 conditions can no longer keep up with the present speed of changing conditions." He said that PJPT II [Stage II Long-Term Development] plans to pay close attention to the creation of Indonesians who are reliable both physically and spiritually so that the country can compete with more advanced nations. "But we have been concerned recently because trafficking in alcoholic beverages and controlled substances has upset our efforts to build up dependable human resources, both physically and spiritually, who are skilled, broad-minded and intelligent," he said. Indications are that Indonesia has changed from a mere transit point to a target country, said Soesilo, and there is a lot of evidence that drugs are being introduced and are ready to be marketed in Indonesia. "Just look at the case of the 12 kg of heroin uncovered in Medan; was it going to be distributed there or was it in transit?," he asked. In addition, there have been several similar cases of large amounts of drugs smuggled into Indonesia as their final destination. "Previously, Indonesia was only a transit point; we didn't like that and we like it even less when Indonesia is the target zone, so the only option is to work even harder." Asked whether there was any political intent behind targeting young people, Soesilo said, "It's not that simple; the world is undergoing large-scale changes in direction and this affects everything, including the narcotics problem, and this is what makes us nervous," he said. The Coordinating Minister for Police and Security is not willing to allow Indonesia to become a paradise for drug trafficking because the sentences handed out are too lenient. "When I was PANGKOWILHAN I [Commander of Defense Region Command I] in Medan, I once carried out an operation. We worked so hard to capture somebody and then the sentence was insufficient. We have to straighten this problem out," he said.
