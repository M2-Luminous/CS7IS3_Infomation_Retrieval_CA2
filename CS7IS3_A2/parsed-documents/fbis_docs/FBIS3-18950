This impact will, however, be minor: Our exports of manufactured products will increase by 1.15 percent and our imports by 0.34 percent, according to a study published on Monday, 7 March by the Ministry of Industry, Postal Services, Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade. The study was carried out by BIPE [Office for Economic Information and Forecasts] on behalf of the government. BIPE estimates that average customs duties affecting exported industrial products will drop from 4.6 percent -- the level they were at before the agreement -- to 3.2 percent when the agreement enters into force, i.e., within a maximum period of 10 years. It is because industrial customs duties were already so low that these products were not the focal point of the Uruguay Round negotiations, unlike agricultural products, textile products, services, and intellectual property issues. This also explains the fact that, generally speaking, the impact of the anticipated drop in customs duties (30 percent) on exports and imports of manufactured products will not very large. The study shows that the impact is unequal in different sectors. For exports by French industry, it is obviously the most highly taxed products which benefit from the greatest effects of the planned drop: leather, shoes, clothing, textiles, professional electrical equipment, followed by mechanical engineering, and -- lastly -- parachemicals, pharmaceuticals, printing, and publishing. On the other hand, products from the aeronautics and shipbuilding sectors, as well as the nonferrous metals, paper and cardboard, wood, and furniture sectors will not benefit as much from the Uruguay Round agreement. Minor Impact on the Economy For imports, average customs duties will drop from the current 1.1 percent to 0.8 percent. Sectors which will see imports rise most will be leather, shoes, textiles, clothing, professional electrical equipment, and household equipment. Steel-making, aeronautics, shipbuilding, glass, and construction materials will scarcely be affected. All in all, the positive impact of the GATT agreement will be stronger on exports than on imports, and will therefore favor French industry. This can be explained by France's lower level of taxation compared to other countries -- primarily, of course, developing countries. The impact on the economy will only amount to 0.2 percent of overall production within the next 10 years -- a very modest impact indeed. However, the study stresses that a failure in the Uruguay Round would have certainly had a negative impact on world economic growth. Sixteen thousand jobs will be created (up 0.1 percent for the trading sector), more than half of which will be in industry: 3,000 in the manufacture of professional electrical equipment; 1,700 in mechanical engineering; 1,400 in foundries; and 900 in parachemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and clothing.
