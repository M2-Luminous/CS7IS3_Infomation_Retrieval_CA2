A plenary session began this morning to deal with the program and the State General Budget. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Honorable deputy, do you agree with the 1994 program? [Norberto de Castro, deputy for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] I would like to say that it is evident that the government has made an effort to draw itself closer to a reality from which it had distanced itself. Nevertheless, it is an effort that leaves something to be desired. We believe that the program and the State General Budget have many weaknesses. Let us see if the majority comes to its senses during this plenary session and heeds the call of the minority and rectifies what we think is wrong. [Correspondent] Are you confident the program will be adopted? [Paixao Junior, vice governor of National Bank of Angola] Absolutely. I believe the program contains everything to warrant its approval. [Miguel N'zau Puna, deputy for the Angolan Democratic Forum] As I see it, there are good prospects for the program to be adopted because we are in a minority. So, I think the budget will be approved. [end recording] The plenary session only began at 1100 because yesterday's rain disrupted the communications system. Before the debates could take place, the opposition members of parliament wanted the government to present a report on the country's economic situation in 1993. [Begin Castro recording] Mr. President, if you allow me, I would like to show you a resolution that effectively says there should be a report giving an account of the performance of the State General Budget for the third quarter of 1993, as well as the government's program of action for 1994. Mr. President, regardless of whatever explanations that one can give, we have an illegality on our hands. Either the majority complies with what has been agreed or we will act in disregard of the assembly regulations. I have the document right here and if you so wish you can have it. [end recording] Prime Minister Marcolino Moco was then forced to brief the opposition members of parliament. His explanations fell short of the deputies' expectations. Other deputies addressed the session, but the opposition appeared to be aloof when the agenda came up for voting. The opposition members of parliament did not take part in the voting. As the situation began to look complicated, Marcolino Moco delivered his speech in which he characterized 1993 as a catastrophic year for Angola's economic, social, and political life. He said the war was the main cause of the situation. [Begin Moco recording] It has not been easy to monitor the ongoing political transition, not only because it is no easy task, but also because the war has created even more dramatic situations that should be taken into account when we decide on what course of action to follow. The ongoing political transition has affected the social behavior of our fellow countrymen who have grown tired, and in many instances despondent. The government is committed to a prosperous nation, and a democratic and fair society. That, however, should also be the duty and goal of every citizen. To move decisively toward that goal, citizens ought to regain self-confidence, and to trust their own country. Unless we believe in the future and move together in building this new country, it will not be possible to fully overcome the current situation, and be sure that we will strengthen our position. Mr. President and honorable deputies, there is an unanimous belief that inflation is the main cause of the prevailing economic crisis. Under the circumstances, the honorable deputies should rest assured that we will prevent hyperinflation from taking root in the country, even if we have to introduce the most drastic measures. The most cruel consequences of hyperinflation are felt by the most impoverished and hard-pressed layers of society. We are committed to that goal because we believe the fight against inflation is more than an economic goal, but rather an imperative and a social responsibility that ensures stability in our country. Your excellencies, it has never been possible anywhere in the world to overcome a situation like ours without the sacrifices of all. [end recording] The plenary session has adjourned until 1500.
