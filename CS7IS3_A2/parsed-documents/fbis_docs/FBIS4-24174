Journalists of the BBC, ABC, Finland, LIBERATION newspaper of France, and Radio Muhabura attended the press conference. The focal point of the press conference was the presence of the French troops in Rwanda. Asked how the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] views the French troops' presence in the country, Col. Frank Mugambage said that if the French troops came for a purely humanitarian mission, then the RPF has no quarrel with the French. But if they came with a hidden agenda of involvement in the war, then RPF is ready to defend itself. Col. Frank Mugambage explained that the RPF cannot stop bring suspicious about the French troops' presence, because the French Government has always used the pretext of humanitarian missions to intervene in the Rwandan conflict while they have other hidden interests. Col. Frank Mugambage also said that the French troops know very well that their government armed and trained Rwandan Government forces and militias, and therefore the French Government is responsible for the genocide and massacres committed in the country. Asked what the RPF thinks about the French troops coming to Rwanda through Gisenyi and Cyangugu, an area controlled by Government forces, the RPA chief political commissar said that what is important is to know the actual reason for the French troops' presence. Responding to a question on the Arusha peace agreement, Col. Frank Mugambage said that the Arusha peace agreement is not yet nullified and once the war is over, RPF is ready to respect the implementation of the agreement.
