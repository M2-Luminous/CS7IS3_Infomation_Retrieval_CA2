FR940617-1-00016 FR940617-1-00006 2. A010.1.0 and A200.1.3 are revised to add mandatory address placement standards for other-than-single-piece rate flat-size mail prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper, or otherwise not prepared in an envelope, polybag, or similar enclosure. The types of mail affected by this standard are relatively difficult and costly to process and sort; the second type has the added potential to come apart in the mail, resulting in its failure to reach the addressee. None of these circumstances benefits the mailer, the Postal Service, or the addressee. The proposed change will further Postal Service efforts to provide efficient and timely service. The first of these mandatory placement standards affects flat-size mailpieces not prepared in a full enclosure and that may have an open edge presented either forward (as the piece travels through mechanization) or to the right (as the piece is held for manual sortation, casing, or delivery). The proposed revisions would require that such mail be addressed so that, when oriented to read the address, the mailpiece is positioned for more efficient processing, i.e., with its bound or final-folded edge to the right, and that pieces in partial wrappers or sleeves would have to have the open ends at the top and bottom of the mailpiece. The Postal Service, which has traditionally recommended that such mail be addressed in the manner described in the proposed rule (see existing Exhibit A200.1.3), has received only limited cooperation from mailers and, consequently, has been unable to improve the efficiency with which that mail can be handled. Some mailers (and some postal employees) have said that they were uncertain about whether the proposed placement was previously required. In proposing this standard, the Postal Service seeks to balance the needs of the mailing community with its own operational need to curtail undesirable addressing practices that raise postal costs. Further, the Postal Service realizes that, if adopted as a final rule, the operational effect of this proposal on some mailers would require considerable lead time before actual implementation. Therefore, commenters who are concerned about the effect this proposal would have on their operations are asked to provide specific information and suggestions: • How could the problems associated with handling the affected mail be overcome by measures other than the proposed rule as written? • What are commenters prepared to do to make that mail more efficient to handle? • If the proposed rule is adopted, how much lead time would be needed to make the necessary internal operational changes? • Would a short-term general implementation date be acceptable if the Postal Service worked with individual customers and allowed specific exceptions for delayed implementation? The second mandatory address placement standard requires that flat-size mailpieces prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper must bear a delivery address on the item being mailed itself, by addressing just the item (provided that the address remains visible when the item is mailed), by addressing both the item and the wrapper, or by using an address label to firmly attach the item and its wrapper. (Flat-size pieces would also have to meet the standard proposed above.) The Postal Service has no preference for the method chosen, instead focusing on the objective: Ensuring that separation of the item and its wrapper do not result in the item becoming undeliverable. Some customers have complained that existing addressing methods sometimes cause them not to get this type of mail or to receive only the wrapper, pointing out that the Postal Service's tolerance of the underlying addressing practice is contrary to the best interests of the addressee. Recognizing the validity of these complaints, the Postal Service proposes to require those mailers who generate flat-size mailpieces prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper to move to an addressing method that corrects the problem just described. Commenters who object to this proposal are asked to provide constructive responses to the same questions asked for in the proposed revision discussed above. For consistency, A200.1.3 would be revised to incorporate a reference to the foregoing sections. Other organizational changes are proposed to A010.1.0 that do not affect the substance of the standards.
