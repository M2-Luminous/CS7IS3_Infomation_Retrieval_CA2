FR941205-0-00169 FR941205-0-00029 Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The program will provide a new system of federal credit enhancements to expand the Nation's supply of affordable housing. Qualified State and local housing finance agencies will participate in the program on a voluntary basis. Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the provisions of this rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being, except to the extent that the program authorized by the rule will increase the supply of affordable housing, thereby improving the ability of families to find decent and affordable housing. Any such impact is beneficial and merits no further review under the Order. Executive Order 12611, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12611, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. The Department has specifically provided in this rule that its regulation on preemption of State or local rent control laws does not apply to this program. Any preemption of those laws for purposes of the housing provided under the program will be done under authority granted the HFAs by State or local law. All authority delegated to HFAs by HUD under this program was done so because the Department believes that is the intent of Congress under section 542(c).
