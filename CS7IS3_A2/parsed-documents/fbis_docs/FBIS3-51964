Today, the Hope, Peace, and Liberty Movement said it will not withdraw from the Uraba political pact. The movement's topmost leader, Senator Anibal Palacios, however, has said that FARC's Bolivarian Militias are the ones that massacred 35 people in La Chinita, Apartado, neighborhood. This is Palacios' reaction to a letter FARC addressed to Antioquia Governor Juan Gomez Martinez denying FARC participation in the massacre. [Begin Gomez Martinez recording] We did not say that Patriotic Unity is responsible, but rather that the Guerrilla Coordinating Board and the Bolivarian Militias had a hand in the La Chinita massacre. [end recording] This afternoon, the movement leaders met with Government Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez, whom they have asked to be an international observer for Uraba.
