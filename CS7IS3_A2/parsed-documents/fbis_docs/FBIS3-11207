[Cardenas] The Zapatist National Liberation Army made people aware of the predatory system of unfairness and discrimination that the indigenous communities have endured for centuries. It also revealed that, from the socioeconomic viewpoint, the neoliberal and technocratic schemes were unfeasible, as well as the unpostponable need to end the current state party role played by the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], which has been corrupt, antipatriotic, and arbitrary. The uprising revealed the existence of an obsolete and anachronistic regime. It also showed an unpopular and isolated president (Salinas de Gortari) who is aware of his illegitimate origin, who went from a state of inaction to a state of meaningless and useless action. The uprising awoke Mexican awareness. It is an extremely painful experience due to the people who died, the wounds it caused to the country's society, the abuses committed. The executions, the common graves, the cases of torture could have and should have been avoided by the government by means of political leadership aware of its current and future military and human duties. [Lameirinhas] Did the demonstrations in Mexico City demanding equal electoral and political opportunities by any means spark the Chiapas uprising? [Cardenas] The Chiapas uprising took place within a context in which civilian society had been demanding, for the past five years, a transition toward democracy and political reform. We have asserted that the lack of political reforms and reliable elections under Salinas' regime is unsustainable. These demands, repeatedly made by the Mexican Armed Forces, are what had been heard since the 1 January uprising. [Lameirinhas] What is your party's stance regarding the uprising? [Cardenas] We want a peaceful, rewarding, and fair solution for Chiapas, that is, a deep-rooted reform. We understand the reasons that drove the indigenous communities to despair. They were trapped by a deaf, blind, and despotic regime. Moreover, we have effectively participated in the peaceful rebellion of civilian society, which reasserted its choice for peace and democracy and, at the same time, saved lives and avoided bigger problems by getting the government to call a cease-fire and start peace negotiations in the Chiapas region. The solutions to the Chiapas problem have a national and foreign component. It would be a mistake and risky to separate one from the other. The local solution demands structural changes strongly linked to the state and the region. This is not possible without affecting unjust and illegitimate interests that have existed for years. The communities must recover their rights and assets. An exhaustive land reform is necessary, and the power structure of the "bosses" must be changed so the people can have the possibility of electing their own authorities. Moreover, the great deficiencies in education, health, housing, and highway services must be solved. Job opportunities and greater equity in the trading of local products must be granted. The privileges of large landowners must be eliminated. We favor contributing to all forms of mobilization of the indigenous groups and society in order to eliminate racism and the depredation of natural resources. [Lameirinhas] What does your party think about NAFTA? [Cardenas] I want to make it clear that the PRD is not against Mexico engaging in competition with the world market and its participation in NAFTA. But it should be pointed out that we need to assess the great impact this opening will have on the agricultural sector and other productive sectors, especially the micro, small, and medium enterprises that were not included in the negotiations. We now must work on adapting to the new terms of competition. [Lameirinhas] The latest polls show you as the second most popular candidate. Are these figures reliable? [Cardenas] Polls in Mexico have never been very reliable and, in the past, have been subject to manipulation. We also have seen that people automatically answer that they will vote for the official party in order to protect themselves from possible retaliation by a repressive and authoritarian political regime. [Lameirinhas] Are there any chances of fraud in the August elections? [Cardenas] In order to guarantee the authenticity of the elections, Congress must amend the 1990, '92, and '93 constitutional amendments that greatly distort the people's choices. The PRD submitted a report on the 1994 electoral process to the Federal Elections Institute General Council. The report refers to the illegal aspects of the process based on: first, discretionary control exercised by the government and the PRI on the electoral organizations; second, control over the right to vote through the partial manipulation of the voters lists and registration of voters; third, unfair distribution and discriminating control over resources supplied by the government to the political parties; fourth, unfair access by opposition parties and the PRI to the mass media, especially television; and fifth, supervision of the electoral process, during all its phases, by PRI and government authorities.
