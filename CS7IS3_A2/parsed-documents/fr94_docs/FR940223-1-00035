The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class D airspace as an extension to the Class C airspace at El Toro MCAS, El Toro, CA. During the Reclassification of Airspace effective September 16, 1993 a portion of the Class D extension was inadvertently published as being from the surface to 4400 feet MSL. This proposed amendment would return the airspace to a floor of 2500 feet MSL and a ceiling of 4400 feet. The coordinates for this airspace are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designated as an extension to a Class C surface area is published in paragraph 5000b of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace listed in the document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
