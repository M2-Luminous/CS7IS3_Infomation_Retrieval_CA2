FR940428-0-00004 FR940428-0-00002 The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the order and approximately 260 producers of spearmint oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 160 producers hold ``Class 1'' (Scotch) oil allotment base, and 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native) oil allotment base. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil may be classified as small entities. The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more than one commodity and whose income from farming operations is not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon (part of the area covered by the order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area covered by the order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil. This rule increases the salable quantity and allotment percentage of Native spearmint oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year, which ends on May 31, 1994. This rule increases the salable quantity from 714,665 pounds to 772,611 pounds and the allotment percentage from 37 percent to 40 percent for Native spearmint oil. The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil which handlers may purchase from, or handle on behalf of, producers during a marketing year. Each producer is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment percentage to the producer's allotment base for the applicable class of spearmint oil. The initial salable quantities and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 15, 1992, meeting. The Committee recommended salable quantities of 714,665 pounds and 716,164 pounds for Native and Scotch oils, respectively, and allotment percentages of 37 percent and 41 percent for Native and Scotch oils, respectively. A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's October 15, 1992, recommendation was published in the December 7, 1992, issue of the Federal Register [57 FR 57695]. Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 6, 1993. No comments were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year was published in the May 13, 1993, issue of the Federal Register [58 FR 28340]. Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the order, at its February 23, 1994, meeting in Pasco, Washington, the Committee recommended that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year be increased. The Committee vote resulted in seven members in favor and one member opposed to the recommendation. The member voting in opposition believes current demand for Native spearmint oil is not adequate enough to warrant an increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage. The Committee's recommendation to increase the allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil by three percent results in a 57,946 pound increase in the salable quantity, from 714,665 to 772,611 pounds. Growers currently hold in reserve 1,436,020 pounds of Native oil and 948,063 pounds of Scotch oil. However, the Committee states that not all producers have reserve oil available to fill their increase in the salable quantity. In those cases, no additional oil is made available to the market. Therefore, this rule provides an actual increase of 55,553 pounds of additional base rather than the calculated amount. This small difference between the calculated and actual amounts of released oil will not have a significant impact on the availability of marketable oil. The Committee, in reaching its decision to recommend an increase in the 1993&hyph;94 salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil, took into consideration the current supply and anticipated demand for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils. The available supply of Native and Scotch spearmint oil as of February 23, 1994, is 59,599 pounds and 175,000 pounds, respectively. When considering its initial recommendation for the 1993&hyph;94 season, the Committee estimated that the recommended salable quantity and allotment percentage would result in an approximate carryover of 90,000 pounds of Native oil. This places the current available supply of Native oil below the expected carryover.
