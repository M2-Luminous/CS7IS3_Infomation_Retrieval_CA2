Sir, what can we expect in Mexican economic matters following the events of the last few hours? [Aspe] Well, as we all know, following these unfortunate incidents, in which our friend Luis Donaldo Colosio was killed, the financial sector today joined the call made by the president of the Republic and did not operate today because of the national mourning. International markets, where transactions are constantly taking place, such as public debt transactions and the issuance of stocks at the New York Stock Exchange, were somewhat nervous at the beginning. There was a certain decrease in the amount of transactions. Throughout the day we saw a return to stability, and it was a pleasant surprise. This means that markets are much more mature. Banks and the Mexican Stock Exchange and so on will return to normal operations tomorrow. They will open their operations as any other day. The important thing to note is the enormous stability that is being observed despite the tragic events. We have bigger, more stable, and more mature markets. [Fortuno] Sir, the reaction by the United States, especially by President Bill Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentzen, was to give complete support to Mexico. Could you explain this support? [Aspe] Certainly. As you have seen, today the president of the United States, after talking to the president of Mexico, issued a series of very favorable statements for Mexican institutions. As you know, Secretary Bentsen issued two statements. The first one conveyed his strong support for the implementation of President Salinas' economic policy. His second statement was an unexpected one. We have a mutual support agreement between the U.S. Treasury and the Mexican Finance Secretariat, and one between the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and the Mexican Central Bank. For many years these mutual support agreements had been maintained in the range of $1 billion. In an unexpected action and following many talks and negotiations that we were finally able to speed up today, we agreed on increasing this credit line from $1 to $6 billion. In other words, there was a one-time 600-percent increase. Why is this important? What is truly important is that we have a good economic policy -- one without deficits -- a prudent monetary policy, and an autonomous Central Bank that will begin operating next 1 April. But in addition to this, it is important that we have sufficient international reserves, which fortunately we do. What we have today has been built up for many years. It is the result of the efforts of farmers and businessmen, as well as the government. We have large reserves. However, this mutual support agreement means that in addition to that level of reserves, we have an additional $6 billion to make the markets operate in an orderly manner by avoiding any volatile movements and to support the stabilization of the exchange markets, and needless to say, the economy as a whole. I had the chance to talk with Secretary Bentsen yesterday and today, and this decision is truly flattering because it entails great trust and the idea that we are commercial partners with long-term plans. Also, in short-term troublesome times, it is mechanisms such as these that help us move closer to stability. However, we should not forget that true stability is achieved at home. We have been working on this stability, and this is why we will not have a fiscal deficit in 1994 because President Salinas is committed to turning over an economy with very low inflation, comparable to the international inflation level, an economy that is growing and recovering, and one that has reserves, order, vision, and direction. [Fortuno] This is very clear, Mr. Secretary. Many thanks. We are very grateful. [Aspe] Thank you. [end recording]
