[passage omitted] [Video shows correspondent and the government session] The Herceg-Bosna Government arrived in Vitez today and held its first session here. This is the first time that leaders of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna have come to Croatian central Bosnia. At the beginning of the session, Vice Prime Minister Ante Valeta, who lives in Vitez, gave a report on the work of all bodies in central Bosnia over the past few months. The conclusion was that the political and military leaders of the Croat nation of central Bosnia had organized an effective defense of their areas. Defense Minister Vlado Soljic stressed: [Soljic] It is enough to say that we have realized the main goals if we have the Croatian state as a guarantee for the freedom and rights of all Croats, and if we have sovereign rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Sagolj] Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic stressed, among other things, that all the system's institutions must be further strengthened. In connection with that, the government today established its tasks. [Prlic] The war has not stopped. The war is not over. In that respect, we must remain vigilant. [Sagolj] Minister Mile Akmadzic informed the leaders of central Bosnia about the Vienna and Washington Agreements. It was particularly stressed at the session that now was the time to draw up reconstruction plans, but, of course, without neglecting the strengthening of the defense system. [passage omitted]
