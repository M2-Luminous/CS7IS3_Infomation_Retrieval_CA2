For him, the commitments made by Rwandan officials have not been respected. Here is his declaration: [Begin Booh-Booh recording] This meeting gives us an opportunity to make clarifications on the mandate and the responsibilities of UNAMIR in the context of the difficulties faced by Rwandan political officials in the setting up of transitional institutions as stipulated in the Arusha peace agreement. [passage omitted] The setting up of the transitional institutions had been planned for 37 days after the signing of the Arusha agreement. No one can say that time was short nor that, unfortunately, transitional institutions have been established. One can only note that commitments made by Rwandan officials to the international community have not been respected. Once again, I say that UNAMIR did everything which had to be done. We held many meetings with the country's main political leaders. The delay in the setting up of the transitional institutions cannot be understood nor is it acceptable. The credibility of Rwandan officials in the eyes of the Rwandan people and the international community is now in question. How can one explain the reasons for the last minute obstacles when everything seemed ready on 29 December? How can one convince the United Nations, especially the Security Council, of the seriousness of the solemn commitments made by Rwandan officials? How can one explain to the Rwandan people about the delay which constitutes a grave threat to the future of the country? How can one explain to the international financial institutions and donor countries the absence of a responsible government in Rwanda that will work with them for the recovery of the country's economy? Finally, how can one explain to the thousands of Rwandans, who are impatient to return without fear to their homes, the meaning of the squabbles of some political leaders? UNAMIR remains, more than ever, ready to carry out its mandate. It is up to the signatories of the Arusha agreement of 4 August 1993, in conformity with Article 5, to meet expeditiously and do everything possible to implement one of the most important tenets of the agreement, that is the setting up of the transitional institutions. Thank you. [end recording]
