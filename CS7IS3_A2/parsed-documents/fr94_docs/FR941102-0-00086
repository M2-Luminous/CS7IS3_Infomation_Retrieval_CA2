FR941102-0-00086 FR941102-0-00023 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 638 [Docket No. 940677&hyph;4177; I.D. 090994D] Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS closes the fishery for live rock in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 1994 harvest quota. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 1, 1994, through December 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Georgia Cranmore, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Coral and coral reefs in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states and in the Gulf of Mexico are managed under the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Under an emergency interim rule effective through September 26, 1994 (59 FR 32938, June 27, 1994), and extended through December 25, 1994 (59 FR 47563, September 16, 1994), NMFS established a 1994 harvest quota of 485,000 lb (219,992 kg) for live rock in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states. Section 638.28(d) of that emergency interim rule requires the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), to close the live rock fishery in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states when the 1994 harvest quota is reached, or is projected to be reached. The AA has determined that the quota will be reached on October 31, 1994. Accordingly, the live rock fishery in the South Atlantic EEZ is closed effective 12:01 a.m., local time, November 1, 1994, through December 25, 1994, the end of the period of effectiveness of the emergency interim rule. During the closure, live rock may not be harvested or possessed in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, and the purchase, barter, trade, and sale of live rock in or from the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states is prohibited. The latter prohibition does not apply to live rock that was harvested prior to November 1, 1994. Classification This action is required by 50 CFR 638.28(d) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 27, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
