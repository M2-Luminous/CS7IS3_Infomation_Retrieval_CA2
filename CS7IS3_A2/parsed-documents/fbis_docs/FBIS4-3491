FBIS4-3491 "drchi077_v_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Leaders Criticize PRC Leaders Criticize PRC OW2004132594 Taipei CNA in English 1255 GMT 20 Apr 94 OW2004132594 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Bear Li] [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- Eight to ten people, including several soldiers, were involved in the murders of 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainlanders at Lake Qiandao, Director-General Yin Tsung-wen of the National Security Bureau was quoted as saying Wednesday [20 April]. At a closed-door Legislative Yuan session, Yin said Beijing was still trying to cover up the incident, Legislators Ting Shou-chung and Chen Shui-pien said after the meeting. Beijing originally claimed the tourists were killed in an accident, but on Sunday admitted that it had arrested three suspects in what it said was a "heinous robbery, arson and murder case," although it fell short of details. "The three detained by Beijing are just scapegoats," Yin was quoted by ting and shen as saying. "There are others connected with the incident who are not ordinary citizens." Yin said his bureau from the start believed the victims were robbed and murdered, based on information gathered by informants in Mainland China. He said the informants reported that mainland President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin had set a two-week deadline for mainland police to complete an inquiry into the incident. The report was confirmed by the WEN WEI PAO, a Beijing-supported newspaper in Hong Kong, on Tuesday. Yin said his bureau will publish the information it has obtained before Beijing begins its trial of the three suspects as a way of pressing Beijing to be more forthcoming. The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Mainland China's intermediary body with Taiwan, in a letter to its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Wednesday reconfirmed the detention of the three. ARATS said the three had been planning a tour-boat robbery on the lake since last year. It said the robbers used explosives, hunting rifles, and gasoline in their attack on the boat, using jetskis to make their getaway. Belongings of the victims, including money, watches, and cameras, were later found at the homes of relatives of the three robbers, ARATS said. Meanwhile, in related news, President Li Teng-hui, while receiving SEF President Ku Chen-fu on Wednesday morning, said that Beijing "is moving in the right direction on the case."
