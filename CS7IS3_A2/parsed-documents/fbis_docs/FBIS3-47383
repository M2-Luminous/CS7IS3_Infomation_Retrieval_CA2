Wim Deetman, the head of the Dutch delegation, told reporters after a meeting with the president that the discussions on the implementation of human rights in the country were based on the principle that Indonesia and the Netherlands are sovereign and independent states. "Yes", Deetman said when asked whether the two countries had different views on the implementation of human rights. Commenting on Indonesia's decision to reject Dutch aid in 1992 after the Netherlands' announced suspension of assistance to Indonesia in protest of November 12, 1991 incident in Dili, capital of East Timor, he said, "That's the fact." The Indonesian Government has since then refused Dutch aid on the grounds that The Hague had intervened in the country's internal affairs. Indonesia considered a Dutch-sponsored financial consortium a tool to intimidate Indonesia on human rights questions. Meanwhile, House Speaker Wahono told reporters after accompanying the Dutch legislators during the meeting with the president that the Netherlands remained to respect Indonesia as a sovereign and independent state despite the different views on the implementation of human rights. They (Dutch legislators) are aware that the implementation of human rights depends on a number of things, such as the history and background of the nation," he said. The head of state and Dutch legislators also discussed a possibility of using Rotterdam to serve as a gateway for Indonesian export commodities to Europe.
