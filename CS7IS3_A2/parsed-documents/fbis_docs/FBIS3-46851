Khan] [Text] President Ramos yesterday moved to streamline the bureaucracy by transferring 15 agencies and corporations under government departments. Following the cabinet workshop last Tuesday, the president issued Executive Order No. 149, calling for the transfer of regular agencies to mother departments for "better policy and program coordination and integration and administrative supervision." Moreover, he directed the affected agencies to prepare within two months a Function, Rationalization and Integration Program (FRlP) which will be assessed by the budget and management secretary, who will in turn make a full report and recommendation to the president. Moreover, Mr. Ramos said that the FRIP should include the streamlining and rationalization of the agency's functions, programs, and activities; the policy integration and rationalization plan for the departments affected by the transfer, and, the significant refocusing, abolition, scaling down or phasing out of functions, programs and activities, and the corresponding shifts in structure and resource allocation. The following agencies have been affected: -- the National Statistical Coordination Board, to the National Economic and Development Authority [NEDA]; -- the Commission on Filipino Language, to the Department of Education, Culture and Sports; -- the Philippine Center Management Board, to the Department of Foreign Affairs; -- the National Statistics Office to NEDA; and, -- the Statistical Research and Training Center to NEDA. Government-owned and controlled corporations transferred to government departments include: -- the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation, to the Department of Finance; -- the Laguna Lake Development Authority, to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources; and, -- the Philippine Center for Economic Development, to the University of the Philippines System. On another note, the chief executive likewise ordered the transfer of six agencies set to be abolished to departments for the time being. These are: -- the Economic Support Fund Secretariat, to the Department of Public Works and Highways; -- the Board of Liquidators, to the National Development Corporation; -- the Development Coordinating Council for Leyte and Samar and the Kalinga Special Development Authority, to the Department of National Defense; -- the Sequestered Assets Disposition Authority, to the Presidential Commission on Good Government; -- the Philippine Human Resources Development Center, to the Presidential Management Staff; and, -- the Philippine Gamefowl Commission, to the Games and Amusements Board.
