By continuing to twist the facts, the only thing they are demonstrating is that they want to continue to lie and defame." Silvio Berlusconi personally is entering the field in the tax battle: "The first point in our program is dedicated to the poor. They will be exempt from paying income tax." [Luciano] But Budget Minister Spaventa says you would make the Treasury go "broke".... [Berlusconi] [Forza Italia economic expert] Antonio Martino will give Spaventa a detailed response tomorrow and counter his thesis. Moreover, our program is very clear in this respect. [Luciano] Many say that it is summed up in the slogan "less taxes." [Berlusconi] Far from this. This statement could not be farther from the truth, given the fact that we are developing a 45-point program and supplying a series of concrete responses to the various problems. No party has presented such a precise, articulated, and detailed program during an election campaign. [Luciano] Do you really envisage safeguarding only high incomes? [Berlusconi] First, we propose eliminating income taxes for poor families. Then, there is the introduction of deductions for each dependent. The third and fundamental point, is to reduce VAT [value-added tax] to 2 percent and reduce the number of taxes to 10 or a maximum of 20, compared to the current 200. [Luciano] Will the Treasury lose resources? [Berlusconi] According to our calculations, these modifications to the current system will introduce more justice without drawing from the revenues of the Treasury. [Luciano] But the progressives are also saying that public spending cannot be reduced. [Berlusconi] They forget that for years they accused the government in office of having wasted public money. If it was really impossible to spend money better, the progressives would fall into a clear contradiction. [Luciano] You must admit, however, that the 18 million lire a year for four people is a little.... [Berlusconi] This was how Martino answered those asking him what he considered to be the minimum subsistence level for a family of four in Rome today. It is certainly not the objective identified in our government program which is complex and systematic and cannot be read only in some points and ignored in others. [Luciano] The impression that remains is this: less taxes and no sacrifices. [Berlusconi] This impression is entirely mistaken. The key point of our program is that of relaunching economic development by relaunching private enterprise and containing where possible public expenditure, which has exploded out of control over the past years and which has consequently deprived the economic system of the savings necessary for development. [Luciano] What are your basic proposals then? [Berlusconi] Doing all that is possible to take up the path toward development. The program contains a detailed account of many measures in this respect. For example, placing a limit on public spending by reducing the tendency to increase public spending by at least one point, in such a way as to bring the expenditure to 43 percent of GDP in the medium term as in 1980. This must be combined with a reform and a cultural revolution in the public administration to transform today's perfect bureaucratic and political machine that creates difficulties and bans into a support for those that work and produce. [Luciano] What role will you leave to the state? [Berlusconi] The state must go back to doing its job. Not the job of the private sector. When done by the private sector, everything that the state does costs half and is normally done better. For this reason and in order to work toward a reduction in public expenditure, we propose that the state return to fulfilling its fundamental duties, leaving to private initiative all that the private sector can produce in a system of competition: health, education, retirement benefits. But to protect myself from malevolent and unfounded criticism, I must say that the briefness of an interview does bad service to the completeness, organization, and precision of our program. I really hope that our critics will want to examine directly each of our proposals in the program before making any hasty judgements.
