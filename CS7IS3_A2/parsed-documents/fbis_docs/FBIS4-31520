"The warring sides were requested in an imperative way to agree to a four-month cessation of hostilities in order to reach a political solution in the meantime, but the Muslim side did not accept it." In addition, the warring sides were requested to negotiate without setting any conditions, but the Muslim side did not abide by that either, Buha said. "The Geneva document has been treated as the first step toward reaching an agreement on the cessation of hostilities, while negotiations to this end will begin in a few days," Buha said. "Another part of the agreement contains an obigation for the three sides to exchange POW's on the all-for-all principle in the meantime; that is, before the new round of negotiations."
