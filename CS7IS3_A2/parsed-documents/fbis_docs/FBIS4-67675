Requintina] [Text] Health Secretary Juan Flavier said yesterday that there are eight new cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS ), bringing to 483 the total number of AIDS cases in the Philippines this year. Flavier also said the Department of Health (DOH) has decided to temporarily withhold the distribution of information, education and communication materials earlier found "offensive" pending the release of guidelines. As of February this year, Flavier said the total number of fullblown AIDS cases was 127 while 77 persons have already died of the incurable disease. Of the new cases, four were females while the rest were males whose ages ranged from 31 to 33 years old. The health department estimated that 50,000 people harbor the HIV virus but are not aware of it. Less than 500 cases have been documented and 116 have resulted in deaths from full-blown AIDS. HIV infection in the Philippines is transmitted primarily through heterosexual and not homosexual contact. Flavier said that ReachOut [as published] material entitled "Lust for Life" which contained pictures of men in anal sex would not be released until members of the HIV-AIDS network have agreed on the guidelines next week. The material was also reported to have reached school children. Apparently, he said, the Filipinos are not yet ready for the kind of material which was funded by an American organization and aimed at homosexuals. Another non-government organization, Kabalikat [copartner], which printed comics on family planning was the subject of criticisms by the school and the church sectors. Flavier said that the comics contained the use of condoms with the penis in an erect position. "As a doctor, I don't find it offensive. But if it affects the sensibilities of some people, then we also have to discuss this matter," he said. Flavier stressed that the health department cannot censor the information materials because the DOH lacks specific guidelines.
