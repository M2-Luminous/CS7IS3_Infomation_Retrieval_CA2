At the present stage, considering today's regularities of world development, Azerbaijan, endeavoring to take its rightful place in the world community, is fully resolved to create a democratic society committed to the fundamental principles and values that have been expressed by human civilization at all stages of its development. The bases of the official policy of Azerbaijan are a love of peace, political pluralism, and the recognition and assurance of individual liberty and human rights. Enforceable enactments on political parties, freedom of religious belief, protection of the rights of national minorities, and such have been adopted and are functioning here. Azerbaijan builds its foreign policy on the basis of a profound recognition of the interdependence and interrelated nature of the world, proceeding from the common global purposes confronting all of us. We are firmly confident that the basis of security in the current period of challenges and threats is mutual respect for states' sovereignty and territorial integrity and the sanctity of their borders. Azerbaijan has embarked on the implementation of economic reforms to create a market economy open to the outside world, which will make it possible to realize the country's wealth of potential. We are to this end implementing measures to attract foreign investments in the economy and establish cooperation with the world's biggest companies. A process of legislative backing for the reforms is under way. Azerbaijan is today experiencing the profound crisis which has encompassed the entire territory of the former USSR and which is the result of the collapse of the Soviet system. Despite this, we are fully resolved to overcome the difficulties of the current stage and by way of the plan-oriented implementation of reforms to strive for the creation of a prosperous sovereign state. In September 1993 Azerbaijan became a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, considering this an essential factor of political and economic cooperation with all the countries formed following the disintegration of the USSR, and signed the Collective Security Treaty. My country's situation is made worse by the fact that it is being subjected to aggression on the part of neighboring Armenia, which has territorial claims on Azerbaijan. Armenia, as the aggressor-state, is using the ethnic group of Armenians living on the territory of Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region as an instrument of separatism for the annexation of our territory. Armenia is using its own territory and armed forces to wage war on the territory of Azerbaijan, and it can no longer conceal these facts. In the course of the aggression perpetrated against Azerbaijan the Republic of Armenia has occupied more than 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory. As a result of the ethnic purges carried out by the Armenian armed forces more than 20,000 persons have been killed and approximately 60,000 have been wounded or have become disabled, 4,000 have been taken prisoner or hostage, and approximately 1 million Azerbaijanis have become refugees in their own country. Under the threat of annihilation, absolutely all Azerbaijanis have been driven out of all the occupied territories. The forces of occupation are employing scorched-earth tactics. Approximately 90,000 residential structures, more than 1,000 economic facilities, 250 schools and educational institutions, and 250 medical establishments have been burned, looted, and destroyed. The damage caused Azerbaijan is put at billions of dollars. Armenian nationalism ignited the torch of war and set against each other two peoples bound by the will of history to live in peace and good-neighborliness. I am profoundly convinced that the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has no military solution. The continuation of the hostilities will bring both peoples incalculable misfortunes. It will prevent them getting back on their feet, establishing their independence, implementing economic reforms in full, and creating a democratic state. Azerbaijan has always adopted a constructive position on questions of a settlement of the conflict. The territorial integrity and sanctity of the borders of our state are for us a fundamental principle. We will strive for the liberation of all occupied Azerbaijani territory and the return of all refugees to their land, the 50,000 Karabakh Azerbaijanis included. We will simultaneously undertake to ensure the security and all civil rights of the Karabakh Armenians and to afford them the appropriate level of autonomy within the framework of the Azerbaijani state. On 12 April of this year I appealed to the citizens of Armenia and the inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh of Armenian nationality--citizens of Azerbaijan--to stop and cease hostilities. The Azerbaijani state guaranteed all inhabitants of the conflict zone involved in the hostilities personal safety and the possibility of living freely and in peace on their native land. We once again today confirm this fundamental position of ours. In the time of the military aggression against Azerbaijan, which has gone on for approximately six years now, many steps aimed at a peaceful settlement of the conflict, which, unfortunately, have yet to produce the desired results in view of the hard-line aggressive policy of the Republic of Armenia, have been taken. The fact of the occupation of Azerbaijani territory and the demand for the immediate, full, and unconditional withdrawal therefrom of the Armenian armed forces of occupation have been reflected in four resolutions of the UN Security Council--822, 853, 874, and 884. But on various pretexts Armenia is still refusing to comply with these resolutions. Armenia is by its behavior openly challenging the world community, sapping at root all attempts at a peaceful political solution of the conflict by refusing to recognize the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and to liberate occupied Azerbaijani territory. The Azerbaijani Republic once again declares its readiness to solve all questions by way of peaceful negotiations within the framework of the CSCE Minsk Group, on the basis of the UN Charter and the principles of the CSCE. The Azerbaijani Republic is, for its part, doing everything to support the actions of the Minsk Group and creating all possible conditions for it. But I would like to emphasize that each time that the Minsk Group assembles, the world witnesses a further escalation of hostilities on the part of Armenia and new seizures of Azerbaijani territory, as was the case at the time of the visit to the region of the current chairman of the CSCE in October 1993 or this April, when a meeting of the Minsk Group was held in Prague, and so forth. A delegation of the Minsk Group, which we rendered the utmost assistance, was in the region from 26 April through 2 May. If all the countries represented in the Minsk Group were to demonstrate the firm will to bring the bloody war to an end as quickly as possible and to embark on the restoration of peace, I am sure that success would be assured. Taking advantage, therefore, of my presence in NATO Headquarters in Brussels, I appeal to the North Atlantic alliance, of which all leading countries of the CSCE Minsk Group are members, for the adoption of the necessary effective measures to ensure peace and stability in our hemorrhaging region. The Azerbaijani Republic has profound respect for the North Atlantic alliance and values highly its activity which has in recent decades secured peace, stability, and progressive development in Europe. At the present time NATO, as an actually functioning structure of collective security in the world, provides for the defense of democratic values and their spread to the new independent states which have formed in East Europe and on the territory of the former USSR. We regard NATO as an organization which could help the young Azerbaijani state establish close multilateral relations with the Western world and become familiar with its wealth of experience. The strengthening of the independence of Azerbaijan, as, equally, of the other new European states also, would serve as practical confirmation of the permanency of the principles on which the entire activity of NATO is built. We are grateful to NATO for its expression of concern at the situation in the Transcaucasus and its confirmation of its respect for the territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty of the states of this region and, in particular, of Azerbaijan, which was expressed in the NATO Council declaration adopted in January 1994. The principles of NATO, on the basis of which its participants regulate their relations, settle all disputes arising among them by peaceful means, and develop their individual and collective possibilities for warding off aggression against one or several members of this organization, have proven their viability over many years now and could be the foundation of the building of a new system of European security in the postconfrontation period. The young Azerbaijani Republic, which has opted for the path of the building of an independent democratic state with a market economy, looks with great hope to the states that have scored big successes on this path and awaits help and assistance from them. For this reason we, like many other countries also, received with great enthusiasm NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. The North Atlantic alliance is in itself for us a reference point thanks to the security which, as NATO General Secretary Manfred Woerner said on 10 January of this year at the meeting of heads of state and government of NATO members, it guarantees its members because this is the organization which is functioning the most efficiently in the sphere of collective security. We, as a state that is in a state of war and subjected to aggression on the part of a neighboring country--Armenia, hope that participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program will enable us as quickly as possible to achieve a just peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, the liberation of the occupied Azerbaijani territory, and the elimination of all the consequences of the war. The high authority of NATO could be a telling factor in an end to this bloody war. We hope that the Azerbaijan Republic's affiliation to the Partnership for Peace program will afford us an opportunity to stimulate our participation in the creation of a dependable system of collective security in Europe. I believe that the democratic principles underlying the North Atlantic alliance will contribute to our successful cooperation, the practical removal of the obstacles that stand in the way of peace and stability in the Transcaucasus and other regions, and the progress and prosperity of all peoples.
