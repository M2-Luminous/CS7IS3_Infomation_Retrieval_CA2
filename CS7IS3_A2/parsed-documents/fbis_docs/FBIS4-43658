It matters who gets it. It matters what they think and how they all lead. But -- save for some prospective lathering by Norman Lamont and the Tory Right -- there is no discussion of the contenders and no hint of democracy in the process of selection. This time next week, after the Corfu summit, Europe will probably have a new Commission President, the heir to Jacques Delors. That ought to be important. Mr Delors is a deeply significant figure -- departing, with luck, to add a drama to the French presidential race. But though the disillusioned voters may choose the MEPs [members of European Parliament], if they can be bothered, they have no say over the Commission or its president. A stitch-up as usual, to baroque conventions. Delors was a Socialist from a big country: custom and practice demand that he is succeeded by a sort of conservative from a small country. Two men are first out of the frame: Ruud Lubbers, lately prime minister of the Netherlands, and Jean-Luc Dehaene, present prime minister of Belgium. A year ago, all the betting was on Lubbers, but he has fallen out with Chancellor Kohl, up whose capacious waistcoat most of the wheeling and dealing takes place. Kohl and soon departing Francois Mitterrand have thus settled for Dehaene, a capable, rather grey political operator. This can all be portrayed -- see those Tory latherings -- in terms of manic or less manic attachment to the European federal project. That's probably unfair to Dehaene, an expert on integration rather than a zealot. But it does not begin to address the fears and hopes of the people of Europe, as expressed seven days ago through the ballot box. Corfu will be horse-trading as usual. The British and the Greeks will back Sir Leon Brittan for a while; and so probably will the Italians, until gradually the offers of other jobs -- like the Secretary Generalship of Nato -- and sundry favours gradually dissolve the blocs. (Sir Leon is a heavyweight in line for the big foreign affairs portfolio next time; his trouble is that he's John Major's candidate.) So only if the council is irredeemably split between Lubbers and Dehaene will the ranks of the undeclared but available begin to be talked about. We hope that happens, because the best second choice may actually be the best first choice: Peter Sutherland from Ireland, whose mastery of the Gatt free trade ship steered it safely into port. Sutherland is more international civil servant than politician to be sure -- but he has the grasp and the personality to give the Commission an identity which explains and persuades rather than retreats behind closed doors. But how can a voter -- or a newspaper -- affect any of these developments? The bargaining will be secret and frenetic. No leader in Corfu will have a remotely democratic mandate. The old pie, with plums for the taking, is being cooked up as usual. And, shortly thereafter, we'll be treated to all the usual stuff about unelected Brussels bureaucrats. So be clear as the storm starts to break. The bureaucrats are unelected because that's the way national governments want it. Even the chief bureaucrat -- who is much more than that -- emerges in ways that would make the next Pope weep in shame. Jacques Delors, a testimony to his reign, has made the presidency too crucial to be carved around in this fashion any longer. If the European project is losing touch with the people of Europe, who on earth can wonder at that?
