Thus when the Seoul-Beijing route opens, which may take place as early as April, Europe-bound Korean Airlines cannot fly over China and Chinese carriers are not permitted to use Korean airspace for travel to the United States or Japan, the sources said. "We (Seoul and Beijing) did agree on having beyond-point traffic rights in principle, but we decided to apply the rights in the future when we find them necessary," a Seoul government official said. The two governments agreed not to initiate beyond-point traffic rights at present because when they do, the Seoul-Beijing route could become an international one as it may be opened to other airlines and they fear a loss of passengers, he said. They reached tentative agreement on opening a direct air route between the two capitals after a week of working-level talks in Beijing that started Jan. 17. The agreement is expected to be put into writing next month in the fifth bilateral aviation talks.
