A new round of bilateral talks was recently held after a lapse of more than a year. The talks failed, however, due to India's refusal to budge even an inch from its earlier position. Some U.S. Government spokesmen -- especially Joseph P. Hoar, commander-in-chief of the Central Command -- are giving the impression that the talks did not fail and that there has been considerable progress, but a review of the statements of Pakistani and Indian spokesmen would hardly convince a person to share U.S. optimism. The general impression is that the 2-3 January talks remained abortive. This means the black cloud of tension is still hovering over the Indian subcontinent. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali rightly told his hosts in Tashkent that the Indian subcontinent and South Asia are facing great danger. He is also correct in saying that if the Kashmir dispute is not settled in accordance with the principles of justice and the UN resolutions, then war might erupt again between the two countries. If this happens, God forbid, the war might become nuclear. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's statement could never be called an exaggeration. Observers of history and relations between the two countries know they have already fought three wars; Kashmir was the main dispute in all of them. Since the last war in 1971, the two countries have achieved nuclear capability. India openly carried out a nuclear explosion. Pakistan has not carried out such an explosion, but it acknowledges that it has the ability to make a nuclear weapon. It is true that Pakistan has not manufactured a nuclear weapon, nor does it intend to do so. But if war erupts and it finds out that its opponent has a nuclear weapon, then Pakistan might take any step to defend itself. We know that on more than one occasion the two countries have come to the brink of war because of Indian military exercises; in these cases some foreign circles saw a real danger of nuclear war. Given the situation, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's expression of apprehension about a nuclear war cannot be called an exaggeration or an unfounded product of imagination. There is a real risk of nuclear war that not only threatens peace in South Asia, but in the whole world. The only way to avoid such a danger is to strike at the root cause of tension between the two countries -- the well-known Kashmir dispute. The world powers, especially the United States, should put all their weight behind resolving the Kashmir issue if they want to save the Indian subcontinent from devastation and nuclear war. The danger signal given by Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali is not without its causes. He has informed the world in a timely manner of a possible danger; prudence dictates that serious efforts be made to deal with the situation before we miss the chance. It is not inappropriate to hope that the United Nations, the United States, the European countries, the Islamic Conference Organization, the PRC, and other Asian countries realize their responsibility in maintaining peace in this area and make wholehearted efforts to convince India to see reason. Pakistan has repeatedly conveyed its readiness to accept and implement any fair and reasonable proposal on Kashmir. Now it is up to India to realize its responsibilities and make sincere efforts to implement them. It will benefit the subcontinent and the two countries as well.
