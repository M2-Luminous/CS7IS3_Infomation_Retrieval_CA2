FR940603-1-00015 FR940603-1-00005 Background and Purpose On March 12, 1994, the sponsor, Boys Harbor, Inc., New York, NY requested that a fireworks display be permitted in the port of East Hampton in the vicinity of Sammy's Beach, East Hampton, NY from 8:45 p.m. through 10 p.m. on July 16, 1994. The safety zone covers all waters of Three Mile Harbor within a 1200 foot radius of the fireworks barges FBG 1 and FBG 2, which will be tied together and located one mile south of Sammy's Beach, East Hampton, NY. This zone is required to protect the maritime community from the dangers and potential hazards to navigation associated with this fireworks display which is occurring over Three Mile Harbor. Entry into or movement within this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port or his on scene representative. Good cause exists for providing a comment period of less than sixty days. Providing a sixty day comment period would be contrary to the public interest since the fireworks display is for public viewing and is scheduled to occur in conjunction with the Boys Harbor, Inc. summer fund-raiser to benefit disadvantaged boys from New York City. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be minimal due to the limited duration of the fireworks display, the small size of the safety zone, the low level or non existent commercial vessel traffic expected in the area during the effective time of the zone, and the broadcast of marine safety advisories the day of the event. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be made available in the docket.
