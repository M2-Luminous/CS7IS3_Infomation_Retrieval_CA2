The statistics show that at the end of March 1993, the net position was 54.3 billion New Zealand dollars (32.08 billion US dollars) in deficit, 8.1 billion dollars worse than the previous March and the fifth year of decline. This flowed from a decrease of 1.4 billion dollars to 31.7 billion dollars in overseas assets held by New Zealand investors and an increase of 6.7 billion dollars to 86 billion dollars in foreign-held assets in New Zealand. The 6.7 billion dollars increase in New Zealand's total international liabilities stemmed from rises in both foreign equity holdings in New Zealand companies and in borrowings overseas. Equity rose to 23.2 billion dollars at the end of March 1993 from 18.5 billion dollars a year earlier, mainly due to a 4.6 billion dollar increase in foreign direct investment involving 25 percent or more of the voting shares of a company. New Zealand investment abroad amounted to 21.7 billion dollars at March 31, 1993, compared with 24.8 billion dollars a year earlier. In contrast, foreign investment in New Zealand increased to 76 billion dollars from 71 billion dollars.
