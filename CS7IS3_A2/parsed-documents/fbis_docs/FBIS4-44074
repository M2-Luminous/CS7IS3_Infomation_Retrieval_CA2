This European Union summit was actually very significant. Delors has already given us a taste of what we managed to accomplish, what we have managed to agree upon, and what we have managed to do. I believe these are great steps forward. Before going into detail, I would like to say that although some disagree about the general policy that is being formulated, this policy is contained in Delors' white paper. Battles have been waged to achieve this, but now it is established. The white paper will constitute a guide for our actions and initiatives in the future. Now, regarding decisions specifically for Greece. Four big development projects for our country are included in the decisions of the EU summit. These are the Egnatia highway project, the Patrai-Bulgarian border highway project, the natural gas network, and the cable link between Greece and Italy. A second point that I would like to stress is that for the first time it has been decided to include both Cyprus and Malta in the next EU expansion phase. Within the framework of this conference, we had other very important developments. We had the signing of the agreement between United Europe and Russia, which constitutes a great step forward for peace, progress, and democracy. We also had the signing of the accession agreements by four countries. All of these countries are particularly sensitive to social policy and environmental issues and will contribute significantly to the United Europe's working level. There was also an official meeting within the framework of dialogue between Cyprus and the European Union. As you may know, we met Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis on this matter. I will say that I am mostly happy with the results, with only one exception, on which I cannot remain silent. We were unable to elect a new European Commission president to replace Jacques Delors. The Greek Presidency did everything possible to reach this goal, but unfortunately we did not achieve it. I am obliged to say that it was not achieved because Great Britain refused to accept the proposal of all the others. The issue remains open. A new EU summit supposedly will take place in mid-July to elect a new European Commission president. I do not want to go into more detail, but it is necessary to take a position. Now, I ask Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos to detail the conclusions of this EU summit.
