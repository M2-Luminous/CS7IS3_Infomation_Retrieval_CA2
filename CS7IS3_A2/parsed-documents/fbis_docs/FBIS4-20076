This is the upshot of Clark's speech at the Carnegie Institute of Washington. Commenting on Clark's speech, Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the document accepted by the Greek Cypriot side refers only to the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the guard posts south of Famagusta and control of the road by the United Nations. In his speech at the Carnegie Institute, Clark had said that the area that will be used for access to Famagusta could be used by the Turkish Cypriots, something that is not mentioned in the UN document. He had also said that with the confidence-building measures, Turkish Cypriots will have the right to travel by air to other countries and will also be able to charter flights to transfer passengers and cargo. Clark also had said that the UN asks various countries to give landing and take-off rights to one Turkish Cypriot airline.
