This is part of the effort by Chinese scientists in recent years to develop farm products and technology, invigorate the country's agriculture and bolster the economy's growth. Great achievements have been made in fertilizers, pesticides, breeding of crops and domestic animals, and processing and storage of farm products. Changes in farm patterns, economic structures and development modes, as well as in the thinking of farmers, are all attributed to the development in technology. Figures from a government department show that about 16.8 percent of the country's total scientific awards at national level last year were given to research projects in agriculture, stock raising and the fishing industry. These projects not only help tackle the technical problems in agricultural production, but also contribute to bettering people's life in rural areas. In east China, over 1,000 scientists from more than 100 different bodies have been involved in a development and research project to deal with the problem of low production in the plains of the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe Rivers. In the past eight years, some 81 of the 134 results they have achieved have been put into use. In some experimental areas, the annual grain output reached 15,000 kilograms per hectare.
