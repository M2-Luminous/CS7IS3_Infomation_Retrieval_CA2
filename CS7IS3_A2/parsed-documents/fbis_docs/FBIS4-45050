The embargo was imposed by the European Community in 1982 after the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] invasion of Lebanon, but most EC members had long since rescinded the ban. Britain left it in effect, insisting that the IDF withdraw from the security zone. Although Britain has lifted the prohibition on buying arms from Israel, she has not actually bought any weapons because of the embargo. Why are the British more extreme in this matter than the other European countries? It may be that the answer to this must be sought in the remote past, when Britain conducted policy in Mandate Palestine by calculating the worth of relations with the Arab states and the Arab world. It was a question not of principle but of practical considerations. The reason given for the recent decision to lift the embargo was the positive developments in the peace process in the Middle East, "especially in light of the IDF's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho." The decision was made following an extended lobbying visit by Rabin, Peres, Beilin, and their assistants. Beilin, who met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, told him that Britain's decision to maintain the embargo so long as no progress occurred in the negotiations with Lebanon, was absurd because such progress depends on Syria. Moreover, Israel made clear that she has no territorial demands on Lebanon. We glean from these events that Britain lags behind European nations in her conservative policy. This is also fundamentally a pro-Arab policy, to the point of imposing conditions for every development in relations with Israel. The British seem to forget that Israel no longer is a land under the control of the British Government, or that Britain cannot dictate how she shall conduct policy. The technique of imposing "collective punishment" on Israel for one policy or another is pointless. Britain cannot impose an economic embargo on another government simply because its political considerations differ from those of His Majesty's. The British Government has taught us another lesson at the same time. Prime Minister John Major refused to accept the Jewish community's invitation to take part in an evening devoted to Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day. His secretary justified that on the ground that Britain does not recognize and, indeed, rejects Israel's annexation of Jerusalem. Short and sweet. This is a community that sought to be honored by honoring the man who serves as the prime minister and, in the end, was honored by his disgrace. The festive dinner was held in a synagogue in Jerusalem even without a speech by Prime Minister John Major.
