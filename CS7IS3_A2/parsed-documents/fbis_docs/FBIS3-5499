Special regulations allowing boat people from Indochina temporary immigration permits pending screening of their applications for refugee status were abolished Saturday. The abolition was in line with the results of an international conference on Indochina refugees held in Geneva last month, officials at the ministry's Immigration Bureau said. Under the new system, people from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, who enter Japan without valid passports will be deported to their home countries and will not have the option of seeking refugee status, the officials said. Residents of Ukujima Island in the Goto group of islands in Nagasaki Prefecture spotted the 24 people aboard a small wooden boat anchored some three kilometers southeast of the island at around 7:20 A.M. and informed the authorities. The boat people are being questioned by Maritime Safety Agency officials. They are thought to be from Vietnam and include seven women and four children, agency officials said.
