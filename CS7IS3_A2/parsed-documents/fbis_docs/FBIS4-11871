[Al-Natshah] Thank you. [Al-Aswad] After the PLO and Israel reached agreement on security arrangements in the Hebron area, President Yasir 'Arafat appointed you mayor of Hebron. In your opinion, what is the significance of this step? Can it be seen as the beginning of actual Palestinian authority and decisionmaking in the occupied territories? [Al-Natshah] We welcome this decision and regard it as a step toward legality and democracy. My return and the return of the elected Municipal Council to our duties at Hebron Municipality strengthen legality and democracy. The Municipal Council is actually the elected body that was dismissed in 1983. Now, thanks to PLO efforts, it can again carry out its tasks. [Al-Aswad] Your appointment followed the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. What is the mayor's role in providing protection for the Palestinians? Is this part of the mayor's authority? [Al-Natshah] Conditions in the city since the massacre are unprecedented. The city center is closed off because of the security measures imposed by the Israeli authorities to protect the settlers. We have 750 shops that are closed. People living in the downtown area need permits to reach their homes. The schools in that area are closed because of the security cordon. Generally the city is paralyzed. Therefore the Municipal Council's first task is to reopen the city and restore normal life. We hope to do this within a few days, God willing. Second, the citizens have suffered a lot from assaults by the settlers and the Israeli Army. We hope that the international forces will protect the citizens and end the assaults. [Al-Aswad] Mr. al-Natshah, as you know, there is an agreement to deploy Palestinian police and international observers in Hebron. How do the Palestinians in Hebron view this step? What is the general atmosphere like in view of these recent developments? [Al-Natshah] The agreement provides for the deployment of international observers, meaning international protection, but not Palestinian police. We welcome the international protection; it has been a Palestinian demand for years. This is the first time we are being given international protection. We regard it as part of the implementation of the relevant UN resolutions -- in this case, Security Council Resolution 904. We hope this is a prelude to the implementation of the remaining UN resolutions. We stress that an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. Evacuating 30 settler families from inside Hebron would be the most important move to protect the city's Arab citizens. [Al-Aswad] The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will resume in Cairo today to discuss ways of implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on transitional Palestinian autonomy, beginning with Gaza and Jericho. According to some reports, the Israeli withdrawal from these two areas will begin on 12 April. What is your assessment of this step, judging from your perspective as a resident in the occupied territories? [Al-Natshah] We want peace in the region. We want a withdrawal from the rest of the West Bank. We want it to be a genuine, total withdrawal. We want the settlements issue to be put at the top the agenda so that the settlers will also be evacuated. [Al-Aswad] Mr. al-Natshah, how do the Palestinians in the territories regard the Egyptian role in making peace and restoring the Palestinian people's legitimate rights? [Al-Natshah] We greatly appreciate the stance of Egypt and Mubarak and their backing for the Palestinian cause. We hope this backing will continue until the Palestinian people can exercise self-determination and establish a state on their national soil. [Al-Aswad] Mr. Mayor, we thank you very much. You are always welcome on the Voice of the Arabs. [Al-Natshah] Thank you.
