FR940606-1-00064 FR940606-1-00008 (3) Materially affect the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof, or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has made the determination that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. For this reason, this action was not submitted to OMB for review. D. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1687.01) and a copy may be obtained from Ms. Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St., SW, (2136), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 366 hours per respondent for the first year after the date of promulgation of the rule, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, 2136, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for the EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. E. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations on small ``entities.'' Since the proposed rule applies only to major sources as defined in section 112(a) of the Act, the EPA certifies that there would not be a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Consequently, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. F. Clean Air Act Section 117 In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator welcomes comment on all aspects of the proposed regulation, including health, economic, technological, or other aspects. G. Regulatory Review In accordance with sections 112(d)(6) and 112(f)(2) of the Act, this regulation will be reviewed within 8 years from the date of promulgation. This review may include an assessment of such factors as evaluation of the residual health risk, any overlap with other programs, the existence of alternative methods, enforceability, improvements in emission control technology and health data, and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
