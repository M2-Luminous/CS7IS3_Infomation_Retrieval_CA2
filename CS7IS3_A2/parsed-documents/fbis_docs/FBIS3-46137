While acknowledging that infrastructure construction is booming all over the country, the editorial warns against the tendency in some localities of paying no heed to objective conditions, neglecting economic returns and blindly seeking big projects and construction speed. It criticizes some areas for failing to implement a national unified construction plan, undertaking redundant projects and over- extending the construction scale. "These malpractices are detrimental to the healthy cultivation of a socialist market economy, the rational distribution of natural resources, the display of comprehensive economic returns and the coordinated growth of China's economy as a whole, and even have damaged national interests," the editorial says. The country's leading newspaper also stresses the impOrtance of seeking truth from facts in doing everything. "In doing so, we must do everything in our power, and more importantly act according to our capabilities," it points out. The undertaking of major infrastructure projects is crucial to the overall distribution of the national economy and the overall supply-demand balance of the macro-economy, it says. That is why it is imperative to subject these projects to a national unified construction plan, it adds. In undertaking infrastructure projects, it is also necessary to pay close attention both to social efficiency and economic returns, the editorial says. Everything possible must "e done to step up the construction of those infrastructure facilities badly needed to spur China's economic growth, it stresses. However, it is also necessary to build such facilities in an orderly and step-by-step way, it adds. With a relatively low level of economic development, China will face the problem of insufficient financial resources and supply shortages of materials for a long time to come, it says. "Therefore, we ought to concentrate on the construction of top- priority infrastructure facilities, while doing our best to prevent waste resulting from redundant and blind construction," it says.
