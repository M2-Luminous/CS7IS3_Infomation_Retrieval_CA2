[passage omitted] We do not want a centralized European state, in which each and every thing is regulated from Brussels; we want a Europe in which the peoples are with each other in togetherness, in which we as Germans or Belgians, as Dutchmen, Luxembourgers, or Frenchmen make our contribution to Europe. We want this Europe to be a Europe in which the children born at this hour in Aachen take it for granted that they carry their home of Aachen and the language of their mothers, their mother-tongue, in them throughout their lives -- so that home means what the associations of that word are for us Germans: The space in which we grew up, the neighbors, our own family, the countryside. [passage omitted] The Maastricht Treaty has given us the basis and we will continue to develop this treaty over this decade, with more rights for the European Parliament, with an assumption of more responsibilities and competences, in a (?sensible) way, but not in such a way that we want to have a centralist European superstate, but so that in a wise way we will develop a federal Europe of the kind that we have tested out here in Germany. Ladies and Gentlemen let me say this. This Europe has been as successful as it has with the Germans in the last 20 or 30 years because here in Germany the German mark has grown more and more into the leading European currency. The fact that the German mark is today, alongside the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, one of the world's leading currencies is of the greatest importance for Germans and Europeans. This is why the following statement holds true, and I will continue to say it loud and clear, as is stated in the Maastricht Treaty: We will only agree to a European currency when this currency is of the same quality as the German mark. That is a decisive precondition of our policy. [applause] [passage omitted] Ladies and Gentlemen, in spite of positive developments in the economic sphere, concern about jobs remains. We know from our experiences over past years that when the economy is back on track and prosperity returns following an economic decline, unemployment cannot be reduced overnight, that it takes time for the new positive development to take hold fully. For that reason the issue of combating unemployment, halting unemployment, and creating new jobs remains the paramount task for us, for the CDU. But jobs cannot be talked into existence, or talked into existence through placards. It must above all be insured that the economy is back on track and that companies -- not least small- and medium-sized industries -- are capable of creating new jobs and hiring people. [passage omitted] The precondition for getting the economy back on its feet, and I add this quite frankly, is that following the experiences of the economic crisis that is now coming to an end, we do not assume we can carry on as before. [passage omitted] We know there are hundreds of thousands of citizens, including those who have a secure job now, who would quite willingly switch to a part-time job. [passage omitted] I am grateful for the fact that in the wage settlements of the past few months, especially in the pay settlements for the chemical and engineering workers, greater flexibility is now finally a reality and we can now adapt to the future in a much more dynamic way. That is the point -- the maxim must be to secure the future. [passage omitted] Ladies and Gentlemen, the competition -- thank God, for indeed we wish this -- is knocking at our door. We do indeed wish to see the successor states of the Soviet Union, namely Russia and Ukraine, make progress. We do indeed wish to see the rule of law, democracy, and a market economy established. For if they do not succeed, if the reforms collapse, and if the old structures return, be they military dictatorship or a communist regime, then everything is going to be much more expensive than at present, and the vicious circle of missiles and rearmament will begin all over again. We wish to see peace and freedom prevail in Central, East, and southeastern Europe and for their peoples to build their lives in a free country. However, that assumes that they build up their industries which, to put it bluntly, means that they are going to be our competitors. I will be speaking in Mannheim tomorrow, in May Square, just a few meters distance from the premises of one of the big European companies. This same company also has a branch in Brno. Both factories manufacture the same product. In Mannheim the hourly rate for a trained metalworker is 43 German marks [DM], in Brno DM3. And that is not on some far-distant planet but a distance of just a few hundred kilometers. These two figures illustrate to anyone how the competitive situation is shaping up. Naturally, prices in Brno will rise since prosperity means higher wages, and naturally wages in Mannheim cannot be lowered. But we must reflect on how to cleverly improve in many ways our competitiveness. Anyone who believes that the required standard has already been achieved and that one could now rest on one's laurels complacently awaiting future developments is betraying the future of Germany. Therefore, we from the Union say that we must be able to rethink to safeguard our future, and we will do everything necessary in this way. [applause] [passage omitted]
