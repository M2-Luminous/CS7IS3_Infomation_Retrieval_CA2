[Matsuoka] In a way, I cannot say exactly when that might happen until the draft budget for the next fiscal year has been finalized, but we must not delay this matter. Even if the upper and lower house elections are not held simultaneously, we feel that we must be prepared to contest next summer's upper house election and the next lower house general election as a single set of elections. We do not have very much time. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] It was Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who originally proposed the formation of a large parliamentary group composed of all the ruling coalition parties. How do you feel about this? [Matsuoka] The prime minister has clearly indicated that the plan is geared toward the next election. The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] still fares strongly in local districts. The battle between the coalition alliance and the LDP is a battle between reformists and the forces of the old system. Therefore, reformist-minded political parties (of the coalition alliance) must unite to carry on this battle. Because this is just about to happen, there is no time to argue about (regrouping parties into) a bipolar or tripolar structure. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Under the circumstances in which the Diet is remaining idle and deliberations on the budget cannot begin, complaints have been raised even by some members of the ruling coalition parties against stepping up moves toward a political realignment. How do you feel about this? [Matsuoka] We have not thrown the "ball." Neither has the prime minister. The proposed formation of a parliamentary group is... well, a "ball" thrown at us by Shinseito. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What kind of new party do you envision after the formation of a large parliamentary group? [Matsuoka] It can be expected to take various forms, because there will be a complex integration of beliefs about democracy, the Constitution, and other matters. However, I doubt whether we should rush to form a new party. What is necessary is to first completely destroy the old system. In addition, it is necessary for the time being to improve ways to steer the Diet, rather than to try to form a large parliamentary group. Should the JNP, Sakigake [Harbinger], and Shinseito unite, they would turn into a powerful force of about 120 members. We are now faced with difficult tasks, including a reform of the tax system. Unless the government has centripetal force -- just as in the days when the Tanaka faction, which consisted of over a hundred-odd members, was formed under the LDP -- the Diet cannot function properly. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The JNP and Sakigake have already formed a parliamentary group. What will happen to your party's ties with Sakigake? [Matsuoka] Prime Minister Hosokawa has suffered very much (in connection with the national welfare tax and cabinet reshuffle issues) as a result of the "ball" thrown by Sakigake's Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (head of Sakigake). If relations between Hosokawa and Takemura are referred to as an "engagement," Takemura should devote himself to playing the role of a housewife and unite his heart with that of the prime minister at their "household," which is the Prime Minister's Official Residence. Takemura, however, failed at this. Sakigake is more to blame for the changed situation (the deterioration in relations) as it exists now. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it no longer possible to restore the damaged relations with Sakigake? [Matsuoka] Sakigake used to be a group of LDP members who were dedicated to carrying out political reform. They also share a common political ideology with members of the JNP. However, what is wrong with them is that they tend to seek a joining of hands with the LDP. The JNP will absolutely never ally itself with the LDP. In this respect, Shinseito and the JNP are in agreement. However, Shinseito continues to drag on the employment of the old system's political style. The JNP can still continue to act as a mediator between Sakigake and Shinseito. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it possible to conceive of forming a parliamentary group consisting of these three new political parties? [Matsuoka] That depends on how members of Sakigake perceive this new political era. We would like them to look back and think calmly. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you have any concern about the possibility of the JNP becoming a cut field of grass [kusakari-ba -- recruiting ground] for other parties of the ruling coalition? [Matsuoka] The term "cut field of grass" itself is old-fashioned and is reminiscent of the old system. The JNP just has to further strengthen its own identity and continue associating with other parties.
