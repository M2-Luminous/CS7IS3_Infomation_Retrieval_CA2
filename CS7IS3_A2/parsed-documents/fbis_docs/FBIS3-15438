"The main purpose which unites us is the struggle against Georgia's joining to the CIS. We must avoid arguing on second-rate issues," Leader of the National Democratic Party, Georgi Chanturiya stressed. The opposition parties refused to establish a single organization. They decided to carry out their political cooperation through regular consultations which will take place in different parties' headquarters. The opposition has initiated collection of signatures for the country's independence and against Georgia's joining to the CIS. The opposition parties adopted an appeal to the UN, the world community and the heads of state which says that the Georgian leadership had tried to legalize the loss of independence and the republic's joining to the modernized Russian empire.
