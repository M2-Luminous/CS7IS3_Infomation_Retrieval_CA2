Wang expressed the Chinese Government's stance against importing wastes at a conference in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, Saturday [11 June] to commend Nanjing port for its discovery and return of harmful chemical wastes to Republic of Korea. On September 25, 1993, two Chinese corporations and some companies of the Republic of Korea had 1,288 tons of harmful chemical wastes shipped to Nanjing port under the label "other fuel oil". The matter caught the attention of the State Council and through joint efforts of departments involved, on March 5, the wastes were all returned to the port of origin abroad. Experts noted that in recent years, the cases of transnational transferring of harmful wastes and rubbish were on the increase. The State Bureau of Environmental Protection and General Administration of Customs are now closely cooperating to prevent pollutants from abroad from being shipped into China. China is now formulating a law governing solid waste pollution.
