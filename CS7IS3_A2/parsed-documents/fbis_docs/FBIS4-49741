Gao Shangquan, head of the subgroup representing the Chinese side said: Some media misinterpreted the economic subgroup's recommendation as indicating that the Chinese Government is unwilling to give up the land fund and is going to transfer it to the mainland for investment. He pointed out that this is not true. He made the following four points of clarification: (1) This land fund is an important financial source for the Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government. This financial source does not belong to anybody else or the mainland, but to the SAR Government. This sum of money is generated by Hong Kong land resources, after being processed by the people of Hong Kong. Therefore, it naturally belongs to the SAR Government. (2) This land fund will be handed to the SAR Government on the very day of 1 July 1997. This is very definite and well grounded. (3) How the SAR Government will manage and use this sum of money shall be decided by the SAR Government. No one else shall interfere. (4) If the SAR Government thinks that retaining the existing framework of the land fund for the time being is conducive to a smooth transition, it may consider doing so. The land fund will be managed by the SAR Government. Besides, he held that this period of retention should not be too long, but the actual length of time shall still be decided by the SAR Government. Fong Wong Kut-man, head of the subgroup representing the Hong Kong side, explained that the dominant view within the subgroup did not suggest merging the land fund with the exchange fund because there are more restrictions on the exchange fund. If the SAR government finds it necessary to use this fund to stabilize the currency, there might be difficulty in withdrawing this fund. Therefore, the subgroup thinks that if the land fund can be handled separately, the SAR government will have some flexibility. This was "purely the good intention" of the subgroup. As regards the alternative of putting the fund into the reserves, Fong Wong Kut-man pointed out: The future SAR government's financial policies remains anchored to the principle of a balanced budget, and it is not necessary to overdraw a large sum on the reserves. Therefore the subgroup did not think it necessary to put the land fund into the Treasury. Furthermore, when asked about the political subgroup's earlier statement about composing anew the Legislative Council, Fong Wong Kut-man, who is also member of the political subgroup, said that the subgroup had always understood "composing" or "reorganizing" as "re-elections."
