"It is not possible to advance with inefficient, isolated economies, nor is it possible with internationalized economies that are socially irresponsible," Salinas de Gortari added. According to Salinas de Gortari, "we must insist that economic recovery go hand in hand with social reforms." Salinas de Gortari said that he views with optimism bilateral and multilateral trade agreements signed during the past few years by countries of the American Continent because "free trade and the just exchange of goods and capital will benefit all of us." In addition, he called for a more active presence of Ibero-American countries in international organizations, and particularly mentioned the World Trade Organization, (?affiliated to GATT), which he hopes to chair. Salinas de Gortari expressed his solidarity with Colombia over the natural disaster that affected the regions of Cauca and Huila last week, which caused more than 1,000 deaths. He also congratulated his Colombian counterpart and host, Cesar Gaviria, for his election this year as the new OAS secretary general. Salinas de Gortari delivered his speech at the inauguration of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which was delayed six hours because most of the heads of state and government attending the event used double and even triple the amount of time they were expected to use (seven minutes each).
