He stressed that al-Kikhya's disappearance is a riddle, noting that Libya will not sacrifice its relations with Egypt for the sake of a Libyan opponent. He denied that his country is involved in kidnapping al-Kikhya, stressing that there are relations of friendship between the former Libyan minister and the Libyan regime's leaders. He pointed out that al-Kikhya did not constitute the least danger for Libya, making it sacrifice its relations and interests with Egypt. He said al-Kikyha is a man of high standing and the revolution honored him and appointed him a minister. When he reached retirement age, brother Colonel al-Qadhdhafi asked him to go to Algeria as part of the visiting Libyan delegation when Ben Bella returned to Algeria. Al-Bishari pointed out that the culprit in the disappearance of al-Kikhya has interests in continuing the embargo against Libya, starving the Libyan people, maintaining the threat of the Lockerbie case against Libya, and harming Libyan-Egyptian relations. Discussing the Lockerbie crisis, al-Bishari stressed that it could have been settled peacefully in November 1991 had it followed a legal course and had the Western nations cooperated with the Libyan Judiciary. He said Libya was surprised when the Western nations brought the case out of its framework and imposed it on the UN Security Council and passed resolutions to impose the embargo on the Libyan people. He pointed out that his country suggested every possible proposal to solve the issue peacefully without harming its sovereignty, independence, or supreme interests. And Libya, he said, expressed readiness to cooperate with every party and implement the UN Charter, which calls for maintaining security and peace. We also offered to compensate the families of the victims. Al-Bishari did not rule out a peaceful solution to the Lockerbie crisis, noting the mediation efforts by heads of state and countries including President Mubarak. He stressed that Libya seeks to establish good ties with Washington as a superpower and has interests in Libya. He noted that Egypt and Tunisia are trying hard to reach this goal. He said his country seeks no confrontation with Washington but will not relinquish its national interests or the Arab nation's right to exist and have unity. Al-Bishari stressed that the retreat of the main witness in the Lockerbie case, which will greatly help his country, is considered to be an important development in the case that might influence public opinion and the attitude of the nonpermanent members of the Security Council, which were pressured to vote against Libya.
