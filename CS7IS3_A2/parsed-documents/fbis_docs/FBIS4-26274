The largest circulation newspaper carried the deputy foreign minister's interview with its political correspondent Edyth Bulbring on South Africa's foreign policy. Pahad said the People's Republic of China is important for South Africa not only because of the enormous trade potential, but also because it is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. He pointed out that should South Africa establish diplomatic ties with China, it would have to forgo the long-established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. However, he stated, Taiwan is one of South Africa's largest trading partners. "In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by our interests and international precedents." Pahad said given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the focus will be to increase favorable economic relations with its traditional trading partners -- the United States and the European Union. But, he said his country will also be looking beyond traditional partners to expand economic relations with, among others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, the People's Republic of China and Latin America. Another area where links were unexplored is the Middle East, not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.
