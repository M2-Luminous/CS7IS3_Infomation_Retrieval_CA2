P. Yakimovich; UDC 621.397.13] [Abstract] A method for transmission and reconstruction of three-dimensional wide aperture images is examined. The essence of the method lies in obtaining three-dimensional coordinates, brightness and spectral characteristic of object's points, aperture of their visibility window and eventual reconstruction of a three-dimensional picture as a totality of the object's points, where each of them is visible only from its own visibility window. This method allows to transmit high quality wide-aperture three-dimensional images without significantly increasing the bandwidth of the standard TV communication channel. This method can be employed with any methods of point- by-point scanning or monitoring the scenes. In this article the method of horizontal cross sections is examined because, compared to other, it requires a minimal bandwidth of the communication channel for the information transmission. The optical diagram for a possible implementation of the examined method is provided. Figure 1, references 9: 5 Russian. 4 Western
