Agriculture must be a priority in economic work. He said: Rural economic structural adjustment must proceed on the basis of maintaining a stable increase in grain production with a focus on the development of township and town enterprises, animal husbandry, and highly efficient industrial crops. Governor Chen Shineng continued: Township and town enterprises should implement the policy of major development and major improvement and ensure a 30 percent annual growth rate while striving for 40 percent. This year, the province will build 20 small industrial zones for township and town enterprises' development. In animal husbandry, aquatic breeding, and crop planting, we should develop pig breeding step by step, vigorously develop the breeding of cows and sheep, step up the development of eel breeding, and explore the development of all kinds of industrial crops. In two years, we should strive to raise the proportion of the output value of animal husbandry and aquatic breeding to the gross agricultural output value to more than 30 percent. In industrial crops, we should develop flue-cured tobacco, tea oil, tea, and Chinese medical herbs. Governor Chen Shineng pointed out: In the course of improving large and medium state-owned enterprises, we should boldly develop the nonstate economic sectors and take this as a strategic point in establishing a market economic structure and stimulating Guizhou's economic development, so as to gradually form a pattern for multiple economic sectors, equal competition, and common development. Chen Shineng said: Beginning this year, we will put nonstate economic sectors in the economic and social development program and will determine a clear development objective and policy. With the exception of those that have been specifically stipulated by the state, restrictions will be lifted on operational scale, methods, and scopes of nonstate-owned economic sectors. We will support individual industrial and commercial households in carrying out border trade, as long as they have the necessary conditions; in building joint-venture or cooperative enterprises; and in doing business or building enterprises abroad. Financial departments should allocate funds for the development of individual and nonstate economic sectors, which are entitled to equal treatment as state-owned enterprises and township and town enterprises. We should list the operational sites of individual industrial and commercial households in the urban construction program. Wherever possible, we should build all kinds of professional markets and small commodities markets and actively assist nonstate enterprises that have certain potential and good foundations in expanding their scale of operations, upgrading their facilities, and raising their standards. We will encourage redundant personnel as well as scientific and technological personnel in institutions to engage in civilian-run enterprises. There are currently more than 300,000 individual industrial and commercial households in the province, with registered capital of 1 billion yuan. There are more than 3,000 nonstate enterprises, with 50,000 personnel and registered capital of 400 million yuan, and there are 685 three-capital enterprises, with registered capital of $1.1 billion. The output value of these nonstate economic sectors accounts for 33.5 percent of the gross industrial output value, and their sales volume accounts for 63.1 percent of the total market sales volume.
