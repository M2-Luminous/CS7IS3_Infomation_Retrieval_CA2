Jaba Ioseliani, the chairman of emergency situations; Parliament Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze; Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia; ministers, administrators, and representatives of force departments were present at the session. The session was conducted in a businesslike and interesting manner. Full information about the session will be broadcast in the near future. We would like to stress the unanimous opinion of the session participants: That a lot has been done in the republic for establishing order. [Begin Shevardnadze recording] After they [Russian officials] had noticed these tendencies [of improving the criminal situation in Georgia], a decision was made that Russian President Yeltsin visit Georgia in the near future. I would like to say that in ancient Russian-Georgian relations, this event is the most significant one. Russian Emperors used to visit Georgia, our representatives also used to visit Russia, and you know how they would reach Russia, some would fail altogether; Soviet leaders used to visit Georgia and there would be a celebration but then it was still a visit to a colony and a periphery. Now, the leader of one of the world's greatest countries is going to visit independent Georgia, an independent country. The greatest acknowledgement for Georgia's independence is a visit by the Russian president and his emphasizing this fact. Georgia has a lot to tell, her needs are plenty, and there are many problems that cannot be resolved without Russia, we have already made sure that they cannot be resolved [without Russia]. Therefore, it is our essential goal to establish good-neighborly, friendly and kind relations with Russia. I am grateful to President Yeltsin for -- if I am not mistaken his birthday is on 3 February -- having chosen this very day for visiting this friendly country, to meet these friendly people, and greet them the way a representative of a great country should.
