FR940817-2-00051 FR940817-2-00039 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;357&hyph;000] Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff August 11, 1994 Take notice that on August 8, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, with a proposed effective date of October 1, 1994: First Revised Sheet No. 206 Sheet Nos. 207&hyph;210 Second Revised Sheet No. 216 Texas Eastern states that by this filing, it proposes to grant, effective October 1, 1994, customers under Rate Schedules CDS and FT&hyph;1 enhanced transportation rights with respect to deliveries and receipts in Texas Eastern's Market Zones 1, 2 and 3. Texas Eastern states that it proposes to add new Sections 13 and 15 to Rate Schedules CDS and FT&hyph;1, respectively. Pursuant to the enhanced transportation rights contemplated by these new tariff provisions, Texas Eastern proposes to increase transportation rights for customers paying rates pursuant to Section 3.2 of Rate Schedules CDS and FT&hyph;1. Texas Eastern states that the proposed tariff provisions will permit qualifying customers to deliver gas in one Market Zone up to the lesser of customer's MDQ or the sum of customer's maximum daily contractual entitlements on the 24-inch line, the 30-inch line, the Texas Gas Transmission Corporation loop, and the Trunkline Gas Company loop applicable to the upstream Market Zone in which the delivery is to be made without necessarily impacting or limiting, as is the current situation, its capacity rights in a downstream Market Zone. The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is October 1, 1994, a date which corresponds to the date that necessary changes to Texas Eastern's scheduling procedures and computer information systems can be implemented to accommodate the proposed tariff changes. Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
