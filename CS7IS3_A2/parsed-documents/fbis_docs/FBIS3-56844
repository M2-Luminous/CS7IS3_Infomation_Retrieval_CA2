Russia has no intention to violate the sovereignty of Latvia in whatever way, but the withdrawal of Russian troops must take place in a normal and civilized manner, and according to an agreement, Kozyrev said. "Russian troops cannot leave at once; this depends on a number of circumstances that are also known to the Baltic partners. Russia's firm objective is that the withdrawal should take place on a legal treaty basis -- this will also strengthen the sovereignty of these countries," he said. The Russian foreign minister said his country was following a specific line of conduct in its relations with the former republics of the Soviet Union, or its so-called close abroad, vacillating between two extreme options: to send in tanks or demand fully abandoning these regions. Kozyrev said either of these options would lead to the repetition of the so-called Yugoslavia scenario on the former Soviet territories. Kozyrev said the same would happen if Russia's special role was denied. He said that if Russian troops were pulled out from Tajikistan, if they abandoned their peacekeeping activity in the Karabakh, Ossetia and other regions of conflict, millions of refugees -- all of them not inevitably of Slavic origin -- would flood Moscow. He said this was a thing Russia couldn't let happen. Kozyrev said the West was "not always able to understand these simple truths." He warned that Russia was not going to remain still if the rights of Russian-speakers in the Baltics were violated. Saying that the negotiations held separately with all three Baltic countries on the issue of their Russian-speaking population were going on normally, Kozyrev mentioned that using more rigid measures was possible if a violation of international legal norms took place in the Baltics. "We spoke already before Zhirinovskiy that economic sanctions might be imposed against countries which follow such a policy," the foreign minister said. But he also warned of the possibility of provocations by pro-fascist forces in Russia.
