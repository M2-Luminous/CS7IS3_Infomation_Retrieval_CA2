"Assessing the recent economic indicators, there seems to be high chances that the economy has moved one step toward a recovery," Mieno told the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors. The governor said the "one step" was from his latest assessment that the economy is "showing signs of bottoming out." Mieno cited brighter signs in personal consumption, inventory adjustments and exports, particularly to Southeast Asian nations, and noted that corporate concern about having a surplus of facilities and equipment has "hit a ceiling." His comments came after the central bank released Friday its quarterly "Tankan" report on business sentiment that showed improvement in confidence by both major manufacturers and nonmanufacturers for the first time in five years. Asked about the effects of the 5.5 trillion yen income tax cuts, Mieno said he expects the cuts to "support the economy that is showing slight brightness." But Mieno said he remains uncertern if the economy has moved "two or three steps forward," noting such prevailing concerns as the yen's rise, sluggish corporate capital investment and competition from other Asian nations. As for capital investment, however, he said the environment for a recovery is improving, and stressed that declines in interest rates since the central bank cut its official discount rate to an all-time low of 1.75 percent last year are still supporting corporate restructuring efforts. The central bank intends to continue carefully watching to see whether the recent bright spots spread to the economy as a whole, Mieno said.
