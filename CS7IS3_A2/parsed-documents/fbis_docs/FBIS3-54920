The Bishop has consecrated the building where the Russian government will work from now on. The Premier will work in the study formerly occupied by the former Russian prime minister, Ivan Silayev, and then Boris Yeltsin. The recent occupant of the study was the former speaker of the Russian Parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov. The Bishop of Istra blessed the activities of the premier and the government. Chernomyrdin has handed over to him two icons and added that over one thousand icons would be handed over to the Russian Orthodox Church later. Taking part in the ceremony was the first Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets who, together with other government members, moved to the new study in the building at Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. A spokesman for the Council of Ministers has told Interfax that the new government residence has an office for President Yeltsin. The building on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment will have previous telephone numbers for the government hot line. The telephone numbers for the cabinet members will change due to the building's being switched to a new automatic telephone network. At Staraya Square, the telephone numbers began with 206. Now the first three figures will be 205.
