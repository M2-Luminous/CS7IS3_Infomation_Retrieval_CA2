While the world economy is recovering at a faster tempo than last year, maintaining economic growth and creating employment, that is, "growth and employment," are expected to be the central issues at the summit because of worsening unemployment. In particular, the United States and other nations are expected to strongly urge Japan to continue its tax cuts and to increase public investment substantially in order to expand domestic demand through fiscal measures. One of the focal points of the leaders' discussions will be whether to include country-by-country economic measures in the declaration. With regard to aid to countries converting to a market economy, the leaders are expected to reach agreement on aid to Ukraine, which is in the midst of a serious economic depression. A Japanese-U.S. summit is also expected to be held on 8 July immediately before the Naples summit. The two leaders are expected to confirm Japan's tax cuts beyond FY 1994, and recent points of agreement at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks to demonstrate the strong "cooperative relationship between Japan and the United States." Unemployment has become the top priority political issue, especially for Europe. The total number of unemployed in the OECD nations has reached 35 million. While the United States strongly demands macropolicies to stimulate the economy, including tax cuts and other fiscal measures, and a loose monetary policy by lowering interest rates, to deal with unemployment, Europe and Japan favor a structural reform of the labor market by correcting the excessively high wage levels and unemployment benefits. The main issue for Germany is a looser monetary policy; for other European countries, the structural reform of the labor market; for Japan, expanding domestic demand; and for the United States, reducing the fiscal deficits. Following the agreement on aid to Russia at the Tokyo summit, the Naples summit will discuss plans to ask Ukraine, which is where the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located, to close the power plant completely in exchange for economic assistance. A survey team will be send to Ukraine, and aid measures will be discussed based on the findings of the team. In addition, the leaders will confirm the conversion of GATT to the World Trade Organization (WTO) from January 1995, and they will discuss problems relating to the world trade system. They are also expected to include in the economic declaration stronger measures to prevent money laundering, which will also cover funds used for arms procurement, in order to deal with regional conflicts, as well as regulations on bribery by the advanced nations' companies in developing countries.
