FR940124-2-00047 FR940124-2-00040 4. The administrative charges to be assessed under the Contracts will be (a) an administrative charge of $30 per Contract year, during the accumulation period only, if total purchase payments in the first Contract year are less than $100,000 and (b) a daily asset-based charge, at an annual effective rate of 0.15%, during both the accumulation and annuity periods. Security Life guarantees that it will not raise these administrative charges for the duration of the Contracts. Security Life also represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the administrative charges will be greater than the total expected cost of administering the Contracts, on average, excluding costs that properly are categorized as distribution expenses, over the period that the Contracts are in force. 5. If more than one demand partial withdrawal occurs during a Contract year, there will be a charge of the lesser of $25 of 2% of the amount withdrawn for each additional demand partial withdrawal. Security Life represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the partial withdrawal transaction charge will be greater than the total expected cost of administering demand partial withdrawals, on average, over the period that the Contracts are in force. 6. The Contracts will permit transfers among the divisions of the Account, subject to certain conditions. Prior to the annuity date, an Owner will be able to make up to 12 transfers each Contract year at no charge. Each additional transfer will be subject to a charge of $25. After the annuity date, an Owner will be able to make no more than four transfers each Contract year. No charge will be assessed for a transfer after the annuity date. Security Life represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the excess transfer charges will be greater than the total expected cost of administering excess transfers, on average, over the period that the Contracts are in force. Security Life represents that the amount that it will recover for premium taxes will not be greater than the amount of premium taxes required to be paid. 7. No front-end sales charge will be imposed when purchase payments are applied under the Contracts. However, a surrender charge will be assessed if the Contract is surrendered or partial withdrawals exceeding certain amounts are taken during the six year period from the date Security Life receives and accepts each purchase payment. The surrender charge in the first Contract year is 7%, and reduces by 1% each Contract year thereafter; there is no surrender charge applicable to the withdrawal of payments that are six or more years old. In no event is the surrender charge greater than the amount withdrawn. 8. Applicants seek to impose a daily asset-based charge equal to 1.55% annually to compensate Security Life for certain mortality and expense risks it bears under the Contracts. Security Life will assume several mortality risks under the Contracts. First, Security Life assumes a mortality risk arising from the fact that the Contract does not impose any surrender charge on the death benefit. Second, Security Life assumes an additional mortality risk by its contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the Annuitant under annuity options involving life contingencies. Third, Security Life will assume a mortality risk because of its promise to pay a death benefit to the beneficiary if the Owner dies prior to the annuity date. This assures each Annuitant that neither the Annuitant's own longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the annuity payments received under a Contract. At the same time, Security Life assumes the risk that Annuitants as a group will live longer than Security Life's annuity tables had predicted, which would require Security Life to pay out more in annuity income than planned. The contracts contain annuity tables that are based on the 1983a Individual Annuity Mortality Table and, for variable annuity options, alternative net investment factors of 3% or 5%. Security Life guarantees these annuity tables for the duration of the Contracts. 9. In general, the Contracts provide for a death benefit that is the greatest of: (a) The purchase payments made (less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken), accumulated at 7% per year (the interest rate for any Owner of attained age 75 or greater is 0%) up to a maximum of two times the sum of all purchase payments (less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken); (b) the accumulation value at the time of death; and (c) the step-up benefit plus purchase payments made, less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken since the last step-up anniversary. The step-up benefit at issue is the initial purchase payment. At each step-up anniversary, the current accumulation value is compared to the prior determination of the step-up benefit, increased by purchase payments made and reduced by partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken since that anniversary. The greater of these becomes the new step-up benefit. The step-up anniversaries are the Contract date and every sixth Contract anniversary thereafter ( i.e., sixth, twelfth, eighteenth, etc. Contract anniversaries). The death benefit equal to the accumulation value, or to the sum of the purchase payments made less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken, constitutes the basic death benefit. The death benefit in excess of the foregoing basic death benefit, including purchase payments accumulated at 7% interest as described above, and the step-up benefits as described above, constitutes the enhanced death benefit.
