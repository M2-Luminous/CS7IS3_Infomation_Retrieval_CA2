Kutlu Esendemir and Recep Ozturk had been preparing a television program in the region for the past week, TGRT official Erdal Celebi said. The pair last contacted the network on Wednesday, when they left the Sulak police post in the Sirnak region, near the Iraqi border, heading toward Guclukonak, in the same region, Celebi said. Celebi blamed the kidnapping on the Kurdistan Workers Party, the separatist movement which launched an armed rebellion against the Turkish government in 1984.
