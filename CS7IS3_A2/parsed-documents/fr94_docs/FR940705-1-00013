FR940705-1-00013 FR940705-1-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [OAQPS # CA21&hyph;6&hyph;6291; FRL&hyph;5007&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision; Ventura County Air Pollution Control District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. The revisions concern the control of oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) from electric utilities and stack monitoring requirements for making compliance determinations in Ventura County. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of NO x in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA actions on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. COMMENTS: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing on or before August 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A. Meer, Chief, Stationary Source Rulemaking (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. Copies of the rule revision and EPA's evaluation report of each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours. Copies of the submitted rule revisions are also available for inspection at the following locations: Stationary Source Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. California Air Resources Board, Stationary Source Division, Rule Evaluation Section, 2020 ``L'' Street, Sacramento, CA 95812.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wendy Colombo, Stationary Source Rulemaking, (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 Telephone: (415) 744&hyph;1202. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background: On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO X emissions through reasonably available control technology (RACT) are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November 25, 1992, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO X Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, notice should be referred to for further information on the NO X requirements and is incorporated into this document by reference. Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO X (``major'' as defined in section 302 and sections 182(c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas. Ventura County is classified as a severe nonattainment area for ozone, 1 therefore subject to the RACT requirements of section 182(b)(2), cited above. 1 Ventura County was designated nonattainment and classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by a pre-enactment control technologies guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document) by November 15, 1992. There were no NO X CTGs issued before enactment and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO X sources since enactment of the CAA. The RACT rules covering NO X sources and submitted as SIP revisions are expected to require final installation of the actual NO X controls by May 31, 1995 for those sources where installation by that date is practicable.
