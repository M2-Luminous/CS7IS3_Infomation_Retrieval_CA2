He has expressed his views on many occasions since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee held in last November. The sources also said: Wan Li, former chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, specially pointed out when chatting with retired veteran cadres in Beijing that once the Gang of Four collapsed, Chen Yun had resolutely asked for permission to let Comrade Xiaoping resume his post. Later, he gave his support to Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As far as party life is concerned, it is normal to have different views on certain concrete policies and measures, which should not be considered as factional infighting. The Scale of Construction Must Be in Line With Our National Strength The sources added: On the eve of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Chen Yun wrote a letter entitled "My Several Views" to the Central Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. He spoke of five points in his letter: 1. The leading body of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is strong and capable, it has done a good job. 2. We must enhance party building and heighten the ideology of building a clean government on the people's behalf and treat it as our party's long-term task. 3. We must educate the whole party and, in particular, cadres at the provincial (ministerial), prefecture, and city levels, and resolutely get rid of localism, departmental selfishness, and sectarianism. 4. It is true that speed is a major consideration in economic construction, but benefits are of paramount importance. It is true that economic construction should procede on a large scale, but it must be in line with our national strength. This is precisely a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. 5. Reform must be founded on self-reliance and the principle of building China well. Only when we build China well can we become independent and autonomous, vigorously develop China, and be in an invincible position. Do Not Alter the Principle of Treating the Publicly Owned Economic Sector as the Mainstay Chen Yun stressed on many occasions since last January that in reform, the principle of treating the publicly owned economic sector as the mainstay cannot be altered because it concerns the overall system of the state. He said: I fully support the principles and policies set by the central authorities. That is, key state enterprises and large and medium enterprises which have a bearing on our national economy and the people's livelihood can only be strengthened, rather than weakened, in reform. We must watch out for losing and doing damage to state-owned assets. He pointed out: We must try to find out what is meant by a socialist market economy. We can never indiscriminately copy others' experience, but can only practice it in a selective and partial manner. Whether or not the system is good should be proved in practice, and never should we rush headlong into mass action. Chen Yun also said: I agreed with what is said by some comrades. That is, we cannot allow foreign businessmen to run airports, ports, highways, railways, mines, and other important strategic resources. We must be far-sighted and cannot be in a passive position. We cannot say foreign businessmen can invest in whatever they wish. The United States, Canada, European countries, Japan, and South Korea also place restrictions on foreign investment in accordance with their national conditions. Chen Yun stressed: There are three things which serve as the key to the development, progress, and stability of the whole country, that is, the CPC's own building, rural development and utilization of rural labor force, and an urban inflation rate which can be sustained by most citizens. If we fail to solve and handle well any of these over quite a long period, troubles will come. Chen Yun suggested that the central authorities should focus, in a planned way, on the development of a number of impoverished provinces and regions. He said: We have implemented reform for 15 years, we should place this problem on our agenda and try to solve it. We can never neglect it, and we can no longer wait.
