FR940816-2-00093 FR940816-2-00073 [TA-W-27,920] Bell Helicopter; Fort Worth, TX; Negative Determination on Remand By an order dated April 29, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (USCIT) in Former Employees of Bell Helicopter Textron v. United States, (USCIT 93&hyph;01&hyph;00024) remanded this case to the Department for further investigation. The workers under this petition were initially denied eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance on December 18, 1992. The negative determination was published in the Federal Register on January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4186). The basis for that decision is the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the group eligibility requirements of the Trade Act was not met. The findings show that Bell Helicopter does not import publications which are produced in Fort Worth. The findings show that the production of manuals is done either by Bell Helicopter or contracted to domestic vendors. The court ordered the Department to investigate on remand where Bell Helicopters are now being produced and to determine whether any manuals are also being produced at the new helicopter production sites. The Court further ordered the Department to investigate whether manuals are being imported into the U.S. if it turns out that they are being produced abroad. The court also instructed the Department to obtain independent verification of Bell's statements that no English language manuals were being produced abroad and that no imported manuals were substituted for those formerly produced in Fort Worth. Item # 1 of the petition identifies the group of workers petitioning for TAA as the writers and illustrators of the Technical Publications Department, AR 2. however, plaintiffs assert that the production of helicopters is linked to the production of manuals. Investigation findings show that during the period applicable to the petition, Bell Helicopter produced helicopters in Fort Worth, Texas and in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada. The Quebec facility products the commercial helicopters while the Fort Worth facility produces military and commercial helicopter components and assembles military helicopters for the U.S. Government, namely the Cobra and the OH58D_an observation helicopter. New findings on reconsideration show that Bell Canada in Mirabel, Quebec was opened in 1984 and is the final assembly for commercial helicopter models. The final assembly for commercial models 206B, 206L, 212 and 412 was transferred to Bell Canada between June 1986 and September 1988. However, the manuals for models 206B, 206L, 212 and 412 are produced at Fort Worth except for the manuals of 100 helicopters (model 412) sold to the Canadian Government. The Canadian Government mandated that the manuals be produced in Western Canada. The first effort to produce these manuals began in October, 1993 some 16 months after the layoff of the petitioners in June, 1992. According to Bell Helicopter officials, the plaintiffs' layoffs had absolutely nothing to do with the Canadian government purchase of the model 412s. Furthermore, some of the technical writing for these 100 manuals was returned to Fort Worth and Bell Helicopter has two technical publications employees assisting in the creation of these manuals. The completion of the 100 technical manuals is scheduled for January 1995. Bell Canada is also producing helicopter model 230 and will soon put model 430 into production. However, these models were never produced at Fort Worth. Furthermore, they are not like or directly competitive with the models that were transferred to Canada. Bell Canada or their subcontractors produce the manuals for models 206B, 206L, 212 and 230. Changes to the manuals for the 230 model are, however, accomplished at Fort Worth. While some manuals for model 230 are being imported into the U.S. they are not being substituted for the manuals formerly produced at Fort Worth. In response to the court's order, the Department asked the plaintiffs to provide evidence for their assertions that Bell has moved its manual production abroad and that imported manuals have replaced those formerly produced in Fort Worth. The plaintiffs asserted that some manuals are being produced in Alberta, Canada. However, according to Bell, these manuals are for model # 230 which is not like or directly competitive with models formerly produced at Fort Worth. Furthermore, the plaintiffs also indicate that three Fort Worth employees are working on these manuals under a Canadian government contract. As noted above, this contract had nothing to do with the plaintiffs' layoffs. Consequently, the plaintiffs' responses do not provide a basis for certification. Other findings on reconsideration show that the Technical Publications Department's layoffs in 1992 were the result of company-wide reduction in force caused by severe curtailments in production and cancellations or loss of programs from the Department of Defense. Conclusion After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance for workers and former workers of Bell Helicopter, Fort Worth, Texas. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 5th day of August 1994. Stephen A. Wandner, Deputy Director, Office of legislation & Actuarial Service Unemployment Insurance Service.
