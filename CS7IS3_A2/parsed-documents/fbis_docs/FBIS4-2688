He broached the question of Timor today. He asked the Chinese Government to contribute to a just solution to the problem of East Timor. He stressed that the Chinese contribution should come within the UN framework. [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] We believe that there are two issues in Timor: the question of respect for human rights, which we will continue to advocate here and anywhere else in the world, and there is the question of the occupation by a foreign power of a territory that, according to international law, is still under Portuguese administration. Therefore, we are asking the Chinese Government for support, so that within the UN's framework, under the auspices of the UN secretary general, a just and internationally accepted solution can be found for the problem of Timor. [end recording] As for the nationality of the Macanese, Cavaco Silva said that he had been informed that the Chinese authorities did not intend to impose Chinese nationality on the residents of Macao who are of Portuguese descent and culture.
