"We set greatest store by peace, but, if any enemy dared provoke a war by challenging our sincerity and efforts, we would sweep away the aggressors from this land for good and demonstrate once again the mettle and honour of heroic Korea." The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] says this in its information No. 646 published on March 31. Noting that the United States and the South Korean authorities have staged war exercises almost every day, massively introducing various kinds of war materiel and a large number of aggressor troops, the information goes on: "If the reckless war moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges are overlooked, the train of a nuclear war would inevitably be lighted, and then, the territory of our country would turn into a barren land and the whole nation suffer an irretrievable holocaust. "The South Korean people of all walks of life should fight more daringly to check and frustrate the planned deployment of Patriot missiles and new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges."
