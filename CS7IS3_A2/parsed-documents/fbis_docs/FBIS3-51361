According to the diplomat, the Onusal mandate will continue past the March elections. [Begin Ramirez Ocampo recording] Onusal's obligation is to verify the peace agreements, and therefore Onusal's duration is determined by compliance with the agreements. [end recording] Ramirez Ocampo said the concern some political sectors have over the limited number of party representatives on department boards has been resolved by a bill that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal presented Monday to the Legislative Assembly. According to the Onusal spokesman, the bill states that all the parties, including the coalitions, can have a party representative in both the department and the municipal boards. [Begin Ramirez Ocampo recording] It is obvious that no party can be deprived of representation, but it is also obvious, I believe, that there cannot be more than one representative. This means that it is important that all contending political parties are represented equally at the electoral department boards. [end recording] As Ocampo sees it, it must be guaranteed that the electoral department and municipal boards function legally.
