The agreements open an opportunity for the stationing of U.N. peacekeeping forces in the region. Still, an appropriate decision of the U.N. Security Council is required for this, experts believe. The problem of refugees return will be resolved in stages, ITAR-TASS learned. At initial stages, refugees will return to places of their permanent residence in Galiy District. According to diplomatic circles close to the Georgian delegation, the question of refugees return to Sukhumi and Gagry is not yet raised. This problem is to be solved at future negotiations. The agreements do not apply to refugees who participated in hostilities against the Abkhazian side. This provision has been included in the document on Abkhazia's insistence, but in a milder form then intially planned, according to the same sources. Another important point of agreements invisages consultations in Geneva between the Georgian and Abkhazian delegations on a permanent basis.
