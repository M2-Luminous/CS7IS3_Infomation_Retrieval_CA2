A number of deputies immediately demanded that Georgiy Lukava, a deputy from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], be replaced as chairman of the session as, in the view of many, his lack of experience meant he was not up to the task. In accordance with the Constitution, Georgiy Lukava opened the first session of the State Duma as the oldest of the deputies, and it was thought that he would chair the session until a speaker was elected. Some deputies suggested that Georgiy Lukava should give up his place to one of the more competent deputies by means of a Duma resolution. However, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the LDPR leader, from a microphone in the hall, gave the stand-in chairman a categorical instruction "to go nowhere, switch off the microphone, and not allow anyone onto the podium." He demanded that discussion of the issue of the numbers in a faction be resumed, having been stopped before the break, and if necessary that "the militia be called." The indignant deputies protested and refused to take part in the electronic registration announced by Georgiy Lukava. As a result, the electronic board showed that there was no quorum several times in a row. The first session of the State Duma continues -- for the time being -- in a less than constructive spirit.
