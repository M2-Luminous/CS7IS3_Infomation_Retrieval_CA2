Comrade Foreign Minister, I know you have had an intense work agenda to cover in 24 hours since you arrived in Zambia from Zimbabwe. We would like to know about the different activities carried out by you and the delegation accompanying you on this visit through five African countries, and also about the meeting you had today with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and other prominent figures. A good evening to you from Havana, Cuba. [Robaina] Well, yes, Mejia. Indeed, the past 24 hours have been extremely intense, and we will be leaving for Namibia in a few hours. In any case, I can assure you that these have been hours well used, to the extent that relations between the two countries are strong and historic. However, we have not spent our time talking and discussing, just to talk about how historic they have been, but rather to make them even more historic, and to make history, to the extent that we may be capable of strengthening [these relations]. We have had extensive discussions with the Foreign Ministry, essentially in the spheres of education and health. These areas, in which cooperation already exists, will continue to be explored. There is a willingness on the part of the Zambian Government to continue and indeed increase the compensated cooperation in these spheres. A number of new variants have also appeared in the spheres of sports and agriculture, in which the Zambian Government believes Cuba has achieved a good deal of results that would also be useful to them. They have therefore asked that these be established as important mechanisms.... [Mejia, interrupting] Yes. [Robaina, continuing] for cooperation and exchange. From the moment we arrived, the first hours we were here, they have expressed their country's absolute gratitude, particularly for the way in which Cuba, despite its limitations and difficulties, has been able to contribute to training its physicians, engineers, and teachers. They are truly grateful for that, and vastly appreciative of everything Cuba has done for Africa. I never tire of replying to statements of this sort that although it is important for gratitude to exist, we also owe our Cuban-ness of today, and today's Cuba, to among other things, our African roots. And I think that the special thing today.... [Mejia] Yes. [Robaina, continuing] has been meeting with President Frederick Chiluba, who furthermore sends a special greeting to our people, and has recognized in a very profound and very serious manner the heroism of the Cuban people and the characteristics of its principal leaders, especially Comrade Fidel. He said he wished this continent had a lot of men like Fidel because it certainly needs them, really needs them. But, above all, he emphasized the way the people draw enough strength from where there appears to be no strength, enough to resist. He sent special greetings.... [Mejia] Yes. [Robaina, continuing] and made public his decision to visit Cuba on whatever date is most suitable for both the Cuban and Zambian sides. I think these hours have been put to very good use, and, I repeat, one comes out of it greatly satisfied.... [Mejia] Um-hmm. [Robaina, continuing] to again be able to greet this land, this country, these men and women who maintain a special relationship with Cuba. [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister, we know that the current government of Zambia tries to keep an active profile in foreign policy, basically with its neighbors in the region, as is the case with Malawi and, more recently, its mediation in contacts between representatives of Luanda and UNITA. What news do you have about the evolution of negotiations between the Angolan Government and UNITA? [Robaina] Well, this is a topic with which we are familiar and with which we continue to keep abreast. Many of us people continue to be, in one way or another, linked to conflicts and negotiations of this kind. [Mejia] Yes. [Robaina] The information is exactly the same as that in our country. There are some talks going on, and both the Angolan side and the Zambian [words indistinct], site of the talks that are being held, agree. We notice confidence and optimism that they could evolve. In any case, I would like, in this (?detour), not to lose hope. We know what has always happened with the negotiations carried out domestically by the Angolan side. Some of the parties that are participating in this negotiating process do not always do what has been agreed upon and committed to, and this makes the road much more difficult. As you know, the only thing Cuba can really do is express a clear desire to see the negotiations progress, a clear desire to have them progress in the best way possible -- to have everyone do the impossible to keep Angola from returning to the positions of a declared war. And I say an openly declared war because although some may think that the war has ended, the war has not ended in Angola. There is a tremendously difficult, tremendously complex internal situation that is the result of the way this entire process of negotiations has been obstructed. It is getting much more difficult. [Mejia] In conclusion, Foreign Minister Robaina, in a few hours you leave for Windhoek. I understand that during your visit to Namibia, and prior to concluding your African tour, you will be meeting with President Sam Nujoma and other government officials. [Robaina] That is correct. We leave early tomorrow morning for Namibia. We have many meetings scheduled in Namibia. We will be meeting with members of the parliament, ministers, and with President Sam Nujoma. I think we can continue to talk on the telephone. We are happy to say that our tour ends in Namibia and then we will be going back home. [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister Roberto Minister, I greatly appreciate your talking to me. I know I have robbed you of some minutes of sleep. It is now 0220 in Lusaka, Zambia. Listeners, as you have heard, we have been talking to Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina who is on a tour of several African countries. Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister, for your statements to Radio Rebelde in Havana, Cuba.
