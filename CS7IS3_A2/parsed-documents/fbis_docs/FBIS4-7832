Akashi said afterwards that the talks mainly focused on the situation in Gorazde and the corridor leading toward the town. He expressed the hope that the United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] will visit the town soon in order to acquaint themselves with the real situation in the field and the (?possible) level of damage that was caused in the most recent battles. At the same time, he said that UNPROFOR will strive to do everything with a view to establishing a cease-fire [words indistinct] of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. For a complete and whole peace in this region, the agreement between the Croats and the Muslims will not suffice. The third -- Serbian side -- must be included with a view to establishing a lasting peace and a lasting solution. On the basis of an agreement of all three sides, one should build peace and demilitarization of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi said. Radovan Karadzic pointed out that Gorazde and the territory surrounding it is only a small part of the front and the great Muslim offensive that is taking place on all sections of the line of separation with the Serbian forces. The Serbian side offered to the Muslims peace and to have the battles stopped on all sections of the battlefield, as one cannot solve the conflict partially -- that is, where it suits the Muslims. We are ready, Dr. Karadzic said, to make it possible for military observers to enter Gorazde so they can see for themselves that the town is not endangered and that battles are waged only where Muslims attacked the Serbian forces. At the same time, he stressed that the Serbian side does not want any more territories, that it is ready to concede certain percentages of what it currently has under control, and one should believe the Serbs when they say that offensives and war are not in their interest. However, if the Muslims attack, they run the risk of gambling with their own territory and their lives. They may lose much more than they could win with peace, Dr. Karadzic said. At the same time, he demanded that the international community not help the Muslims feel secure in regions where they do not have a military advantage or to help them where the Serbs have a military advantage so that they may again feel more secure there. Therefore, one needs an equal treatment and warning sign to the Muslims that through gambling and war, they could lose a lot. When such large-scale battles are being waged, percentages do not mean anything, Karadzic said, and reiterated that we are ready to give a part of the territory, but only in exchange for a lasting peace. He demanded that members of the peace forces pay attention to the possibility of survival of the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serbian entity on these regions. The Serbian side has nothing against this federation, as long as it is not directed against them. We have our own territory; we have our republic, which is a reality, and we should be allowed to survive. With time, these two states -- the Srpska republic and the Muslim-Croatian federation -- will establish some kind of relations to the extent that the peoples would want and would allow.
