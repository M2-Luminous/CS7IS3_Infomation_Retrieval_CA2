The strategic aims for the socioeconomic development of both states coincide in what is most important or are running in parallel, which, consequently, creates reliable preconditions for joint production and cooperation. This was stated today by Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, as he addressed representatives of Chinese business circles at the PRC committee for promoting the development of international trade. Broad prospects are now opening up, the prime minister noted, for Russian-Chinese relations to attain a fundamentally new level of constructive partnership, geared toward the 21st century. It [the partnership] is in the two countries' national interests and is an important factor in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia- Pacific region and throughout the world. Meanwhile, continued Chernomyrdin, Russia and China -- whose trade turnover is approaching $8 billion -- are yet to explore the great potential of objective possibilities for joint economic activities. The noticeable drop in trade turnover, especially at the beginning of the year, prompt us to look for new forms of mutually beneficial forms of interaction. In Chernomyrdin's opinion, mutual investments and attracting Chinese investments and the work force into exploration of Russian natural resources and construction of infrastructure facilities, as well as Russia's participation in large projects in China. [sentence as received] It is now time to think about creating joint investment and brokering corporations and there is the possibility to re-examine the agreement on the clearing system of payments. The Russian prime minister also called for broadening cooperation in the sphere of conversion of defense enterprises. He proposed elevating border ties to a higher level by promoting production cooperation and the creation of trade zones with a special regime for foreign investment. At the talks with Premier Li Peng there was a discussion of the question of setting up a bilateral inter-regional body for coordinating trade and economic cooperation between border regions. Dwelling on the economic situation in Russia, the Russian Government chairman noted that in just over two years of reforms progress had been achieved in establishing market relations and consolidating the legal basis of the state. Chernomyrdin told the representatives of business circles that the Russian Government intends by January to reduce inflation to 5-7 percent. In his opinion, of important significance here are the edicts signed a few days ago by the Russian president on tax policy, strengthening the budget and payments discipline, normalizing accounting, liberalizing foreign economic activity, and the reforms of state enterprises. The state does not intend to throw loss-making state enterprises to the mercy of fate. The necessary help will be given to ease the difficulties of the period of transition. Above all, this concerns questions of the social sphere. The government is taking specific actions, which will help to prevent, in practice, a further reduction in the living standards of the Russian people and to keep inevitable unemployment at a socially acceptable level, the Russian prime minister said.
