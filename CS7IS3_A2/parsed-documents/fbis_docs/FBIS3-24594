S. Kabanov, Tayfun Scientific Production Association; UDC 551.576.11:551.510.42/522.629.782] [Abstract] Changes over time to the horizontal size of a water vapor and hydrochloric acid launch cloud ater the launch of a solid fuel rocket are calculated. Its lifetime at the surface is calculated for various meteorological conditions. Calculations were done for clouds which formed after space shuttle launches. The time for the cloud to be destroyed by precipitation is estimated. The following assumptions are made: the troposphere is not saturated with moisture; there is no cloud cover; the temperature and concentration of water vapor does not change over the cloud's lifetime; wind speed in constant. Cloud altitutde is assumed to be limited by an inversion layer. The vertical and horizontal components of turbulent diffusion are described. Figure 1; references 10: 4 Russian, 6 Western.
