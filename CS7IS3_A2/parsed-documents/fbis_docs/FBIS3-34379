Our sources said in an urgent dispatch received today that dozens of armored military units and tank battalions were seen taking up positions along the road. Most of the tanks deployed by the regime, our sources added, are sophisticated Russian-made T-72's used by the Republican Guards. Our sources cited well-informed sources that the deployment came after antiregime popular moves in central Iraq, especially in the Governorates of Karbala', al-Najaf, and al-Hillah. The sources said the command of the deployed force was instructed to hold military exercises and training for occupying imaginary targets inside cities. It should be noted that the Governorates of al-Najaf and Karbala' were in the past few weeks the scene of heroic operations carried out by the Islamic resistance forces. The regime's centers, headquarters, and its security and party services were attacked, and leaflets urging citizens to rebel against and overthrow tyrant Saddam's regime were distributed.
