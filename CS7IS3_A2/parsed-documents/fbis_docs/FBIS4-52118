A source from their meeting said that Suphachai asked the ASEAN ministers to compare the tariffs on petrochemical products sector by sector but the ASEAN ministers said that the tariff cut schedule should remain unchanged. Thailand has proposed to cut tariffs on petrochemical products according to the normal track timeframe -- that is, tariffs should be cut to 20 per cent over five years from 1996. Malaysia and Indonesia, however wanted to opt out of cutting tariffs on petrochemicals. Officials said that their rates are still lower or close to the levels implemented by Thailand. Meanwhile, plastic industry representatives will meet with Dr Sippanon Ketthat, chairman of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, on April 29 to ask for a tax reduction on raw petroleum in order to protect the plastic and related industries which are to be affected by Afta. The source said that the plastics industry would like to discuss the effects of protecting the petrochemical industry, and cooperation between the petrochemical and plastic industries on problems which will arise from the government tax restructuring in line with Afta. The plastics industry is ready to comply with the government tax restructuring but on the condition that the tax on raw materials be reduced more than the tax on plastic products. If not, small industries consuming plastic pellets would suffer. And in the long term, the petrochemical industry would be hurt since nobody can afford a higher price for plastic pellets in the domestic market, the source said. Also, there is a possibility of cheaper pellets from aboard coming into Thailand, even if the government sets high import duties, the source said. Although the government will succeed in setting up an Afta Adjustment Fund designed to help industries immediately affected by Afta, small plastics companies will not benefit from it, only large firms, the source said.
