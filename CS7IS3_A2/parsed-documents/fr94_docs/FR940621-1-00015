FR940621-1-00015 FR940621-1-00006 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 2 [ET Docket No. 94&hyph;45; FCC 94&hyph;110] Revision of the Rules Regarding Marketing and Equipment Authorizations AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposal responds to a Petition for Rule Making filed by the Consumer Electronics Group of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA/CEG) that would consolidate and harmonize the Commission's marketing rules. This proposal will permit radio frequency devices, prior to authorization or a determination of compliance with the technical standards, to be announced, advertised, displayed, and operated for compliance testing, demonstrations at trade shows, or evaluation at the manufacturer's facilities. In addition, non-consumer devices that have not been tested or authorized could be offered for conditional sale or supplied to the user for evaluation or compliance testing. On its own motion, the Commission is also proposing to amend its equipment authorizations regulations to provide clarification, to resolve inconsistencies, to remove unnecessary restrictions and obsolete regulations, and to incorporate several interpretations. These proposals would stimulate economic growth by permitting products to be developed on a cooperative basis by manufacturers and retailers, and by potential decreasing the time for a product to reach the marketplace. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before September 5, 1994, and reply comments on or before October 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John A. Reed, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;7313. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making in ET Docket No. 94&hyph;45, adopted May 9, 1994, and released June 9, 1994.

Paperwork Reduction The proposed amendments will not modify the information collection requirements contained in the current regulations. Summary of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making the Commission, in response to a petition from the Consumer Electronics Group of the Electronic Industries Association, proposes to amend Part 2 of its rules regarding the marketing and operation of radio frequency (RF) devices. Marketing includes the sale or lease, offer for sale or lease, including advertising for sale or lease, and importation, shipment or distribution for the purpose of sale or lease or offering for sale or lease. Currently, the rules prohibit the marketing and operation of an RF device unless it complies with all of the standards and the equipment authorization procedures. Certain exceptions to these rules are provided for verified digital devices and non-consumer ISM products operated under Part 18 of the rules.
