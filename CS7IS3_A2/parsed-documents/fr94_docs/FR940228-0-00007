FR940228-0-00007 FR940228-0-00002 Comment: One comment suggested that Harding and Perkins counties, South Dakota, be added to the list of wheat counties that have an April 15 cancellation and termination date. Statistics indicate that over 80 percent of the wheat in these counties is initially planted spring wheat. In order to maintain the line of counties which separates the April 15 counties from counties with earlier dates, Harding and Perkins counties should be listed with the other South Dakota counties with the April 15 date. Response: FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified the provision as recommended. Comment: Four comments agreed with changing the wheat sales closing and cancellation dates for Idaho, Oregon, and Washington from October 31, to September 30. However, they recommended the dates not be changed until the 1995 crop year due to the late publication of the proposed rule. One of the four comments indicated the change would cause the production reporting date to occur at an earlier date. In some areas of the Northwest, harvest may not be completed by that new production reporting date. Response: The effective date of these regulations has been postponed until the 1995 crop year, therefore, the wheat sales closing and cancellation dates for Idaho, Oregon, and Washington from October 31 to September 30 has been postponed to 1995. FCIC will take action to change the production reporting date if problems occur. Comment: One comment stated that the change of the wheat sales closing and cancellation dates from October 31 to September 30 for Idaho, Oregon, and Washington is favorable and inquired as to the reason that Nevada and Utah remain at the 10/31 date. Response: FCIC changed the sales closing and cancellation in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington due to an allegation that the previous dates posed a potential for adverse selection. FCIC has not received any comments or recommendations regarding the dates in Nevada or Utah. It is FCIC's intent to allow the maximum sales period possible as long as program integrity is not compromised. FCIC will not change the proposed rule. Comment: A comment recommended that the cancellation and termination dates be changed from April 15 to February 28 for barley and oats in all Pacific Northwest states. Response: FCIC plans an overall assessment of program dates for all crops. The recommendation will be considered in that review. Comment: A comment recommended moving the cancellation and termination dates from the Crop Provisions to the Special Provisions. The comment suggested that any information specific to a state, county or group of counties be located in the Special Provisions where the appropriate parties have access to it. Response: These dates must remain in the Common Crop Insurance Policy due to the requirements of ยง457.8. However, FCIC will consider also placing them in the Special Provisions. Comment: One comment stated that as proposed, policy language in subsection 6.(a) could lead the reader to believe that the insured has the option of insuring only a portion of their insurable acreage. Response: FCIC agrees that this language should be clarified. The provision has been modified to indicate the crop insured is each small grain the producer elects to insure, that is grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which premium rates are provided by the actuarial table. Comment: One comment recommended requiring that requests for written agreements be received by FCIC within 15 days of the acreage reporting date and that the requirement be added to section 6. Insured Crop. Response: The Crop Insurance Handbook now indicates that these types of written agreements must be sent to FCIC, and be postmarked no later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date. Since reinsured insurance contracts are between the reinsured company and the insured, the contract should not contain obligations that exist between FCIC and the reinsured company. Therefore, language indicating that requests must be received by FCIC within 15 days of the acreage reporting date will not be included in the crop provisions. Comment: Three comments were received regarding the provision that allows the insured to designate wheat acreage that will be destroyed before harvest as uninsurable acreage, or acreage eligible for a reduced premium rate. The comments suggested that applicability of the provisions not be limited to wheat, and that the reduced premium rate should only be provided in counties where early destruction of crops has been a problem. Response: FCIC agrees that applicability of the provisions should not be limited to wheat. Only acreage intended to be harvested for grain qualifies as an insurable crop. Therefore, if it is known at the acreage reporting date that the acreage will be destroyed, it is not insurable. The provision that allows an insured to designate only wheat acreage as uninsurable acreage has been changed to apply to all covered crops. The provision that provides for a reduced premium rate if acreage is destroyed by a certain date, has been changed so that it applies only in those counties for which such a reduced rate is included on the actuarial table. This change will allow FCIC to provide a ``short rate'' only in areas where small grain crops are most commonly used for multiple purposes, e.g., grazing and harvest for grain. Comment: One comment questioned the benefit of using the under-reported premium factor as opposed to current procedure whereby production from unreported acreage is counted against the guarantee for reported acreage, or the acreage report is revised if acreage is over-reported. Response: Current procedure is not altered if under-reported acreage is the only problem. The under-reported premium factor reduces the guarantee when share, practice, type, or other material information is under-reported. Comment: One comment noted that it is extremely important that shifting liability procedure be reinstated. Acreage is reported by unit and the insurance company requires the insured to indicate on the acreage report the acreage he plans to destroy, however, insureds often do not know at acreage report time exactly which acres will be destroyed. Therefore, the company is asking for information that is often unknown at the time the acreage report is filed. Shifting liability procedure is an equitable method of addressing the situation. Response: If an insured indicates that acreage will be destroyed and then does not destroy the acreage, the unit will be subject to the under-reporting provisions of subsection 6.(f) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8).
