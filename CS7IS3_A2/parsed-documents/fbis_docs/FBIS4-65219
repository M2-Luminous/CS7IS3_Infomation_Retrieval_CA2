Let's leave the details to later. We'll work it out. That was the tune from Denmark's nonsocialist parties yesterday after the Progress Party leadership had made public in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE the party's very considerable demands that are the price of the necessary votes to support a possible future nonsocialist government. Hereafter, no one need believe that three or four no-nonsense demands from Pia Kjaersgaard a good way in advance of the elections can in any way disconcert Uffe Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal Party) and Hans Engell (Conservative People's Party). The two leading nonsocialist figures know the real political landscape in 1994 too well for that. It is quite simple. It is true that the Progress Party's seats are an absolute mathematical prerequisite along the road toward a Conservative-Liberal government, but it is just as inevitable a conclusion that Pia Kjaersgaard's troops really have no alternative but to support the formation of a Conservative-Liberal government. For who would the Progress Party people otherwise choose to support -- Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, for example? It is thoughts of this nature that are currently reassuring the Liberal Party and the Conservatives. And that have led to the slighting indulgent nonsocialist reactions to the Progress Party's extremely no-nonsense demands. For Engell and Ellemann-Jensen can note with satisfaction that for the foreseeable future the Progress Party will not find itself in any key position that can even begin to be compared with that which the Radical Liberals have exploited so skillfully for quite a few years. For while parties of the center can always make political capital out of the mere threat of moving toward the opposite end of the political spectrum, things are not so easy for the Progress Party: The party cannot bet on two horses. It has support for the Liberals and the Conservatives -- or nothing. This is why party leader Pia Kjaersgaard finds herself in difficulties when she is asked what her and her party's threat to the Conservatives and the Liberals really amounts to. In the past -- this was in [Progress Party founder] Mogens Glistrup's day -- the threat was clear: Here the party was always ready to play the role of totally unpredictable player. A party that no one dared count on when it came to forming a majority. That threat is scarcely real any more. After years out in the political cold the Progress Party is longing for the tiniest scrap of political influence, and Pia Kjaersgaard is the last person to want a return to the seventies' and eighties' semi-anarchist conditions in the Progress Party. In the light of this, Pia Kjaersgaard's latest statements should probably be interpreted as a way of reassuring the party's grass roots who to an increasing extent are seeking real results at the national level in return for their support: There must be no doubt among party officials that the party's flagship issues are at least being fought for. And there is something else that reflects the relative strengths of the three nonsocialist parties. Pia Kjaersgaard has already -- at a time before a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority is a reality -- suffered several defeats at the hands of the Liberals and Conservatives. First there was the question of government involvement. Pia Kjaersgaard considered it "natural" that the Progress Party should have ministerial posts. That ambition has been shelved -- everybody has now admitted that at best the party's role will be that of parliamentary support party. Then there was the question of foreign and EU [European Union] policy. Pia Kjaersgaard's move recently was that these issues should be included "from the outset" in the written platform of a future government. "Out of the question," both Engell and Ellemann-Jensen immediately thundered. And that is how things were left. The lesson seems therefore to be that in the final analysis the two big nonsocialist parties can do what they like with the Progress Party. Nevertheless, the latest demands from the Progress Party have caught the Liberal and Conservative party leaders off balance. Not so much because of their content, but rather because of the negative signal value this "visual interference" has. The truth is that what Engell and Ellemann-Jensen fear more than anything else is that the impression will become widespread among voters that there "is always some row" surrounding the Liberal, Conservative, and Progress parties. This would -- as several politicians have pointed out -- be a real gift. Particularly to the Social Democrats who would, for example, fight the forthcoming election campaign by conjuring up the vision of the Liberal Party, the Conservative People's Party, and the Progress Party as an unserious and unreliable alliance that does not represent a credible alternative to the incumbent government.
