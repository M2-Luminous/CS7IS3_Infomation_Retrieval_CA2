The primary objectives of this standard are: _to allow very highly interactive graphics application programs using 2D or 3D hierarchically structured graphics data to be easily transported between installations. This will reduce costs associated with the transfer of programs among different computers and graphic devices, including replacement devices. _to aid the understanding and use of dynamic hierarchical graphics methods by application programmers. _to aid manufacturers of graphics equipment by serving as a guideline for identifying useful combinations of graphics capabilities in a device. _to encourage more effective utilization and management of graphics application programmers by ensuring that skills acquired on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of graphics programmer retraining. _to aid graphics application programmers in understanding and using graphics methods by specifying well-defined functions and names. This will avoid the confusion of incompatibility common with operating systems and programming languages. 9. Applicability. PHIGS is one of the computer graphics standards (Appendix A discusses the family of computer graphics standards) provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. These graphics standards should be used for all computer graphics applications and programs that are either developed or acquired for government use. 9.1 ␣The FIPS for PHIGS is intended for use in computer graphics applications that are either developed or acquired for government use. It is specifically designed to meet the performance requirements of such demanding applications as Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Manufacturing, command and control, molecular modelling, simulation and process control. It emphasizes the support of applications needing a highly dynamic, highly interactive operator interface and expecting rapid screen update of complex images to be performed by the display system. The PHIGS Plus functionality is designed to support graphics applications requiring lighting and shading, curved lines, curved and facetted surfaces, and non-indexed color specification. 9.2␣ The use of this standard is compulsory and binding when one or more of the following situations exist: _The graphics application is very highly interactive, or contains hierarchically structured graphics data, or requires rapid modification of 2D or 3D graphics data and the relationships among the data. _It is anticipated that the life of the graphics program will be longer than the life of the presently utilized graphics equipment. _The graphics application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently. _The graphics application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers of different makes and models and different graphic devices. _The graphics program will or might be run on equipment other than that for which the program is initially written. _The graphics program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones. _The graphics program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal government ( i.e., State and local governments, and others).
