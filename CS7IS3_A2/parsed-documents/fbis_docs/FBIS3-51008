The fights broke off after it was decided not to allow the participation of 13 senators elected in the 18 January 1992 elections, whose election has been challenged by the parties supporting Aristide. Senator Eudrice Raymond of the National Front for Change and Democracy (FNDC), which brought Aristide to power, attempted to leave the building so as to prevent the quorum from being formed, but the challenged senators closed the doors. It was then when challenged pro-Duvalier Senator Gabriel Ancion hit Raymond and later attacked centrist Senator Judnel Jean. Assembly President Firmin Jean Louis was also hit in the face by Deputy Pierre-Francois Vital, while Jean Louis' bodyguard was apprehended by armed civilians and police. In light of the chaos and panic prevailing at the assembly, most of the legislators decided to abandon the building. It is not yet known when the legislative process will be resumed, given the new situation.
