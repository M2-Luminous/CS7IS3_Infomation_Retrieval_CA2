FBIS4-29472 "dreas118__a94021" FBIS-EAS-94-118-A Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Intraparty Group To Support Murayama Intraparty Group To Support Murayama OW1606135494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 15 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1606135494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] House of Representatives members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], who support chairman Tomiichi Murayama, decided on 14 June to form a new intraparty group as a counterforce against the party's largest group "Democrats," which supports general secretary Wataru Kubo who is eager for SDPJ's return to the coalition administration. If the Tsutomu Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse, the new group intends to strongly demand an early dissolution of the House of Representatives and a general election. Following the move, the conflict within the party will certainly worsen. The new group will develop from the "group for promotion of true political reform," which backed Mr. Murayama in the chairmanship election in September last year. Former SDPJ General Secretary Tsuruo Yamaguchi (chairman of the House of Representatives' Budget Committee) proposed the formation of the new group. They will hold a general meeting on 21 June to formally form the group centering on Diet Administration Committee Chairman Koken Nosaka and Deputy General Secretary Hideyuki Maejima. They intend to expand and reorganize the group in the future by inviting middle-of-the-roaders and former cabinet members to join the group. In a platform on "calling for regathering" which was worked out on 14 June, they agreed to the recent party policy of "demanding a dissolution [of the lower house] and a general election" if the Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse. At the same time, the platform virtually stresses the need to start election preparations in anticipation of a lower house dissolution and a general election under the current multiseat electoral system, saying: "We have to prepare for establishing the structure for dealing with a general election." Moreover, it denies the possibility of allying with both Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, saying: "We severely criticize the Liberal Democratic Party for its corrupted system resulting from money-oriented politics and the "Ichi-Ichi line" [the alliance between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa] for their way of managing politics by use of pressure tactics. We need to put "social democrats and liberals" together as the third force."
