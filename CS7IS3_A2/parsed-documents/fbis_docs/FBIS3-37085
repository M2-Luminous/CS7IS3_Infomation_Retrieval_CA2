Luik said that Denmark as a NATO member state admits the possibility of NATO taking part in building out Estonia's border defense system. The foreign minister said the possibility of joint military exercises was also discussed. "The first major joint maneuvers will be conducted in 1994," he said. "Germany, Poland and Denmark, and most probably also the Baltic states will take part in maritime exercises this summer." Luik said great importance was attached to Estonia sending in the near future a liaison officer to NATO planning division that works out the plans for all the alliance's military operations. The Baltic foreign ministers and their Danish counterpart discussed also the formation of a Baltic peacekeeping unit. Luik said the Danish officials regard it as having good prospects and are prepared to train military personnel for it. Luik said the Danish parliament is going to discuss financial aid for the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and the Estonian border guards. "If the parliament approves an aid program, we will probably receive more up-to-date communications and transport equipment," he predicted. The meeting between the foreign ministers touched on the Baltic states' relations with the European Union. "European Union member states accept us as future members of the union," Luik said. Another subject discussed in Copenhagen was the situation in Russia. Luik said Danish foreign policy leaders expressed great concern over the state of affairs in Russia. "There's no reason for panic, of course, but Russia's leaders must be shown calmly, through clear foreign political moves, what the bounds of international behavior are," the Estonian foreign minister declared.
