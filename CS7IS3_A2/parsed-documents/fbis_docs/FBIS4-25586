As indicated by several state leaders's recent remarks and by information provided by some authoritative departments, the present situation of the Chinese economy is good. What impressed us most is: The trend of rapid economic growth is still maintained this year despite a steady drop in the pace of growth, and the GDP in the first half of this year is expected to increase by approximately 12 percent over the same period of last year; the trend of reform is good, the several major reform measures introduced this year proceed smoothly despite arduous efforts made and the great difficulties met, the new system is running normally, and China has fully entered the new period of establishing a socialist market economic system; a good situation of opening up to the outside world, which is unprecedented, has emerged. China is opening up to every trade partner and has become one of the countries in the world with such ae great degree of opening up. A few days ago, on the basis of announcing the abolition of import administration for 283 commodities late last year, China also relaxed restrictions on the import of 195 commodities. This year, China's foreign trade continues to grow at a full and high speed, and import and export volume in the first four months increased by 20 percent over the same period last year. As for China's economic situation, the international community has, generally speaking, made very good comments on it. Not long ago, NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, a French weekly, published an article about impressions of China after visiting it, saying that "visitors are really startled by China's changes" and that in China, the "train has been set in motion, this is a train of reform and full-scale opening up which is advancing at a high speed." Sutherland, director-general of the GATT, said in admiration: "China's ambitious reform makes its economic system closer to the international trade system" and "the Chinese economy is undergoing eye-catchingly great changes." Even U.S. President Clinton also acknowledged not long ago that "last year, China was the country with the fastest economic growth in the world" and that "an economic entity belonging to the 21st century is gradually taking shape in China." Hong Kong is linked by common mountains and rivers with the mainland, and the people of Hong Kong are more capable of noticing the mainland's constant changes and of listening to the mainland people's footsteps of making great strides. We may ponder on things which we see and hear or even personally experience and take part in. In recent years, influential powers in the world have been trying every possible means to cooperate with China, and many globally renowned big enterprises have been vying with each other in marching into the market of China. What does it mean? It means that apart from having a vast market and an abundant supply of labor and raw and processed materials, more important is that the Chinese economy is growing at a quick pace, its investment environment has been improved greatly, and its domestic market is linking up with the international market step by step. These are precisely the results of China's reform. As far as Hong Kong business investments in the mainland are concerned, areas of investment have been extended to interior provinces or even to border areas in the northwest, the focus of investment fields has shifted from tertiary industry to infrastructure construction, and the scale ranges from investing tens of thousands or several millions yuan in running an enterprise to investing billions or even 10 billions yuan in developing stretches of land in a city. Not long ago, three worldwide famed transnational companies based in Hong Kong--New World Development Company Limited, Sun Hung Kai Company Limited, and Henderson Land Development Company Limited, decided to jointly invest 15 billion yuan in rebuilding riverside urban districts and some obsolete industrial enterprises in Wuhan, which is inspiring. What does it mean? It means that China's economic situation is getting better and better, and China has increasingly strong power to attract foreign investment. A number of Chinese state-owned enterprises have been successfully listed in Hong Kong. The first group of them are nine state-owned enterprises, which have issued a total of 5.5 billion H-shares and raised 11.6 billion Hong Kong dollars of funds, thus helping China's securities market take the first gratifying step towards internationalization. Now, another group of 22 state-owned enterprises scattered over the country are going to be listed in Hong Kong and in the United States. What does it mean? It means that the transformation of China's state-owned enterprise mechanisms is successful and approved of and accepted by international investors, and that the trend of the reform of state-owned enterprises is good and promises high hopes of establishing a modern enterprise system. In the exchange market of Hong Kong, we notice that the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and renminbi is kept at 100 to around 110 and that between U.S. dollars and renminbi has remained at one to 8.7 since China announced the unification of the exchange rates. What does it mean? This phenomenon also shows that China's financial situation is stable. We are not saying that everything is fine when we describe China's economic situation as good. Since China is so big a country and its conditions are so complicated, it is impossible that nothing is going wrong in the development process. Reform brings about a readjustment of interests, and different localities and different kinds of people benefit from the same reform at different times and in different degrees, thus it is inevitable that certain ideological problems arise. Reform is an orderly and gradual process which can never be accomplished in one move. At a time when the old system is being transformed into the new one and domestic and international markets have not converged, certain friction and conflicts are bound to arise. Although these problems are nonessentials, the CPC and the Chinese Government still attach great importance to them and vigorously seek to solve them by means of reform. We appreciate the remark made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed: It is never easy to rule a country with a population of over 10 million, let alone rule a big country with a population of over 1.1 billion! If we take such an attitude, various nonessential problems arising in China's economic work are comprehensible.
