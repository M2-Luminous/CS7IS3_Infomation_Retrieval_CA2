Summary of Evaluation Research on the Durability of Materials Used in Nuclear Power Plants (1) Perspectives of Durability Evaluation Research It is essential to ensure the durability of equipment and materials to provide for system safety and economy, and also to improve the performance of operational plants such as light water reactors and large reprocessing facilities. In the development of new plants, such as high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, the social acceptance and expandability of such plants are often governed by the durability of structural materials, although achievement of performance goals also is necessary. As Figure III-1 illustrates, to achieve a breakthrough in materials technology, both durability evaluation and the development of new materials are required. Therefore, in evaluating the durability of metal structural materials, the expansion and generalization of research results have been implemented through the comprehensive development of a series of research themes, such as deterioration analysis of materials used in the target environment, selection and development of quantitative and prompt evaluation test methods to predict operational life time, and the collection of data on corrosion and environmental cracks, together with the development of databases on various environmental, material, and dynamic parameters. In addition, improving material performance, and the development of new materials based on the results of durability controlling factor analysis are underway. Figure III-2 illustrates the relationships between differences in the durability control factors of nuclear plant materials and the use environment, that is, temperature and mechanical factors. Since slight modifications of reactor engineering design in the development of new types of plants affects the conditions of the operational environment, the development of evaluation and material production methods having a high degree of adaptability are being emphasized as key technologies. Because suitable nuclear properties related to environment safety in addition to durability will be required of structural materials for future plants, as illustrated in Figure III-3, the development of elements and nuclides as sources of radioactive cladding, improved adhesion in surface tissue and corrosion, and the development of criticality safety materials for reprocessing equipment are in progress. (2) Development of Durability Evaluation Methods Corrosion in the nuclear environment -- such as that produced by high-temperature water, high-temperature helium, and reprocessed nitric acid -- can vary drastically due to small amounts of impurities and coexistent elements. For this reason, efforts are underway to develop and improve durability evaluation and analysis methods -- including the generating surface and gap that are specific to practical structures, as well as environmental changes at the time of accidents -- using advanced equipment analysis and environmental management technology. Mass transport analysis in the same system as corrosion emission elements, which has an important effect on system maintenance and control, has been conducted with regard to the new environment of high-temperature helium and reprocessed nitric acid. Corrosion monitoring technology can be used to improve various conventional corrosion sensors used for electrochemical measurement, thereby serving as an on-site technology that can be adapted to the radioactive environment. Another goal is to develop methods appropriate for state resolution, such as optical and acoustic measurements. As quantitative evaluation methods to assess the extent of corrosion or changes in the quality of materials, work on activation analysis and fission track analysis using nuclear reactor facilities is in progress, in addition to various surface analysis and micro analysis technologies. (3) Analysis of Corrosion Damage Due to Age Deterioration Many nuclear materials are used in radioactive and corrosive environments for dozens of years. In such cases there are examples of damage due to age deterioration that would not appear in general industrial use. The JAERI facilities have played an important role in forecast studies for age deterioration phenomena. These include a hair-crack analysis of JPDR that led to research on stress corrosion cracks (SCC) in stainless steel in high-temperature pure water containing dissolved oxygen. In recent years, SCC and pitting corrosion at temperatures under 60�C were discovered on the stainless steel pipes of the primary cooling system of a nuclear reactor that was over 20 years old. Thus we learned that adequate water quality control and materials measures equivalent to those used for a high-temperature primary cooling system were necessary. At the time of long-term loop operation during a power stoppage for "Mutsu," a nuclear vessel, pitting corrosion on coated pipes was analyzed. The soundness of the fuel element was ensured by a thorough inspection, and by replacing defective components, after which the rest of the experimental sail was completed. Precious data concerning the generation and growth of partial damage produced by the effect of concentrations of very small amounts of chlorine in gaps, as well as by copper dissolved from the same circuit, were also obtained. An example of pitting corrosion that was observed after a long period of service in low-temperature pure water is illustrated in Figure III-4. Although the actual pitting corrosion depth obtained by destructive inspection is deeper than the results obtained from measurements using such ordinary methods as a mechanical tracer or the optical visual field depth method, there is a certain proportional relationship that indicates stable growth between aperture diameters. If they are of the same type, the depth of pitting corrosion in those for which destructive inspection cannot be conducted can be estimated quite accurately. We have experienced a number of problems with the materials that are used in the current generation of power plants, such as solid phase deposition by gas-air separation on the high-temperature heating surface of the liquid waste enrichment can, gap corrosion and SCC due to alkali concentrations, and the accumulation of radioactive crud through the selective elution of Co for the stellite hard metals in the high-temperature sealing section. Therefore, basic research related to operational control and countermeasures to protect materials have been implemented. 2. Examples of Forecast Method Development for Materials Durability The following is a summary of various studies on high-temperature gas-cooled reactor heat-resistant alloys, reprocessing plant materials, and water-cooled reactor core materials conducted by JAERI. All of these studies involved issues related to the evaluation of the durability of materials used in nuclear plants, as described in the previous chapter. (1) Long-Term Durability Forecast for Heat-Resistant Alloys for High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor As described in Part II, hastelloy XR was developed at JAERI as a high-temperature structural material for use in HTTR, and various performance evaluation tests related to its soundness and long-term durability have been conducted. This section will present methods for search testing for age deterioration damage modes, which control durability, for the purpose of developing rapid evaluation testing methods for assessing long-term durability, as well as rapid evaluation testing methods for material change due to high-temperature gas and surface responses. [1] Search for Age Deterioration Damage Modes That Control Durability In determining the high-temperature structure design plan for the HTTR, assumed damage modes are extracted using the characteristics related to materials durability and operational conditions. Taking these into consideration, the structure is designed so that there is a sufficient safety allowance to prevent damage to the materials. However, among the damage modes assumed in the design of the HTTR, it was found that the safety allowance for creep rapture and creep fatigue rapture was the smallest, and that creep property evaluation for extended use was important. As described in Part II (2), the creep strength of hastelloy XR for relatively short periods of about 1,000 hours can be radically improved by adjusting the boron content to 40-60 ppm. This improvement is also valid, as illustrated in Figure III-5, for creep properties for longer use periods, which is important for long-term durability. The figure illustrates the relationship between stress and rapture life time for hastelloy XR with a low boron content of 10 ppm or less, and for hastelloy XR-II at 50 ppm. The comparison is shown using dotted lines and full lines, respectively. (Hastelloy XR-II conventionally is used to distinguish it from hastelloy XR, which is defined as having a boron content of 100 ppm or less.) Compared to hastelloy XR, the creep properties of hastelloy XR-II show greater improvement at the lower temperature range of 700-900�C, and on the side of low stress and long hours. The results indicate the possibility of evaluating long-term soundness for creep rapture in structural materials in the real equipment environment by setting the boron content at 30 ppm for HTTR-specified materials, while using changes in the boron content of the alloy by aging as an index. [2] Preliminary Examination of Creep Life Time Evaluation Based on Boron in Alloys Since the boron content of the alloy was expected to diffuse and deviate from the inside due to surface response, variation by aging was measured using heating temperature, environment (air and impure helium), and test piece shape as parameters. Figure III-6 illustrates the results of measuring variations in the boron content of the alloy over time after heating round bars with three different diameters (1.6, 6, and 10mm) at 950�C and 1,000�C. A prominent reduction in the amount of boron can be observed in the 1.6mm diameter round bar heated in helium at 950�C and in the 10mm diameter round bar heated in the atmosphere at 1,000�C. The former began to lose boron within several hours, and almost all the boron was diffused from the test piece after several hundred hours. By contrast, the latter began to lose boron in the perimeter after about 3,000 hours, and continued to decrease to several ppm after about 5,000 hours. There was no observable reduction of boron up to several thousand hours at 950�C without load in any environment. These results verify that, as a method for evaluating the long-term durability of HTTR high-temperature structural materials, long hours of environmental effects can be accelerated by adjusting the size of test pieces without changing temperatures, in other words, by using test pieces with a larger relative surface area. [3] Examination of Accelerated Testing Method for Durability Evaluation Using the results of search testing to determine the boron content in the alloy under different heating conditions, combined with a method for analyzing the diffusion of boron in the alloy, various methods for predicting the long-term durability of high-temperature structural materials for HTTR were examined. In order to obtain this index, test pieces that were systematically varied in size were analyzed to determine their average boron content after being heated in various atmospheric conditions, and were evaluated using a model based on diffusion theory. a) Analysis of Diffusion Behavior of Boron in the Alloy For a preliminary examination of the diffusion behavior of boron in the alloy, the hastelloy XR base with 1 ppm boron was welded using hastelloy XR-II with 40 ppm boron as a filler material. The welded joint was heated at 950�C for 3,000 hours, and then cut and sanded. The density distribution of the boron on the surface of the welded cross-section was analyzed with an ion microanalyzer. The results are illustrated in Figure III-7. Boron is distributed symmetrically on the welded line as a result of being heated at 950�C for 3,000 hours in the atmosphere. This is true for all cases including the axis from the welded metal to the back of the metal plate (circle), the axis of jointing at one-quarter T of the plate (triangle), and the axis of jointing at one-half T of the plate (square). Figure III-7 also includes the results of an analysis of the behavior of boron as an unsteady element in a one-dimensional interdiffusion model. The profile of the test values of boron distribution coincides well with a diffusion model when the boron diffusion factor is assumed to be D = 1 x 10[.sup]-9[/]cm[.sup]2[/]/s. Analytical treatment of this kind is considered possible. (b) Examination of Accelerated Evaluation Method Using Size Effect Boron diffusion behavior in such practical structural materials as round bars and plates also was analyzed -- assuming unlimited length with limited diameter and thickness -- using the diffusion factor D for boron that was obtained as described in the previous section. Figure III-8 illustrates the relationship between the heating time required to reduce the boron content in solid round bar test pieces and heat transmission pipes, made of hastelloy XR-II with 50 ppm boron, heated to 950�C to 5 ppm, and the diameter of round bars and thickness of heat transmission pipes. Changes in the boron content as a result of heating solid round bar test pieces 10mm in diameter over 20,000 hours can be observed after several thousand hours by using solid round bar test pieces 4mm in diameter instead. Such a tendency is even greater with heat transmission pipes. It should be possible to predict material changes in heat transmission pipes over a long period of time from the results of tests using round bar test pieces. Based on the results of the examination introduced here, basic research concerning various accelerated testing methods is in progress to ensure the long-term durability of high-temperature structural materials for the HTTR. Comprehensive development of a life time evaluation system using such analytical methods is also underway. (2) Corrosion-Resistant Alloys for Reprocessing Plants Current large-scale commercial facilities for reprocessing spent light water reactor fuel use the purex process, which involves the use of organic solvents dissolved in nitric acid. It is planned to improve this method for use as a group separation technology in future. On the historical side of material technology, however, the durability of stainless steel equipment has become an important issue, since the object of reprocessing switched from low burn-up metal fuel to high burn-up oxide fuel, as illustrated in Figure III-1. For this reason, work on durability evaluation methods, material-related technologies, the development of corrosion damage data, and analytical codes as the basis for a life time forecast database is in progress. This involves implementing analytical research on the chemical properties of nitric acid solutions; research on durability control factors for various conventional materials -- such as stainless steel, zirconium, and titanium alloys -- in the nitric acid environment; and the development of evaluation testing and analysis methods. In addition, work is underway on the development of stainless steel, high-chrome compound converted alloys, and refractory metal alloys suitable for use in the corrosive environment of nitric acid for three levels of oxidation. [1] Development of Testing Methods and Evaluation of Environmental Corrosion Based on chemical analyses of nitric acid solutions, the corrosion of stainless steel in reprocessed nitric acid is controlled largely by the chemical condition and the electrothermal ebullition condition of various elements dissolved from spent fuel, such as FP and TRU. Therefore, to characterize the environment, equipment analysis and electrochemical measurement methods -- such as state analysis and reaction generated gas (NO[.sup]x[/]) analysis of micro ionic species based on ion chromatography and high-frequency plasma emission analysis -- were established. Subsequently, "the on-site analysis method" using the laser Raman method was developed. At the same time, we also developed a number of evaluation testing methods, such as various corrosion testing methods focusing on the corrosion acceleration factors specific to the nitric acid environment of fluid condensed nitric acid and electrothermal ebullition, slow-speed skew-speed tensile testing (SSRT), corrosion fatigue testing, and fletching. As illustrated in Figure III-9, SUS 300 stainless steel, which is an ultra-low carbon steel, with sufficient sensitization showed a high level of corrosion resistance to oxidative acid, which tends to become passive. However, it was found that an accelerated corrosion peculiar to reprocessed nitric acid took place due both to the dissolved chemical properties of nitric acid itself, and to changes in the condition of dissolved ions, as indicated in the results of the chemical measurement shown in Table III-1. Because the pyrolytic response of nitric acid increases at higher temperatures in the ebullition condition, the effect of temperature on the corrosion speed for the steel in question in the depressurized ebullition condition presents two-step changes, as indicated in Figure III-10. Also, oxidation generation from trivalent chromium to sexivalent chromium occurs only in the theoretical pyrolytic temperature range. Furthermore, with regard to heat transmission, the corrosion potential rises to the transpassive region, as shown in Figure III-9, due to the effects of A and B reactions, and general corrosion with prioritized corrosion is further promoted. The acceleration of corrosion on the generating surface can be understood as a function of the amount of evaporation and corrosion accelerating ion parameters. Such findings were useful as guidelines in establishing operational conditions for the equipment used for generation boiling of evaporation cans, methods for material selection, and the development of corrosion-resistant alloys with a high level of safety allowance. [2] Durability Evaluation Testing and Materials a) Ultra-Low-Carbon Austenitic Stainless Steel For this material, the effects of alloy elements and impurities on corrosion in the high potential range from the passive state to the transpassive state were studied. It was found that the microsegregation that occurs during cooling to reach a liquefying processing temperature can cause intergranular corrosion with the presence of a few ppm of dissolved elements that weaken the cohesion of metal elements such as P and B in the transpassive state. Furthermore, based on a close examination of cut-out stainless steel parts from a demonstration test reactor at the current plant, gradual and accelerated growth of corrosion damage (general corrosion intergranular corrosion tunnel corrosion corrosion crack) of the stainless steel used in high-oxidation nitric acid solutions was studied quantitatively. The results of this evaluation were reflected in the development of life time evaluation methods and new materials. With regard to materials, a compound method for metal structure control by adjusting by alloy components combined with changes in the intermediate production process was examined as illustrated in Figure III-11. Using a compound means of purification and a microgranulation to improve grain boundary purity based on the electronic beam solution method, as well as the skew aging mid- and high-temperature recrystallization method, intergranular corrosion, and progressive increase of corrosion speed by aging, which is characteristic of the transpassive region, did not occur. Tunnel corrosion was prevented as well. Furthermore, by examining alloy elements in detail to improve corrosion resistance from the passive to transpassive regions, as illustrated in the lower diagram of Figure III-9, a high-chrome compound addition RW alloy, which has more corrosion resistance than stainless steel, was developed by the compound addition of a suppresser element (Si) for cathode reaction -- which is a reduction response to high-oxidation ions and nitric acid -- and film generation elements (Cr, W) to suppress anode response. As illustrated in Figure III-12, the corrosion resistance of alloys especially developed for use in high-oxidation nitric acid is far superior to that of conventional steel, and it confirms the effective role of Si and W compound additives. b) Refractory Metals Such as Ti and Zr It is necessary to isolate durability problems, and to develop quantitative evaluation and analysis methods for materials designed to serve as replacements for stainless steel, which has transpassive characters, for use in reprocessing equipment. Ti has a high degree of auto-ion dissolution in low concentration nitric acid. Therefore, analysis of such phenomena as corrosion work and pitting corrosion in fresh condensate nitric acid under evaporation-condensation conditions, separation by hydrolysis, and escape to the gas phase by compound formation with thermodynamic instability illustrated in Table III-1, which displays new mass transport phenomena, has been promoted. Meanwhile, work also has been done on Zr, which has good corrosion durability in all ranges of nitric acid concentrations in spite of its SCC. Its stress corrosion crack sensitivity was evaluated by the slow-speed skew-speed tensile testing (SSTT) method, and it was found that the TG (thorough granular) SCC of false cleavage crack with sensitivity loss was created in boiling nitric acid in several standards. The reduction of rapture life time by SCC as a result of increased nitric acid concentration, as illustrated in Figure III-13, is greater in the test pieces with the densest plane of dense hexagonal crystals being oriented in the direction of crack development. It was also found that Zr crystals, particularly in softer materials, tended to rotate at the tip of cracks as a result of low-temperature creep, where stress was concentrated. This promoted crack development by orienting the densest plane toward the direction of the crack development, and accounted for more than 50-60 percent of the fracture factor in false cleavage cracks. As there has been insufficient use of the metal in question with dense hexagonal crystals as a thick structure material, analysis of durability controlling factors by fracture mechanic methods, including low-temperature creep and fatigue effects, and the development of evaluation methods is underway. Because corrosion improvement of the metal in question requires alloying measures that take into account the crystallographic anisotropy specific to dense hexagonal crystals, methods for improving corrosion resistance focusing on the ion radial effect of alloy elements and corrosion crack existence have been developed. To improve the corrosion resistance of Ti, the addition of corrosion-resistant elements such as Ta, which has a similar ion radius, has been found to be effective. As for the corrosion crack resistance of Zr, improving low-temperature creep by adding corrosion-resistant elements with a different ion radius has proved to be effective. (3) Water-Cooled Reactor Material From the standpoint of thermal neutron economy, a material with small cross-section for thermal neutron absorption is preferable for the fuel elements of power generation reactors. Coated pipes for a new type of light-water reactor with a hard neutron energy spectrum, and the primary wall of water-cooled nuclear fusion reactors require high mechanical strength in the mid-and low-temperature range, as well as a high level of several radiation resistance. Austenitic stainless steel in the SUS group is one of these candidates. It has been found that the major factors governing the life time of this steel in heavily irradiated high-temperature water are reduced ductility, and radiation-induced stress corrosion crack (IASCC). Analyses of material transformation caused by heavy irradiation in the mid- and low-temperature range, as well as the development of radiation-resistant steel have been conducted. For the former, electrochemical measurements such as EPR after heavy irradiation, quantitative evaluation methods for sensitivity using various corrosion tests, and SSTT test technology for high-temperature pure water have been developed. [1] Analysis of Durability Reduction Mechanism by Mid- and Low-Temperature Irradiation The sensitivity of stainless steel at temperatures below 500�C was thought to be equivalent to the model for M[.sup]23[/]C[.sub]6[/] separation and Cr-depleted layer formation along with the grain boundary shown in Figure III-9. However, it has become known that it is promoted by the spinodal decomposition-type microsegregation of atomic layers by the interaction between transfer and dissolved elements as a result of the increasing over-saturation of dissolved elements, including such major elements as Cr, caused by the reduction of stabilization of the austenite phase. In addition, among interstitial atoms that are spun off under neutron irradiation, Ni, P, and Si, which have a smaller ion radius than Fe, begin selective diffusion. A phenomenon called radiation-induced segregation (RIS), where the concentration and depletion of specific elements occur, has been confirmed with STEM. It has been found, however, that the P amount of grain boundary segregation, and SCC fracture phase factor are not closely related. Figure III-14 illustrates the different effects of temperature on the high-temperature sensitization of M[.sup]23[/]C[.sub]6[/] separation, low-temperature sensitization (both by evaluation of latent periods for sensitization based on Straus's test) by distorted aging, and the EPR test results for a heavily irradiated material. The activation energy of the former two is equivalent to the body diffusion of Cr, but the activation energy of the latter indicates a low value equivalent to the diffusion of interstitial atoms (Cr, etc.) of a radiation-induced Frenkel defect. This suggests that segregation and depletion occur easily on a supersaturated specific surface because of the reduced stability of the austenite phase, even at low temperatures, as long as it is being irradiated. Much of the rapture surface of irradiated SUS 316 steel after the SSTT test presents a mixed crack mode consisting mainly of TGSCC on the low-temperature side. The IGSCC rapture factor as an IASCC index as well as the temperature increases, but there is a lack of a corresponding relationship with rapture life time. Concerning the evaluation of IASCC sensitivity for heavily irradiated materials, the corrosion potential and the transformation mode are important factors, as illustrated in Figure III-9, and a system to implement a detailed comprehensive examination has been developed. This includes the development of ultramicro analysis technology for metal structures, and for constituent segregation, using evaluation test methods and FEM, which has a high level of space resolution. [2] Examination of Methods To Improve IASCC Resistance It is hard to produce He brittleness on stainless steel with heavy doses of radiation at mid- and low-temperature. Therefore, we have improved the stability of the austenite phase by adjusting the Fe/Ni ratio, and by reducing electronic hole density. At the same time, we have examined methods designed to reduce the supersaturation level of impurities to cause RIS at the same time. Since the comprehensive properties of stainless steel are optimized when its composition is about 35 percent Ni, we have developed 35 Ni-18 Cr-25 Mo steel with a purified grain boundary, and reinforced microgranulation. In doing so, we introduced purification by the electronic beam production method, as well as a distorted aging technique called SAR, and thermal processing of recrystallization at middle and low temperatures. Compared to the conventional steel, our newly developed steel displayed a high level of void swelling resistance, and a high level of heat flux resistance, without reducing low-temperature sensitivity or ductility at middle and low temperatures. 3. Development of Materials Database (1) Significance of Database for Nuclear Materials As described in Part 1, nuclear development is facing a number of problems that cannot be solved by the application of conventional materials technology. Thus we anticipate the development of new materials that will break through the limits of existing materials, together with corresponding application technologies. In the past, the research and development of nuclear materials in Japan was primarily aimed at meeting minimum requirements for individual projects. Therefore, research programs and the establishment of databases relied on the initiative of individual organizations, and were not centralized. Because of the lack of systematic development in such projects, they had only a limited impact on the industry. The revision for FY 1987 of the "Long-Term Plan for Nuclear Development and Use" by the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan urged the prompt development of a comprehensive database as the crucial item for basic research on nuclear materials. First, individual research organizations were to develop a database for their area of specialization, and then link them to share intellectual properties, and to promote activities to facilitate the effective use of such data. In the next section, we will present an outline of the JAERI Material Performance Database (JMPD), a comprehensive nuclear materials database being developed by JAERI to aid in the development of materials for nuclear reactors and facilities, together with the characteristics needed for behavior evaluation, structure design, and safety evaluation. (2) JAERI Material Performance Database As illustrated in Figure III-15, the JMPD is based on a general-purpose database management system (DBMS) for large computers for storage and search. In addition to this core section, it includes a data input and output section, and a section for network development. The information to be included in the database include data needed for materials design, such as radiation-resistant materials, materials to limit induced radioactivity, and chemically resistant materials; data needed to ensure the safety and durability of the equipment and structures introduced in the previous section; and data for evaluating the production and performance of new materials, such as ceramics and compound materials. There is a problem in that it is difficult to determine an appropriate data structure, since new and important data are continuously being generated, and the significance of data items can change radically in some cases. Therefore, a relational database has been selected for the DBMS in view of the need for a flexible data structure, and for ease of data renewal. Information that cannot be described in the current data structure, but that is likely to become important in future can be included in the section for remarks. Considering the characteristics of the base data for nuclear materials, a data structure capable of uniformly describing data items related to radiation, and the nuclear-specific chemical environment has been selected. As for data output, because flexibility of the retrieval system is the most significant factor, a program with the following features has been developed internally: [1] it can be operated freely without a special knowledge of computers, [2] retrieval can be made without referring to the design document for data structure, and [3] the relative importance of data items can be alternated easily to follow the results of development of research. Figure III-16 provides a comparison of retrieval processes based on (1) ordinary SQL commands, and (2) the internally developed program, to indicate the performance of the newly developed retrieval program. It confirms that the method developed in the current program makes it easier for ordinary materials researchers to conduct a data search. User friendliness has been improved by the development of a unit conversion function, a data listing function, a retrieved data storage function, an interconnection (with different computers) function, and an on-line help function. Data for about 7,000 test pieces drawn primarily from materials research at JAERI have already been stored in the JMPD, and have been used for analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, concerning the networking of materials data, although it is not introduced here, development of a prototype system for a distributed data network for materials called the "data freeway" is in progress. Eventually, it will link the Tokai Research Establishment of JAERI, the Tsukuba Branch of the National Research Institute for Metals, and the Oarai Engineering Center of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation.
