FBIS4-67194 "jptdd021__l94047" JPRS-TDD-94-021-L JPRS Narcotics 13 May 1994 EAST ASIA THAILAND Controversy Over Drug Charges Against Parliamentarian Controversy Over Drug Charges Against Parliamentarian Continue Chuan Rules Out Extradition BK1305024394 Bangkok THE NATION in English 13 May 94 pp A1, A3 BK1305024394 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out the extradition of Thanong Siriprichaphong to the United States, where he is wanted on drugs charges. Chuan said the police or the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) can take legal action against the Chat Thai MP in Thailand if they have sufficient evidence from the United States. Chuan insisted that any action against Thanong, who has been accused by the U.S. of conspiring to smuggle more than 45 tones of marijuana into the United States, should be in a Thai court rather than overseas. A U.S. indictment, revealed on Tuesday, charges Thanong with smuggling, conspiracy and operating a continuing criminal enterprise between 1973 and 1987. The U.S. Justice Department announced early this week that it will seek Thanong's extradition under a treaty with Thailand. But Thai officials insisted the treaty did not oblige extradition of Thais to the U.S. and vice versa. "If police or the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) have enough evidence, they can take legal action against Thanong," Chuan said. "They can request evidence from the U.S.." Chuan said investigators must have sufficient evidence before taking criminal cases into court. "The government's duty is to ensure justice prevails in our society. Any allegations against Thais should be tried in a Thai court," he said. The government was also willing to comply with a Chat Thai request to provide a party fact-finding committee with all information relating to the charges against Thanong. Other senior government MPs yesterday were also insisting that any action against Thanong should be in Thailand. Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said: "We will never send Thai people to stand trial in a foreign country. We will take legal action against a culprit according to evidence we have and under Thai law." He said the Foreign Ministry was in contact with the U.S. authorities and was seeking more details of the evidence against Thanong. Aphisit believed Chat Thai's fact-finding committee would be neutral and take action against Thanong according to the evidence placed before it. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, who oversees the ONCB, said the agency had a policy of cooperating fully with the U.S. in tracking down drug trafficking activities. It would not protect Thanong if there was evidence against him. Amnuai would not commit himself on the issue of Thanong's extradition to the U.S. but said Thailand had a discretionary right to prosecute its own citizens. Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said Thanong would be immediately prosecuted in Thailand if police had sufficient evidence. "Police are waiting for more evidence from the U.S. "If they get enough evidence to substantiate the charges against Thanong, the prosecution will proceed," he said. Parliament President Marut Bunnak said that in practice Thailand would not allow the extradition of its citizens to stand trial in a foreign country. The U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, has offered to help make possible a visit to the United States by Thanong. The embassy also announced that it "is working closely with the (Thai) Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issue, and is providing a complete text of the indictment to the ministry". Thanong has denied the U.S. charges and announced his willingness to travel to the US, if necessary, to defend himself.
