Bureaucrats To Be Banned From Taking Bribes"] [Text] Nightmares that haunted Chekhov's protagonists will apparently soon be understandable for current Russian bureaucrats. In accordance with the draft Law on the Civil Service in the Russian Federation, which has been drawn up by the working group of the State Duma committee on judicial and legal reform, examinations and assessments of qualifications will be regularly conducted in the civil service. The draft law proposes that the obscure titles of the old Russian Table of Ranks, such as "collegiate assessor" or "titular counselor," be replaced with less spectacular "counselor" and "consultant." The draft's authors have also rejected the trappings that had formerly added luster to this occupation, such as a civil uniform and strict rules of address: there will be no Your Honors or simply Your Excellencies. The draft calls for civil servants to be divided into politicians and administrators. The politicians, as is the case now, will be elected, and the administrators will be appointed via competition. According to the new table of ranks, each administrative official will know his place. For them, a number of grades have been established: top, chief, leading, senior, and junior officials. In order to begin a climb up the career ladder and to become a junior official, one needs to have at least secondary professional education. It is expected that all top and chief officials in Russia must have a degree. All civil servants will have special titles conferred on them. For starters, a civil service consultant; then a civil service counselor; simply a counselor; and a state counselor. A career can be crowned with the title of full state counselor first class. All titles will have the same number of classes -- from one to three. The transfer from one rung to another will entail an increase in one's salary by at least 70 percent. For the sake of all that a civil servant will have to sacrifice a whole range of rights enjoyed by other citizens. Bureaucrats may not engage in entrepreneurial activity. No presents, no bribes (referred to in the draft as "financial rewards") or other "bones thrown to them" -- even upon retirement. Civil servants will be banned from calling strikes and accepting foreign orders without the president's permission. In order for a civil servant better to realize his responsibility, he will swear an oath when entering the civil service.
