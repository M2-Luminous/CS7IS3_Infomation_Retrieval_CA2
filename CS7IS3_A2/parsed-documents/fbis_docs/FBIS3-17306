At a Wednesday meeting with the press he said that everywhere peace-keepers are subordinate directly to the national Armed Forces. He stressed that the new ministry does not have any combat weapons at its disposal. "Even when it carries out its missions it rents ships, aviation and armored vehicles from the Armed Forces and pays for their use", he said. In Grachev's opinion the Ministry for Emergencies has no experience in commanding peace-keeping forces. He said that the purpose of the ministry is to resolve domestic problems: deal with the consequences of air crashes, accidents on railways or power stations etc. "Peace-keeping tasks lie beyond the territory of the Russian Federation", he stressed. At a news conference on March 17 the Minister for Emergencies Sergey Shoygu spoke in favor of subordinating the Russian peace-keeping force to his ministry. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev expressed the opinion that the Federal Assembly will pass a law on the peace-keeping force after the April 20th. He told journalists that the status of units of the Russian Armed Forces performing peace-keeping functions has not been defined yet. Answering a question from Interfax Grachev expressed the hope that the defense budget would be increased in 1994. He stressed that legislators are also responsible for the security of the state. According to Grachev, the budget proposed by the cabinet will not allow his ministry to continue reforming the Army. He said the money will not be enough to purchase the necessary weapons and machinery. "With such a budget I will not be able to build strong Armed Forces," Pavel Grachev said.
