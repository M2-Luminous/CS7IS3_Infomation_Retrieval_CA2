Three days of debate by the Security Council raised many questions, and the Security Council refrained, for the first time, from issuing its traditional statement on extending the blockade. Instead, it just satisfied itself with a shy extension of the unjust embargo on Iraq. Replies can be provided for these questions to clarify matters regarding what happened and what is expected to happen. The first reply is that the international community has begun to understand that the continuation of the blockade is unjustified, that insistence on it has become meaningless and has made the security Council a subject of accusations, and that the insistence of the United States and its British satellite is illogic because it seeks to achieve wicked goals that have nothing to do with legitimacy or international law. The second reply is that Iraq has been using its goodwill in handling the premeditated resolutions that have bad goals and that it has met its obligations in accordance with Security Council wishes and mechanism, the latest of which is its approval of the permanent weapons monitoring. But the Security Council has not met its obligations, its position is viewed as ill-intentioned and indifferent, and it has resorted to procrastination and the take- and-demand formula without offering Iraq any of its rights. This has awaken several Security Council member states, since the unjustified extension of the blockade is not a plaything as it means a continued war of annihilation against a nation that fights, suffers, and is hurt every day. The third reply is related to international changes that show a refusal to endorse U.S. decisions and dictates. The international community has begun to reject and criticize the U.S. Administration and its policies, and even U.S. political circles follow suit. This has encouraged many states to behave as they wish and in light of their interests and policies and not in the American way. An example of this is the Japan's rejection of the U.S. economic trusteeship, as well as Russia's firm stand on its espionage crisis with Washington. These replies, as well as the firmness, the patience, and the steadfastness Iraq has demonstrated over the past years in its conflict with the tyrant, explain to us the reasons for the current absence of consensus on U.S. options. Therefore, the first signs of the dissolution of the anti-Iraq alliance mobilized by the United States have begun to emerge. What took place in the Security Council means that the future is in favor of Iraq, and that the key to the solution is approaching to the gate of the blockade to open it and to end the ugliest crime in history. This is because the current situation is being shaped by the will of a growing majority opposed to the will of an isolated minority that lacks the weapon of logic. Iraq's strong will and its clear and bold demand for its rights will certainly decide the issue and will enable Iraq to have the final say in the future of the blockade. Pending that historic moment, we, the Iraqis, have to be patient and to remain highly vigilant.
