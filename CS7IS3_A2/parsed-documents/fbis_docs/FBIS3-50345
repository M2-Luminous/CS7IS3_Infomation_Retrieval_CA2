In open talks, they exchanged views regarding the improvement of bilateral relations between Serbia, i.e. the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Hungary, and also issues of importance for stability in the region. Both sides concluded that they were interested in the development of good-neighborly relations based on the observance of equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in internal affairs. Special emphasis was placed on economic relations between the two countries for which conditions exist. It was stressed that economic sanctions against Serbia, i.e. the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, have been inflicting damage on the economies of both countries and that it was in their mutual interest that they be abolished as soon as possible. Serbia attaches great importance to the potential for economic cooperation with Hungary, particularly in the sphere of energy, traffic, trade, and tourism. The Danube, as the largest European waterway, which links Serbia and Hungary and also other countries of the Danube region, represents an important economic advantage for both countries. In addition, as regards the overall development of traffic, it is important to construct a fast rail line from Belgrade to the Hungarian border, and also a modern Belgrade-Subotica highway that will enable the extension of more efficient economic links between partners in both countries. It was also pointed out that the Hungarian and Serbian national minorities in the two countries objectively strengthened their interest in maintaining stable interstate relations and building mutual trust. It was emphasized that members of the Hungarian national minority in Serbia enjoyed all the rights guaranteed by the Serbian Constitution, in conformity with the highest standards prescribed by the CSCE documents and international law. The two men also discussed efforts to wind up the peace process for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bearing in mind that the Republic of Serbia had made a great contribution in this respect, and that the Serb side had fulfilled its share of responsibilities stemming from the agreement reached with the European Union, hope was expressed that the international community would abandon its one-sided approach to the Yugoslav crisis and lift the economic sanctions. This means that Hungary, a neighboring country, should adopt an objective stance in line with its latest views on this subject, which would facilitate the surmounting of open questions and have a positive impact on the development of bilateral relations. The meeting was also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, Serbian Assembly deputy [and leader of Vojvodina Hungarians] Andras Agoston, and others.
