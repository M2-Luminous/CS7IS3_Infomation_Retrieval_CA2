Both government and ANC spokesman indicated on Wednesday that they regarded the choice of a single ballot as a practical choice and not an issue of principle. On Tuesday the furore over the issue was joined by Anglo American Corporation Chairman Julian Ogilvie-Thompson and the South African Chamber of Business, both of whom warned that continued ANC and government intransigence on the issue could endanger the April election. ANC President Nelson Mandela and senior ANC negotiators have said the ballot issue was not negotiable. ANC spokeswoman Gill Marcus said on Wednesday that the ANC's preference for a single ballot was not based on considerations of principle. She said the ANC would prefer a double ballot under ideal circumstances. However, a double ballot could create practical problems, not the least of which were widespread voter confusion. "We would ideally like a double ballot. It is not a matter of principle. If you can address the practical problems we would be prepared to support it," Ms Marcus said. She stressed, however, that this was not a comment on specific discussions taking place but rather an outlook on the question in general. A government spokesman said government did also not regard its preference for a single ballot as a matter of principle. "Government is pragmatic on this issue and we are willing to discuss it." A Freedom Alliance source said while the ANC's conceding to a double ballot would greatly improve relations between the alliance and the ANC, it would not necessarily be sufficient to bring the alliance into the constitutional process. He said the Inkatha Freedom Party was the major force behind alliance demands for a double ballot. The ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) met on Tuesday to discuss an alliance package of proposals placed before it at talks on Monday night. The package was substantially the same as the package of December last year which included proposed changes to the interim constitution as well as a concession on the ballot issue. The NEC's response would be conveyed to the government and the alliance at their meeting on Thursday.
