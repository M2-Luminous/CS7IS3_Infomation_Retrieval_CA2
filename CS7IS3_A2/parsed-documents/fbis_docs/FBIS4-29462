There are big reactions from China," the prime minister said: "What explanation? Does one have to give an explanation on such a trivial matter? Talk about capability... I heard a long time ago that even a Tokyo University student can make them." He thus insisted that there are no problems with the remarks he has made, and said he is not thinking about offering any explanation. The prime minister said emphatically, "To begin with, we have never even imagined going to war with nuclear arms. Shall I call them stupid objects? As a politician, I have never once thought about possessing them (nuclear arms). We can do without such undesirable things. I will faithfully work toward completing the abolition of nuclear arms."
