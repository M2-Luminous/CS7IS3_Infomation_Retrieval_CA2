SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests.

The Director of the Information Resources Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior to submission of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following: (1) Type of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection; (4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract. OMB invites public comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Cary Green at the address specified above. Dated: February 24, 1994. Cary Green, Director, Information Resources Management Service. Office of Postsecondary Education Type of Review: Revision Title: Campus-Based Reallocation Form Frequency: Annually Affected Public: State or local governments; Businesses and other for-profit; Non-profit institutions Reporting Burden: Responses: 2,000 Burden Hours: 608 Recordkeeping Burden: Recordkeepers: 2,000 Burden Hours: 100 Abstract: This form will allow institutions of postsecondary education to report anticipated 1993&hyph;94 unspent funds for the campus-based programs so these unspent funds can be distributed as supplemental 1994&hyph;95 awards and to report the 1993&hyph;94 (FWS) Community Service Activities. Failure to collect this information would prevent the maximum utilization of the funds appropriated, deprive needy students of financial aid, and result in ED's non-compliance with the reallocation provisions of the HEA.
