Referring to the Albanian diaspora census of 1993, some 120,000 Albanians are in Germany, 95,000 in Switzerland, 35,000 in Sweden, 35,000 in Austria, 8,000 in Belgium, 5,000 in France, and the same number in Denmark, 4,000 in Italy, 3,500 in Norway, 2,500 in England, 2,000 in Netherlands, 40,000 in Croatia, and 15,000 in Slovenia. According to the newspaper, some 25,000 Kosovars are living in Albania. There are not exact data about the number of the Kosovars living in Turkey, Macedonia, the Czech and the Slovak Republics. The reasons for this Albanian emigration are the Serb repression, the forceful called up of the Albanians in Serbian-Montenegrin Army, the economic poverty, and the insecurity of the life in Kosova.
