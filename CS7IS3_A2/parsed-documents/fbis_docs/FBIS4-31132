Ozren in northeastern Bosnia, Bosnian Serb sources have told TANJUG. The Bosnian Serb humanitarian aid organisation has apprised the International Committee of the Red cross (I.C.R.C.) office in Bijeljina about the planned execution of the Serbs captured on Mt. Ozren, and appealed to the I.C.R.C. officials to take the necessary steps to save the captives' lives. In a letter to the I.C.R.C. office, the Serb humanitarian organisation says that Moslem extremists have brutally murdered and then mutilated the bodies of large numbers of captured Serbs in the course of this war, especially in the areas of Fakovici, Kamenica, Kravica near Milic, Brcko and elsewhere in eastern Bosnia. In mid-1992, Moslem troops stormed and torched 43 Serb villages in eastern Bosnia, massacring 960 Serb civilians, mostly old men, women and children. Serbs who have fled Tuzla with Croat help for Serb-controlled territories testify that the position of their ethnic kin in Tuzla is worsening, with the town's Moslem authorities evicting them from their homes and taking them away in an unknown direction. In fear of their lives, Serbs in Tuzla are taking shelter with Croat families in the area, witnesses say.
