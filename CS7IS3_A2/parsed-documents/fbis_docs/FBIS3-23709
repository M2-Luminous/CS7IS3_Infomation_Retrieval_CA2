Yesterday the bank received the Edict of the President of Russia "On Issues Regarding the Activities of the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Relations," in keeping with which it officially becomes a state financial institution specializing exclusively in servicing the foreign debt and assets of the former USSR (and in the future, of Russia as well), as well as government credit lines. Actually, these are precisely the functions Vneshekonombank continued to carry out during the two-year period since its de facto bankruptcy. Let us recall that the activities of the Vneshekonombank (VEB) over the past two years were conducted on the basis of a decree of the Russian Supreme Soviet Presidium dated 13 January 1992. In keeping with this decree, the charter, reserve, and other funds, buildings, and other property were transferred to the Central Bank, while the bank's current operations were conducted by the Operational Management Committee. The president's latest edict envisages transferring the aforementioned funds and other property to Vneshekonombank's full economic disposal, while the committee is to be liquidated. The bank is headed by a chairman appointed for three years by presidential edict, while it is managed collectively by the board of directors (two deputy chairmen and six members of the council); appointments to the board were approved by the Government of Russia on 24 January. According to VEB's acting chairman Anatoliy Nosko, separating the handling of state functions from purely commercial operations is an absolutely necessary measure. Otherwise, there is a great probability of the situation that occurred in the bank in December 1991 developing. Therefore, over the past few years such functions of the bank as servicing legal and physical entities, trade operations clearing, and other area of activities typical of a regular commercial bank have been dropped. At the same time, its subsidiaries and branches abroad have been transferred to the Vneshekonombank of Russia. Thus, the bank currently will concentrate on carrying out five basic functions. First and foremost, servicing Russia's foreign debt (including that of the former USSR), as well as clearing and control operations related to the government's centralized credits and financial guarantees. Equally important functions that remain the responsibility of the bank are servicing the bonds of the domestic hard currency bond issue, repayment of debt to private individuals, and conducting in-house trading operations. The Vneshekonombank leadership has prepared a memorandum for the government on the bank's conversion to joint-stock holding. Its stockholders will be the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the State Committee for the Administration of State Property. A corresponding agreement has already been reached, and after the final coordination of positions the government is expected to approve the proposed draft. It is envisaged that approximately in a month the stockholders will approve the bank's new charter and determine their shares in the charter capital. It will amount to a total of 30 billion rubles [R]. Taking into account that Vneshekonombank's charter capital is R26 billion, practically no budget money will be required to bring it to the required total.
