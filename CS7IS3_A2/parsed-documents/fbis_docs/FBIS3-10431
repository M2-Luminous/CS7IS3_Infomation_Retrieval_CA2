"El Chacal," by unidentified Radio Corporacion reporters; in (Caulatu), northern Jinotega; date not given; monitored in progress -- recorded] [Text] [Talavera] ...That is part of the government's not honoring its word, and that is why it is now confronting so many problems, like the demands being made by the peasants in Managua. That is why we do not trust the government to keep its word, and why we feel tomorrow, the government might decide not to honor its commitments. You could say we are on the alert. We are keeping a watchful eye on the government to see if it will follow through with its promises. As I said before, in previous years the government has not kept a significant number of agreements with us. I could even say it has not honored even a small part of the agreements that were very important to the Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] movement at the time when it was armed. The RN movement continues to be an organization with a very ample social base, which, by the way, is still quite significant. [Unidentified reporter] What about the call (Jimmy Leo), president of the RN High Council, made to the 3-80 Northern Front through several Managua radio stations; a call for an end to the negotiations agenda with the government, while problems such as land distribution, ownership titles, and hunger strikes are still unsolved? [Talavera] With respect to statements made by the RN High Council president or vice president, we completely support them as part of the resistance. We also feel a certain degree of solidarity with all the commando units that support the peasants who are participating in a hunger strike. A very just cause is what has forced them to adopt this hunger strike decision because the government has not honored its obligations. We have a responsibility toward them, and we want to say that from the moment they decided to go on a hunger strike, we, in turn, decided to pressure the government to keep its word. [Reporter] Will that in any way interfere with negotiations already carried out with respect to an initial demobilization? [Talavera] Since we consider ourselves responsible people, there might not be a need to interrupt negotiations, but if we have opportunities, like tomorrow at 1000 hours, when we are scheduled to meet face to face with government representatives, we will call attention to the plight of those Managua peasants. [Reporter] What is your opinion of the decision by "El Charro" and "Northiel" not to demobilize? [Talavera] We have received information indicating that there has been some contact between mediating organizations, such as Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo's commission, the CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support and Verification-OAS], and an exchange of letters. I believe it would be premature to talk about whether or not they will decide to demobilize. If I decided to comment on this issue, I would most likely be speculating. They are also fighting, however, for the same things we are, and we expect there will be a satisfactory solution to the problems. In all reality, Nicaragua's problems have not been solved, and the government has complicated things even more by not honoring its obligations. [Unidentified reporter] This morning's BARRICADA newspaper ... [Talavera, interrupting] What's that? [Reporter] This morning's BARRICADA newspaper reported that the 3-80 Northern Front had sold its Redeye missiles to drug traffickers. The report also pointed out that the missiles had been sold for $25,000 each. What can you say about this? [Talavera] All I can say about the alleged sale of Redeye missiles by the 3-80 Northern Front is that the person who wrote the report is very irresponsible. The author reveals information in a very malicious manner and attempts to manipulate Nicaraguan public opinion and portray us as worthless people. Maybe he is worthless and that is why he wrote that report. All I can say is we have never associated with drug traffickers or become involved in any other type of corruption. [Reporter] You still have the missiles under your control? [Talavera] Of course. We still have a significant amount of weapons under our control. The demobilization process involves at least 100 or more men ... [Reporter, interrupting] Do you plan to turn over the Redeye missiles once the demobilization process is over? [Talavera] So far, we are in a negotiation phase. We have initiated negotiations the same way as we have initiated negotiations with respect to demobilization. Tomorrow we have another meeting scheduled with the government. It follows a process. [Reporter] Jose Angel, what words do you people use to talk to the government about the RN's general problem, whether it is poverty, desertion, etc.? According to the 3-80 Northern Front, how many men participate in RN activities? [Talavera] Nearly 30,000 active military men are involved in RN activities. Also, hundreds of thousands are involved in the social problem. Our biggest problem is that peasants, who make up the RN's rank and file, are one of the most seriously ignored sectors. [Reporter] In addition to the information reporter Alvaro Cruz read to you, we have also heard that you have been getting support from Honduras. Some newspapers have hinted that the RN has received aid from Honduran military men. What can you say about this? [Talavera] Those reports are groundless. Their only grounds is speculation. We have never been supported by any government. Our struggle has been 100 percent nationalist and supported by the Nicaraguan people. [Reporter] Commander Chacal, will some of the demobilized RN commanders participate in the training classes to be held at the Walter Mendoza police academy? [Talavera] Only line officers from the first demobilization will attend the course at the Managua Police Academy. The rest of the officers, who will work in the country's northern municipalities, have yet to participate in the course. [Reporter] Commander Chacal, when will the RN's main body be incorporated into the RN Party? [Talavera] RN is united as an organization. We are keenly interested in consolidating a party that can represent and be the political arm of the peasants, workers, and students. We must say the organization has been growing steadily. We want to be incorporated into the RN party as soon as possible. I believe only details remain to be worked out and that all RN sectors want to form a single party, a political arm to coalesce all of the RN members as well as the rank and file. [Reporter] Has the 3-80 Northern Front been assigned any responsibility in the RN High Council? I understand that you have talked to the High Council. [Talavera] We have not met with the RN High Council, but we want to belong to it so we can be more active and be heard. As soon as we lay down our arms, our struggle becomes a civic one. [Reporter] Commander Chacal, how do you explain the RN party's failure in the Atlantic Coast elections, where the RN did not win a single seat? [Talavera] I do not know what really happened at the Atlantic Coast elections because we were busy with other problems. We were confronting a military offensive. I do not think the RN's failure to win even one seat represents much. I think, however, that this is due to a scarcity of available resources and a lack of publicity. We do enjoy broad support in the Atlantic Coast. Of this I am sure. [Reporter] Commander, what are your comments on criticism from exiled Nicaraguans in Miami who say that the fact that the 3-80 Northern Front has agreed to demobilize is treason to the RN. [Talavera] The people who have expressed that opinion are totally removed from the real situation here in Nicaragua. I have belonged to the RN for many years. I was brought up in this. I have never felt like I betrayed the RN. Proof of that is the fact that I have the support of all the peasants in northern Nicaragua and of the leaders who are in command. We do not feel we have turned our backs on these peasants. On the contrary, I would say this is being looked at from another point of view. There are some people who like to talk, and those who talk the most are the ones who do the least. That is the situation. The people who made those comments had no bases for doing so. The reality here is totally different. It is not the same to live in Miami and to see war on television as to face the enemy not knowing where to obtain resources, secure logistics, ammunition, and other type of war materiel. What does one do with the wounded, the dead, and the grieving? What will be done with the war disabled? What will be done about a number of consequences brought on by war? I regard the type of information given by certain gentlemen in Miami as totally irresponsible. We have very solid social foundations, we have good friends, but there are those who always like to find fault. There are some bad Nicaraguans who are always on the lookout. They are always trying to criticize, but their criticism is totally destructive. The reality here in Nicaragua is totally different. [Reporter] The matter of Northiel [Wilfredo Gutierrez or Wilfredo Chavarria], Charro, and other members of the 3-80 Northern Front is still pending. What is the position of these cells or groups led by specific commanders regarding the demobilization plans or negotiations with the government? [Talavera] In the case of Commanders [name indistinct], Charro, and Northiel, I think the negotiations will have to be held directly with them. The 3-80 Northern Front is negotiating independently. We believe that the commanders who lead those troops will negotiate directly with the government. [Reporter] Commander Chacal, could you give us the names of those who make up the 3-80 Northern Front general staff? [Talavera] There is a board of commanders. Commander Piloto, Commander Carlos, Commander Chacalin [Salvador Talavera "Esteban"], Commander Gringo, Commander Musun, and Commander Martin are some of them. There are several other commanders whom I do not....[pauses] There is Commander Magnum. [Reporter] Tell me something, are the troops or groups led by Northiel or Carlos part of the 3-80 Northern Front? [Talavera] We consider them brothers as we are struggling for the same cause, but the 3-80 Northern Front is totally independent from those commanders. [Reporter] Commander Chacal, excuse me if I insist, but do you really have a great deal of faith that the government will meet the agreements signed? [Talavera] We have hope, as I said before, and we also have faith. The fact of the matter is that we have our apprehensions. On previous occasions the government has not met its commitments, but we hope that this time they will not repeat the same actions or that they will not fall into the vicious circle of making promises that they don't keep. [Reporter] Commander Chacal, what can you tell us about the work in the labor unions carried out by the RN Superior Council in Managua. [Talavera] It has been very well done. Any organization that seeks to unite the RN has my blessing. I congratulate the commanders who have shown interest in the RN going down one road under one leadership. I congratulate the general command and the supporters who participated. Many of them in the party and in the RN Supreme Council are actively participating to unite the entire RN organization. [Reporter] It would be interesting to know the scope of the demobilization plan, because the government always claims it lacks the funds needed to cover demobilization expenses. How much money will be required to implement the plan? [Talavera] That is true. The government always claims it lacks funds for this purpose, although it has funds for other activities. In reality, the needs and demands of peasants in this area are very high. Our goals, however, are beyond the government's promises and agreements. We have created commissions to request international aid to lessen the government's burden and to help peasants join the nation's social and productive life. [Reporter] Does that mean the government will have to resort to credits from banks and to money that is not readily available or that is obtained at a high cost? If you request international aid, what will be the state's contribution? [Talavera] We are not talking about specific amounts yet. We do know that there are many social demands, that the peasants need assistance and financial aid. The government has many responsibilities toward peasants that it has not accepted. We cannot give exact amounts. We are not saying the government should give them handouts but that they should reincorporate them into society and find ways to help peasants in the northern region who have been totally neglected in the past years. [Reporter] What will happen if the government does not comply? [Talavera] We are always ready to continue our struggle. We will continue our efforts and present our demands. We will resort to all civic and peaceful means to demand full compliance with the agreements. Based on our experience, I know there will always be problems, but we do hope we will not have to pressure the government to ensure its total compliance. The negotiations have just begun. It is a process, and we hope this time the government will act in good faith. [Reporter] Commander Chacal, what was the purpose of Esteban's visit to Managua this weekend? [Talavera] Esteban visited Managua for several reasons. First he had to go to the police academy to receive a group of demobilized 3-80 Northern Front members who are participating in an intensive course before going to the municipalities where they will be stationed. He also had to coordinate future meetings with the central government, which I believe will be headed by Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta. Those were the main reasons for his visit, to receive the group of former combatants in Managua and to create a direct channel between the Government Ministry and the 3-80 Northern Front to avoid future obstacles that could delay the negotiation process. [Reporter] There is an interesting factor. The second chief of staff, who I believe is Javier Carrion, has held talks with the 3-80 Northern Front High Command. Do you feel you can trust this top EPS [Sandinist People's Army] officer? We have heard peasants say that there is still espionage and persecution. Do you think you can trust him as member of the Army since he was the one who talked to you? [Talavera] We must accept certain things. We must talk with the people who have power in Nicaragua. Those who have the weapons are the ones who run the country. The Army has the weapons and is involved in the struggle. The government sent its representatives, and Colonel Carrion was one of them. We participated in direct talks at the negotiating table. We must admit, however, that we have our misgivings. Security was one of the key points discussed at the meeting. We know full well that our lives are in serious danger once we demobilize. Therefore, one of the most critical topics we discussed at the meeting, which was suspended on several occasions, was security. We are afraid that once we demobilize we could face direct persecution or be killed. The hundreds of commanders who have been killed are proof of that. We must act maturely in these negotiations to prevent persecution or attacks in the future. We had to make this clear. One of the agreements reached to give security to our troops was their admission into the National Police. [Reporter] What does that agreement entail? To what extent would the police serve as a guarantee for the security of the RN's 3-80 Northern Front? [Talavera] Most of those demobilized in the northern area are former RN members. All 3-80 Northern Front fighters live in this area and were born and raised here. After speaking to them, they confirm that they intend to continue living here. Therefore, this would help them a great deal, and they would feel more confident as it would remove the tensions thanks to the constant contact with their own people and organizations in their own backyard. It is only logical. That does not mean we do not feel at ease with Nicaraguans from other parts of the country. It is really a reflection of the military problem, the military conflict, which since last decade has been bloodier in this area than anywhere else.
