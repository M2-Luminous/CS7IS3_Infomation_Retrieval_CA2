The meeting is being chaired by Division General Ramon Espinoza Martin, Chief of the Eastern Army. The council analyzed a broad agenda, which in addition to several defense preparation aspects, included other subjects such as the fight against crime and the increase in food production. Several council members and the first secretaries of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] of the six provinces that comprise the territory defended by the Army are also participating in the meeting. They are Politburo members Esteban Lazo and Julian Rizo who are also first secretaries in Santiago de Cuba and Camaguey, respectively; Juan Carlos Robinson from Guantanamo, Alfredo Enriquez Pina from Granma, Francisco Garcia Ferrer from Holguin, and Julian Lopez from Las Tunas, all members of the PCC Central Committee. The report by Army chief of staff, Brigade General Urbelino Betancourt, conveyed the satisfactory fighting capacity of the forces deployed to this extensive territory, which is demonstrated by the successful fulfillment of the FAR's main objectives. The preparation of the commanders, officers, and soldiers of the territorial troops militia, both from the regular forces and the reserves, as well as the production and defense brigades, was considered good. This evaluation applies to the operational and tactical levels -- to shooting ability, physical fitness, and their Marxist-Leninist education, following the example of Marti. The refurbishing of the military theater of operations has progressed considerably over the past year, surpassing all plans, including the most important engineering works and the defense tunnels. The work carried out in Santiago de Cuba, which surpassed the annual plan by 85 percent, has also been emphasized. This plan also seeks to achieve full protection for the heroic town, the country's second most important town. Holguin and Camaguey Provinces also shine in the work they accomplished. The plan to maintain weapons in good condition, that is, the plan for the preservation, diagnosis, prophylaxis, mobilization, and loading tests of the fighting instruments demanded a tremendous effort, which is reflected in the following figures: over 4,600,000 pieces of equipment, from heavy 36-ton tanks to antigas masks, were tested. The experience accrued by the Army in this type of work is now being transferred to civilian organizations that have great quantities of unused equipment, such as Micons [Construction Ministry], the Agriculture Ministry, and Minaz [Sugar Industry Ministry] following the recent guidelines of the party's second secretary on the importance of maintaining and preserving the tremendous amount of capital invested by the country, equipment which is today not used, but which can be essential tomorrow, to the extent that we bail out of this special period. The discipline was also considered satisfactory, having reduced the number of infractions or crimes. Concerning the nutrition program, in 1993 and in the previous year, the Army increased its production of meat, eggs, milk, tubers and vegetables, grain, honey, coffee, and others, by more than 30 percent, reaching a total of 20,000 tons, a figure which surpasses the troops' self-sufficiency needs by 23 percent. This has allowed the Army to hand over more than 5,000 tons of food to the people of the eastern region and to begin a modest assistance plan of food for the officer corps' family groups. Fish production increased 75 percent as compared to 1993. The reforesting program by the Army forces and by the six provinces was surpassed by 21 percent; that is, by 49 million trees. The conclusion reached by the military council is that 1993 was a successful year for defense in the Eastern Army, the 1994 objective of which is to maintain the same level of activities, achieving better results, with the hope of retaining Camilo Cienfuegos' machine gun, a rotating trophy of the FAR, following the Army's example. The trophy is today in the hands of the people of the eastern region. At the closing of this report, the council was assessing other points of the agenda. Also present at the meeting as special guests were Alfredo Jordan, agriculture minister and member of the politburo; Jorge Fernandez Cuervo, the fishing industry minister; Division Gen. Fernandez Gondin, first vice minister of the interior; and Enrique Oltuski, the fishing industry vice minister.
