The study shows that such compounds as d-tubocurarine and phencyclidine inhibit the SP binding but only at sufficiently high concentrations (10[.sup]-4[/] M). Thus, ion exchange HPLC is used to purify _a_-neurotoxins, _k_-bungarotoxins, cytotoxins, and A[.sub]2[/] phospholipases of snake venom. Phospholipases A[.sub]2[/] have the highest ability to inhibit the substance P binding by the rat brain membrane while the remaining toxins are weak inhibitors. The high inhibitory potential of _a_-bungarotoxin discovered earlier is attributed to contamination of commercial preparations with phospholipase A[.sub]2[/]. The high sensitivity of the SP interaction with tachykinin receptors to phospholipases A[.sub]2[/] is especially noteworthy due to the fact that various phospholipases A[.sub]2[/], including brain enzymes, are activated by a number of G-proteins connected to G-protein-dependent receptors. It is speculated that cell phospholipases are capable of specifically interacting with Na[.sup]+[/]- and K[.sup]+[/]-ATPase or annular lipids and serve as an endogenic regulator.
