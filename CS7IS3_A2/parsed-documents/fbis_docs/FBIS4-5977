FBIS4-5977 "dreas074_m_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Thailand Cambodians, Thais Cancel Planned Visits Cambodians, Thais Cancel Planned Visits Hun Sen Cancels Thai Visit BK1804031094 Bangkok THE NATION in English 18 Apr 94 p A5 BK1804031094 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday said the cancellation of the planned trip by Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen had nothing to do with strained relations between the two countries. Surin said the cancellation was not motivated by repeated Phnom Penh charges that Thailand was still supporting the Khmer Rouge. Surin also denied that the cancellation partly stemmed from a fact that Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri had strongly critcized Cambodian leaders who publicly charged that Thailand provided safe haven for the Khmer Rouge fleeing Pailin after the defeat. Cambodia's Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, during a recent visit to Malaysia, charged that Thailand was not sincere in solving the Cambodian internal conflict by still supporting the Khmer Rouge. Prasong said that the Cambodian leader broke a promise which that the two countries would not accuse each other in public. [sentence as published] He also said that Cambodian government failed to produce evidence on the charges. Hun Sen had previously said that he would visit Thailand after April 1 but later cancelled the trip, citing inconvenience. Coinciding with Hun Sen's cancellation Supreme Commander ACM Woranat Aphichari's planned trip to Cambodia next week has also been called off. However, there is no report to confirm that the two cancelled trips are related. Hun Sen and Thai leaders were expected to discuss border security problems. His planned trip came after the Phnom Penh troops seized the Communist faction's major stronghold of Pailin early last month. Surin said the Thai government leaders were now preparing a trip of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to Malaysia. Therefore it would be inconvenient for Hun Sen to visit Bangkok. Surin stressed that Thailand still wanted to foster good relation between the two countries. "We don't want to see fighting and violence in Cambodia. We want to see peace," he said. He also said that he did not want to let the allegations affect future cooperation between Thailand and Cambodia, citing a discovery of natural gas in the Gulf of Thailand off Cambodia in disputed territory.
