The seven-party coalition indicated that the government's budget should show concern for the running of small and mid-sized firms and for stabilizing employment conditions, areas particularly affected by the nation's prolonged recession. The coalition, which also issued a tax reform platform, presented its view on the budget for the fiscal year starting in April, the draft of which will be presented to the government by the Finance Ministry on Thursday. In line with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's emphasis on turning government attention toward improving people's standard of living, the platform calls for rethinking budget priorities and reviewing the long-fixed system of public works projects. The coalition called for measures as soon as possible, in the wake of December's agreement settling the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, for reforming Japanese agriculture, including training to keep younger generations on the farm and revitalizing remote mountain communities. On the international front, the coalition platform calls for increasing the number of diplomats, improving Official Development Assistance and actively addressing such global issues as environmental problems and drug abuse.
