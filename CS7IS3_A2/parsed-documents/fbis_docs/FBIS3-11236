Since 28 March 1982, we Salvadorans have been making great and permanent efforts to establish and develop democracy in our country. We have been successful in our endeavor. We have been able to gradually legitimize the electoral system, which has resulted in governments originating directly from the will of the people. Within that framework of legitimacy, it was possible to promote the process that led to the attainment of peace in our country. Without democracy, peace would have been impossible. Democracy is the work of the people who made great sacrifices for the sake of democracy. Peace, therefore, is also the work of the people who have accepted it as something that belongs to them. We must defend and strengthen it in a process that will lead us to definitive political and economic stability with opportunities of liberty and progress for all. Within that process, Sunday, 20 March is a day of great responsibilities and possibilities. The elections for president and vice president of the Republic, for deputies to the Legislative Assembly, and for municipal councils throughout the country will take place on the same day as the result of a very fortunate concurrence of the electoral calendar as established by the Constitution. It is a day when all elected offices will be renewed. To this we add the significant fact that these elections are the first to be held free of the dark scenario of the war behind us. The electoral system has been improved by the constitutional reforms, which fully guarantee that the elections will be honest and functional, with the vote of each citizen in every part of the country being valuable and secured and contributing to the general will, which is what will decide who should lead the fate of the country from the various posts in the years to come. Thus, this is a great opportunity to continue consolidating our democracy, and that is why it is such an important responsibility to go to the polls to vote. That vote is the only legitimate weapon of citizens who want to build a fatherland with freedom, security, and stability. This Sunday, young people, adults, and the elderly -- women and men -- must go to the polls. With our votes we will decide on the leadership of the next government. We will do it with our votes, not with weapons. We will do it with the force of reason, not with unreasonable force. Nobody should exclude himself from this great task. Abstention is self-exclusion, and nobody wins by it, much less the nation. Dear fellow countrymen; everything is prepared so Sunday's elections will be exemplary. The electoral and security mechanisms are ready to guarantee the honesty and tranquillity of the elections. In addition, the eyes of the world are on these elections, which are taking place within the framework of pacification that has merited the respect and admiration of the international community. In this context, we want to commend the work of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which has efficiently fulfilled its role. The legitimacy of the process and the free expression of Salvadorans is guaranteed. Fellow countrymen; all that remains to be done is for you to go to your polling station next Sunday and freely cast your vote according to your conscience and inclination. Go with your family members, with your children, because an election such as the one to be held on 20 March should be a lesson in civics with mutual respect and joy. Among us we are building the fate of our beloved El Salvador. Do it while thinking of your future and the future of our dear fatherland. Go and vote, as everyone who wants a better country will do. We want a humane, harmonious, and peaceful country. Let us all remember that we are all brothers at the polls for the sake of El Salvador. May God enlighten your decision on 20 March.
