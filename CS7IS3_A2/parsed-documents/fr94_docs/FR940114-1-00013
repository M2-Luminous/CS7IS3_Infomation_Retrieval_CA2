FR940114-1-00013 FR940114-1-00003 For Class Free and Class A States, animal health officials would have to complete the epidemiologic investigation within 15 days after they are notified by the cooperative State-Federal laboratory that brucellosis reactors were found on an MCI test. For Class B and Class C States, the time limit would be 30 days. This time standard for completing the epidemiologic investigation is the same standard required in the current regulations. Experience with brucellosis program operations has shown the time limits to be long enough to be workable for animal health officials, and short enough to support effective controls on the spread of brucellosis. We believe there are circumstances that would constitute acceptable justification for not testing or quarantining a herd following an MCI reactor traceback. The current regulations merely state that herd testing or quarantine will be employed ``[W]hen required by the results of the epidemiologic investigation.'' We would like to provide more specific guidance concerning when it would be justified to forego herd testing or quarantine. We are proposing to require that herd blood tests be conducted or the herd be confined to the premises under quarantine within 30 days after notification that brucellosis reactors were found on the MCI test, unless a designated epidemiologist determines that: 1. The brucellosis reactor is located in a herd in a different State than the State where the MCI blood sample was collected. In such cases a State representative or APHIS representative must give written notice of the MCI test results to the State animal health official in the State where the brucellosis reactor is located; or, 2. Evidence indicates that the brucellosis reactor is from a herd that no longer presents a risk of spreading brucellosis, or is from a herd that is unlikely to be infected with brucellosis. Such evidence could include, but is not limited to, situations where: a. The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that has been sold for slaughter in entirety. In this case, the potential for the herd to spread brucellosis no longer exists. b. The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that is certified brucellosis free and is 100-percent vaccinated. In such cases it is probable that the MCI test was a false positive, due to a titer caused by the vaccine. c. The brucellosis reactor showed a low titer on the MCI test and is traced back to a dairy herd that is 100 percent vaccinated and has tested negative to the most recent brucellosis ring test required by the regulations. This is another case where the probability of a false positive or other error in the MCI test is far greater than the probability that the herd of origin is affected by brucellosis. Animal health officials could report a traceback to a farm of origin in another State as a successfully closed case because we do not expect animal health officials to conduct epidemiologic investigations and herd testing in another State. However, as part of successfully closing the case we would require them to notify in writing the State animal health official in the State where the farm of origin is located so officials in that State could take proper follow-up action. Under this proposal, Class Free and Class A States and areas would need to successfully close at least 95 percent of the MCI reactor cases traced to the farm of origin, and Class B and Class C States and areas would need to successfully close at least 90 percent of such cases. This means that 1 in 20 MCI reactor cases could be left unclosed in Class Free and Class A States, and 1 in 10 reactor cases could be left unclosed in Class B and Class C States. If adopted, this proposal would reduce current recordkeeping requirements for the States. While State officials would still need to compile data, the time involved should be much less than what is currently required for computing the MCI reactor prevalence rate. Under our proposal, States would focus their recordkeeping on a fairly small number of MCI reactors, rather than the much larger number of cattle with negative MCI test results. States would no longer need to count all cattle tested, separate out cattle from other States, and then calculate an MCI reactor prevalence rate based on the number of their State's cattle that were tested and the number of MCI reactors found through such testing. Instead, each State would need to include in its annual report to APHIS the percentage of MCI reactor cases it successfully closes. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this proposed rule: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Only State animal health agencies would be affected by this proposed rule; it would have no effect on the private sector. State animal health officials would need to provide information on only the MCI reactors detected each month instead of total numbers of MCI test cattle slaughtered. They would also need to maintain records of the numbers of MCI reactor cases that are successfully closed and report the percentage of successfully closed cases annually to APHIS. The States are already required to carry out the activities that constitute successful case closure. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) Administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.
