The 30 men, who were caught last Thursday with guerrilla training manuals in their possession, were repatriated under heavy military guard and placed in a high security prison. They had been on their way to Libya, the sources added. Sierra Leonean officials here refused to comment on the reports. The military junta in power since April 1992 has been facing rebel insurgency in southeastern Sierra Leone. After making amnesty offers, it in January declared "total war" against Foday Sankoh's guerrillas.
