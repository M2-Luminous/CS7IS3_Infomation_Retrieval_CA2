One of the men behind the idea of the formation of financial-industrial groups in our country back in 1991 was Andrey Kokoshin, today's Russian Federation deputy defense minister. In a commentary for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Andrey Kokoshin pointed out that given today's budget and financial crunch it is extremely important to create financial-industrial groups. They may ease the pressure on the federal budget. The establishment of financial-industrial groups is one of the necessary conditions for progress in capital investments in industry, for getting industry circulating capital from budget funds. The formation of financial-industrial groups as components of a market-based economy depends in the first place upon the enterprises of the defense complex which are becoming diversified. The most probable potentially powerful financial-industrial groups, in experts' assessment, are the Ilyushin Design Bureau and Voronezh Aviation Plant.
