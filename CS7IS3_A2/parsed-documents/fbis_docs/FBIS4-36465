[Beilin] I think that a much more solid common denominator was reached, an additional tier was laid for the Declaration of Principles signed on 14 September last year. The most important thing is that the talks will continue next month in our region, apparently both in Jordan and in Israel. I hope that the proximity of the talks will also make them more intensive and that we will be able to reach agreement on all the issues on the agenda in the next few months. [Ganor] To what do you attribute the change in the Jordanian position? [Beilin] I do not regard myself as an expert on Jordanian affairs. Last September I thought we would be able to score quick progress. For some reason, it was the Jordanians that slowed down the rate of progress. I am glad that today they are willing to facilitate the process, and I hope this will end in a peace agreement with us. [Ganor] Does the change in the Jordanian position indicate that a similar change can be expected to take place in the Syrian position? [Beilin] I find it difficult to believe that the Palestinian, Jordanian, and Syrian tracks are unrelated. I believe that we have a very good chance of reaching an agreement with Syria within a relatively short period of time, that is, within several months, because we have a common denominator regarding three issues: A willingness to reach peace; a willingness to implement a withdrawal on the Golan Heights; and a willingness to have intensive U.S. involvement in order to facilitate the process. Granted all this, I believe it will be possible to complete the whole process. [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 8 June adds: "U.S. and Israeli sources say that Syria will agree to move the talks with Israel to our region in the near future and hold them in al-Qunaytirah on the Golan Heights and possibly in Tiberias as well. The sources added that Jordan's agreement to hold the talks in al-'Aqabah and Elat was given only after receiving the OK from Damascus."] [passage omitted]
