The Siemens researchers have set a world record with their 40 Gigabit-per-second microchip: It had previously been considered impossible for a silicon-based circuit to reach processing speeds of this magnitude, with the result that many manufacturers had turned to gallium arsenide, which is costlier and more complicated to work with. Three different processes, applied to the best advantage, brought about this success: transistor technology, circuit design, and metrology. The latest production methods give controlled deposition of extremely thin films precisely where required. Single-crystal semiconductor and insulating films 1 billionth of a millimeter thick can be accurately positioned using this process, which goes hand in hand with transistor technology developments that create high-performance, purpose-structured transistors by depositing microscopically thin semiconductor materials. The transistor technology is complemented by an optimized circuit: "We did not have to reinvent the wheel by any means, as the circuitry principles are not new, but we succeeded in scaling and arranging the components in such a way as to achieve maximum performance," says Felder. The scientist, who received the 20,000-German mark Philipp Reis Prize for his work, took advantage of his know-how as a qualified high-frequency engineer when developing his high-speed circuit technology. "There are technical sound barriers that you have to know. Once you exceed speeds of a few Gigahertz, the structural and measuring techniques have a major impact," he explains. The chip is still a prototype and is only a part of the complete 40-Gigabit transmission system. Felder and his colleagues are continuing work on the other key electronic components required for data rates of this magnitude. These include circuits capable of converting parallel data stream inputs into a serial data stream. These "multiplex circuits" are a must for feeding large volumes of data into a glass fiber cable. There are already trial glass fiber network lines capable of transmitting 10 billion bits per second. The expansion of these networks renders high-performance circuits in the switching stations indispensable. The Siemens researchers expect an early breakthrough for ultra-high-speed transmission technology, particularly in data systems and communications. This means that future circuits and integrated network concepts will have to handle billions of bits per second if they are to be able to transmit this data together -- for high-definition television, digital radio, and mobile phones, for instance.
