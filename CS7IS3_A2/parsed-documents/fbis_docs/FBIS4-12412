[Abu-Salih] Let us return to May of last year, when a ranking Sudanese delegation travelled to Abuja to hold talks with Garang, who did not attend the meetings. He sent his deputy Musa al-Bashir instead. Despite this move indicating his derision and unwillingness to establish peace, we continued discussing the basic issues for three weeks. We found a solution to around 80 percent of these issues. At the same time, there was another Sudanese delegation negotiating in Nairobi with a delegation from the United Faction. We made some positive progress. But developments in Nigeria then made it difficult to continue negotiations. In September of last year, the (EANGAD) [abbreviation, parenthesis as published] group in East Africa proposed mediation to form a committee from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda, and Kenya. It held many meetings on the presidential or foreign ministerial level in the different places. But there was no clear objective behind these meetings. We were made to understand that negotiations are the objective so that EANGAD does not negotiate on their or our behalf. I went to Nairobi last month to confirm our adherence to and welcoming of mediation on condition that a negotiating schedule be set out, that negotiations be direct, and that there be a specific working agenda. The Nairobi meeting was held on 8 March. President al-Bashir traveled on 17 March and met President Moi. We believe this was a good beginning. Agreement was reached on a second round of talks on 15 May in accordance with the old schedule. We believe we need to build on what has been achieved in the past, when agreement was reached on many issues. We also believe that future meetings should take place to discuss the other problems. [Ahmad] Recently, some proposals were made on the right of the south to self-determination. Was this issue discussed in the negotiations? [Abu-Salih] Not at all. They proposed some ideas on the working agenda, the most important of which was to add a new item, the right to self-determination. We rejected this totally. They are nothing but a group of rebels forming a minority. The reason we do not talk to them is not because they carry arms, but because we believe that the solution always lies in dialogue. We have no intention of deciding the issue militarily, although this is our duty and mission. There is no power that can prevent us from being flexible. These people are not talking in the name of the south. [Ahmad] You have often pointed out the existence of foreign circles supporting the separatists. Who are these circles? [Abu-Salih] There are American and British circles. The two governments are not too distant from each other. There are many seminars being held in the two countries. The most recent one was held in an American research center in October. It called for the unity of the factions. Congressmen attended. Another seminar was held in the British House of Lords, although none of the lords attended. The topic of the seminar was the right to self-determination in the south. The archbishop of Canterbury and many other figures and officials visited the south without the permission of the Sudanese Government. [Ahmad] The Arab foreign ministers issued a resolution at the end of their recent meeting rejecting every attempt to divide Sudan. Is this stance considered enough for Sudan? [Abu-Salih] Undoubtedly, it was a supportive stance, beyond our expectations, when the Arab brothers competed to highlight and confirm their country's position on the unity of Sudan, especially Egypt's stance. We do not wish to polarize the Arab nation or seek military or material support. But we wanted to warn the foreign sides that there is Arab moral support for the unity of Sudan's territory. [Ahmad] This leads us to Sudanese-Egyptian relations. [Abu-Salih] The differences between the two governments are not beyond resolving if there is confidence between us. We are still waiting for Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa [to come to Khartoum]. I do not believe we will need many meetings between us. I must point out that Egypt's stance on the south is honorable and responsible, without anyone asking it to be so. [Ahmad] How do you explain Sudan's stance opposing Egypt's joining the preferential trade agreement for the countries of East and South Africa? [Abu-Salih] That is not true. Countries other than Sudan objected. I did not attend this meeting. [Ahmad] But Sudan did object? [Abu-Salih] Yes. But two other countries are very close to Egypt. I do not wish to discuss this topic. [Ahmad] In what way does expelling Sudan from the IMF affect the economy in Sudan? [Abu-Salih] Primarily, the IMF stance on Sudan is a political stance, not a scientific one.
