FR941028-0-00093 FR941028-0-00009 Effect of the Rule on State Programs The provisions of section 503(a)(1) of the Act require that State laws regulating surface coal mining and reclamation operations be ``in accordance with'' the requirements of the Act. Further, section 503(a)(7) of the Act requires that State programs contain rules and regulations ``consistent with'' regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to the Act. These terms are defined at ยง730.5 of title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations to require that State programs contain procedures which are, with respect to the Act, no less stringent than the Act; and with respect to the Secretary's regulations, no less effective than the Secretary's regulations in meeting the requirements of the Act. Following promulgation of this final rule, OSM will evaluate State programs to determine whether any changes in these programs will be necessary. If the Director determines that any State program provisions should be amended to be made no less effective than the revised Federal rules, the individual States will be notified in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17. Federal Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . and assigned clearance numbers 1029&hyph;0034, 1029&hyph;0041, and 1029&hyph;0051. Executive Order 12778; Civil Justice Reform Certification This rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the preamble discussion of this rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order: A. What is the Preemptive Effect, if any, to be Given to the Regulation? The rule would have the same preemptive effect as other standards adopted pursuant to SMCRA. To retain primacy, States have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective than those set forth in OSM's rules. Any State law that is inconsistent with, or that would preclude implementation of this proposed rule would be subject to preemption under SMCRA section 505 and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. To the extent that the rules would result in preemption of State law, the provisions of SMCRA are intended to preclude inconsistent State laws and regulations. This approach is established in SMCRA, and has been judicially affirmed. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264 (1981). B. What is the Effect on Existing Federal Law or Regulation, if any, Including all Provisions Repealed or Modified? This rule modifies the implementation of SMCRA as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions that are affected by this rule. C. Does the Rule Provide a Clear and Certain Legal Standard for Affected Conduct Rather than a General Standard, While Promoting Simplification and Burden Reduction? The standard established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of topics covered and the mandates of SMCRA. D. What is the Retroactive Effect, if any, to be Given to the Regulation?
