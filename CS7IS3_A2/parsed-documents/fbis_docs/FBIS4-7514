Replying to their questions, President Tudjman spoke about the cease-fire agreement reached between representatives of the local Serbs from the occupied Croatian areas and the Republic of Croatia, the Washington agreement, the overcoming of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the causes of the Greater Serbian aggression and its tragic consequences for Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now that we signed an agreement on the normalization of relations with Belgrade and the cease-fire agreement with the Serbs in UN protected areas in Croatia, a process of reopening roads and telecommunications should begin. At the same the rebuilding of trust between the Croatian authorities and the Serbs from these areas who were dragged into conflicts with the Croatian authorities by the former communist Yugoslav army should begin, President Tudjman said in reply to a question of what he expected from the cease-fire agreement. By the gradual normalization of relations, President Tudjman said, we will try to restore trust to carry out elections for the local Serb self-administration in two counties in which they make up a majority. In the beginning we would like to create conditions for the return of more than 250,000 refugees, wherever it is possible, the president stressed, expressing the hope this would be possible to achieve gradually and through negotiations. As regards the possibility of restoring economic ties, President Tudjman stressed that some Serbs from the UN protected areas a year ago signed an agreement with the Croatian authorities after which they were arrested by Serb extremists. We were called on to restore trade links and to normalize relations by the people from all Serb-held areas, even from Banja Luka, the Croatian president said. In the final phase the Croatian policy and that pursued by the Western countries coincided. That is the basis for the partnership between Croatia and the Western world, particularly the United States, President Tudjman said in reply to a question of whether the Washington agreement and the cease-fire agreement were a result of a turnabout in the Croatian policy or were a result of pressure coming from the West. We wish to reintegrate the UN protected areas into the constitutional and legal system of Croatia in a peaceful way. If our efforts and those made by the United States and Russia did not bear fruit, Croatia would not be able to bear the present situation for ever, President Tudjman said, stressing that, in the light of the international situation, Serbia would have to agree to the normalization of relations.
