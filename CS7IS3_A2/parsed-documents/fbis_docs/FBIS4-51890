"As long as there is no reconciliation among Cambodians, fighting will continue," Squadron Leader Prasong said. "Other countries should not encourage division among them (Cambodians) or extend military support for them to fight each other," he added. The minister reaffirmed support for a Round Table among the Cambodians but stressed that Thailand would not be involved in the peace talks. "The Round Table has nothing to do with Thailand," he said. "The whole affair is a matter for the Cambodians in which we do not want to be involved," he added. Thailand would extend economic, social or health assistance to Cambodia but will not intervene in the country's political affairs, he said. As for fighting spilling over the border into Thailand, the minister said military authorities had been able to compile damage estimates so that the Foreign Ministry can file a report to the Cambodian government.
