A correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVICE agency learned this from sources in the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan. At present annual output stands at the level of 10 million tonnes a year. This is largely due to the absence of necessary production technologies, because those available allow for extracting only 65 percent of producible oil. Lack of funds for repairs and the technical servicing of drilling rigs is another reason. In conjunction with this, about 2,000 wells both on land and at sea are completely idle at present.
