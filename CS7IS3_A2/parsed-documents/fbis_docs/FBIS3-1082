According to the authorities, he narrowly escaped a murder attempt during a religious ceremony. The attempt was only revealed last night, and the government is using the incident as a stick to beat the opposition with. From Moroni, the Comoros capital, Kamardine Mohammed faxed this report: According to last night's statement, the attempt was going to be made by a former presidential guard, who was arrested on the spot--armed with a pistol hidden in his jacket. The statement was broadcast on Radio Comoros following an emergency meeting of the government yesterday afternoon. In a stinging attack, President Djohar's press attache, Ali Jei, denounced the opposition. Ali Jei claimed that initial investigations showed that the arrested man, Fayar Oumar, was hired by the opposition. The press attache claimed that the man was promised $3,530 and a ticket to go to the French island of Mayotte. The opposition has rejected the accusation, pointing out that the alleged would-be assassin was a bodyguard for a ruling party member of the Federal Assembly. They also say that the man was carrying a starter pistol. Abass Youssouf, the leader of the opposition umbrella organization, the Forum for National Recovery, told me this afternoon that this accusation was just a manipulation to discredit the opposition.
