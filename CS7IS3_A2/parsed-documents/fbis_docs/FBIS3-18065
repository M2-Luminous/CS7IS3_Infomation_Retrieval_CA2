It is impossible to say at present, given the very high proportion of those who are undecided, with confusion reigning supreme. This is the conclusion reached by the ITER social research center, which conducted a survey on the attitudes of Italians just over a month from the election date. No winners or losers emerge from the investigation. "We were not aiming to carry out an electoral survey," explained ITER Director Bruno Babando, "in the first place because we believe such surveys are unreliable. We preferred to analyze the issues and problems --as perceived by Italians -- which will have to be addressed by our new representatives." It is apparent from the survey -- conducted on a representative sample of Italy's population (1,426 interviews) -- that confusion and uncertainty still prevail among the voters. In fact, over 79 percent say they find the present political situation confusing, and no less than 58 percent say they have not yet decided whom to vote for. Furthermore, 56 percent state that in the upcoming elections the candidates' personality will be more important than their party allegiance. In this respect, electors showed that they had fully understood and correctly assessed the changes introduced through the new uninominal system.
