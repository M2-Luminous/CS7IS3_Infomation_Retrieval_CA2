The French engine builder believes the only way to pull out of the recession is to break with the past... "We're not going to see another `miracle' like the CFM-56. Our competitors will not allow it." Financial problems, battles for technology, collapsing markets: Yves Bonnet, general manager of SNECMA [National Company for Aircraft Engine Design and Construction], knows the company can count on very little outside support in its struggle for economic recovery. In a sector likely to see increasing concentration, SNECMA has no choice. If it wants to defend its position, its markets, and its research, it must get back into the black as soon as possible. New Markets Once a supplier of products for exclusively military use, SNECMA has succeeded over the last 5 years in becoming the third largest company in its field, thanks to a cooperative alliance forged 20 years ago with global leader General Electric [GE] (United States). The market-penetration achieved by the CFM-56 family of jet engines under a 50-50 partnership with GE lifted it to the ranks of a world-class engine builder. With 6,500 units in service for close to 200 clients, the CFM-56 is the world's best-selling jet engine. Alas! It has had to pay a price for this success. When the full force of the recession in the air transport market hit, SNECMA was too much a one-product company. CFM-56 deliveries dropped from 900 in 1991 to 500 in 1993, resulting in a 30-percent decline in sales volume. In the last 2 years, it has suffered annual losses of 600 to 700 million [French] francs [Fr]. The group suddenly realized it was overly dependent on GE. If business generated by the partnership with the Cincinnati engine builder were to decline further, 75 percent of its activity would be threatened. Thus the company had to take action. Especially since its president, Gerard Renon, does not expect an overall recovery in the sector before 1997. "Even then," he says, "only companies that have developed new products will survive." So SNECMA decided to gamble: It would expand its product offerings in a bid to secure new market outlets. This meant branching out to the civilian sector, of course, but also broadening its military base. Formerly it supplied warplane engines only to Dassault, but now it is prepared to equip foreign aircraft too, though the latter are not really competitors to any great extent. It has recently proposed building a new version of the M-88, the Rafale's engine, to power the Swedes' Grippen. Discussions are also under way with South Korea on provision of a modified M-88 to power a single-engine trainer. In the civilian market, a number of needs have been identified. First, at the low end, for regional aircraft with fewer than 100 seats, demand for which is going to accelerate in Europe and Asia. Looking ahead to the year 2009, replacement of the oldest Airbuses (A300 and A310) should open up opportunities for engines with thrust in the range of 40-50,000 pounds. Over the longer term, finally, a successor to the CFM-56 will need to be developed. New Alliances The problem is, with development costs for a new engine starting at a minimum of Fr1 billion, SNECMA may not be in a position to follow through. It now spends close to Fr4 billion per year--about 31 percent of total sales revenue--on research and industrial development. It is no longer able to sustain that spending level, which is substantially greater than the percentages spent by rivals (15 to 20 percent). Both its adversaries (Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney) and its principal partner (GE) are two to four times as big. In order to compensate for this handicap, and despite the fact that "cooperation with GE remains indispensable," the French firm has entered into a number of alliances with new partners. With Rolls-Royce, SNECMA is working to acquire technology for the warplanes of the 21st century. Also in the military domain, it has just signed a preliminary agreement with Russia's Mikoyan for manufacture under license of the Larzac, an engine developed in association with Turbomeca. Another accord has just been concluded with Germany's MTU and Italy's Fiat Avio for research on an engine for the FLA, the future European tactical transport aircraft. In the field of low-power civilian engines, those targeted at the regional aircraft market, SNECMA has signed letters of intent to cooperate not only with GE but also with MTU [Motor and Turbine Union, Inc.] and Pratt & Whitney. The partnership would be based on development of a civilian spinoff of the M-88 that may also be of interest to the Japanese for their YSX. Other discussions are under way with Russia's Perm for a 40,000-pound [i.e., thrust] engine, a market niche where GE is not a player. Production Cycles Obviously, such a policy would have no chance of succeeding unless SNECMA had some good technological arrows in its quiver. Even so, it will need to redouble its efforts to improve productivity. The objective is to reduce both costs (30 percent) and development time (1 year) for new engines. To meet new demands, the company's production facilities are going to have to match the faster pace set by airplane builders. For example, now that Boeing has decided to shorten production time for its airplanes from 18 to 14 months by 1996, SNECMA will have to deliver its engines in 4-1/2 instead of 6 months, if it wants to remain a player. That means a complete overhaul of work procedures, including elimination of excess layers of hierarchy, autonomy for production units, creation of expertise hubs that bring together research laboratories, study bureaus, and the manufacturing side. A breakdown of old structures is under way. "Aeronautics is no longer a separate industry," proclaims Jacques Bouhelier, the just-named director for comprehensive quality control. "In the future, engine-building will evolve more in the direction of client services," confirms Alain Habrard, director of development. Airlines will not want to have to worry about repair or maintenance of their engines. There will come a time when they want services at flight time. SNECMA has already begun offering this type of contract, and is considering a top-to-bottom overhaul of its commercial network. If it perseveres to the end, the state-owned company's gamble will pay off. The most difficult part will be getting back into the profit column within the next 2 to 3 years. SNECMA may be in a position then to make a comeback and take in private-sector shareholders. Solid financial footing, broad international base--the vision is well fleshed-out. But just bringing in private investors will not substitute for the planned reforms, which are essential if the company is to prosper in a highly competitive market. [box, p 24] Subsidiaries Adapting In 1993, only two of SNECMA's five subsidiaries--SEP, which builds the Ariane's engines, and Techspace Aero, formerly FN [National Arms Factory] Engines, in Belgium--posted profits. Gerard Renon, the group's president, offers this analysis: "In an environment of such frenzied competition, we can no longer let them remain simple subcontractors for the parent company." Their survival depends on their ability to establish themselves as prime contractors on the international market. An objective which in most cases means more alliances. Thus Messier-Bugatti has decided to join forces with Britain's Dowty in the landing-gear domain. In the field of engine nacelles and thrust reversers, Hispano-Suiza is entering into collaboration with Grumman (United States). Sochata's maintenance activities may be reintegrated into SNECMA itself. [end box] [box, p 25] Technological Strike Force SNECMA's strength depends on the upstream organization of its research effort, which is based on a network of 80 research organs, laboratories, and universities both in France (ONERA [National Office for Aerospace Studies and Research], CNRS [National Scientific Research Center], CART, etc.) and overseas (Europe, the United States, Russia). Forced to compensate for its relatively small size, it gets as much mileage as possible from computer simulation, which saves time and avoids costly testing. Starting from scratch after the Liberation [i.e., near the end of World War II], SNECMA is one of the few engine builders in the world that has been able to design and build military aircraft engines without external assistance. The M-88, developed for Dassault's Rafale, is a distillation of expertise that will offer performance superior to that of any competitor. Compared with the J200 destined for the EFA [European Fighter Aircraft] and Pratt & Whitney's ATF [advanced tactical fighter] engine in particular, it will offer higher turbine injection temperatures and an unprecedented thrust-to-mass ratio on the order of 10 daN/kg. That presupposes complete mastery of new materials technologies. Likewise, in the civilian domain, SNECMA has obtained remarkable blower efficiency and compression rates. These technological advances have not been purchased at a cost to reliability. For example, the failure-in-flight rate of the CFM-56-3 is almost 20 times less than that of rival Rolls-Royce's V 2500. With some 2,000 engineers on its rolls, "SNECMA is, from a technical standpoint, up there with the best--perhaps even better," boasts Jacques Caruel, the group's technical director. SNECMA Engines - CFM-56: The result of a 50-50 partnership with GE, it has made SNECMA a leader in the civilian market, with 6,500 units in service. - M-88: Developed for Dassault's Rafale, it is a distillation of the most advanced technologies. It will be offered for export in various versions. - GE-90: With so much experience under its belt, SNECMA is now moving ahead on the GE-90, the world's largest aircraft engine. Its new objective: to be prime contractor for a major civilian program. [end box]
