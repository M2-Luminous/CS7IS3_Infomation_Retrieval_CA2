Glukhoyedov, department chief of mineral and raw material base of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources and L. Oganesyan, chief of the Information and Analytical Department of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources: "The Mineral-Raw Material Base and Geological Service of the Russian Federation"] [Text] Around 20,000 mineral deposits have been discovered and explored in Russia. The inventory of reserves, however, was conducted under conditions created by a totally different price system, low-cost energy sources, and cheap shipping services. Now it is anticipated that the amount of profitable reserves will decrease by 30-70 percent as a result of re-evaluation of the various types of raw materials. Reserves of natural gas, gold, silver, and diamonds in Russia are higher than world reserves, but for lead, zinc, and antimony they are very low--less than 20 years. Its territory lacks explored reserves of manganese, chrome, and zirconium ores, high-grade kaolin, barite, and Muscovite mica meeting contemporary industrial demands. The mineral and raw material base of oil, gas, pit coal, iron, nonferrous and noble metals, diamonds, and agrochemical raw materials, and production capacities and infrastructure that were formed in past years so far are meeting the needs of Russia and even yield up to 70 percent of the foreign currency proceeds of the country through the export of mineral raw material. At present 37 percent of the best projects are undergoing industrial assimilation, including the absolute majority of unique and large deposits which, comprising around 5 percent of their total number, contain almost 70 percent of the explored reserves and account for 50 percent of the raw material that is extracted. The problem concerning development of the raw material base of the fuel-energy complex remains a highly important priority for the geologists. At present 76 percent of oil fields, which include 93 percent of the reserves, have already been assigned to oil-producing enterprises. A sharp decrease in the size of new deposits is taking place. In Western Siberia, for instance, in 1975 reserves of one deposit amounted on the average to 53 million, in 1985--to 15 million, and in 1991-1993--to 11-13 million tonnes. The average daily extraction of oil per well is shrinking correspondingly: from 29 tonnes in 1975 to 19 tonnes in 1985, and 10 tonnes in 1991-1993. Deposits of pit coal are being exploited to a much smaller degree (around 14 percent of the recorded reserves and 23 percent of the total number of deposits with an overall volume of 202 billion tonnes--12 percent of world reserves). The share of explored reserves of high-grade coking coal and anthracite, which are in short supply, however, amounts to just 12 percent of the total reserves in Russia. Assimilation of deposits of lead, zinc, mercury, zirconium, and titanium is being delayed for a variety of reasons, including low quality of the ore, and technological and economic limitations. The mining of gold is dominated by placer deposits (71.4 percent of the total extracted), the explored reserves of which amount to only 26 percent of those recorded in the state balance. Reserves of placer gold in the main gold-mining regions will be exhausted in three to 15 years if high rates of extraction and the lag in geological prospecting work continue, which, on the basis of world criteria, is evaluated as a deep crisis of the raw material base. At the same time, some of the largest indigenous gold ore deposits have not been assimilated (Sukhoy Log in Irkutsk Oblast, Vorontsov in Sverdlov Oblast, a number of deposits in the Northeastern region, Kamchatka, and Khabarovsk Kray). The bulk of the gold (around 60 percent) is mined in regions of the Russian Far North. The sharp rise in cost of energy sources, transportation, and other services may lower that share to 20-30 percent in the immediate future. Compensation of such decreased extraction by other regions is impossible, because the raw material base is not prepared. The needs of Russian industry for manganese, chrome, mercury, antimony, titanium, and a number of other types of mineral raw material is satisfied almost in full by deliveries from former Union republics. In 1993 884,000 tonnes of chrome ore was delivered to Russia from Kazakhstan, along with 10-12 million tonnes of commercial-grade iron ore and 206,000 tonnes of manganese ore from Ukraine. Mineral raw material imported in 1993 cost Russia a total of $2 billion. Reserves in the old raw material regions are running out. The annually expanding reserves are worked by oil extracting enterprises of the North Caucasus and the Volga Region, and by many lead, zinc, tin, and gold mines and mining combines. There is a lag in the preparation of reserves of ecologically protected underground water to be supplied for drinking. Until now, around 50 percent of the cities and populated points in Russia, including up to 80 cities with a population of over 250,000, utilize surface water unprotected from pollution (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vologda, Kostroma, Kirov, Astrakhan, Kurgan, Chelyabinsk, Perm, Omsk, and other cities). The rate at which reserves of ecologically protected underground water sources are being prepared remains low. Complex and specialized geological enterprises, as well as those that have paid orders to satisfy state needs and direct contracts are being preserved. One of the most important directions in the development of geological prospecting work is the creation of modern enterprises and performance of work for foreign clients. The joint venture Polyarnoye Siyaniye company for the development of the Ardalin group of oil fields is the largest one. Geological prospecting work was performed on the basis of contracts with foreign firms by the state enterprise Krasnoleninskneftegazgeologiya ($1 million) as well as geophysical work by the government enterprise Yeniseygeofizika ($1.5 million), and by others. In 1993 the joint venture Dalpacific Minerals in Khabarovsk Kray concluded contracts for an overall amount of more than $250,000. The joint venture Geoylbent and the SANK [expansion not given] Urengoyl were also established in 1993. A number of other joint ventures are in the stage of formation. This year it is planned to increase the volume of foreign investments fourfold. In 1991-1992 several geological expeditions whose workers get higher wages and benefits received at mining enterprises as compared with geological enterprises of the Russian Federation Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources, were transferred to the group of mining enterprises. The most important premises for structural transformation consist in privatization and auctioning of enterprises. At present a decision has been made regarding privatization of 27 geological enterprises and materials on 45 organizations are being prepared by the GKI [State Property Committee] of Russia and its local organs. A legislative and standardization base was created for the use of mineral resources, which is founded on joint management of mineral resources of the Russian Federation and its subjects, and on the licensing of the use of mineral resources, including paid use, (as of 1 April 1994 6,591 licenses were issued for the right to use mineral resources).
