In a letter to the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/CSU Bundestag Group that became known to DPA on Thursday [17 February], Waigel now provides deputies with arguments against the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] with comprehensive accounts of burdens. One "cannot talk" of preferential treatment of higher incomes or discrimination of people with small incomes, he stressed. As of 1995, no solidarity contribution will be collected from a four-person family with two children and a gross income of 47,197 German marks [DM] per year. The full surcharge to the wage tax with a rate of 7.5 percent will only become due starting at DM52,166. According to the income tax scale, high-income earners are already now considerably more burdened than regular earners, which has disastrous consequences for industrial enterprises. Another substantial tax burden, repeatedly and emphatically demanded by the SPD, would significantly restrict the financial scope for necessary investments, it was stated. At the same time, the finance minister rejected the SPD reproach that the transfer to eastern Germany via social insurances is socially unjust. In 1993, funds of DM57.5 billion flew from the Federal Employment Office (39.5 billion) and the pension insurance (18 billion) to the new laender; DM33.3 billion of it or just under 58 percent come from federal subsidies, that is tax proceeds. Insurance contributions from employers and employees account for the rest, Waigel reported. However, even regarding the funds from social contributions, the benefits have always been granted independently of the regional origin of the funds. "There is obviously no reason to deviate from this because of the establishment of the unity of the German state," he said.
