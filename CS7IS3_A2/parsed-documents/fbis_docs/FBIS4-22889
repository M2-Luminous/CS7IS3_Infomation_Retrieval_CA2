Ovchinnikov at Russia's Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 57.083.3] [Abstract] The immunomodulating properties of muramyldipeptide (MDP)--a minimal structure of the bacterium cell wall--capable of substituting for the microbacterial component and affecting the central nervous system and a lack of complete understanding of the molecular principles of the effect of muramyl peptides (MP)--a glycopeptide which contains muramic acid--prompted the development of an original approach to studying the receptors of biologically active ligands with the help of anti-idiotypic antibodies. To utilize this approach to examining the muramyl peptide receptor, an attempt is made to produce monoclonal antibodies to N-acetylglucosaminyl-(_b_1-4)-N-acetylmuramyl-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (GMDP)--a biologically active analogue of muramyldipeptide--for subsequent use of these antibodies for producing anti-idiotypic antibodies to GMDP. The GMDP conjugates to MeBSA and poly[(D, L-Ala)[.sub]n[/] Lys] (GMDP-AL) were synthesized in the peptide chemistry lab of the Shemyakin Institute while the GMDP conjugate to ovalbumin (GMDP-OVA) were produced using water-soluble carbodiimide (EDAC) according to Bahr, Garelli, et al. A prolonged immunization procedure was selected for immunizing mice with the GMDP-MeBSA conjugate. The hybridoma E6/1.2 line was produced by fusing splenocytes of mice immunized with the GMDP conjugates to methylated bull serum albumin (MeBSA) and cells of the SP2/0 myeloma line. The E6/1.2 line is capable of producing monoclonal antibodies to GMDP. The E6/1.2 MCAs are classified as belonging to the IgG1 subtype and have an affinity constant to GMDP of 2[.sup].[/]10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/]. Based on data of a competitive enzymatic immunoassay analysis, the GlcNAc(_b_1-4)-MurNAc carbohydrate fragment and the first amino acid, i.e., alanine, make the largest contribution to these antibodies' interaction with GMDP. The conclusion is drawn that E6/1.2 MCAs are highly affine and interact specifically with GMDP, making it possible to use them for producing hybridoma which, in turn, produce monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies simulating the spatial GMDP structure.
