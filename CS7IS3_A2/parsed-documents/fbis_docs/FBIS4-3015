Addressing a joint press conference after talks with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the UN chief expressed his cautious optimism on a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Bosnia. On Russia's complaint that it had not been consulted on the NATO air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia on Sunday and Monday, Butrus-Ghali argued that the Russian authorities had been informed from New York before the attacks. He said he shared the view Russian President Boris Yeltsin sounded during his visit to Spain earlier this week that force could not put an end to the war in the area. Dialogue should be encouraged, but "if the UN peacekeeping forces face risks and relevant UN resolutions allow us to use force, we should not hesitate to resort to force," Butrus-Ghali said.
