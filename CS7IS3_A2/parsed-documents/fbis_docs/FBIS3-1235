The IFP said it would like him to reveal the identity of the author of an alleged ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] document outlining a plan for the overthrow of the kwaZulu government. The IFP said it believed that Mr. Gordhan, a member of the SACP, had seen the document. It alleged that a recent statement by him calling for TEC intervention in kwaZulu was in line with the strategy set out in the document for the destabilization of kwaZulu. Earlier, the Goldstone Commission said it would ask the IFP for details of the allegations to enable it to conduct a full inquiry. Confirming that he had received a copy of the document, Mr. Justice Goldstone said that if the IFP was unable or unwilling to furnish the information it should indicate the action it wanted the commission to take.
