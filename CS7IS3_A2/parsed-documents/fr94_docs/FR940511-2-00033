FR940511-2-00033 FR940511-2-00022 Financial Assistance Award: Pennsylvania State University AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent to award an unsolicited application financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under Grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;94CE15581 to Pennsylvania State University. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $92,131 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through the construction and testing of a lightweight, solid polymer, lithium battery to be used in electric automobiles. This high energy density, highly efficient, rechargeable light weight battery will significantly reduce the weight of electric cars and increase the energy efficiency of the cars. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, ATTN: John Windish, HR&hyph;531.23, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the unsolicited application for financial assistance submitted by Pennsylvania State University, is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation. Dr. Harry Allcock will be the principal investigator. He is the inventor of this patentable polymerization method for lightweight lithium batteries and has spent over thirty years in the field of polymers and materials. The Energy Related Inventions Program (ERIP) has been structured, since its beginning in 1975, to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation. The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 24 months from the effective date of award. Issued in Washington, DC, on May 4, 1994. Scott Sheffield, Director. Headquarter Operations Division B, Office of Placement and Administration.
