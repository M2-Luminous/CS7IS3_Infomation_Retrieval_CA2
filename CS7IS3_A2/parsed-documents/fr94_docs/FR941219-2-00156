Description The proposed rule change amends MSRB Rule G&hyph;34 to require generally that dealers acquiring new issue municipal securities apply for depository eligibility. This amendment is designed to facilitate the movement of municipal securities to a three business day (``T+3'') settlement time frame. 4 Because interdealer and institutional customer transactions are settled on a delivery vs. payment or receipt vs. payment (``DVP/RVP'') basis, it is critical that the delivery of securities be made in a timely manner on the settlement date. The physical delivery of securities certificates, however, is relatively time-consuming and inefficient as compared to book-entry delivery through a securities depository. A shortened settlement cycle will provide dealers, institutional customers, and their clearing agents with less time to deal with the processing requirements and inevitable problems that arise in connection with transportation, delivery, and acceptance of physical securities certificates. 4 On October 6, 1993, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6&hyph;1 under the Act which establishes three business days after the trade date (``T+3'') instead of five business days (``T+5'') as the standard settlement timeframe for most broker-dealer transactions. The rule becomes effective June 7, 1995. Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33023 (October 6, 1993), 58 FR 52891 and 34952 (November 9, 1994), 59 FR 59137. Although municipal securities were not included within the scope of Rule 15c6&hyph;1, the Commission did request that MSRB provide a plan for implementing T+3 settlement in the municipal securities market. In response, MSRB submitted to the Commission its Report of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board on T+3 Settlement for the Municipal Securities Market (March 17, 1994) (``T+3 Report''). The T+3 Report detailed changes in operational practices and regulatory actions that will be needed in the municipal securities market in a T+3 environment. The T+3 Report discussed the need to increase the number of securities made depository eligible in order to minimize the use of physical securities certificates to settle interdealer and institutional customer transactions. MSRB Rules G&hyph;12(f)(ii) and G&hyph;15(d)(iii) require essentially all interdealer and institutional customer transactions be settled by book-entry when the securities involved in the transactions are listed as eligible for deposit in a depository. The proposed rule change facilitates book-entry settlement of transactions in municipal securities by requiring, with limited exceptions, that dealers that acquire new issue municipal securities apply for depository eligibility. Under the proposed rule change, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers are required to apply for depository eligibility within one business day of the date of sale of a new issue municipal security. 5 The proposed rule change exempts (1) issues not meeting the eligibility criteria of all depositories that accept municipal securities for deposit and (2) issues maturing in sixty days or less. The proposed rule change also provides an exemption until July 1, 1996, for issues under $1 million in par value. 5 For competitively sold issues, the date of award from the issuer is considered the date of sale. For negotiated issues, the date of execution of the contract to purchase the securities from the issuer is considered the date of sale. MSRB has asked that the proposed rule change become effective sixty days from the date of approval. Therefore, the proposed rule change will be effective on February 7, 1995.
