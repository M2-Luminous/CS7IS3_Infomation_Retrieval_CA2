Defying security guards, the Cubans forced their way into the embassy, located in the residential neighborhood of Miramar (west of Havana) at approximately 0900 (1300 GMT). One of the Cubans who tried to enter, however, was barred entry, according to the same source. A U.S. television crew from Miami, which arrived in Havana to cover The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which for three days brought together representatives of the Cuban Government and Cubans living overseas, was in front of the embassy and filmed the incident, the same source reported. In recent months, several Cubans have attempted on various occasions to enter the embassy garden, which is protected by a large gate and guarded around the clock by several policemen. The last time something like this happened was in late January, when eight Cubans sought asylum at the residence of the Belgian ambassador in Havana. In view of the Cuban authorities' refusal to allow them to exit the country, they did not leave the residence until one month later, on 24 February, after obtaining the government's promise that they would not be prosecuted.
