NIN reports that the program showed special unit soldiers practicing responding to street disturbances and their actions against the demonstrators. NIN observes that the television pictures reminded viewers of recent unpleasant events in the streets of Belgrade but that this time Yugoslav Army soldiers rather than regular policemen clad in blue uniforms were involved. The weekly reports that, according to the TV program, Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Momcilo Perisic tried to explain the preparation of the special units for possible conflict with "their own people" by citing Article 133 of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] Constitution, which states that "the FRY has an Army that defends its sovereignty, territory, independence, and constitutional order." NIN states that Perisic explained the meaning of "constitutional order" by criticizing "some parties that understand their role in the political life of the country in a distorted way and are trying to overthrow the government." The constitutional order of the country cannot be equated with the activities of the political parties and their struggles for power, NIN remarks, adding that it is the Army's duty to defend the constitutional order, which is defined in the FRY Constitution by regulations that, for example, refer to Yugoslavia as a "sovereign federal state founded on the equality of citizens and member republics...." Discussing the high cost of financing the Army at the expense of the people, who "are literally starving," NIN asks whether the special Army police unit will now go on to attack the "hungry and impoverished people when they take to the streets to rightly protest the situation in which they find themselves without being responsible for it."
