As INTERFAX learned from Tajikistan's Deputy Defence Minister, Major-General Aleksandr Chubarov, the operation involved army units and troops from the Tajik Security and Interior Ministries, who were supported by helicopters and armored vehicles. Garm Region lies high in the mountains. Because of its complicated terrain it can be dominated by small mobile groups of armed men. That is why it is viewed as a bulwark of the opposition. As Chubarov said, during the operation 48 men were detained in the area of military actions, and handed over to the Security Ministry. Some of them were soon set free, since it was proved that they had no connection with the opposition. About 30 units of firearms, several grenade throwers, a British-made transmitter, and a large quantity of ammunition were discovered in secret caches hidden in the mountains. A center for training opposition militants was destroyed in a locality lying north of the village of Hait. Participants in the operation are categorically forbidden to use "any types of weapons against population centers," and therefore there were no civilian casualties, Chubarov stressed. He does not share the belief that the present confrontation in Tajikistan may grow into a long guerrilla warfare. "If we manage to ensure reliable protection for our borders, find effective solutions to political issues, including problems connected with interaction between the various areas of Tajikistan, and conclude the first stage of building our armed forces this year, we'll be able to accomplish, together with Security and Interior Ministries, the task of preventing the opposition from acting on Tajikistan's border and within the country," the general said.
