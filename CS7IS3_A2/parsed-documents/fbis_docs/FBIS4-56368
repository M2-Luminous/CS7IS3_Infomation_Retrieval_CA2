This is what President Cristiani had to say: [Begin recording] [Cristiani] I have not had a chance to examine each of the reforms as they were approved on 29 April. I understand, however, they acted on basically the same issues they had been discussing. I believe they address the audits carried out by the Court of Accounts [Corte de Cuentas], certain privileges, state monopolies, and, of course, several issues concerning the judicial branch. Generally speaking, and again without knowing what exactly was changed, I believe the changes are positive. Concerning the workers' request, it concerns only state workers, whom the Constitution withholds the right to declare strikes. This situation is not unique to El Salvador alone. I believe many countries withhold this prerogative, which is common to employees of the private sector, due to the nature of the tasks assigned to public employees, whose job is to serve the nation. Should public employees declare a strike, it would deprive people of the service to which they are entitled. We already saw what happened when public employees went on strike: The Rosales Hospital was shut down and caused much distress among the people. In another turn of events, treasury funds are not for the benefit of one individual in particular; they belong to the people, and they must return to the people. Many of the things common to the private sector [four-second break in reception] such a decision attempts against the resources of a specific enterprise. It is not Salvadorans' money. There must be a balance. In short, I believe this constitutional article must be left untouched for now. Concerning the Fuertes Caminos exercise, arrangements are under way. U.S. engineers, along with our engineers, will continue to do the same type of works they did during the first phase. This second phase is larger, however, because more works will be done. We hope many of the communities that were chosen to have health centers, schools, and other infrastructure works, such as wells, built there will benefit from these works. [Reporter Mario Jovel] Good morning, Mr. President. The U.S. observers who came here during the elections on 29 April asked the U.S. Congress to unfreeze economic aid to ensure that peace agreements will be complied with. My question is how much aid does the country need to comply with the remaining peace agreements? [Cristiani] In general terms, AID has supported such programs to rejoin public life, such as the land distribution plan and other plans to train mini- and small-scale businessmen. The land distribution program lacks financing, however, that is, it lacks the necessary resources in order to be carried out. On the other hand, perhaps most of the aid to the PNC, especially the National Public Security Academy, is not in cash but, rather, in the form of advisers, trainers, vehicles yet to be delivered, and others. We need to continue this program, but I cannot estimate the exact amount we need, but the land distribution program requires large sums of money. The lack of funds for this program pertains to the 100 million colones. It is obvious that if the resources needed do not come from abroad, we will have to find a way to provide them domestically. [Reporter Ruben Dominguez] Mr. President, today we mark May Day. Could you please send a message to all Salvadoran workers? [Cristiani] The Salvadoran people are known as hardworking people, and we observe International Labor Day today. We send our most cordial salute to all Salvadoran workers who are enjoying, along with their families, some type of recreation, perhaps in the countryside, because today is Sunday. We hope this is the right time to regain strength to continue to work for El Salvador. [end recording]
