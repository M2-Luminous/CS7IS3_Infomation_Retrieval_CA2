Rong welcomed Matteoli to China on behalf of the Chinese Government. Being here for the first time, Matteoli said that through the current visit, he hoped he could establish connections with the Chinese leaders so as to serve the development of the friendly relations between France and China. Matteoli said that developing such relations was in the interests of the two countries. Rong said that generally, Sino-French cooperation and exchanges in politics, economy, culture, science and technology have made progress since the two set up diplomatic ties 30 years ago, though there were twists and turns during the period. The recent visit to China by Prime Minister Balladur had contributed a lot to the promotion of bilateral relations, Rong said. China and France suffered tremendous losses in World War Two and therefore both cherish and work for world peace. The present world is not so peaceful, said Rong, and the situation requires different nations, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, to enhance exchanges and deepen understandings, so as to make joint efforts to safeguard peace in the world. The Chinese vice-president stressed that as China and France are both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, their friendly cooperative relations have significant meanings for international peace. Matteoli agreed with Rong's views. The Economic and Social Council is a legislation consultation institution in France. Matteoli and his party are here on a friendly visit as guests of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
