In an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine, Steinberg pointed out that "there exists a coherent international system for the notification of the nuclear situation in the world, under which all members of the European Nuclear Society inform the headquarters of this organization based in Switzerland of accidents at their nuclear power stations, which distributes the information among the other member-states." Meanwhile, the head of the press service of the Russian Gosatomnadzor, Yuriy Rogozhin, told INTERFAX yesterday that failures to inform the Russian Gosatomnadzor by former Soviet republics violate the official agreement between the nuclear supervising organizations reached shortly after the break-up of the Soviet Union.
