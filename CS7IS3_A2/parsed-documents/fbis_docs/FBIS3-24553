Polemics'': ``The Academy Again Demands the Blood of Saltykov''] txt}[Text] From what we see on television and read in the newspapers we know that President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Yuriy Osipov is extremely worried about the financial situation of academic science and is particularly outraged by the fact that in the draft of the budget for 1994 the lifeline of Russian basic science--the separate line ``Russian Academy of Sciences''--has disappeared. 947A0029C Moscow SEGODNYA Language: Russian and read Article Type:CSO Yuriy Osipov blames directly for the loss of the line two Borises--Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov and Minister of Science and Technical Policy Boris Saltykov. In the opinion of the presidium of the RAS [Russian Academy of Sciences], which on 14 December was set forth in the appeal of academicians to Boris Yeltsin, these two ministers are purposefully and systematically destroying the academy. The decree of the presidium of the RAS of 21 December contains the threat of the public impeachment of the mentioned Borises. In the appeal to the presidium the indignant scientists propose to put an end to this disgrace, to transfer to the jurisdiction of the academy of sciences all basic research of the country, and to eliminate the Ministry of Science. This demand is being advanced by the leadership of the academy for far from the first time. But for the first time all this talk has been brought from the offices to the public at large. And, perhaps, for the first time the ``immortals'' are so close to the desired goal. The battle under the carpet has ended, war has been declared. They are bombarding the Ministry of Science with angry telephone calls: ``How could you? How dare you leave academic science without means for existence?'' Deputy Minister Andrey Fonotov shrugs his shoulders in bewilderment. In his opinion, the panic arose due to a misunderstanding. ``We thought that this problem was over long ago. For the new dummy of the budget, in which this line existed, was sent out to all interested departments back during the summer. And not the academy, but we directed the attention of the Ministry of Finance to this detail. The draft was very poor, we sent it off with a large number of critical remarks, on 28 October the ministry agreed with our criticism, and the line about the academy was returned to its legitimate place. It is strange that Yuriy Osipov did not try to find out from the minister of science the true state of affairs before scribbling one denunciation after another.'' But, to all appearances, the president of the RAS did not define more precisely the state of affairs because this was not in his interests. The available facts force one to suppose that he needed a panic precisely at this, post-election moment, when Boris Yeltsin had announced the coming reduction of the number of ministries and their staffs. Panic was needed around any problem, be it even a nonexisting one. It is hard for us to believe that the leaders of the academy for all their friendly relations with the president and prime minister of the country did not have access to the latest dummy of the budget. But the facts are as follows. Back on 14 September Nikolay Malyshev, adviser of the president of Russia for science and education, sent Yeltsin a note, in which what the presidium of the RAS is now talking about was proposed--the transfer of all basic science to the jurisdiction of the academy and the elimination of the Ministry of Science. Then the dissolution of the parliament occurred, and the chair of Boris Saltykov for the first time in many months ceased to rock. The minister of science as a man of the Gaydar team during this period without a constitution was absolutely inviolable. As soon as the election concluded in the way we know, the note of Malyshev with the presidential resolution to ``consider'' lay on the desk of Yegor Gaydar. The suggestions of Malyshev, taken separately, could hardly damage the ministry--the advanced accusations did not conform too much to reality. The ministry was accused of the inordinate inflation of staffs at the moment when staffs had been reduced appreciably--due to low wages people are now fleeing the Ministry of Science. The ministry was accused of working ``in the old way'' and of the fact that here they were not dealing with anything, except for ``petty tutelage and the distribution of finances.'' But it is hard to call ``petty tutelage'' the establishment of new structures like the state science centers, which literally saved from collapse several tens of the largest scientific organizations of the country. It is hard to call work ``in the old way'' the development of a completely new method for us of distributing finances with the help of scientists themselves--the establishment of the Russian Basic Research Fund is meant. This fund, incidentally, in spite of all the criticism leveled at it, revived much stalled research. ``Instead of complaining,'' one scientist said,`` we are not writing applications for grants.'' At a pre-election meeting with scientists Boris Saltykov spoke about the establishment of a similar fund for humanities scholars, about a Technology Fund, and about the possibility of establishing a fund for the payment of $1,000 stipends to representatives of the scientific elite of the country. Now everything may end in failure. Malyshev's proposals, which are supported by surprisingly similar proposals of the presidium of the RAS and have been multiplied by an exactly chosen moment, may thus overthrow the ministry that is hateful to the academy. According to information from the state apparatus, there is on the desk of Boris Yeltsin a document on the elimination of the Ministry of Science and the establishment in its place of a department for science. Which Malyshev, of course, is being appointed to head. Already a once former minister of science. For a whole month. ``The ministry in its present form is not the most ideal structure for the extrication of science from a state close to clinical death,'' believes Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the Russian Consultative Council of the International Science Foundation and an active supporter of reforms in science, whom one can sooner call an opponent than an admirer of the Ministry of Science. ``They often and at times quite justly criticize the ministry. Like any Russian department, it is very slow, and any innovation--be it a statute on the tax benefits of international charitable organizations on the establishment of a new fund--comes to it with extreme difficulty. However, this is the only department that is taking steps in the correct direction, which is not typical of the Soviet methods of management. If the ministry is eliminated and the financing of basic research leaves the academy, the only thing for Russian scientists to do is to put on their mourning clothes--the hopes for the improvement of the situation, which as it is are small, will decrease practically to zero. Practical experience has shown: The only thing that the leadership of the RAS can do effectively is to beg well for money. The presidium of the academy is not capable of carrying out reforms that make it possible to preserve the scientific potential, inasmuch as any of the reforms weakens its power. It is capable only of dragging out the agony and making it irreversible.'' A short addendum to this article. The poor Russian Academy of Sciences, which is constantly crying about budgetary support, for example, has at its disposal several joint ventures, including together with an Austrian firm--the five-star Palace Hotel. Another five-star hotel is located on the grounds of the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the RAS, an automobile showroon also operates there. Where the considerable currency assets are going is unknown. In particular, during a check of the Palace Hotel $860,000 in uncollected cash, which belong to the academy, were discovered. One must think that scientists did not need it very much or it was put aside for a rainy day.
