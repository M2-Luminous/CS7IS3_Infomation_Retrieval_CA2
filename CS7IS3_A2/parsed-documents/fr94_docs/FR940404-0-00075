FR940404-0-00075 FR940404-0-00019 Sections 19.71 through 19.73 contain closeout procedures and other procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments. §19.71 Closeout procedures. (a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The Federal awarding agency may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.

(d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that the Federal awarding agency has advanced or paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A&hyph;129 governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.

(a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following. (1) The right of the Federal awarding agency to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review. (2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions. (3) Audit requirements in §19.26. (4) Property management requirements in §§19.31 through 19.37. (5) Records retention as required in §19.53. (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in §19.73(a), including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate. §19.73 Collection of amounts due. (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by the provisions of paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section. (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements. (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient. (3) Taking other action permitted by statute. (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Federal awarding agency shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR chapter II, ``Federal Claims Collection Standards.''
