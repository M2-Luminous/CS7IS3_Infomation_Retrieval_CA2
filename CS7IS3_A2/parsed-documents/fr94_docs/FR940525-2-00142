FR940525-2-00142 FR940525-2-00073 [Docket No. 50&hyph;400] Carolina Power & Light Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;63 issued to Carolina Power & Light Company (the licensee) for operation of the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, located in Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina. The proposed amendment would allow reduced power operation as a function of reactor coolant system (RCS) total flow rate for flow rate reductions of up to 5 percent below the currently specified flow rate. Operation would be allowed at total flow rates slightly lower than (293,540 gpm × (1.0 plus C1)) if rated thermal power (RTP) is reduced by 1.5 percent for each one percent that RCS total flow is less than this rate. This change would provide for needed operational margin and flexibility without the unnecessary penalty of a large power reduction. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Since the proposed amendment does not involve any changes in the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) configuration, the precursors to those Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accidents previously evaluated are unchanged. RCS total flow and RTP are traded off against one another to maintain the current departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) margins. NRC-approved methodologies and the NRC-approved 17 × 17 Mechanical Design Report have been used to verify that current design criteria continue to be satisfied. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment does not involve any modifications or additions to plant equipment and the design and operation of the unit will not be affected.The allowable reduction in the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint will not introduce any new FSAR Chapter 15 accident precursors. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the Bases to the Technical Specifications. The RATED THERMAL POWER is reduced consistent with the RCS total flow to maintain the margin of safety. This margin has been assessed by the evaluations performed with the approved methodologies as defined in the Technical Specifications. The reduction of the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint ensures that the DNBR margin for the analyses of record is maintained for those FSAR Chapter 15 events that utilize the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint trip function. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
