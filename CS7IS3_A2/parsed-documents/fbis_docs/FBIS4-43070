Answering an EU interpellation by the leftist alliance in the Eduskunta, Aho said the Eduskunta must approve the laws connected with the agricultural subsidy package before the national referendum in the fall. According to Aho, military nonalignment would be the basic tenet of Finland's security policy even as a member of the EU. Aho emphasized that the outlining of joint EU foreign policy requires the approval of each member state when the matter is raised two years from now. There will also be a separate decision on joining the European Monetary Union by the Finnish Government and the Eduskunta. Motions for and against the EU have been prepared for the interpellation debate. The Eduskunta will hold a vote of confidence in the government on 15 June.
