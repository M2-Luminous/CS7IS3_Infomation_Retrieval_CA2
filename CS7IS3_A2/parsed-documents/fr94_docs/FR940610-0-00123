Section 20.2055&hyph;2 is amended by revising paragraph (f)(4) to read as follows: §20.2055&hyph;2 Transfers not exclusively for charitable purposes. * * * * * (f)␣*␣*␣* (4) Other decedents. The present value of an interest not described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section is to be determined under §20.2031&hyph;7(d) in the case of decedents where the valuation date of the gross estate is after April 30, 1989, or under §20.2031&hyph;7A in the case of decedents where the valuation date of the gross estate is before May 1, 1989. * * * * * Par. 25. Immediately following §20.7101&hyph;1, an undesignated center heading and §§20.7520&hyph;1 through 20.7520&hyph;4 are added to read as follows: General Actuarial Valuations §20.7520&hyph;1 Valuation of annuities, unitrust interests, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests. (a) General actuarial valuations. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and in §20.7520&hyph;3 (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances), in the case of estates of decedents with valuation dates after April 30, 1989, the fair market value of annuities, interests for life or for a term of years (including unitrust interests), remainders, and reversions is their present value determined under this section. See §20.2031&hyph;7(d) (and, for certain prior periods, §20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter for the computation of the value of annuities, unitrust interests, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions, other than interests described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section. (2) In the case of a transfer to a pooled income fund with a valuation date after April 30, 1989, see §1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) (or, for certain prior periods, §1.642(c)&hyph;6A) of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) with respect to the valuation of the remainder interest. (3) In the case of a transfer to a charitable remainder annuity trust with a valuation date after April 30, 1989, see §1.664&hyph;2 of this chapter with respect to the valuation of the remainder interest. See §1.664&hyph;4 (or, for certain prior periods, §1.664&hyph;4A) of this chapter with respect to the valuation of the remainder interest in property transferred to a charitable remainder unitrust. (b) Components of valuation _(1) Interest rate component _(i) Section 7520 Interest rate. The section 7520 interest rate is the rate of return, rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one percent, that is equal to 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate, compounded annually, for purposes of section 1274(d)(1), for the month in which the valuation date falls. In rounding the rate to the nearest two-tenths of a percent, any rate that is midway between one two-tenths of a percent and another is rounded up to the higher of those two rates. For example, if 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate is 10.30, the section 7520 interest rate component is 10.4. The section 7520 interest rate is published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (See §601.601(d)(2)(ii)( b ) of this chapter). (ii) Valuation date. Generally, the valuation date is the date on which the transfer takes place. For estate tax purposes, the valuation date is the date of the decedent's death, unless the executor elects the alternate valuation date in accordance with section 2032, in which event, and under the limitations prescribed in section 2032 and the regulations thereunder, the valuation date is the alternate valuation date. For special rules in the case of charitable transfers, see §20.7520&hyph;2. (2) Mortality component. The mortality component reflects the mortality data most recently available from the United States census. As new mortality data becomes available after each decennial census, the mortality component described in this section will be revised periodically and the revised mortality component tables will be published in the regulations at that time. For decedents' estates with valuation dates after April 30, 1989, the mortality component table (Table 80CNSMT) is included in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6). See §20.2031&hyph;7A for mortality component tables applicable to decedent's estates with valuation dates before May 1, 1989. (c) Tables. The present value on the valuation date of an annuity, life estate, term of years, remainder, or reversion is computed by using the section 7520 interest rate component that is described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the mortality component that is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Actuarial factors for determining these present values are included in tables in these regulations and in publications by the Internal Revenue Service. If a special factor is required in order to value an interest, the Internal Revenue Service will furnish the factor upon a request for a ruling. The request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts, including the date of birth for each measuring life and copies of relevant instruments. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;1, 1994&hyph;1 I.R.B. 10, and the first Rev. Proc. published each year, and §§601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)( b ) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee. (1) Regulation sections containing tables with interest rates between 4.2 and 14 percent. Section 1.642(c)&hyph;6(e)(4) of this chapter contains Table S used for determining the present value of a single life remainder interest in a pooled income fund as defined in §1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). Section 1.664&hyph;4(e)(6) of this chapter contains Table D (actuarial factors used in determining the present value of a remainder interest postponed for a term of years), Table U(1) (actuarial factors for one life), and Table F (payout factors) used in determining the present value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust as defined in §1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter. Section 20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) contains Table S (actuarial factors for one life), Table B (actuarial factors used in determining the present value of an interest for a term of years), Table K (annuity end-of-interval adjustment factors), Table J (term certain annuity beginning-of-interval adjustment factors), and Table 80CNSMT (mortality components) used in determining the present value of annuities, life estates, remainders, and reversions. The regulations will be revised periodically to include new mortality component tables and new tables of factors.
