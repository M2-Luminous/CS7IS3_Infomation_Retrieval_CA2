The decision was made in the runup to June when the United States decides if the most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status will be granted. Family sources said yesterday that Chinese authorities had suddenly postponed, to an unspecified date, the trials of at least 14 dissidents originally scheduled for this week, following the weekend release of imprisoned dissident Wang Juntao. The brother of one defendant said: "The trial for the entire group has been postponed indefinitely -- lawyers for each of the defendants informed us by phone on Saturday." The wife of another family member said: "I have no idea why they have decided to postpone it. There is a good chance it has something to do with MFN status." A Beijing Intermediate Court spokesman said the case of the 14, the largest batch of political dissidents to be tried in China since prosecutions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, was still in the pre-trial stage. She said by phone it was difficult to say when the formal court session would be held. Meanwhile, the Chinese trade minister said in Hong Kong she was confident of China getting the renewal after her lobbying mission to the U.S. last week. Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said U.S. entrepreneurs and congressmen favoured an unconditional U.S. renewal of MFN to China. "I have met a large bunch of big entrepreneurs this time and all of them unanimously think that MFN should be granted to China unconditionally," she said, adding that the same attitude prevailed among some 30 senators she visited during her stay. The dissidents were charged for alleged involvement in underground pro-democracy and labour groups, among them the Free Labour Union of China and the Liberal Democratic Party of China. Two, Gao Yuxiang and Li Quanli, have been excused from prosecution, at least temporarily, because of illness, the relatives said. In Washington, the visiting Chief Secretary Anson Chan continued to lobby key congressmen for unconditional renewal of MFN. A leading proponent of linking MFN and human rights congressman Nancy Pelosi brought forward a meeting with Mrs. Chan. The two met last night (HK time) following an interview with Mrs. Chan on the national CNN television network. Mrs. Chan also kept a number of appointments with key MFN players including House speaker Tom Foley, Democratic leader in the Senate George Mitchell, and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord. Also in Washington, a White House press secretary said the release of Mr. Wang was "a positive step" toward meeting U.S. conditions for renewed MFN to China.
