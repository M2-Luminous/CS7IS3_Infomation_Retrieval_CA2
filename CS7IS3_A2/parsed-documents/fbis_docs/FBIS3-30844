It does not offer direct national security guarantees," Bulgarian Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov said at a workshop on national security here. "But the initiative promotes mutual confidence and its better for us to join it than to remain outside. This is my personal view," the defence minister added. "While Central and Western Europe may be facing no danger for an armed conflict, there are a number of high-risk factors in the Balkans," Chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army Army General Lyuben Petrov said at this workshop. He believes that international guarantees and bilateral treaties will therefore continue to play a key role for this country's national security. "The truth is that most of our neighbours are rearming and increasing their armies' strength," General Petrov also said. He went on to cite the military budgets Greece, Turkey and Romania have allocated -- over 8,000 million U.S. dollars, 600,000 million Greek drachmas, and 500 million U.S. dollars respectively -- which, according to the speaker, come to prove his observations. Compared to those figures, the Bulgarian Army will just survive to the year's end if parliament passes the military budget bill, General Lyuben Petrov also said. Aside from these, the Bulgarian Army will need more funds to launch the military reform and join Partnership for Peace, according to the Bulgarian chief of General Staff.
