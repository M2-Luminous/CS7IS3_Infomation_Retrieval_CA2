Identification of differential impacts. As shown above, Option 3 is economically achievable when viewed across all Subcategory C facilities. However, EPA was aware, through discussions with industry, that certain segments of the industry exhibit distinctive technical and market characteristics. In particular, industry identified the institutional/commercial market for pesticides as having unique technical and market characteristics. The Agency therefore analyzed whether subgroups of facilities, defined by major pesticide market, were disproportionately affected and considered whether technical and market factors distinguished any subgroups in ways that would warrant different regulatory approaches for those subgroups. Impacts were analyzed by market, with market definitions based on responses to Survey question # 19 (page I&hyph;9 of the Survey 7 ). Responses to this question indicated each facility's total 1988 revenues from pesticide products containing the original 272 PAIs by the following markets: 7 See Appendix A of the EIA. •Agricultural. •Institutional/commercial. •Industrial. •Wood preservatives and coatings. •Pesticide intermediate products. •Products used as an additive to a non-pesticide product. •Non-agricultural professional use products. •Consumer home, lawn, and garden. •Government, for non-institutional use. •Other. This analysis indicated that facilities obtaining greater than fifty percent of their 272 PAI pesticide related revenue from the institutional/commercial (I/C) market bore both a large and disproportionately high percentage of the impacts under Option 3. Table 5 indicates the distributions by primary market of all facilities projected to incur costs under Option 3, and of those facilities projected to incur significant economic impacts under Option 3. 8 Table 5 shows that, of the 574 facilities expected to incur costs, 267 or about 47 percent of those facilities receive 272&hyph;PAI-related revenue primarily from the I/C market. Moreover, the distribution of significant economic impacts is even more concentrated in the I/C market facilities. Of the 171 facilities expected to incur significant economic impacts, 102 or nearly 60 percent receive 272&hyph;PAI-related revenue primarily from the I/C market. 8 A facility's primary market is the market from which it receives at least fifty percent of its in-scope pesticide revenue. If no market accounts for at least 50 percent of in-scope pesticide revenue, the facility has no primary market.
