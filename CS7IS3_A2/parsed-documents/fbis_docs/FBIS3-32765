For those who opposed the referendum, the decisive vote was in the hands of the more than 900,000 members of the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols (PAC). Obviously, however, to the joy of some and disbelief of others who were close to the government and who expected these men to cast yes votes, PAC members did not vote. The story on why PAC members did not exercise their right to vote began many days earlier. Ranking Army commanders discussed the topic at a very secret meeting. The room was heavy with tension and uneasiness. Voices sometimes rose, and at other times they dropped to a murmur. It was evident that many of them were uneasy, angered more by the issue of peace with the guerrillas than by the referendum over the legislative reforms. A general with a great deal of influence within the military ranks and respected for his past record told the gathering that it was impossible to look on while a victorious Army was being led to defeat. He was referring to the presidential decision to accept the presence of a United Nations representative at the negotiating table. Although an attempt was made to disguise this representative as a "moderator," the top UN representative -- according to the results of the 10 January meeting in Mexico between the government and URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] -- would be authorized to present peace initiatives, convene meetings, observe, and offer advice. All of this, added to the fact that the Guatemalan conflict would be placed on the same level as the conflict in El Salvador with its truth commission, international military verification, liberated areas for the guerrillas, and so forth, prompted the exasperation of more than a few officers. This panorama finally unified the views of hard-liners and officers who, following Serrano's fall, had been removed from the Guatemalan Army and who under no circumstances were willing to allow diplomacy to destroy the halo of the winners of an internal war that has lasted over 30 years. According to confidential information, the destabilizing climate of the past few weeks is closely linked to this uneasiness, although it is not known which military group is to blame. Meanwhile, there was talk of the return of General Ortega Menaldo who many expected to be the new chief of the G-2. Strings were pulled to place his people in certain key positions within the institution and there was talk of isolating the officers who aborted Serrano's dream. Although the Army's granite-like unity is frequently referred to, everyone knows there are three factions: One is formed by the soldiers who were removed following Jorge Serrano's coup d'etat. The second is formed by the hard-liners, and the third is the institutional wing that supports President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. The second group, although their hard-line inclinations concerning the war against the URNG and their conditional support for the De Leon Carpio administration are known, would be willing to join with the officers who were removed in order to regain the initiative in the sphere of armed actions if the effort to further involve the United Nations in the Guatemalan peace process continues. The first group has taken advantage of this situation. They have used this prevailing uneasiness to attempt to look after themselves, eager as they are to see the system collapse and to regain their positions within the Armed Forces. This is the panorama that was under discussion at that tense meeting prior to the popular referendum. Despite their hard-line position, the second group did not want to break away from the democratic system either and was desperately seeking measures that would return the peace issue to its proper level. They knew it was impossible for the president to reverse his decision because the international community had welcomed the decision to include the United Nations in the negotiations. That is why they adopted the drastic measure of "confining the PAC's to their quarters" and asking them not to vote. As a result of this, the PAC members' relatives also failed to exercise their right to vote. The plan's strategists wanted a low voter turnout to prove President De Leon Carpio's weakness and fragility and to isolate him from the popular sectors who opposed the referendum from the beginning. They also wanted to exert stronger pressure on the president. Furthermore, the URNG played a role in the overall plan: It was supposed to pretend a military coup was being plotted against the civilian president. The URNG sought to emerge victoriously from a low voter turnout and, as an embellishment, provoke concern within the Army with its capricious interpretations -- very typical of the framework agreement reached in Mexico, which the URNG pledged not to reveal but ended up doing so anyway. In addition, a coup d'etat at a time when subversion has almost been annihilated would breathe new life into the URNG, particularly at the international level, where its position was weakened after Serrano's ouster. (Prior to the 25 May 1993 events the international community thought the URNG was the only one which had the right to talk with the Guatemalan Government, but following Ramiro de Leon Carpio's arrival those governments discovered there are other groups in Guatemala, which, with due respect for the political system and the rules of the game, sought to reform the state and its institutions.) Meanwhile, the military measure preventing the PAC's from voting also sought to exert even more pressure on President De Leon Carpio. His position within the Armed Forces was considerably weaker without the people's support on the reforms issue. Only a small step separated this from the coup d'etat rumors. Once the referendum results were known, rumors about an imminent coup d'etat began to spread in editorial rooms, the National Palace hallways, the Congress hallways, as well as the political parties' headquarters. There was even talk about the assassination of a public figure, a wave of assassinations, kidnappings, and a chaotic situation that would provoke the president's removal. Everything seemed to indicate Vice President Arturo Herbruger would be De Leon Carpio's immediate successor, which would greatly benefit not only Army hard-liners but also those who, due to their actions during Serrano's administration, had to fall back into the military ranks but were ready to return. According to labor and popular leaders, a military coup right now would provoke a veritable bloodbath; it would thwart our hopes of achieving peace; and it would place us among the most backward Latin American nations in the social and economic sector. It seems the situation is returning to normal. Two of the Armed Forces factions, the institutional faction and the hard-liners, have understood that the only option for this country is a democratic solution. They have closed ranks around the process, setting aside the lowly attitudes of those who have been forced out.
