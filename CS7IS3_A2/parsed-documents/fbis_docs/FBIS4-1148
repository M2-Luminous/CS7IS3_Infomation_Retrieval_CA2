The establishment of major institutions of the Fourth Republic marks the end of the activities of the transition government. I want to pay tribute to all Togolese people for the courage and high sense of duty demonstrated during this transition period and, in particular, during the legislative elections. Let me congratulate the outgoing prime minister and his ministers as well as all political leaders and administrative officials who have had the arduous task of running our country's government at this difficult time. [Words indistinct] to seek hours of compromise which enabled us to conclude the transition. When the nation was faced with a serious threat of being torn apart, each one of you made it a point to demonstrate a sense of responsibility and love for our country by placing national interests above personal interests or that of one's party. To you, my dear countrymen, parliamentarians whom the people have freely and in a sovereign manner elected to represent them and to defend their interests at the National Assembly, I express my warm congratulations. [passage omitted] I promised you, even before the holding of the legislative elections, that I will ensure a broad-based government is set up. The legislative elections reflected the desire of the people. The results of these elections have demonstrated your wish for a renewal and your desire for continuity. They also demonstrated your concern for level-headedness because, after these elections, none of the parties that contested them was in a position to claim parliamentary majority. We must see this situation in a positive manner. It must encourage each one of us to be moderate and to adopt dialogue, taking into account the situation as well as the (?needs) and aspirations of the people. You know the country's (?situation) and needs. Your aspirations are clear. Do you want to live in a truly independent and free country? Are you tired of experiencing the consequences of these political rivalries? This is why immediately after the legislative elections, as I pledged to do even before being elected as president, I started consultations to appoint a new prime minister. I acted so because I took into account your desire for change and renewal. I have paved the way for the formation of a national union government. The naming of the government must be in conformity with the provisions of Article 66 of our Constitution. The article says the president names the prime minister from within the parliamentary majority group. The Constitution confers on the head of state the sole responsibility of choosing a prime minister. I made it a point of consulting with leaders of the political parties to know their preferences and their aspirations. In the aftermath of the legislative elections, an alliance was formed between two parties, the Action Committee for Renewal and Togolese Union for Democracy, to form a parliamentary majority. I held several working sessions with the chairmen of these two parties. I asked them to suggest to me several names from which I could choose a prime minister. Indeed, it is necessary to respect the constitutional prerogative of the president of the Republic. It is also necessary to take into account the aptitude of the person chosen to assume that post and to restore confidence and national harmony. Up till today, I had not received any proposal. The legislative elections were completed several weeks ago. The country can wait no longer. As the guarantor of the Constitution, it is my duty to encourage everyone to uphold his responsibilities. This is why I have decided to choose a personality from the parliamentary majority to form a new government, in conformity with Article 66 of our Constitution. I am appealing to the sense of responsibility in all of you. The time has come for us to come together instead of being divided. The time has come to work for the construction of the country instead of destroying it. I have confidence in the political maturity of the Togolese people [words indistinct] division. The head of government will be charged with the task of working towards national unity and general interest. He will be charged with managing the country's affairs thoroughly and efficiently during this delicate phase of national reconstruction. [passage omitted] I wish the prime minister and his future cabinet good luck. Long live the Republic! Long live democracy! Long live Togo!
