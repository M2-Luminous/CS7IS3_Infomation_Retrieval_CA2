He said there is no longer consensus among U.S. citizens of Cuban descent about whether Washington's economic embargo -- which has been in force since 1960 -- should be maintained. "Most are against it," he said. Bolanos, 55, was interviewed by FOLHA during a farewell dinner offered by the Brazilian-Cuban Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo. He said it was "entirely contradictory" for the United States to maintain the embargo on Cuba since revoked in February the similar sanctions it imposed on Vietnam. "Both countries are Communist, both have a single party system, and both have a centralized economy." Bolanos does not believe the UN Human Rights Commission 11 March decision to condemn Cuba reflects the country's isolation. "It just proves the organization is subordinated to the United States." He said he believes the opening of the Cuban economy will not destabilize its political system. He cited the former USSR as an example of the "illusion of capitalism" and mentioned the PRC and Vietnam as examples of Communist countries that have modernized their economies without losing political stability. Bolanos, the first ambassador to Brazil since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations seven years ago, will become the Cuban deputy foreign minister.
