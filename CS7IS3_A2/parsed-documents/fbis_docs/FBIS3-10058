In a 90-second report from Oruro, the announcer comments on university students' plans to stage demonstrations today protesting the central government's failure to meet fund allocation demands; on confirmation by the departmental offices of the Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, that local streets will be blocked for one hour, beginning 1500 GMT, in rejection of the government's failure to meet workers' petition; on a regional meeting of union leaders to begin at 1830 GMT to schedule ways of exerting pressure on the government during this week; and on a Mining Corporation of Bolivia, Comibol, deadline today for miners to tender their voluntary resignation and thus become entitled to a $1,000 bonus. In a one-minute report from Cochabamba, the announcer comments on the declaration of a state of emergency in the tropical Chapare region following frequent clashes between coca growers and Mobile Rural Patrol Unit, Umopar, agents because coca growers refuse to have their plantations eradicated even though, in some parts of the department, they are growing more coca than the compulsory coca eradication program allows. In a two-minute report from Potosi, the announcer comments on the miners' harsh criticism of the current administration and describes the tragic situation prevailing inside Unificada mine where water supply, air supply, and electricity have been suspended to force miners to voluntarily resign. The announcer also reports on the situation reigning at other local mines and protests about the $1,000 bonus from which, in several leaders and workers' opinion, a large amount will deducted under the concept of social contribution. In a two-minute report from Santa Cruz, the announcer comments on local university students' refusal to suspend demonstrations -- which on 25 February ended in violent clashes with the police and a large number of people injured -- unless government meets their fund allocation demands, and on student leaders' protests over police violence during said demonstrations.
