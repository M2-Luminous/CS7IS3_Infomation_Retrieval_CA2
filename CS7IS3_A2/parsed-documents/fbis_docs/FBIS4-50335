The COA issued eight permits to export 321 tons of old frozen whale meat between 1988 and 1993, said Li Jen-chuan, director of the COA's Fishery Department. "The meat had been stockpiled before Taiwan formally banned commercial whaling in 1981," Li explained. The International Whale Commission did not formally ban commercial whaling until 1985. Taiwan decided to allow exports of such meat only after it could not obtain assistance from the United States and Japan for handling the meat, Li noted. Taiwan originally had 450 tons of whale meat in its stockpile, but 129 tons of the meat rotted while in storage. Local dealers managed to sell the remaining meat by October 1993. The last batch, weighing 220 tons, was exported to Singapore. Li said the 232 metric tons of whale meat the U.S.-based Animal Welfare Institute claimed it had found in the Russian port of Vladivostok was not necessarily from Taiwan. "If the meat was old and frozen, it might have been transshipped to Russia by the Singaporean company which first bought the meat from Taiwan," Li said, adding that no international trade rules can prevent such transshipment. If the meat was fresh, Li said, it might be Singaporean traders who used the Taiwan-issued export permit for old frozen whale meat to ship the fresh meat to Russia. "We hope the American conservation group can further investigate the case before blaming Taiwan," Li said. "It's unfair to fault US for failing to prevent whale meat smuggling," he added. Li made the statement after the U.S. group, in a Tuesday news conference in Washington, D.C., accused Taiwan of being involved in a smuggling operation orchestrated by Japan's largest whale meat distributor.
