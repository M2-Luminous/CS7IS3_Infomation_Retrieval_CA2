Nothing for us. The San Cristobal talks. Period, paragraph. To the people of Mexico; to the peoples and governments of the world; to the nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]; to the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas; to the national commissioner for mediation; to the local and international media: The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] hereby addresses itself to you to report and state the following: 1. As reported in due time, the EZLN's CCRI-CG has completed a consultation in all of the villages that comprise and support it, the committee. Through the assemblies of communities and regions, we have learned about the feelings in our people's hearts. 2. The EZLN's CCRI-CG has counted the votes on the Federal Government's peace proposals presented during the talks in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. 3. Here are the results of the free democratic voting: 2.11 percent voted for signing the government peace proposal; 97.88 percent voted against signing the government proposal. 4. In terms of the proposals on what to do if it was decided not to sign the government's proposals, this is the result: for resuming hostilities, 3.26 percent; for resisting and calling for a new national dialogue with all honest and independent forces, 96.74 percent. 5. Consequently, and by an agreement of the Zapatist majority, the EZLN's CCRI-CG hereby announces: The federal government's proposal for a peace agreement is hereby rejected. The San Cristobal dialogue is declared terminated. The people of Mexico are hereby called to a national dialogue with the country's progressive forces. The central subjects of this dialogue will be democracy, freedom, and justice for all Mexicans. In order not to back down in the search for a political solution to the conflict, and in order not to interfere with the upcoming August's electoral process, the EZLN's CCRI-CG has ordered all regular and irregular forces throughout national territory and abroad to extend the cease-fire, refrain from attacking the Armed Forces, and permit the upcoming elections. The EZLN guarantees that no offensive actions will be conducted against the Federal Army if the EZLN is not attacked. The EZLN will not hinder the upcoming elections in the territories under its control and will permit the installation of electoral sites under the surveillance of the NGO's and the International Red Cross Committee. The EZLN will accept absolutely no assistance from the federal, state, or municipal governments and will resist the siege solely with its own means and the Mexican people's help. 6. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, for his true efforts in the search for a political solution to the conflict. Unfortunately, the government's historical blindness keeps it from understanding that its refusal to yield to the impetus of democratization will lead the country into a painful confrontation whose consequences are unpredictable. 7. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, national commissioner for mediation, and his team for their efforts and sacrifice in mediating between the conflicting sides. We thank the team for their strength in resisting pressure and threats, as well as their willingness to listen. We hope that in the new stage of dialogue we are hereby calling for the team can join with its honest participation in the search for a political solution for the national demand for democracy, freedom, and justice. 8. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks the honest and independent media for their efforts in learning the truth and disseminating it to the Mexican people regardless of threats, pressure, or blackmail. We hereby apologize if, through our unschooled media policy, we angered them or mistrusted them. We expect them to understand that we had never before fought a revolution, and that we are undergoing a learning process. We hereby reiterate that, thanks to the press, the military stage of the war was stopped. We sincerely hope they will understand our difficult situation and the unfair selection and the elimination of those media that had access to us. We hope they continue along the path of truth. 9. The EZLN's CCRI-CG particularly thanks the NGO's, the vanguard of civilian society. The NGO's play an objective role in attaining the peace with justice and freedom that our people desire. The government's stubbornness has prevented any agreement so far. We remain open to dialogue and are willing to walk on the road that you marked for us: the political path that leads to democracy. 10. The EZLN's CCRI-CG greets all men, women, children, elderly people, and the faceless people throughout the country and abroad, who have expressed their solidarity and support for our cause. Our struggle is for you, our brothers. Our death is for you, also. We will not rest until all Mexicans, Indians, peasants, workers, employees, students, housewives, neighbors, honest artists and intellectuals, the retired people, the unemployed, the outcasts, and all of the voiceless and faceless men and women can have everything necessary for a worthy and true life. Everything for everyone. Nothing for us. As long as the national flag does not fly over Mexican territory in democracy, freedom, and justice, we, the tender fury, wlll continue to fight. Democracy! Freedom! Justice! [Signed] Respectfully, the CCRI-CG of the EZLN [Issued] From the mountains of the southeast, Chiapas, Mexico, June 1994
