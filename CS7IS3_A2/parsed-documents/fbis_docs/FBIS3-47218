Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said at a meeting of cabinet ministers that the retail price of rice from California should be 70 percent of the standard price of Japanese rice and rice from China should be sold at 60 percent of the ordinary domestic rice price. Japan is importing rice on emergency basis in the current fiscal year due to a bad crop in 1993. In the meeting, Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency said, retail price-setting should be consumer-oriented and the government should advise retailers to show the year of production of the rice they are selling. A committee meeting of the Rice Price Council will be held Thursday to discuss the retail prices of such imported rice. Kubota called on Hata to ensure that the price for rice to be imported from next fiscal year beginning in April under the government's minimum access policy should be set at a council meeting before the government officially decides the price, ministry sources said. Japan has decided to partially open its rice market under an agreement in the Uruguay round trade talks which were wrapped up in December.
