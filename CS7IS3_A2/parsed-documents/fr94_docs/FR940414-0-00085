FR940414-0-00085 FR940414-0-00029 Finally, Mr. Green seems to use the concepts of hold capacity and catching capacity interchangeably. While the ability to catch fish is undoubtedly tied to hold size (or under-deck volume), the relationship between these variables is not necessarily one to one, and the relationship may be different in different fisheries. NMFS' initial uncertainty regarding this relationship prompted examination of actual highliner production records and eventually led to modification of NMFS' initial proposal. Comment 17: Several commenters representing the operators of factory trawlers favored the NMFS initial proposal (Initial Alternative I) because it was based on data from the highest producers and, of the three alternatives, best reflected actual historical production by factory trawlers. They argued that factors such as product quality and problems with flesh deterioration limited the ability of factory trawlers to increase production. Response: In the NMFS Initial Alternative I proposal, the non-increasing (flat) part of the formula for vessels larger than 200 ft (61.0 m) exaggerated the fact that not very much increase was observed in this range. Actual production figures do indicate a modest increase in historical production as vessel size increases. In addition, the original analysis focused on assessing the conservatism of the formula by comparing a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel's catch capacity with that of factory trawlers. Drawing on the example in the response to comment 2, under Initial Alternative I, a 300-foot (91.4 m) factory trawler would need ten 60-foot (18.3 m) permits or 3.6 90-foot (27.4 m) permits. The ten 60-foot (18.3 m) permits represent a whiting capacity of about 4,700 mt per week, a reasonable amount of conservatism compared to a factory trawler's historical production of about 2,000 mt per week. However, the 3.6 90-foot (27.4 m) permits would represent a minimum of 2,200 mt per week, which is not only below some of the peak weeks observed for factory trawlers, but also provides no protection for the possibility of factory trawlers improving their production in the future. Since NMFS cannot rule out the possibility that factory trawlers will increase production in the future through effective scouting or other operational changes, a reasonable amount of conservatism is justified. NMFS believes that conservatism is supplied by the schedule promulgated by this rule (NMFS preferred approach). Changes From the Proposed Rule The proposed rule did not indicate how NMFS would determine the number of rating points for vessels for which the length overall is in fractions of feet (e.g., 70.39 ft (21.4 m) length overall). NMFS will calculate the number of rating points for fractions of a foot by multiplying the fraction by the difference in the rating points assigned to the lengths (in whole feet) immediately above and below the length overall measurement of the vessel, and adding the resulting number of rating points to the number of rating points for the nearest integer below the length overall measurement. For example, the total number of capacity rating points for a vessel with a length overall of 70.39 ft (21.4 m) would be 22.92 (the capacity rating for a 70-foot vessel) plus 0.39 ร the difference between 23.74 (71 ft; 21.6 m) and 22.92 (70 ft; 21.3 m), or 0.39 ยง0.82=0.32. Thus, the total number of rating points for a vessel with length overall of 70.39 ft (21.4 m) is 22.92+0.32=23.24. Minor editorial changes are made to ยง663.33(g) for clarity. Classification This final rule has been determined to be ``significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. This final rule is published under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act), 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator), has determined that it is necessary for management of the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. At the proposed rule stage, NMFS certified to the Small Business Administration that the NMFS preferred approach or Initial Alternative I or II, if adopted, could have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. Although the cost to a vessel owner of purchasing additional permits to combine for use on a larger vessel would be offset by the greater fishing effectiveness and larger profit potential represented by the larger vessel, vessel owners may be adversely affected by not being able to obtain the appropriate combination of permits or by having increased permit costs due to the possible absence of permits for sale endorsed with the appropriate vessel lengths. As a result, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis was prepared. After the close of the public comment period, a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) was prepared. Based on information contained in the FRFA, NMFS concluded that this action will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of fishermen. The Assistant Administrator finds good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act to make this rule effective upon filing at the Office of the Federal Register. If this rule is not effective by April 15, 1994, some fishing vessels will have to cease fishing until such time as the rule is effective, because the regulation that requires each vessel to have a limited entry permit with a size endorsement no more than 5 ft (1.5 m) shorter than the vessel's length overall will take effect. Immediate effectiveness is necessary to prevent a hiatus in the fishery for some vessels. Therefore, delaying the effective date of this rule is contrary to the public interest. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 663 Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: April 8, 1994. Rolland A. Schmitten, Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 663 is amended as follows: PART 663_PACIFIC COAST GROUNDFISH FISHERY 1. The authority citation for part 663 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. 2. Section 663.33(g) is revised to read as follows: ยง663.33 Limited entry fishery_General. * * * * * (g) Combining limited entry permits. Two or more limited entry permits with ``A'' gear endorsements for the same type of limited entry gear may be combined and reissued as a single permit with a larger size endorsement. The vessel harvest capacity rating for each of the permits being combined is that indicated in Table 1 of this paragraph for the length overall (in feet) endorsed on the respective limited entry permit. Harvest capacity ratings for fractions of a foot in vessel length will be determined by multiplying the fraction of a foot in vessel length by the difference in the two ratings assigned to the nearest integers of vessel length. The length rating for the combined permit is that indicated for the sum of the vessel harvest capacity ratings for each permit being combined. If that sum falls between the sums for two adjacent lengths on Table 1, the length rating shall be the higher length.
