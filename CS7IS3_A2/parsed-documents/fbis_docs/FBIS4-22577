(As it is known, according to the Crimean Constitution, the president heads the Cabinet). Saburov, who was born in the Crimean city of Yalta, accepted the invitation and parliamentarians confirmed him on this post at the last session of the republic's Supreme Soviet. Our Interfax correspondent Yuriy Shein speaks with Yevgeniy Saburov who has recently visited the peninsular [as received] about the Crimea's problems, prospects of its development, and mutual relations between Kiev and Moscow. [Shein] What are your impressions concerning the visit to the Crimea? [Saburov] In the course of my trip I had to closely associate with the Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and to see what he has been done, to analyze the measures proposed to the republic by different experts including representatives of the previous composition of Crimea's Cabinet of Ministers and by different commercial structures, governmental departments, and by initiative groups and parties. A total of 16 programs have been put forward for consideration. As a matter of fact, the greater part of these programs lacks technological aspects, they have no logical conclusion and are of a purely conceptual nature though they present a certain interest. The proposed programs suffer from one major shortage -- it is impossible to fulfil them. These are not programs but just good intentions and concepts which have not been calculated from the economic point of view. However, one can consider them and "improve" them to the level of draft decrees. The Moscow experts, and, in particular, experts from the Moscow State University, have done at least one fourth of this work. [Shein] What economic problems enjoyed priority during your trip? [Saburov] First of all, it was necessary to make it clear what role plays Crimea's Cabinet of Ministers and what is the situation with the management in the economy. [sentence as received] The republic's previous leadership was not ready for democracy; nobody has ever thought that the existing power bodies can loose [as received] during the presidential elections. The reaction of certain circles in Simferopol with respect to Meshkov's victory was just a hysterical one. As a result of Meshkov's unexpected victory they have entirely withdrawn despite the need to organize the spring sowing campaign, to get ready for the summer vacation period, and presence of numerous everyday problems because this period is the decisive one for the rest of the year. Consequently, due to the offense, because the people have voted not in such a way as the previous leaders would have preferred, they were ready to leave the Crimeans literally in hunger and in cold. This is the supreme level of political tactlessness. However, this line of behavior is peculiar only to the representatives of the supreme echelons of power. The people from the next link of the management chain remained absolutely calm regarding the results of the elections. In general, they did not demonstrate their political likings but honestly fulfilled their duties. Though there were some exceptions, it, for example, concerns Crimea's Agriculture Minister Yegudin. [as received] He reported both in Kiev and Simferopol that the situation with fertilizers on the peninsular is rather good. However, it appeared that the situation in this field is just catastrophic. It seems that by his statements Yegudin wanted to discredit Crimea's new government. I'd like to repeat that, as a rule, the sabotage was peculiar only to the supreme echelons of power. [Shein] However, these people still hoped to continue their work in the new composition of the government, didn't they [Saburov] It was quite clear that they would not enter the new Cabinet -- some of them were incompetent, some of them were "stained" because the level of corruption in the Crimean Government was rather high. It's interesting to note that there were attempts "to fail" Meshkov even after these elections; the statement stating that Meshkov would stay at power only for four months which was voiced by the Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia V.Kryzhanovskiy [name as received] testifies to this fact. An artificially created shortage of bread and other goods in Crimea would probably be one of the reasons of his dismissal. However, I think that these actions have not been planned beforehand, the question primarily concerns a spontaneous hysterical reaction. [Shein] What is the reaction with respect to Meshkov's victory in the regions? [Saburov] I have visited Kerch, Bakhchisaray, the Simferopol region, the peninsular's southern coast and met with leaders of several farms and enterprises. I must say that they demonstrate a positive reaction with respect to the recent events. If earlier under the pressure of the official propaganda the majority of the leaders of this level perceived Meshkov as an extremist then now, when they saw his concrete moves and actions (I believe that one of them is my invitation to the post in the Crimean government), they have radically changed their opinion. It became clear that the question concerns a normal life, raising of the people's well-being, and, first of all, the need to abolish several Ukrainian decrees regarding the economic activity in the Crimea. As a result, Meshkov's rating started to grow. The world practice demonstrates that the popularity of a new president falls immediately after his elections, it is a natural phenomenon. We watch quite an adverse situation in the Crimea -- Meshkov's rating has grown even in the circles which looked at him with some fear. It is very important because this knocks out the ground from under those who thought that the president would quickly "fail," that he came to power thanks to populist slogans. Now the people understand that Meshkov is a serious politician who demonstrates a well balanced approach to different problems and they agree to work with him. That's why there is a kind of perplexity among his opponents now. [Shein] What is the position of the Crimean Tatars? [Saburov] This is a serious problem. Kiev persuaded the Crimean Tatars that Yuriy Meshkov is a Russian nationalist who would not take them into account. A great part of the Tatars gave their backing to him, however, these were inactive layers of the population who are not interested in political activity. These people are not noticeable on the public arena. For their part, the most politicized layers of the Tatars counted on Kiev. Now it is clear that Crimea's new leadership has no anti- Tatar moods and understands the tragedy of these people (in 1994 all Crimean Tatars were deported to Siberia and Middle Asia -- Interfax). Meshkov managed to persuade the Tatars in his deep interest in peace and stability on the peninsular and his sympathy towards them. Of course, there is still no special kindness but there is no sharp confrontation either. However, after the Tatars' attitude towards the new Crimean leadership started to improve it seems that certain political circles outside the Crimea started to demonstrate that they do not need stability and peace on the peninsular. Of course, if the Crimean-Tatar people happily live in the Crimea then there will be no need in noisy TV shows, loud statements, and stormy meetings in the defense of the "oppressed" Crimean Tatars, that is those factors thanks to which the functionaries try to earn their political capital. Russia must seriously think over this question -- Kiev has allocated material aid to this deported people and where is Moscow? [Shein] What is your opinion concerning the relations between Simferopol and Kiev? [Saburov] The situation is not quite clear. Kiev has not demonstrated any objections regarding my candidacy. In accordance with the developed scheme I signed a statement with a request to grant the Ukrainian citizenship to me; the major obstacle was removed by this move. However, there is still no answer to my request. I believe that leaders in Kiev, both the present ones and those who will come to power, must be interested in the Crimea's well-being and in its relations with the Russian Federation. The existing discrimination of the Crimea cannot last for ever, the politicians must understand this. The will of the people is an exclusively serious thing. Objectively, the appointment of a professional economist to the high post in this important for Ukraine region is a positive factor. However, there are certain circles in Kiev who stake on the Crimean problem during the pre-election campaign. These people deem it important to declare about their Ukrainian patriotism, that's why they artificially aggravate the situation on the peninsular. They do not occupy high posts but they represent rather a garish group interested in stirring different kinds of conflicts. I hope that the Ukrainian president has enough wisdom not to go after these "functionaries." There are no such functionaries in the Crimea. It maintains a provincial calm atmosphere and is concerned over the solution of social issues. [Shein] What can you say about the industrial sector of the republic? [Saburov] The presence of a great number of highly skilled workers is peculiar for the Crimea. In my opinion, there is no such a region from this point of view on the whole territory of the former Soviet Union, including the Baltic states. Who can boast about this in Russia? The Crimea produces tankers for the countries of the Western Europe. Where in the former USSR the production of the electronic industry can compete with the western one? The goods produced in Simferopol can find a good market. The predatory Ukrainian laws present the main misfortune. According to them, we are to pay 50 percent of the currency earnings to the state on an extremely low rate, not in accordance with the exchange one. For example, Kiev, say, offers 9000 Ukrainian coupons for one dollar and its real price is 36,000 coupons. It is unprofitable for enterprises to work for export under this situation. It is necessary to remove these obstacles and to create a normal currency exchange. The question concerns enterprises of a European level. As far as Crimea's agriculture is concerned, it has nothing in common with the ruined Russian collective and state farms. These are like large factories on the land built on analogy with the conveyer industry as, for example, the wine producing factories where there is no farms, this stage is left in the past. Here the production is organized in accordance with the modern technology and science, it's the XXth century. In order to privatize these factories without destroying the established system it is necessary to handle them in such a way as the Russian industrial giants -- it is necessary to trade them but not to dismember. Directors of these enterprises are well educated people having high intellectual needs. Unfortunately, all of them are in a difficult economic situation due to the system of mutual payments between Kiev and Moscow, existence of customs offices, levying of customs tariffs, etc. One should take into consideration that the Crimea's economy is oriented towards the Russian Federation but not Ukraine. Russia, especially the Russian North, has been also the major consumer of the Crimean products. The ports on the peninsular have been built given this factor. The break in its relations with Russia places the Crimea on the brink of survival. That's why the demand to restore these relations are not of a nationalist overtone on the part of the Crimeans but a natural strive to restore the previous contacts. The republic has been deprived of the market, it is a real strangling of this region. [Shein] The Crimea possessed the best resorts in the USSR... [Saburov] Now the Crimean budget is arranged in such a way that the recreation branch with its sanatoriums and rest houses represents a stone on the republic's neck as it brings no profits but necessitates appropriations. This is caused by the existing taxation system and distribution of the expenditures and revenues part of the Crimean budget. It is necessary to create a real bank system, to let foreign banks, primarily the Russian ones, to the Crimea. Let the Turkish, Swiss, and other banks act in the Crimea, God bless them. Currently Russian banks actually cannot function in the Crimea, they are being choked, and the Crimean ones are rather weak yet. [Shein] What is your opinion about Sevastopol? [Saburov] Sevastopol is a city with highly professional branches of industry which has much in common with Kerch and Simferopol. The greatest naval base which must contribute something into the Crimea's budget is situated here. I believe that a good trade and passenger port can also be created here. There are rather many minor political intrigues of provincial scale around the Crimea. Several politicians would like to withdraw Sevastopol from the composition of the Republic of Crimea. These people do not look into the far future they cannot think strategically and imagine whereto this course can lead. I think that this issue can be removed by means of a rational explanation of the situation to the citizens. That's why, I think that the situation in Sevastopol is very difficult. At the same time I'd like to stress that the policy of a forcible Ukrainization of the Crimea and stirring of anti-Russian moods on the peninsular is very dangerous. The Crimea is a Russian-speaking region. However, the republican radio stations broadcast their programs in the Ukrainian language. It has only several minutes a day to broadcast in the Russian language. This irritates the population greatly. The TV programs from Moscow are also broadcast not to the full extent. There is no popular TV channel NTV at all. One can permanently listen to songs in the Ukrainian language and see Ukrainian dances. I am not against them but one should observe certain boundaries. The people are irritated. [Shein] Do you acknowledge the Crimea's joining Russia? [Saburov] I do not think that one should raise the issue on the Crimea's withdrawal from Ukraine. There exists a Ukrainian law on delegation of authorities between the Crimea and Ukraine. I cannot say that this is a masterpiece of the juridical thought, it is compiled extremely illiterately, one article contradicts to another one. Nevertheless, this decree grants a substantial independence to the Republic of Crimea and we intend to use this opportunity. It will be beneficial for Kiev, Simferopol, and Moscow. If there are no artificial obstacles and politically shortsighted moves on the part of Kiev then the Crimea will be able to play the role of a bridge between Ukraine, Russia, and other countries of the former Union, it will become a kind of an account center, something like a free bank republic or something like this. It is technically feasible under the presence of good will on the part of all parties. I'd like to note that against the background of the growing offensive of anti-democratic forces in several republics of the former USSR, the Crimea remains a democratic region. Everything what happens here is done in accordance with the will of the people. That's why we are extremely surprised by the behavior of several countries which deem themselves strongholds of democracy especially when they oppose the will of the Republic of Crimea's citizens. I'd like to ask these people to seriously treat the situation and understand that Simferopol makes an interesting attempt from the international point of view, it is going to create a normal democratic market economy after the insane failures of various experimentators. [Shein] What do you await from Russia? [Saburov] First of all, we must reach an agreement with Moscow to restore the economic ties. According to available information, Russian enterprises are interested in the Crimea's production and in the development of further contacts. As I have already said, the proposed programs of economic reforms in the Crimea appeared to be non-technological ones but there are highly qualified experts in Moscow who can render their assistance. I am very thankful to Leonid Kuchma (Ukraine's former premier -- Interfax) for a very interesting phrase which concerns the entire situation in this region. When certain circles in Kiev started to declare "Why should we invite someone from the outside, are there no people among us?" minding my invitation to the Crimean government, Kuchma said: "Why we can invite advisers from Canada and the United States who do not know our situation and we cannot invite a native Crimean?" I do not want to boast but there are highly professional people in Russia who understand our situation, who could work here and not go in for politics. However, I'd like to repeat once more that economic and intellectual contacts with the Russians are extremely important and one should not forget that in the moral plan Moscow is in a great debt in the face of the Crimean Tatars. [Shein] What relations do you intend to maintain with the present Russian government? [Saburov] I believe that the relations will be businesslike ones and, of course, not such as now. Naturally, they would depend upon the post occupied by this or that person. For example, one acts as the Crimea's representative and another one as the representative of Moscow, etc. I think that private relations and the knowledge of who is who would positively affect our relations. There is no need to get acquainted because everybody knows each other. [Shein] Can we speak about the personal composition of the government now? [Saburov] The new government will be formed in the near term. I want to invite several intelligent professionals from Moscow. There are many people wishing to come to the Crimea to work, but I do not think that all of them fit this work. We need those who really fit this sphere but it is rather difficult to persuade them to leave Moscow and to live in the Crimea. This work in not just for one or two days. Many people offer their services as consultants. I am not quite satisfied with this either, we can use Moscow's consultations. In Simferopol we need those who are able to really rule. They will face rather high demands and the selection will be tough as well. I hope to find support in the apparatus which already exists in the Crimea. As I said earlier, it is quite workable. However, it is impossible to establish contacts with several people from the supreme echelon. One cannot lean on them as they can let down at any moment. According to the Constitution, one cannot appoint the government in the Crimea, in contrast to Russia, as it is the prerogative of the Supreme Soviet. That's why its too early to speak about the composition of the Cabinet, I shall just select people and the parliament will pass a corresponding decision. [Shein] How do you work with Meshkov? [Saburov] We interact with Yuriy Meshkov rather well. In general, he granted freedom to me, a kind of "a cart blanche" in several spheres. Everything what concerns the economy is in the sphere of my competence and he, what is natural, solves the political issues. However, it is difficult to draw a precise line here. I think that the Crimea faces different, rather serious, problems but there is no problem of the Crimea as such. It has been invented, it is just a card in the play of politicians who do not live in the Crimea. On the whole, the atmosphere is splendid there, I like the Crimea during the winter-spring season very much. One should go and rest there, quietness and calm reign there. [Shein] And now my final question. You have recently visited Great Britain and France. With whom have you negotiated there? [Saburov] We planned this trip long ago and I went there as the Director of the governmental Information and Social Technologies Center. However, it is quite clear that after my appointment to the post of the Crimea's vice premier the tasks of this trip have changed. As a result, I managed to hold several meetings which were not scheduled beforehand. In accordance with the mutual consent of the parties we did not hold any official contacts on the state level. I think that there is no need to force this process. The conversations with representatives of business circles of Great Britain and France who are interested in their presence in the Crimea were very interesting. I shall not speak about concrete projects, the future will tell... It is important that we have already reached several agreements. I even had an impression that there is something more appealing in the Crimea for the western businessmen than in Russia though this comparison is tactless -- the scales are quite different. I am especially thankful to Mr Lionel Stolarue who has done much to introduce me into the world of the French business. Earlier I knew him thanks to his splendid economic works, now I am quite sure that this prominent scientist and state functionary is an excellent man in the supreme notion of this word. He is sincerely "ill" with the Crimea's problems. I congratulate Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk with such an adviser and wish him to more often listen to the recommendations of Mr Stolarue. In general, I'd like to underline that the Republic of Crimea intends to widely use the law on independent foreign economic activity granted to it in accordance with Ukraine's law. The guarantee of our survival lies in our openness. When this interview was ready for publication we learned that on Monday, March 28, Yevgeniy Saburov flew to Simferopol to his new place of work.
