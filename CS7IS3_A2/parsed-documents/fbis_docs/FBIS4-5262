It seems to me that you felt you could no longer remain in the post of premier because of the issue of ethics. You said that not even a single day of stagnation can be allowed in politics. Under the current situation, your sudden announcement may confuse the political situation and invite further distrust of politics, depending on circumstances. As a leader of Japan, what do you think of your decision to resign? Also, when did you make the decision? [Hosokawa] You are quite right. As I have said earlier, there are many diplomatic and domestic tasks which need to be settled. Also, deliberations on the budget, which is closely linked to the people's livelihood, has been stalled. Indeed, I have said earlier that not even a moment of stagnation can be allowed in politics. However, I have decided to resign as prime minister. This is a decision made after much careful thought. The moral responsibility of a top political leader is heavier than anything. On that basis, I came to the conclusion that it was necessary to straighten myself up. Based on this decision, I considered various possibilities and came to the conclusion on my own. [Unidentified reporter] As you were explaining the reasons for making the decision to step down, you said that a new problem had been found. You also said that this was a legal problem. It seems to me that your explanation regarding the decision to resign as prime minister -- who is the most responsible planner -- while the deliberations on the budget remain paralyzed are not adequate. Can you explain in concrete terms what you were trying to say? [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, we are seeking to find out the truth. I want to reveal the details of the problem after the investigations are finished. I explained earlier that such a doubt came out. I forgot about answering the question asked earlier. I was asked when I decided to resign. The details I revealed were reported to me by my office late last night. I made the decision late last night. [Unidentified reporter] Your resignation will certainly create some sort of vacuum on the political scene, and your resignation over the scandal will seriously damage the public's confidence in political circles since your administration was inaugurated to carry out political reform. I would like to have your comment on that point. Also, could you explain your standpoint as a party head, or an individual politician, on the future direction of a political party realignment? [Hosokawa] Concerning the first question, I think the most important point is that a person should sincerely reflect on his or her own problems and correct them if necessary. So I decided to candidly acknowledge the presence of such problems, and to make them public. I believe my decision will be somehow helpful for easing public distrust of politics. To win back the public's confidence in politics, I think my decision was much better than covering up the fact. That is why I took this action, and I have stressed this is a bed-rock principle of my party. I wanted to match my actions with my words. With respect to future realignment of political parties, I cannot say too much about that issue right now because I still have responsibility as prime minister. [Unidentified reporter] The Hosokawa administration was inaugurated eight months ago amid the great expectations of the public. How do you evaluate the eight-month rule of the Hosokawa administration? [Hosokawa] I have fully referred to that in my statement. As a reform-oriented administration, my cabinet has been fully grappling with internal and external problems which have been pending for decades. Fortunately, we have reached some noteworthy achievements owing to public support. While these are still incomplete, we have at least gained some clue to settling long-pending issues. I personally have a sense of satisfaction right now, and I suppose both the Japanese public and the international community would give me a certain level of credit for my work. [Unidentified reporter] Could you describe the schedule for your formal resignation? And, could you explain your opinion on the qualifications of the next prime minister to replace you? [Hosokawa] Regarding the future political schedule, I have responsibility to pass the budget bill, and I would like to consult with the ruling and opposition parties on this matter. Concerning favorable characteristics of my successor, I think it is inappropriate for me to comment on that. [Unidentified reporter] Before you made the decision, did you consult with some politicians, friends, or your family? [Hosokawa] I talked with my wife last night. [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that basically the framework of the current coalition government should not be changed even after your resignation, or do you think you do not mind even if the framework of the coalition government is changed as part of the regrouping of political parties -- in other words, do you think it is possible to reorganize the framework of the coalition government on condition that the new government take over the tasks the Hosokawa government has left? [Hosokawa] I think it desirable that the new prime minister take over the tasks my government has set. But I do not think I should comment on this. [Unidentified reporter] My question relates to the question you have just answered. Your government is the first non-Liberal Democratic Party government in 38 years. You have managed the government for eight months. Are you confident in saying that coalition is the desirable way to form a government? [Hosokawa] It is a very difficult question. I think it has both good and bad aspects. [Unidentified reporter] A while ago you said it is your responsibility to have the budget bill passed. Do you mean you intend to remain in your current position until the bill is adopted? [Hosokawa] I think it depends on when and how the succeeding prime minister will be chosen. [Unidentified reporter] Would you please state your present.... [interrupted by another reporter] [Unidentified reporter] I think the people are very interested in knowing the main reason for your resignation. Would you please explain a little bit more about the newly surfaced problem? [Hosokawa] It is just as I explained to you a little while ago. Investigations are underway now to throw light on the problem. I want to swiftly reveal the details of the problem upon completion of investigations. [Unidentified reporter] Would you please state your present state of mind? [Hosokawa] I commented on my state of mind a little while ago. Basically, my government has attained its goals to a certain extent, but I am personally dissatisfied with what the government has achieved. I deeply regret that in the current situation, where we face a lot of problems both at home and abroad, I have failed to fully meet the people's expectations. I apologize to the people because, at this juncture wherein there are a host of domestic and foreign important issues, I had to decide on resignation in this way. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when do you intend to dissolve the cabinet? [Hosokawa] I have no idea at all. [Unidentified Reporter] How about the timing of choosing your successor? [Hosokawa] I have no idea. It is completely beyond my scope. [Unidentified reporter] When do you think it is desirable? [Hosokawa] As soon as possible. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, [word indistinct] are you thinking of accepting the opposition parties' call for summoning to the Diet those concerned with your pecuniary relations with Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co? [Hosokawa] I have already stated my position on this matter. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when you assumed the office of prime minister, you said it is necessary to join forces in politics mindful of the people. Do you think you have achieved this goal and satisfactorily answered the people's expectations? [Hosokawa] I think there are various ways to interpret the phrase "politics mindful of the people." I, with the mandate of the people, am confident that I have directly tackled and fulfilled my task of carrying out responsible reform without hesitation. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, I want to ask about choosing your successor. How do you think the framework of the succeeding cabinet should be, and is there any possibility of tying up with the LDP to cope with internal and external problems? [Hosokawa] I cannot make a prediction. I have no idea. [Unidentified reporter] Please answer this question as head of the Japan New Party [JNP]. Is there any possibility that the JNP will join the opposition camp depending on the line-up of a succeeding cabinet, or will the JNP still remain with the ruling parties to fulfill its duty? [Hosokawa] Of course, it depends on who will be the next prime minister, but I think our party members have a strong desire to continue to come to grips with domestic and foreign problems as members of the ruling parties. [Unidentified reporter] Who is investigating the newly surfaced problem of 1981? [Hosokawa] My office is conducting the investigations. [Unidentified reporter] How about you, Mr. Prime Minister? [Hosokawa] Of course, I have been informed of the details. However, there are minute details, and each item is being checked one by one. [Unidentified reporter] When do you think most of the facts will be revealed? [Hosokawa] I do not know. I hope they will be revealed as early as possible. [Unidentified reporter] Do you plan to continue your political activities as the head of the Japan New Party after you resign as prime minister? [Hosokawa] Yes, I do. [Unidentified reporter] [passage indistinct]. [Hosokawa] What did you say is in a delicate situation? [Unidentified reporter] The economy. [Hosokawa] Oh, the economy. Of course, there are signs of economic recovery but the most important thing is for the government to implement its pump-priming packages in such a way that they will steadily yield the desired results so the economy will be put on track toward full recovery. Needless to say, it is also an important task for the government to have the fiscal 1994 budget bill passed as early as possible. Until the next prime minister is elected, we will do our utmost to fulfill this task. I am sure the next prime minister will make his own efforts toward this. [Unidentified reporter] Will your resignation affect [words indistinct]? [Hosokawa] I can hardly say my resignation will not affect them at all. But basically, they are moving in a favorable direction. I am confident that the current political difficulties will soon be resolved. You do not have to worry about them. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you have said you plan to continue your political activities as JNP head after your resignation but you reportedly plan to form a new party together with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party]. Will you promote this plan after your resignation? [Hosokawa] I want to refrain from making comments on this matter. [Unidentified reporter] You expressed regret that you have to resign in this manner, before fulfilling your duties. But I cannot dispel a concern that your resignation might affect efforts for three reforms, including economic and administrative reforms. I wonder if you have to [words indistinct]. Do you attach importance to realizing these reforms in selecting the next prime minister? [Hosokawa] I think I should not say anything about the selection of my successor. As I said earlier, We are still uncertain when we can achieve economic and administrative reforms, but we have clearly indicated measures to achieve them. What the government should do next is to steadily implement them. When the Hosokawa government was inaugurated last August, it planned to compile bills on decentralization of political power and on public information disclosure before the end of the year, and to submit them to an ordinary Diet session. This plan has not changed. [Unidentified reporter] You earlier explained about your 100-million-yen loan. Did you say that you have not paid the interest on the loan? You also said investment activities are legally questionable. Which law are you talking about? Is it the law that deals with tax and tax evasion? [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, I cannot tell more because the whole affair is still under investigation. I said such investment activities might have dubious legality. I will clarify everything when all the facts are unearthed. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. [Unidentified dean of press corps] Your question will be the last. [Unidentified reporter] Just as you set a time limit for the enactment of political reform bills, I hope you will set a deadline for disclosing the facts, rather than saying you will clarify things as early as possible. If all of them are not revealed by the deadline, you can disclose the facts unearthed by that time. [Hosokawa] I cannot decide on a deadline by myself because I have to hear others' opinions. We have worked hard to discover the facts, and as a result we learned new details yesterday. Although we intend to make further efforts, we cannot tell when all the facts will be revealed. [Dean of press corps] We will accept one more question. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, countries such as the United States and South Korea put their expectations on you because you are young. You said you will continue political activities as JNP head. Do you have a desire to take the premiership again if you have such an opportunity in the future? [Hosokawa] I am not thinking of this at all. [Dean of press corps] We now conclude the news conference.
