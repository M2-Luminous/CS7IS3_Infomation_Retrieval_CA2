This is due to the fact that the Russian government is taking steps that can take the place of ratification by the Russian parliament of the agreement concerning establishment of the center, which has been delayed by a conflict between the reformist and conservative factions. These steps will be completed in November and the agreement is expected to become effective 1 month after that. Once the center begins operation, it is expected to spur conversion of Russia from a military to civil state and contribute greatly to global security. Research themes for the center already are being studied by representatives of all the countries, and the center finally is about to be realized, 1 year and 8 months after it was conceptualized. The international S&T center will be established with the goal of preventing the proliferation of nuclear related technology that would result if scientists and technicians that were involved in weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and their delivery were to pour out to other countries because of the domestic economic and social chaos caused by the breakup of the former Soviet Union. These scientists and technicians will be given research projects and there will be joint research and technology and knowhow sharing. The concept of the center was proposed by the United States, Germany and Russia in February 1992. Japan decided to participate in March of the same year. Germany's participation evolved into EC participation, and the center became a quadrilateral joint project. Also, in April, Japan announced that it would contribute $20 million over 2 years; the United States will contribute $25 million, the EC 20 million European currency units (ECU; equal to $24 million), and Russia will provide the facilities. In November, the four parties signed the agreement to establish the center; Japan and the United States ratified the agreement on the same day, and EC ratification came thereafter. As for Japan, the Foreign Ministry, MITI and the Science and Technology Agency (STA) each has been allocated $3 million from the FY93 budget to support research at the center to convert nuclear related technology to power generation technology. Also, if the center is established, the Foreign Ministry's deputy director general for arms control and scientific affairs Hayashi will serve as an executive director and a senior official of the STA will serve as a deputy secretary general of the center to provide active support to the management of the center.
