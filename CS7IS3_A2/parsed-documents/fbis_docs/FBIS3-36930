The troops were engaged in fighting with armed gangs some 400 times on the Tajik-Afghan border and killed 700 of them. On that border section alone they confiscated five tonnes of narcotics, as well as other contraband to the sum of four billion roubles. Those figures were cited by Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of the Russian frontier guard troops, published today in the new weekly GRANITSA ROSSII (Russia's Border). Its first issue was brought out today. The issue opens with an appeal by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who believes the newspaper should become an effective instrument of the implementation of Russia's border policy, of the military-patriotic education of frontier guard troops and the population in the interests of ensuring reliable protection of Russia's borders and its territorial integrity. The weekly gives wide coverage to the Army service of Russian frontier guard troops at the borders of Russia and the new commonwealth and carries reports from the Pacific coast, the south Kurile islands and other regions, as well as from the Tajik-Afghan border where the situation has not changed much of late. The troops are continuing their routine studies and training sessions.
