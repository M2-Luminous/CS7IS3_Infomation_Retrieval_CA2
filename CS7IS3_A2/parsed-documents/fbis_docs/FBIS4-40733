Asked whether he could draw a parallel between the issue of Crimean autonomy in Ukraine and that of Palestine in Israel, the minister answered in the affirmative: "Undoubtedly so. In both cases, efforts to improve relations are more expedient than amending borders. Under conditions of tension, there is no point in talking about borders. An atmosphere of mutual respect should be created. This would guarantee success in our negotiations in the United States. Progress begins when the sides realize that force gives in to intelligence."
