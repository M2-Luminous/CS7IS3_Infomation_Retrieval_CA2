FR940617-0-00119 FR940617-0-00026 EPA also disagrees with commenters who believe that only engines ``fixed'' in place for more than 12 months should be excluded from the nonroad definition. An internal combustion engine can be stationary without being ``affixed'' to the ground or other structures. To require otherwise could result in the improper classification of internal combustion engines. For example, an engine that is not bolted or otherwise attached to a structure but remains at one location for five years would be classified under the commenters' proposition as a nonroad engine, even though it operates in a stationary manner, as evidenced by its remaining at the same location for an extended period of time. Therefore, the Agency has decided that the fact that an engine is not ``affixed'' to the ground or other structure does not necessarily identify the internal combustion engine as a nonroad engine. The Agency also believes that 12 months is the appropriate time limit for determining whether an internal combustion engine which is either portable or transportable is to be classified as a stationary engine. Generally, engines that remain at one site for more than 12 months will stay at that site either permanently or for an extended period of time. In such cases, local or state air quality agencies should be able to regulate the applicable engines as stationary sources, since the emissions impact is occurring over a period of time which is likely to have a measurable impact on an area's air quality. The term ``location'' has been defined so as to permit a ``location'' to exist within a facility. Section (2)(iii) of the revised definition defines ``location'' as ``any single site at a building, structure, facility or installation.'' This definition of ``location'' provides more precision in classifying an engine as nonroad if the engine is actually intended to be used in a mobile manner within a stationary source. In other words, an engine would be considered nonroad if it moves to different sites within a stationary source. EPA does not agree with the assertion made by one commenter that title V of the CAA evidences Congress' recognition that some stationary sources are moveable. Title V of the CAA deals with the permitting of stationary sources and not with the determination as to which internal combustion engines are nonroad engines and which are stationary engines. 4. Nonroad Engines Manufactured Prior to the Effective Date of This Definition In the initial NPRM, EPA noted that it interprets the exclusion in CAA section 302(z) to apply only to those internal combustion engines that are manufactured after the effective date of these regulations. EPA stated that this interpretation avoids a regulatory gap for engines manufactured between the promulgation of the CAA and the date that these regulations are promulgated. EPA received several comments opposing this interpretation. These commenters claimed that the language in section 302(z) applied to all nonroad engines at the time of the passage of the 1990 CAAA, even though that term had not yet been defined with any reasonable clarity. In addition, commenters asserted that nonroad engines are generally preempted from regulation by states under title II of the Act. EPA continues to believe that internal combustion engines manufactured prior to the effective date of these regulations should not be considered preempted nonroad engines. First, EPA believes that until the regulations finalizing the definition of nonroad engine (as well as the regulations determining the scope of the term ``new'' as applied to nonroad engines) were complete, no state or other entity could be assured whether such engines would be defined as nonroad engines or as stationary internal combustion engines and the extent to which state regulations of such engines was preempted. Congress clearly intended EPA to determine which internal combustion engines should be defined as nonroad engines and which should be stationary internal combustion engines. 12 As has been discussed above, the final definition of nonroad engine promulgated today is substantially revised from the definition originally proposed. Moreover, as the comments reveal, numerous other definitions of nonroad engine have been suggested to the Agency, many of which are either significantly broader or significantly narrower than EPA's final definition. EPA believes that if the exclusionary language of section 302(z) were applied before EPA's definition of nonroad engine became final, states would have been frustrated from regulating any internal combustion engines manufactured during that time, given the uncertain nature of such engines. For example, a state would not know whether to include regulations of engines in its New Source Review program, or whether such engines should be regulated in a separate in-use operation program. Further, until the initial regulations regarding nonroad engines were finalized, states could not determine the extent to which their regulation of such engines would be preempted, and thus were hampered from going forward with specific programs to regulate such engines. EPA believes that Congress did not intend states to be prevented from regulating these engines before EPA defined what they were. In particular, EPA believes that permits for internal combustion engines issued prior to July 18, 1994, are not precluded under section 209 and 302(z) if the permits apply to internal combustion engines manufactured before July 18, 1994, even if those engines are of a type that has been defined by EPA to be nonroad engines. 12 See Report of House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rept. 101&hyph;490, at 272 (May 17, 1990). Moreover, even to the extent such engines are defined to be nonroad engines in this final rule, such engines were not preempted from state regulations under section 209 prior to the effective date of these regulations. The two sections of the Act preempting state regulation of nonroad engines, section 209(e)(1) and section 209(a) (as incorporated by section 213(d)), refer to ``nonroad engines subject to regulation under this Act'' or to engines ``subject to this part.'' EPA believes that, until EPA promulgated final regulations defining nonroad engines and subjecting such engines to regulation, these engines were not preempted from state regulation under the Act, nor were they subject to any regulation under title II of the Act.
