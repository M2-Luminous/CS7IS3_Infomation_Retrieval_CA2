Ambassador Cha made it clear today that North Korea has no intention to accept additional inspections by saying that North Korea had already shown everything that needed to be open, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency is making an unreasonable demand to North Korea even though it has been proven through inspections that there were no problems of nuclear weapons development. Ambassador Cha also strongly implied the possibility of nuclear weapons development by North Korea by saying that it is no longer a secret that the ROK and Japan are developing nuclear weapons, and that Japan's nuclear armament is particularly a serious problem and if North Korea developed nuclear weapons, it would be basically to restrain [kyonje] Japan.
