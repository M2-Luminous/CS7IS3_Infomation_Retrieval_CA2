The British delegation, led by John Major, will depart for Moscow on 14 January [as heard]. The main objective of the talks with our leadership is obvious: to assess the new balance of forces in Russia after all those reshuffles -- on the spot. After that, there will be a visit to Nizhnyy Novgorod, which the British view as a model for creating market infrastructure with Western help. What about British interests? After all, if they are coming to us, they must also want something. We came to Downing Street to ask this question. [Begin recording] [Gurnov] Mr. Major, there is a lot of talk now about helping Russia, but is there anything Russia can do to help Britain? [Major, in English with superimposed Russian translation] Russia is an enormous and strong power, and it is in British interests to have good relations with you. Therefore, we are ready to help you try to overcome your difficulties, but you are right. Russia has something to offer, not only to Britain but to the whole world. The president, the prime minister, and I will be discussing this during the summit. [Gurnov] The British prime minister will be the first Western leader to visit the Kremlin after the NATO decision on Yugoslavia, which was adopted today and which now threatens to mar Russia's relations with the West. In the light of this, what will be John Major's main task in Moscow? [Major] I would like to stress that NATO is not taking anyone's side in this conflict. We want to find a way to stop the bloodshed while negotiations continue. We have no other option. I am sure that Russia's objective is the same. Because we have similar aims, we have a basis for dialogue. [end recording] [Gurnov] Moscow's task will be to give Major a message for the Western world at a moment when both our home and foreign policies certainly need explaining; that is, if Russia still wants to continue being a part of this world.
