The party's political council, led by Yegor Gaydar, announced that it would insist on the resignation of Stepashin if the latter did not distance himself from the earlier made statement that he was in favor of violating the rights of the individual, if this individual is a criminal. Mikhailov said that by making such a statement during the enlarged session of the Collegium of the Prosecutor-General's Office on June 23, Stepashin meant the right "to kill, rob and rape", appropriated by criminals. He also said that Stepashin, the chairman of the former parliamentary committee for investigating the activities of the KGB, had a clear position: the campaign to combat crime must be put on a solid legal footing. The counterintelligence personnel intend to act in strict accordance with legal acts while implementation the presidential decree on combating organized crime, said Mikhailov. He said the people who are trying to play the FCS card once again must not forget President Yeltsin's statement that "a strong Russia needs strong special services."
