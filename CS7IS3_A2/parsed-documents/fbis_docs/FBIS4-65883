Your country has dispatched the largest military contingent within the framework of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. What is your assessment of the presence of French units in the former Yugoslavia from the point of view of French interests in the Balkans? [Leotard] From the beginning, France has been pursuing a policy of active presence in the former Yugoslavia. This involvement seems natural to us: As President Mitterrand has said, what is happening in the former Yugoslavia "concerns us." The people of the former Yugoslavia are our neighbors and their problems -- ethnic, social -- concern Europe. The stability of this complex Balkan region will partially depend on the outcome that this conflict will eventually cause. Therefore, the crisis merits not only our attention, but also our active involvement. This concern compels the French Government toward constant diplomatic efforts, the aim of which is a balanced and lasting peace settlement. Nevertheless, the presence of French units in Bosnia and Croatia is not only linked to French interests in the Balkans: The mission of the blue helmets in Bosnia is, first and foremost, a humanitarian mission (accompanying convoys, providing an air bridge, dropping food and medicines from aircraft, removing mines, and renewing public services). France could not stand ildly when confronted with the urgent needs of such a suffering people and, therefore, our military contingents are involved fully in these humanitarian missions, which always carry some risk. [CESKY DENIK] At the moment, it seems that the NATO ultimatum in Sarajevo has been crowned in success. In your opinion, is it at all possible to supervise militarily the observance of other possible protection zones? [Leotard] It is certainly possible to supervise militarily adherence to these ultimatums. This has been made clear, especially in Sarajevo, where the UNPROFOR units and military observers have not only been overseeing adherence to the agreement, but -- on the other hand -- have also been bringing the city to life. This supervision, however, requires a large military presence. Whereas the United Nations requested 10,500 troops to guarantee adherence to the agreements -- which is the bare minimum -- the international community could only react by making an offer corresponding to half this number. France has 800 more men here. Under these circumstances, the United Nations must work with the numbers it has at its disposal and must expend a great deal of effort in providing for the most pressing needs. [CESKY DENIK] Mr. Minister, do you think that the West made a mistake in its policy toward the former Yugoslavia? [Leotard] The activity of western countries in the former Yugoslavia could seem hesitant or put off for too long. When the effects of the ultimatum are considered, the question of why it was not made sooner is often asked. We would have made it if the situation earlier had met with political will, as was the case in February. It is impossible to forget that this activity is being carried out within the framework of the United Nations, which is responsible politically for the entire operation in the former Yugoslavia. The countries involved in Bosnia and Croatia have fulfilled the mandate, a mandate that was again determined by specific options. The West's international and military organizations (the European Union [EU], NATO, and the Western European Union [WEU]) do not have to be ashamed of their activity. Seven EU members have troops in the former Yugoslavia, all the others are providing aid, sometimes considerable aid, and they are accepting numerous refugees. As far as the West's diplomatic activity is concerned, it has been conducted particularly forcefully with the aim of finding a real solution to long-term problems. [CESKY DENIK] Do you think that international organizations like NATO or the United Nations have a chance -- following their experiences in Somalia and now in Bosnia -- of resolving local conflicts in the future? [Leotard] We have to learn from the major crises of the past two or three years. The UN operations in Cambodia, Somalia, and Bosnia -- although very different -- suggest that blue helmet missions should, in the future, intervene closer to open conflicts or local clashes rather than merely uphold the traditional role of supervising the suspension of hostilities. Then, within this framework, the international community must formulate clear political aims and the feasibility of supervising directly the command of the military forces in the area of their deployment. Undoubtedly, an important prerequisite for this is to ensure that, next time, the United Nations or the CSCE rely on the resources of military organizations such as NATO or the WEU, which have the possibility of intervening with maximum efficacy. I emphasize this point, for experience from Bosnia has shown us that there is no purely military way out of such complicated conflicts.
