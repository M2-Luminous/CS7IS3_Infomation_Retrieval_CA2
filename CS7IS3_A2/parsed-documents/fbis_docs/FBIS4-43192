Vance will also meet with Skopjean Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. [Begin Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas recording] Our position on the issue of Skopje's name is firm. We will not recognize a state that has the term `Macedonia' in its name. Furthermore, a condition for the lifting of the embargo is a change of Skopje's flag, either by amending the constitution, or having Skopje submit a binding peaceful declaration to the United Nations. It should confirm at the first opportunity that it will take the necessary steps in parliament to change the relevant articles of its constitution. [end recording]
