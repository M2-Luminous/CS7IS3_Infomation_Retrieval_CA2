He added that Slovakia did not need a greater concentration of power in the form of a presidential system. The most burning problem with which the cabinet had to deal was the condition of the state budget, Moravcik said. He rejected "the transferring of problems into the future" by increased borrowing, saying that in addition to saving money taxes had to be raised. Talking about the results of his government's work, he emphasized preparations for the acceleration of privatization, support to small and medium-sized businesses and Slovakia's increased credibility abroad, even though investors "were waiting tensely for the results of the autumn elections." He admitted that the government had not managed to deal with the insolvency of state companies, and the practical functioning of the screening law also remained an unanswered question. Deputy premier Ivan Simko said that during its one hundred days the government had given 43 bills to parliament, most of which dealt with crime, the situation in the state administration, the restoration of purity to political life and bringing Slovak law closer to the requirements of the European Union. Asked whether Slovakia remained a legal state even without the screening law being respected, Simko said that due to unclear competence after the division of Czechoslovakia several laws could not be put into practice. "We cannot observe the screening law, because no organ exists to give out certificates," Nonetheless, he admitted that the solution of this technical question had come up against the political problem of disagreement between the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the coalition. Unlike the premier, however, Simko considers it possible to find a way out of the problem by the elections. Dialogue and the attempt to find a compromise could ensure that the present coalition continued to exist after the elections. Moravcik also said that the differences of opinion between the post-communist SDL and the rest of the coalition with regard to privatization methods "do not concern ideas," and that agreement had been reached as to the extent of coupon privatization. "People's security has become the number one political problem," Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said. Between the beginning of the year and the end of May,the percentage of all crimes solved had risen from 28.3 to 38.5 per cent, with the success rate for solving economic crimes having almost doubled, going from 40 per cent to nearly 80. The result was that people had more confidence in the police, even though crime was on the increase and drug abuse spreading, and the revelation of police corruption remained a problem. Moravcik confirmed that he would probably meet Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus unofficially at the Central European Initiative meeting in Trieste. However, he believed that some of the problems between the Czech and Slovak republics would remain unsolved. Although he rejected opposition pressure to increase further protectionist measures, and admitted that "the partisan method of introducing the imports surcharge is not a good solution," nonetheless Bratislava had managed to "smooth away" displeasure from GATT and the imports surcharge would remain in effect until the end of the year.
