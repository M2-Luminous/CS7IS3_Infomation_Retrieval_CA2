During a news conference on the second and final day of his working trip to Paraguay, Robaina said that one of the main reasons for his South American tour was to advertise investment opportunities on the island. During Robaina's trip to Paraguay, several political leaders from the South American country called for the restoration of diplomatic ties between the two nations, which were broken during the sixties because of pressure from the United States on the Paraguayan Government. The request was made by Senators Carlos Romero and Eugenio Zanabria, both members of the ruling Colorado Party [National Republican Association] and Manuel Benitez, leader of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, the foremost opposition party. The Cuban foreign minister is concluding in Paraguay a tour that included official trips to Uruguay, Peru, and Argentina.
