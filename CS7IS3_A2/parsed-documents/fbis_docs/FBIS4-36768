Informed sources in Amman have said that at 2000 yesterday, Syrian officials summoned the Jordanian ambassador in Damascus to inform him of the decision to postpone the visit, without setting a new date. Damascus has expressed dissatisfaction with a report published by a London-based newspaper that said Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al- Salam al-Majali had told the Jordanian House of Representatives that his country's reply to the Syrian request to set up economic integration is that Amman believes in coordination provided that the relationship is not based on slogans and emotions alone. Al-Majali quickly denied this report, accusing the newspaper of publishing incorrect and distorted reports. He also stressed the strategic ties between Jordan and Syria. In addition, the Jordanian News Agency, PETRA, has asserted that King Husayn and President Hafiz al-Asad have decided to hold bilateral meetings in order to promote cooperation and integration and take advanced steps on the road to unity and comprehensive integration. While in Amman, Al- Zu'bi was scheduled to discuss prospects for setting up economic integration between the two countries. Syria has also expressed displeasure over a Jordanian newspaper editorial urging Amman to go ahead in its negotiations with Israel without waiting for Damascus, which, according to the writer, has made progress on its track with the Jewish state without consulting Amman. The Syrian newspaper TISHRIN replied to that editorial with a strongly worded article asserting the commitment of Amman and Damascus to joint coordination. At any rate, political quarters here have not ruled out the possibility that Damascus also wants to express its dismay at the Jordanian-Israeli agreements signed in Washington on border demarcation, water, and security, especially transferring the negotiations to al-'Aqabah and Elat in July.
