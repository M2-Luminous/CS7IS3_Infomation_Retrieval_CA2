Speaking about Egypt's role, the writer says: "It has become clear that the Egyptian regime is the one which champions such a call among the Arabs for opportunistic and selfish reasons" and because the Egyptian regime "seeks a role for Egypt other than the natural one it assumes within its Arab environment and because it wants to take quick steps toward normalization with the Zionist enemy after it used to be afraid or to hesitate in taking such steps." Continuing to speak about Egypt's role in this respect, the article says: "It would be politically naive to deal with a historic enemy of the Arab nation which has established its parasitic entity by usurping its lands, plundering its rights, and flouting its dignity." The article wonders about the blind Egyptian confidence in an enemy "which has not given up, as yet, its designs to swallow more Arab land and targets Arab resources such as water and oil?" Explaining why such a market is impossible to establish, the writer says: "The enmity between the Arabs and the Zionists is not a transient one, originating from temporary differences between two countries and which can be settled during negotiations and later forgotten. It is a historical enmity between a usurper which not only does not want to give up what it had usurped but seeks to usurp more, and the victim which is asked to give up its rights by force under the canopy of unequal circumtances." The article says that under the plan for a Middle East Market, Israel would gain everything such as new markets, the possibility to exploit oil sources, and many investment opportunities while "the Arab nation is asked to give up its unity, sacrifice its cultural identity, forget its usurped rights, and submit to a fait accompli." The article contnues: "It would be better for those who champion the establishment of economic blocs and those who search for benefits to be gleaned from such blocs to join their voices, if they are sincere, to those advocating Arab economic unity, or at least to those who call for an Arab common market that will fulfill the aspired objectives." The writer further says: "The establishment of an economic unity, or common market among countries which belong to the same nation is the most logical, scientific, objective, and concrete action which is in harmony with historical and geogrqaphic considerations and with the masses' present and future aspirations." The writer adds: "As for the Middle East market, it will be a market of material gains in which the Arab nation's enemies, the usurpers of its land and those who covet its resources will have their say and the lion's share." Concluding, the writer says "The Middle East market is needed for specific reasons that serve the Zionist entity alone, legalize its usurpation, provides it with stability and security, solve its economic bottlenecks, realize the Zionist scheme, and enable it to systematically plunder Arab resources." The article ends by asking "what forces Arabs to give up their pan-Arab project and rush down the road to a Middle East market?"
