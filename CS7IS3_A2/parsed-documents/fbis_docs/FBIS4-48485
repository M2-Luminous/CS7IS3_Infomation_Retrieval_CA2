In a two-page statement, the group, which includes: Comrades Yomi Olusanya, Adetola Oseni, Chief Dayo Abata, Mrs. M.I. Akpankpa, Dr. David Ogunsede, and Chief Tayo Soyode, said it would be strategically unwise and politically suicidal for any ethnic group to boycott the proposed national constitutional conference. The group recalled the experience of the nation in calling for a similar boycott order, by those it described as progressives in the 1964 federal elections, and declared that it would be wiser to use the constitutional conference platform to build a genuine national consensus for a fresh re-examination of the aborted democratic march, than to boycott it. According to the group, a boycott of the conference will turn the gathering into a conspiracy theater, and will not be in the long-term interest of any ethnic group.
