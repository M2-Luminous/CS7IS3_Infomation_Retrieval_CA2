A planned meeting here between Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky will take up issues that have not been covered in recent working-level procurement trade talks, the official at the Foreign Ministry told reporters. "Quantitative criteria" as a tool to assess Japan's government procurement market is among the remaining issues put on hold until the coming high-level talks, the official said. The official was briefing reporters on Tuesday's working-level meeting on medical equipment trade. Trade in medical equipment, covered in the discussions on government procurement along with telecom trade, is one of the three priority fields under the bilateral trade "framework" negotiations launched in July last year. Working-level talks on telecom trade were held in Tokyo last Friday, with the most sensitive issue of how to set "quantitative criteria" also held over for the coming high-level meeting. The working-level medical equipment talks, shortened to a one-day session from the originally scheduled two-day meeting, were held in "a good admosphere," the official said. Tuesday's talks were devoted to explaining Japanese-proposed steps contained in a March market-opening package as a way to enhance foreign access to Japan's medical equipment market, according to the official said.
