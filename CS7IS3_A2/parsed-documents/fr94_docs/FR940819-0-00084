FR940819-0-00084 FR940819-0-00019 Historical Review In 1985, the FAA received two petitions for rulemaking requesting limits on flight and duty hours for flight attendants. One petition 1 sought to establish flight and duty time regulations similar to current regulations for flight crewmembers. The other petition 2 recommended establishing maximum duty time limits and minimum daily, weekly, and monthly rest periods. Both petitions recommended certain flight time limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants that were more restrictive than those that existed for flight crewmembers. The FAA denied both petitions in a Denial of Petition issued on January 23, 1989, because the action sought by the petitioners was not warranted by the information, views, and arguments contained in the petitions. 1 This petition was submitted by the Association of Flight Attendants and summarized in the Federal Register (50 FR 6185) on February 14, 1985. 2 This petition was submitted by the Joint Council of Flight Attendant Unions and summarized in the Federal Register (50 FR 25252) on June 18, 1985. Congressional legislation (H.R. 638 and S. 1170) was introduced in 1989 to establish flight attendant duty time limitations. On May 17, 1989, the Subcommittee on Aviation of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation held a public hearing on H.R. 638. At the hearing, the FAA stated its intent to initiate further studies of air carrier flight attendant scheduling practices. The FAA completed its ``Report on the Study of Current Industry Practice-Flight Attendant Flight, Duty, and Rest Times'' on September 12, 1989 (hereafter referred to as ``the Industry Study'' [Docket No. 27229]), and submitted a copy of the study to the House Subcommittee on Aviation. The study focused on U.S. air carrier scheduling practices and flight attendant actual work hours and highlighted cases of extended duty periods and minimum rest periods. The study indicated that flight attendant duty hour problems may occur more frequently among certain industry segments because of fundamental operational differences. The study noted that most air carriers had policies to address these problems. The study provided a framework for the FAA to address this issue with appropriate regulatory action, which is provided in this final rule. The House Subcommittee on Aviation held another hearing on flight attendant duty and rest on March 13, 1991. The FAA did not recommend rulemaking at that hearing. Subsequent legislation on flight attendant duty and rest, H.R. 14, was passed in the House of Representatives. In 1992, the language of H.R. 14 was incorporated into a provision in the House and Senate versions of the FAA's appropriations bill; however, that provision was deleted later by the conference committee. On January 5, 1993, H.R. 14 was reintroduced in the House of Representatives. On March 26, 1993, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Notice No. 93&hyph;3, Flight Attendant Duty Period Limitations and Rest Requirements (58 FR 17024; March 31, 1993) that proposed duty period scheduling limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants engaged in air transportation and air commerce. The FAA has incorporated into this final rule comments on the NPRM received from the public during the comment period, as appropriate. Discussion of Comments Fifty-one commenters submitted comments in response to the NPRM. The commenters included trade and professional associations, individual flight attendants, labor organizations, part 121 and 135 operators, public interest groups, a government agency, a Member of Congress, and other individuals. Among the commenters were the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA); the Air Transport Association (ATA); the Allied Pilots Association (APA); the American Cyanamid Company; AMR Combs; the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions; Delta Airlines; Great American Airways; the National Air Carrier Association (NACA); the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB); North American Airlines (NAA); the Regional Airline Association (RAA); Southwest Airlines (SWA); Sun Country Airlines (SCA); Transport Workers Union Local 556 (TWU Local 556)_Southwest Airlines; and flight attendants, some of whom are employed by America West Airlines; Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines. Commenters addressed general and specific issues such as scheduled versus unscheduled operations; the application of flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants; rest period requirements; duty period requirements; augmented crew requirements; reserve and deadhead status for flight attendants; flight attendant responsibility; the costs contained in the initial regulatory evaluation; and the implementation period for this final rule. Commenters also addressed the issues of flight attendant fatigue, the Industry Study, international versus domestic operations, part 125 operations, and flight attendant duty limitations and rest regulations in other nations. Overview of the General Issues Thirty-nine comments addressed the concept of regulating flight attendant duty period limitations and minimum ``rest period'' requirements. Fourteen comments did not support establishing flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements while 18 comments did support establishing such limits and requirements based on certain revisions to the proposed rule. The commenters who supported regulating flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements included ALPA, APA, The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, NTSB, nine commenters who identified themselves as flight attendants, and a member of Congress who strongly supports the comments of the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions. The commenters stated that, because a flight attendant's primary duties are safety related, establishing regulations would enhance public safety.
