Our correspondent reports that Ayatollah Javadi Amoli expressed this matter at the Friday prayer service held at Mosalla-ye Qods [a place for public prayer] in Qom. He said that the people must be present on the scene and the country's officials must direct their efforts toward solving the existing problems and inadequacies. He glorified the Islamic Revolution of Iran and said that the revolution's slogans must be preserved. The temporary Friday imam of Qom, having mentioned the virtues and graces of this humanizing month of Ramadan, asked believers to get close to God by devoting themselves to self-making acts and behaviors.
