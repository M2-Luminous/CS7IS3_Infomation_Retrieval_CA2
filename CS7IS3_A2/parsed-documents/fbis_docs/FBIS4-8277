Paasio said that the Czech Republic, given its interest in joining NATO, had a somewhat different idea about its security than Finland, which did not see participation in a military grouping as its way to security. "The roles of our countries in the Partnership for Peace project are therefore somewhat different but the two countries will be complementing each other," he said. Paasio said that within the Partnership Finland was sharing its experiences with United Nations peace-keeping operations but did not intend to participate in joint military exercises of the countries which participate in the project. Paasio mentioned similar efforts of Finland and the Czech Republic at approaching the European Union (EU) and achieving full membership of European economic structures in the long run. He voiced the hope that trade between Finland and the Czech Republic would be more extended in the future that it has been before.
