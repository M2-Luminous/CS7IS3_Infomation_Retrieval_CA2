"We want to ensure the national interests of both states on their outer frontiers," Nikolayev said at a meeting with Kazakh frontier forces senior officers. He said one of the serious problems to be resolved is the possibility for Russian officers to serve in Kazakhstan and for their Kazakh counterparts in Russia. About 270 border troops officers have filed applications requesting their transfer to Russia, according to the Kazakh frontier forces headquarters. On December 24, 1993, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan signed a memorandum on cooperation to protect their outer frontiers. The memorandum stipulates that the protection of borders is their common task which should be carried out on the basis of bilateral or multilateral agreements. If Russia and Kazakhstan iron out the existing disagreements, the talks may result in the signing of a bilateral document on cooperation in border protection. Nikolayev has been authorised to sign such an agreement by President Boris Yeltsin. Speaking about the general situation in the Russian border troops, Nikolayev said they will number 250,000, plus 30,000 workers and employees. At present, there are 206,000 people in the border troops and more 7,000 vacancies for officer positions.
