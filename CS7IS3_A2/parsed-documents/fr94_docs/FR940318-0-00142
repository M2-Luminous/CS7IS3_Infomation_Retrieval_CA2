FR940318-0-00142 FR940318-0-00023 p. Residential air conditioning and heat pumps. HCFC&hyph;22, a class II substance, is the dominant working fluid in residential air conditioning and heat pumps. This end-use includes both central units and window air conditioners. SNAP will begin analyzing class II substance substitutes in the near future. Results of these analyses will appear in quarterly updates in the Federal Register . q. Heat transfer. This end-use includes all cooling systems that rely on convection to remove heat from an area, rather than relying on mechanical refrigeration. There are, generally speaking, two types of systems: Systems with fluid pumps, referred to as recirculating coolers, and those that rely on natural convection currents, referred to as thermosiphons. 2. Substitutes for Refrigerants Substitutes fall into eight broad categories. Seven of these categories are chemical substitutes generally used in the same cycle as the ozone-depleting substances they replace. They include hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrocarbons, blends of refrigerants, ammonia, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and chlorine systems. The eighth category includes alternative technologies that generally do not rely on vapor compression cycles. a. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). EPA believes that hydrochlorofluorocarbons have an important role to play as transitional refrigerants. HCFCs are chemically similar to CFCs except that they contain hydrogen in addition to chlorine and fluorine. Because their thermophysical properties are, in many cases, similar to CFCs, equipment designed to use CFCs can often be retrofitted to operate with HCFCs. In addition, new equipment can be designed specifically for these compounds. HCFCs contribute to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, but to a much lesser extent than CFCs. Use of HCFCs as transitional refrigerants will allow industry to move away from CFCs more rapidly and, therefore, will offer significant environmental and health benefits over the continued use of CFCs. Because they contain hydrogen, the HCFCs break down more easily in the atmosphere than do CFCs, and therefore have lower ODPs. Their global warming potentials are also lower than those for the CFCs. Production of HCFCs is controlled under the international agreement set forth in the Montreal Protocol, which is being implemented in the U.S. through the Clean Air Act. HCFCs were initially scheduled to be phased out by 2030. As a result of growing evidence indicating greater risks of ozone depletion, however, the international community agreed in Copenhagen in November 1992 to accelerate the phaseout of the ozone-depleting compounds, including HCFCs. As a result, EPA published an accelerated phaseout of HCFCs on December 10, 1993 (58 FR 65018). The proposed accelerated schedule places production and consumption limits on the most potent ozone-depleting HCFCs first, with the production of HCFCs with lower ozone depletion potentials (ODPs) permitted over a longer period of time. There are clear environmental and health benefits to be gained by allowing near-term use of HCFCs until substitutes with zero ODP are developed. b. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Hydrofluorocarbons do not contain chlorine and do not contribute to destruction of stratospheric ozone. However, some HFCs do have significant global warming potentials (GWPs). Although a few HFCs have been in use for some time, the potential for HFCs as a replacement for CFCs has grown rapidly over the last several years. EPA is concerned that rapid expansion of the use of some HFCs could contribute to global warming. Nonetheless, HFCs as a class offer lower overall risk than continued use of CFCs, as well as a near-term option for moving away from CFCs. c. Hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons do not contain chlorine or bromine; they therefore also have zero ODP. Hydrocarbons degrade in the lower atmosphere, contributing to ground-level pollution such as smog, but they do not contribute directly to global warming. Propane, ethane, propylene, and to some extent butane are used as refrigerants in specialized industrial applications, primarily in oil refineries and chemical plants, where they are frequently available as part of the process stream and where their use contributes only a slight increment to the overall risk of fire or explosion. Because of the overall risks, these systems are designed to meet rigid requirements for reliability, durability, and safety. Hydrocarbon refrigerants are also used in some home appliances. In general, they are effective refrigerants and may provide some gains in efficiency over CFCs. EPA believes refrigeration end-uses may exist for this class of compounds, but such determinations will require analysis of appropriate controls to address the risk of fire. d. Blends. Blends of refrigerants offer significant opportunities for alternatives to class I substances. The number of single-substance substitutes is limited; combinations greatly expand the number of possible refrigerants. By varying the concentrations of the constituents, manufacturers may design blends for specific end-uses. Blends generally fall into two categories: azeotropes and zeotropes. Azeotropes behave like single refrigerants under normal conditions. They boil and condense at constant temperature and do not change composition across a phase change. Zeotropes, however, exhibit temperature glide, meaning that as the refrigerant flows across a heat exchanger, the temperature changes in response to differential boiling or condensing of different constituents in the blend. Known as fractionation, this process may pose additional risks if any of the blend's components are flammable, even if the blend as formulated is not. On the other hand, equipment designed to take advantage of zeotropic blends may reap energy efficiency gains. EPA expects blends to play an important role in the transition away from ODSs.
