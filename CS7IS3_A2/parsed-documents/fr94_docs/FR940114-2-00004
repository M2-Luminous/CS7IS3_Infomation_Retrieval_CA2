FR940114-2-00004 FR940114-2-00002 Forty years of fire suppression has dramatically increased the density of trees and the amount of dead wood, standing or on the ground. Members of the public have expressed concern over the large numbers of dead trees the amount of forest fuels now present. Many requests have been made for projects to remove timber to reduce safety hazards, fire danger, and to improve visual quality. Such projects would reduce the ``fuel loading'' and could decrease the risk and severity of a catastrophic fire. Additionally, thinning of overstocked stands can be an effective way to prevent future catastrophic insect and disease outbreaks. The environmental analysis provides the decisionmaker_the LTBMU Forest Supervisor with an evaluation of what will happen if nothing is done, and what may result from the proposed action, and other alternatives Such disclosure will allow a reasoned choice between management options. If an alternative other than No Action is preferable, then the work has to proceed quickly. If actively infested trees are removed before the onset of summer when the beetles fly, then fewer healthy trees may be attacked. On small scale, high value areas, such as the East Shore beaches, beetle suppression work may reduce the number of large Jeffrey pines that die. Further, trees that are harvested quickly will have more commercial value. The high cost of a predominantly helicopter operation could deter potential bidders as the soundness of the trees declines. Consequently, project implementation is expected to begin during the summer or fall of 1994. Over sixty agencies, organizations, and individuals were notified of this proposed project through the LTBMU NEPA Status Report. A public meeting was held on October 5, 1993 as part of the scoping process. Some people also provided written comments. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency staff was briefed about the project on November 10, 1993. The Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer has also been briefed. Originally conceived and publicly scoped as a project whose environmental analysis would be documented in an environmental assessment, it was determined in late December 1993 that its potential environmental effects warrant an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Project activities will adversely affect heritage resources in a National Register-eligible historic district. While the type of NEPA documentation has changed since the project's conception, the project itself has not changed. Consequently, only minimal additional public scoping will occur. A public and agency briefing on the project, to be announced in the Tahoe Daily Tribune and through letters sent to those parties who have expressed interest in the East Shore Project, will be held on January 26, 1994, at the El Dorado County Library at 1000 Rufus Allen Boulevard in South Lake Tahoe. Participants in the planning process will be sent copies of the draft EIS for the public comment period. Availability of the draft EIS will also be noticed in the Federal Register , and the Tahoe Daily Tribune, the LTBMU's newspaper of record. Written comments and suggestions received by January 24, 1994 will be addressed in the draft EIS. The ``no action'' alternative proposes a continuation of the current types of management activities currently conducted in the study areas, without imposing impacts from logging to heritage resources. Trees which pose hazards to life and property will be taken down. While the long-term management of the Genoa Peak road system is primarily for off-highway vehicle use, road reconstruction and maintenance at a logging truck standard along a portion of the road will be required to accommodate log haul for timber sales on the adjacent Toiyabe National Forest, as analyzed in the Carson District's Spooner Salvage Sale environmental assessment. Short-term road closures will prevent public recreation use of parts of the area during timber sale operations. Obliteration of nonhistoric nonsystem roads, maintenance of existing system roads and trails, watershed improvement projects, and study and management of the proposed National Register District will continue as part of ongoing programs. The ``salvage only'' alternative harvests dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over approximately 6,600 acres. No green tree thinning will occur. Removal of about 30 MMBF of both merchantable and unmerchantable material is anticipated. This alternative includes all components of the proposed action, except when modified as described: (1) While treatment of activity fuels will occur, only limited use of prescribed fire as a management tool is proposed, in selected areas, such as for use as a fuelbreak near urban areas; (2) site preparation and planting will occur on high value areas only (such as at the beaches and along roadway corridors) and natural regeneration only will occur in general forest zones; and (3) only temporary roads and landings used as part of the project will be obliterated.
