Listen now to a telephone conversation between reporter Zeneida Costales and (Yuri Guerra), collaborator in the U.S.-Cuba friendship caravan. [Begin recording] [Costales] First of all, we would like to know the main points discussed at the news conference. [(Guerra)] Three matters were the focus of the news conference: the two Canadian contingents that traveled from Vancouver and Montreal to the United States, the ecumenical alliance established between the Rainbow Coalition led by Jesse Jackson, and (IFCO), the principal organization of the Pastors for Peace; and two additional signatures of support to Rangel's request for an immediate end to the embargo. This is a victory for us -- acquiring new supporters for our cause through the U.S. Congress. [Costales] To your knowledge, what impact has this conference had on the U.S. media? [(Guerra)] This news conference was covered by National Public Radio at the national level. As you know, Rev. Jesse Jackson is well known in the country and worldwide. This has enhanced the importance of the event. [Costales] We appreciate these words by (Yuri Guerra), a collaborator in the U.S.-Cuba friendship caravan.
