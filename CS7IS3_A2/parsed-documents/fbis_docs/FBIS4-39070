According to him "there are few states so seriously and constantly interested in the situation in Moldova and therefore Turkey's economic interest and its military-strategic interest should not be neglected." He said that "President Demirel's arrival in Chisinau is an important step toward finding foreign partners that could support Moldova during its crisis." On the other hand Nedelciuc noted that "Demirel's arrival has implications that should worry those who carefully observe negotiations between Chisinau officials and Comrat separatists' representatives." He stated that he "was bewildered that the Chisinau officials went so far in the negotiations with the Gagauz representatives," when he studied the project on special status for Gagauzians. He mentioned that the project "contains provisions sometimes granted to independent states, but by accepting it parliamentary leaders will make not only a political but a historical mistake." According to Nedelciuc "if the talks between Demirel, Snegur and the Gagauzian side support this variant, the Parliament will not be able to impose another point of view, even though it will want to adopt a new law because Demirel's arrival will only complicate the situation."
