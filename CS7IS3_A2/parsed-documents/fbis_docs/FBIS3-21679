The program starts with a general review of the problem of drug abuse in the world and the international efforts to combat the problem. The program notes that "although Syria is not a country of drug plantation, processing, or production, it is--because of its location--a country of passage. Consequently, it is not immune to the threats posed by this problem. Syria, like other countries, is certainly a target for the merchants and traffickers of this fatal poison." The program adds that Syria has signed every international agreement and protocol on countering narcotics and is linked with several countries in the world by bilateral agreements on the subject. Syria is also a member of Interpol, which is a principal player in the war on drug trafficking, and has played a key role in formulating the unified Arab strategy on combating drug abuse and the draft unified Arab law on narcotics, the report adds. The program includes interviews with a professor of international law in Damascus University's Law Faculty who explains Syria's involvement in the world drive to combat drug abuse. He notes that a law on combating drugs was issued in 1992 and explains the provisions of that law, which stipulates severe punishments for producers, farmers, and traffickers of drugs. The law also stipulates provisions to fight drug-related money laundering, he says. In an interview for the program, the director of Ibn-al-Nafis Hospital in Damascus says a unit has been set up in his hospital to treat drug addicts free of charge. Patients, he says, are treated in strict confidence and no information about them is divulged to any one. The announcer notes that the Interior Ministry is providing every facility to help develop the anti-narcotics agencies to enable them to fulfill their duties. He says that Syria has scored major achievements in the fight against drug trafficking and confiscates and destroys large quantities of various narcotics each year.
