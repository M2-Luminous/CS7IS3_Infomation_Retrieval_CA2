Very little is known about the contents of Vance's set of ideas. However, there are reports that the proposed draft agreement has basic similarities with the one presented in May 1993 by Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen although it has some basic differences. According to information from diplomatic sources, the most significant difference is the separation of the confidence-building measures from the issue of the name. According to the same sources, in order to continue the current efforts, the international mediator has not made the lifting of Greek countermeasures a condition, as Skopje insists. Greek diplomatic moves are distinguished by a first phase that includes the formation of the preliminary conditions for the resumption of the dialogue and a second phase that includes dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations and economic cooperation measures between the two countries. Parallel meetings of experts from the two countries with Vance are expected in the next couple of days to discuss his proposals. Separate meetings between the UN mediator and the foreign ministers of the two countries are expected to follow.
