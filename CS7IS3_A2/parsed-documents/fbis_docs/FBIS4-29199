The organizers have collected signatures of 306 lower house legislators, including 42 ministers and parliamentary vice ministers who signed on condition that their names not be disclosed, they said. The other 264 signers comprise 60 lawmakers from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 34 from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ-- Social Democratic Party of Japan], 49 from Shinseito, 42 from Komeito, 28 from the Japan New Party, 14 from the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), 21 from New Party Sakigake, Group Seiun and Minshu No Kaze, five from the Liberal Party, five from the New Party Mirai, three from the former Kaikaku No Kai and three independents, they said. The campaign was arranged to prevent the LDP and the SDP from proposing a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata that could result in an early lower house general election held under the still-existing multiseat constituency system, they said. The organizers will show Hata the results Wednesday and urge him not to dissolve the lower house, they said. They will also meet SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and LDP President Yohei Kono to brief them on the outcome. Yuji Tsushima, acting chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council, and other organizers representing other parties met reporters to release the results of the campaign. The new electoral system, under which 300 out of a reduced 500 lower house seats would be elected from single-seat constituencies and the remaining 200 through a proportional representation system, was enacted in January, but it cannot take effect until boundaries of the 300 new single-seat constituencies are formally legislated.
