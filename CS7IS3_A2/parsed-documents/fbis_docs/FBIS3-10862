He also said he had not thought about changing his political plans until he finishes this mission, but political pressures have forced him to change these plans. In this manner, Manuel Camacho Solis said he does not accept any criticism of the actions or work he has carried out as a public statesman. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] It is being said that if Camacho makes a rival decision, he will accept the interests of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. No one, however, stops to consider that some of the programs he led in Mexico City continue to be supported by a majority in the federal district. I do not accept that some people want to make me a factor to explain the inefficiencies of others. Camacho has shown loyalty to the president of the republic, and he is [word indistinct] in the tasks that have been entrusted to him. [end recording] Later on, the peace commissioner clarified doubts on what is being said regarding his possible candidacy to the president of the republic. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Camacho will not be a problem so the candidacies can comply with their responsibilities of consolidating their campaigns and of showing their effectiveness to the people. The opening has always been there. Something I am not willing to do is to stop fully exercising my citizen's rights. [end recording] In conclusion, Manuel Camacho Solis reiterated his decision to continue fighting to strengthen the democratic system in Mexico, and he emphasized that is his commitment. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am not going to act under pressure or hastily. My task is to contribute to unity and to participate in the democratic transition of Mexico. What is the best way to do that? To be effectively loyal to the nation? That is the question. One path that I think is the most advisable for today, is if everyone would support the IFE [Federal Electoral Institute] and COFIPE [Federal Code of Institutions and Electoral Procedures] reforms in such a way that the Agreement for Peace, Justice, and Democracy, which the political parties and presidential candidates signed, is duly observed, and if conditions are right so I can contribute to the guarantee of the democratic transition. After I fulfill my mission in Chiapas, my role will be to support the democratic transition in Mexico and to defend its results. Another path is that if there is no progress toward democracy, if instead of agreements there is polarization, and if there is an effort to violate my rights as a citizen, then, after concluding my mission in Chiapas, I will make the necessary political decision for progress toward democracy and the promotion of Mexico's unity. Nothing is more important to me than to maintain and strengthen Mexico's unity. There cannot be unity if one has to forgo interests; unity is derived by feeling confident about legitimate interests and by opening the doors of institutions to the demands of justice by Mexican society and people. In other words, a unity that does not exclude, but rather one that is based on peace, justice, and democracy. That is my stand and that is the field in which I will work. Camacho will be a factor of reconciliation and stability, and he will be a useful component in the democratic transition. As I have done since 10 January, as of this moment, I am completely focused on my task of seeking peace in Chiapas. [end recording]
