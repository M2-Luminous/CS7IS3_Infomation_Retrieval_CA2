An FO spokesman said the letter, dated April 18 this year, purported to show British policy in Bosnia was anti-Muslim. Another document was also published, allegedly from a disaffected member of the Foreign Office's staff. "Members of the Iranian Embassy in London have been involved in attempting to distribute forged documents purporting to show that Britain's policy in Bosnia was directed against the Muslims," the spokesman said. Referring to the forged letter from Mr Hurd to Mr Rifkind, he added: "It is a crude attempt to copy Foreign Office form and style, and fails miserably." Release of the documents at a news conference today came after Iran's explusion earlier of British diplomat Hamish Cowell from Tehran, in a tit-for-tat response to Britain's explusion last week of the first secretary at the Iranian Embassy in London, Vahid Belourchi. Belourchi was asked to leave because of the false allegations about British policy in Bosnia contained in the two documents.
