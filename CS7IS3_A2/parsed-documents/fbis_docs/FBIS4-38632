Russian Premier's Visit to Beijing Crowned With Series of Agreements"] [Text] Beijing -- Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Beijing has been crowned with the signing of a series of agreements which are designed to ease the development of trade and economic cooperation as well as contacts between the two countries' citizens. The accords envisage that citizens be exempt from dual taxation, prescribe a procedure for border transit and ties between border services, and determine measures for the protection of the environment, the exploitation of the resources of rivers on the border, and the development of maritime shipping. A separate document regulates the exchange of information and experience in agriculture. In the opinion of members of the Russian delegation, these agreements could help our state enterprises and private business become established in the gigantic Chinese market. Indeed, this is the main point of our premier's visit to the PRC. Meeting with representatives of Chinese business circles, he tried to show that there is no reason to be afraid of investing money in Russia and concluding large-scale contracts with it. Whether or not he managed to convince his audience, people used to the unpredictability of the political and economic situation in our country, is unclear. In any event, the legal basis for cooperation was determined by the signing of the new documents. Admittedly, the competition for the Chinese market is becoming increasingly intense. That is the reason for the U.S. President's sensational decision to abandon the linkage between the observance of human rights and terms of trade with China. For Russia, of course, which has a border with China, relations with it are even more important than for the United States. It is no wonder that in conversation with the Chinese, as sources report, the head of our government avoided subjects which they find sensitive, such as the violation of human rights. This decision made it possible to promote Russian economic interests, at least in those areas where fierce competition is not in evidence yet -- in the supply of the latest types of military hardware. The United States and other Western countries are still observing the embargo in this field imposed on China after the suppression of the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. According to some information, particularly intensive talks were held on new supplies of Russian fighters and the transfer of aircraft construction technology.
