ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission has adopted rules establishing general procedures that will apply whenever it employs a system of competitive bidding (``auctions'') to choose from among mutually exclusive applications for certain initial licenses. This action is taken to implement section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Procedures applicable to specific services will be determined in future Reports and Orders. The new rules will promote the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas. These rules also will promote economic opportunity and competition, and disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. This action will provide recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public spectrum made available for commercial use. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 3, 1994.
