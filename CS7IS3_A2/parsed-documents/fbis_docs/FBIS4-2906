The announcement was made by Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and head of the National Unification Board (NUB), after a cabinet meeting on reunification and national security policy here. The move will likely increase pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to allow additional inspection of its nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), analysts here said. Seoul and Washington said earlier that a third round of U.S.- DPRK high-level talks could be held if Pyongyang honored an agreement reached with Washington in New York on February 25. The agreement set two preconditions -- acceptance of IAEA inspections and resumption of inter-Korean dialogue on the exchange of special envoys. However, the DPRK insisted that the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks should be held since it has already met the two conditions. The South Korean government has determined that it is impossible to resolve DPRK's nuclear issue only through an exchange of special envoys since the DPRK has "clearly shown that it has no intention of doing so," Yi said. Consequently, the government has decided against setting the envoy exchange as a condition for a third round of U.S.-DPRK high- level talks, he explained. However, Yi said, there is no change in the government's position that "the nuclear problem will have to be resolved above everything else." South Korea and the DPRK have held eight rounds of working-level talks on the exchange of special envoys at the truce village of Panmunjom since last October, but failed to reach any agreement due to differences on the issue. "Inter-Korean dialogue must go on for mutual and simultaneous inspections of each other's nuclear facilities based on the joint declaration for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Yi said. Today's cabinet meeting also decided that South Korea will accept all DPRK's "escapees from Pyongyang-run logging camps" in Siberia, Russia, who wish to settle in the South. Some 170 escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at Siberian logging camps, are said to be "seeking asylum" in South Korea, according to official sources here. On Thursday, Russia expressed its willingness to help South Korea resettle DPRK's loggers in Siberia. Seoul and Moscow will soon hold working-level discussion on this question.
