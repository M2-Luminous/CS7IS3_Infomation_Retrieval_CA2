According to POBJEDA, the map was printed in the Republic of Croatia. The text accompanying the map, the paper notes, states that the borders of Sandzak were historically and internationally recognized by the decision of the Congress of Berlin and the Treaty of Constantinople. The "creators of this creation" specify that the state of Sandzak will cover over 8,687 square kilometers and have a population of 440,000. Among the "propaganda material," POBJEDA adds, were brochures printed in Iran in Arabic. Pictures of fully equipped fighters in "combat poses" illustrated the text of these brochures. According to POBJEDA, Harun Hadzic, president of the SDA for Montenegro, and Rifat Veskovic, president of the Bijelo Polje SDA municipal committee, were in possession of military staff and command organization plans when arrested. The paper adds that Hadzic and other SDA leaders had purchased 11 radio receivers in Germany and planned to conduct surveillance of the Yugoslav Army and police and to destroy communications lines and radio stations.
