Right after the Easter truce, political parties that rallied together in a coalition addressed the Haitian legislators. Until now, steps taken have been in political meetings, but now tend to extend beyond this scope into the street. The party leaders behind this movement are insistently asking for the application of the Constitution's Article 149, and are threatening to mobilize the population, their crowd of supporters, in the next few days. A first step might have been taken with the public radio announcements calling the senators and deputies to action in solving the crisis. More should perhaps be known today with the conference to be held by the Coordinating Committee for National Mobilization.
