The meeting was chaired by Wang Jinshan. Present at the meeting were He Zhukang, Gao Yan, Liu Yunzhao, Su Rong, Feng Ximing, Wang Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, and Ke Muyun. At the meeting, Governor Gao Yan read the provincial party committee and government's decision on issuing medals of Jilin's outstanding talents to 1,895 specialists, scholars, and technicians, including Tang Aoqing. [passage omitted] He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech at the meeting. He said: Today, the provincial party committee and the provincial government ceremoniously held a meeting to present "medals of Jilin's outstanding talents" to 1,895 specialists, scholars, and technicians with outstanding contributions to Jilin's modernization and to carry forward their deeds. This is a great matter of our province. Over the past years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have constantly put the work toward intellectuals on the important work agenda and successively worked out and implemented a series of policies and measures. To live up the expectations of the party and the people, the broad masses of intellectuals, with vast branches of learning, boundless wisdom, high enthusiasm, and the spirit of fearing no difficulties, keeping forging ahead, and waging an struggle, have engaged themselves in the great practice of reform, opening up, and modernization; brought their wisdom and intelligence into full play; and made brilliant achievements. Some of the medal winners present here today made prominent contributions to building the revolutionary base earlier before the liberation war. Some of them gave up their good working and living conditions abroad and resolutely returned home to engage themselves in the construction of new China and to make contributions to the motherland. Most of them are outstanding talents who grew up after liberation. They have made arduous efforts at different posts and handed in satisfactory examination papers to the party and the people. He urged: The party committees and governments at various levels should try every possible means to eliminate difficulties for the intellectuals, provide them with good environments and conditions, positively widen the channels to establish contacts between scientific research units and economic units, offer a vast environment where science professionals and technicians are able to bring their skills into play, and ensure the supply of necessary funds for teaching and scientific research. We should positively improve the living and medical care conditions of intellectuals. The leaders at various levels should make friends with intellectuals, conscientiously listen to their opinions on the work in various aspects, and provide them with convenience in understanding the overall situation and engaging in social practice. He urged: The vast number of intellectuals should scientifically grasp the Marxist world outlook and methodology; engage in scientific research and theoretical explorations along with an accurate orientation; carry forward the Chinese intellectuals' fine traditions of being concerned about the country and the people, making unremitting efforts to improve themselves, and making selfless sacrifice; go deep to the reality, the peasants, and the workers; attach primary importance to the benefits of the motherland and the people; and contribute their energy and wisdom to seeking benefits for the motherland and the people. He urged: The medal winners will guard against arrogance and rashness, make ceaseless efforts, make new contributions to building a developed border near-the-sea province, and rejuvenating Jilin's economy.
