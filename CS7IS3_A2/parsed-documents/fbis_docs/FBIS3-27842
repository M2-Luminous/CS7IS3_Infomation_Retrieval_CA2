The letter from Takahiro Konishi, 49, who lives in the North Korean capital, appeared in the January 29 edition of a newsletter put out by the group. He wrote that he wants his 16-year-old eldest daughter, who is without nationality, "to study together with her Japanese friends in the land of her ancestors." Konishi is the sixth hijacker to indicate he wants to return to Japan. It is the first time that a letter bearing the hijacker's actual name was sent to Japan. Nine former Sekigun-ha (Red Army faction) extremists hijacked the JAL Boeing-727 airliner and its crew of seven and 122 passengers on a flight from Tokyo to Fukuoka. The plane landed in Seoul, where the passengers were released, and continued on to Pyongyang, where the hijackers defected. Konishi also thanked the sympathizers' group for their letters and gifts, and wrote he "was able to understand the warmness of (Japanese) relatives" at a meeting three and a half years ago in Pyongyang. Konishi said that the meeting clarified his feelings and he was certain he would return to Japan. The seven families of the hijackers include 17 children, and the sympathizers have been campaigning to acquire Japanese nationality and passports for them so that they can return to Japan. Konishi said that if it is possible, he wants to send his oldest daughter and her 14-year-old sister to Japan this summer.
