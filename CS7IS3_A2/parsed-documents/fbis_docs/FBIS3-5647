Kantor identified wood, paper, flat glass, computers, supercomputers, telecommunications, medical equipment, and insurance as business areas where he said U.S. firms face barriers in penetrating the Japanese market. President Bill Clinton reinstated the Super 301 trade provision by executive order last week, setting in motion a U.S. policy of removing foreign trade barriers by targeting offending trading partners for retaliation. Under Clinton's executive order, U.S. trading partners accused of maintaining trade barriers against U.S. goods have until September 30 to avoid being singled out for possible Super 301 action. Testifying before a House Appropriations Subcommittee that handles trade matters Tuesday, Kantor named the eight Japanese industry sectors as areas which he said do not meet U.S. market-opening criteria. Kantor in particular cited wood, paper and flat glass as three Japanese market sectors where he said U.S. firms have seen a decline in their market share. The U.S. Government is scheduled to issue an annual review on foreign trade barriers by the end of March, setting off a six-month process of preliminary negotiations to remove what Washington views as the "most egregious" practices. Kantor indicated that U.S. jaw-boning is unlikely to resolve all trade disputes, telling the U.S. legislators that it would be "quite unusual" if the Super 301 priority list turns up empty on September 30.
