The sides were combating for it with variable success during over a week. Thus, Abkhazian forces got a real chance to take under their control all the Kodor Canyon, which is the last territory in Abkhazia under Georgian control. Georgian authorities undertake emergency measures to evacuate the population by helicopters from the Canyon. Jaba Ioseliani, Head of the Georgian Emergency Committee, told SNARK the situation is extremely strained in the Kodor Canyon. "Georgian volunteers are struggling against regular Abkhazian forces, armed to the teeth". The peaceful negotiation he was coordinating failed. Nevertheless, the dialog should be continued, said Mr. Ioseliani.
