Concerning this, the South Korean ruling bunch is kicking off a row, such as requesting that the United States not grant his permanent residency and extend his visa, as well as requesting that his whereabouts be established. However, this is no more than a deceitful trick to appease the heated public opinion. It is common knowledge that Kim Chong-hwi, who worked as senior assistant for diplomatic and security affairs at Chongwadae during the Sixth Republic era, is one of the key figures involved in irregularities committed in the course of weapons transactions with the United States under the signboard of Yulgok Project [ROK weapons procurement program]. Kim Chong-hwi secretly ran away to the United States last April under the tacit approval of the incumbent ruling bunch because the public's attention was focused on him and his irregularities were exposed. However, the people's voice demanding his summons and that he be dealt with according to the law has not been pacified for nearly a year. Because his request for permanent residency in the United States was exposed recently, the Democratic Party--the opposition party--in a statement urged the puppet authorities to summon him without fail. Even Korean residents in the United States launched a signature campaign and struggle to oppose Kim Chong-hwi's asylum in the United States. Embarrassed by this, the Kim Yong-sam group kicked off a row about a so-called request and so forth. However, it has no intention, even to the slightest degree, to call him to Seoul, because various Sixth Republic corruption acts and irregularities, which have been concealed behind the black curtain, and crimes of the incumbent rulers who are related with such corruption and irregularities, as well as crimes of the civilian ruling bunch which helped him flee to the United States, would be fully exposed to the entire world if Kim Chong-hwi, who has a lot of intelligence materials because he was in charge of diplomatic and security affairs during the Sixth Republic, is summoned to Seoul and is made to stand trial. The puppets' so-called request to the United States, and so forth are no more than a poor trick to appease the people's increasing demand for his summons, by pretending that they are making efforts to summon him. This is proven by the fact that although they described Kim Chong-hwi's request for permanent residency as deplorable and as an act going against common sense, and so forth, the puppets recently stood back a step, saying that drastic measures are difficult, and the like. Moreover, the puppet Foreign Ministry was aware of his request for permanent residency long before the press reported it. Nevertheless, instead of preventing his request the puppet Foreign Ministry kept it secret. The Kim Yong-sam group is now indeed embarrassed by this incident. In addition to Kim Chong-hwi, Yi Won-cho, National Assemblyman from the Democratic Liberal Party; Yi Yong-man, finance minister during the Sixth Republic; and many other criminals fled overseas since the so-called civilian government came to office. If the Kim Yong-sam group only summons and imprisons Kim Chong-hwi, the people will raise voices of criticism that his imprisonment, while leaving others who fled with its help free, is unfair. And if the Kim Yong-sam group does not arrest him, the people's protest will increase. Therefore, the puppets are indeed at a loss. The Kim Yong-sam group is gravely worried that the crimes of the Sixth Republic and its own crimes committed in collusion with the Sixth Republic will be exposed through the mouths of the fugitives when they are called to Seoul. This is why the puppets do not want to summon Kim Chong-hwi, although they are loudly talking about the request and so forth. All facts show that the incumbent ruling bunch is deeply involved in various corruption acts and irregularities of the Sixth Republic and that the reform drive, parting from the Sixth Republic, eradication of irregularities without sanctuary, and so on, which the puppets have loudly talked about to date, are all a deception. The Kim Yong-sam group is the guard who protects criminals who committed various irregularities during the Sixth Republic era. As long as such a group remains in power, corruption and irregularities will not be eradicated in South Korea. In fact, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the ringleaders of various corruption and irregularities during the Fifth and Sixth Republics, are still active under the protection of the incumbent authorities. Besides, incidents of various irregularities, including large-scale financial fraud, have been exposed one after another. The fact that society becomes corrupt and irregularities are rampant under the corrupt politics is a phenomenon that cannot be prevented. The Kim Yong-sam group, the supporter and protector of such irregularities, should be removed from power in order to eradicate corruption and irregularities in South Korea.
