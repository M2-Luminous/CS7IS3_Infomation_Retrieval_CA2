Its leader, Nikolai Yurantsev, was interviewed by MN correspondent in Baltic countries. MN: Who are the Russians in Estonia? Are they splinters of the empire? Or is it already a new community with its own world views and interests? N.Yu.: The Russians diaspora in Estonia consists of many layers: it includes the old indigenous Russians from the time of the Russian Empire, and the most numerous postwar emigration wave, and two subsequent ones --dating back to the mid-1960s and the early 1980s. No one doubts any longer that all of us, the permanent inhabitants of Estonia -- Byelorussians, Ukrainians, Russians, Koreans and Armenians are Russian-speaking people --and we have been trying to unite on the principles of an association of fellow-countrymen, language and non-citizenship. The latter has been engendered by the political partialities of national-radicals, become embodied in a number of ER laws on the state language and on foreigners, and turned into a veritable calamity for a third of Estonia's population. We are already the Baltic Russians. Our association is more necessary for the indigenous inhabitants who must understand that living next to them are "their own Russians." MN: Today the image of a Russian looks like that of a rabid foe from the East whose only occupation was to oppress, enslave and occupy... N.Yu.: Forgetting that the West has perpetrated more troubles here than the East. But the position of many present-day Estonian politicians is this: all evil comes from the East. Even the period of the war from 1941 to 1944 is being repatterned to fit a simple and very clear theory of the main enemy being nearby. Life itself has repeatedly given the lie to this obstinately imposed stereotype. From the very beginning of perestroika, the "native" Russians have repeatedly demonstrated their loyalty to the independent Estonian state. For instance, last year there was a referendum in Narva and the question was formulated as follows: "Are you for national-territorial autonomy as part of the Estonian Republic?" The majority said "yes," but the result was an attack on the part of governmental structures and the non-recognition of the referendum's results. The situation was fraught with power confrontation. But the "reds", as the government called the Narva leadership, recognized the verdict of the State Court on this referendum as being valid and final, that is, their reaction to the "attack" was obedience to the law. A similar referendum took place in Transdniestria, whereupon a war broke out there. The result: Transdniestria remained Transdniestria, and Moldova remained Moldova. Here, however, the Leningrad highway was not blocked with ferroconcrete slabs, as both sides displayed sense. MN: Citizenship is the key problem today. The wisest decision on this question has been taken by Lithuania. And not because there are few Russians there or because they are especially loved... N.Yu.: Evidently because the politicians there understand what a state is. And they do not put up countless fences which they themselves will have to climb over, turning their problems inside out before Europe. Europe's orientation is clear and accurate: the peoples of the Baltics must independently decide the problems of relationships with Russia. In the wake of Lithuania, Latvia has defined its attitude on the question of citizenship. And has found a common language with Russia. The 1988 Law on Citizenship in Estonia could have solved the entire problem had it been carried into effect from the first paragraph to the last. But it was tailoured with a simple resolution on putting the law into effect, deleting the paragraphs which did not suit the national-radicals. But to Europe the law was shown as a whole. And Europe was delighted -- they had no such liberal laws. In accordance with this law, permanent inhabitants, i.e., inhabitants with the permanent Estonian domicile registration, who have lived here for more than ten yeas, actually receive their citizenship in the zero variant. The ruse of the national-radicals was that the resolution introduced the countdown not from the actual time of residence, but since 1990. A temporary residence permit is now granted for a term of up to five years, and only coupled with a passport does this document give one a right to stay in the country. The term of the general civilian passport's validity expires in July 1995. And one fine day you will get your residence permit in the shape of an insert into the passport with the loss of the latter's validity. And then you will be able to live in Estonia on legal grounds for a mere 24 hours. "There is need to fight for this residence permit" -- such is the meaning of the statement issued jointly by the Representative Assembly and the Russian Community of Estonia. Everyone must decide the problem radically for himself. If he stays to live here, it means that he can follow two roads. The most correct thing, we believe, is the acquisition of the Estonian citizenship. MN: How does Russia assist the Russians' integration in an independent Estonia state? N.Yu.: Let me answer bluntly to a blunt question: in no way. Needless to say, any word uttered by Russia in defence of the Russian diaspora carries weight. But today this is no longer enough. Russia's policy towards Russians must be normal protectionism which is widespread all over the world. But, it seems, Russian protectionism extends solely to the retired military servicemen, and this is a partial problem. There are hundreds of thousands of people who worked at the Union enterprises. Russia only singles out but a handful of retired servicemen from among hundreds of thousands. This tends to trigger these Russians' surprise and dislike for both retired servicemen and for Russian politicians. Russia has never formulated its policy in relation to Russians in the near abroad. There are some fragmentary general declarations, but there is no tangible political line which is clear to everyone. In the past few years we have witnessed many sanctions: economic and political, as well as the President's formidable statements. And all this, as a rule, boomeranged at the Russian-speaking population and failed to reach its objective. Of the same nature is the decision on raising custom tariffs beginning with March 15 of this year -- this again hits at the Russian-speaking population. During the past year we have had more understanding with the West than with Russia, which can only be regretted. When a crisis broke out in connection with the Law on Foreigners, five ambassadors, accredited in Estonia from European Community countries, undertook a political demarche as a result of which this law was sent to the Council of Europe for an examination by experts. Those were the ambassadors of Italy, France, Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The Russian ambassador was not among them. MN: Are you under the impression that Russia has been sliding more and more towards power solutions already inside the CIS? N.Yu.: As I see it, democracy the Russian way must be a rigid system ensuring the controllability of the whole country, but this does not mean that its feet in high boots must stick out in neighbouring countries. The latest elections to the local self-management bodies in Russia have demonstrated a system of anarchy. When, however, the government of Estonia granted non-citizens the possibility to elect to self-management bodies, the majority came to the polling stations. At Tallinn's City Assembly there are 32 Russians among the 64 deputies. But electors first had to register, then go to the polls. They came on both occasions in contrast to people in Russia. The government made a little step to meet them half-way, and it received a splash of loyalty.
