FR940603-1-00167 FR940603-1-00009 UR&hyph;4c Pavement Assembly Unit, Concrete_Consists of the labor necessary to remove and restore one (1) lineal foot of concrete pavement, measured along the route of the cable, including any trenching necessary to place the cable at the required depth. All work shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of State or local authorities. UR&hyph;5 (␣) Underground Pipe Crossing Assembly Unit_Consists of the installation of one (1) lineal foot of steel pipe, of the inside diameter, in inches, specified in the last digit of the assembly unit designation, installed in place. This unit includes the pushing of pipe and any excavation, backfilling and tamping necessary for the installation of the pipe. The pipe will be installed at the depth specified by the Owner. The installation of underground cable in the pipe is not included in this unit. UR&hyph;6 Underground Nonpipe Crossing Assembly Unit_Consists of the labor in providing a hole in soil one (1) foot in length of a diameter sufficient to accommodate the cable to be installed therein. The depth of the hole below the surface of the ground shall be specified by the Owner. This unit includes any excavation, backfilling and tamping necessary for the installation. This unit may be used where the permanent installation of a steel pipe under the UR&hyph;5 unit is not required. The installation of underground cable in the pipe is not included in this unit. ␣ 1Unit No. 1Unit labor price ␣ l Construction Units_Line Changes The general heading of Line Changes applies to the changing of existing lines or portions thereof from their existing phasing, wire size, and type to new phasing, wire size, and type and the removal of existing lines or portions thereof and replacing with new lines in close proximity thereto. In general line changes involve three types of assembly units as follows: Section H_Conversion assembly units; Section I_Removal assembly units; Section N_New construction assembly units on existing lines or in replacing lines. The assembly units that are included in Sections H, I, and N are defined by symbols and descriptions which follow together with the applicable descriptions included under New Construction. Where the descriptions are not correct or sufficiently explicit, or when special units are not covered by Construction Drawings, descriptions have been provided by the Owner in the respective sections. Work included in these sections shall be performed under a schedule of deenergization and operating procedures as set forth by the Owner at the time of release of any Section involving work on existing lines. The Contractor will so plan and perform its work that it will be possible to safely reenergize all lines involved at the expiration of the time limits set up in the schedule to resume service to all consumers being served prior to deenergization. Prior to commencement of work each day on lines to be deenergized, and upon completion of work each day on such lines, the Contractor will notify the Owner thereof in writing or in such other manner as the circumstances permit. SECTION H_CONVERSION ASSEMBLY UNITS Conversion assembly units are pole-top assemblies and cover the furnishing of all labor for changing an existing assembly unit to a new assembly unit, utilizing certain items of materials of the existing assembly unit on poles to be left in place. Any materials removed from the existing assembly units which are not required in the construction of the conversion assembly unit are to be reused by the Contractor in the construction of other assembly units, or returned to Owner's warehouse, as directed by the Owner. Conversion assembly units are specified by the prefix H with the new construction assembly unit designation shown first and the existing assembly unit designation shown last. For example, an H B1&hyph;A1 signifies the conversion of an existing A1 assembly unit to a B1 assembly unit (as was defined in the description of construction assembly units). In this instance the Contractor utilizes the existing pin-type insulator, single upset bolt and neutral spool and installs the additional crossarm, crossarm pins, braces, machine bolt, carriage bolts, lag screw, and insulator supplied by the Owner required for the new unit. The Contractor transports the pole-top pin and two machine bolts to the warehouse or uses them on the Project as directed by the Owner. The Conversion assembly units also include the furnishing of all labor in the transferring, resagging and retying of conductors from one position on the pole to a different position on the pole where such transfers are required. Where replacement of conductor is required, the existing conductor will be removed under section I and the new conductor installed under section N. Where replacement of a pole is required, the existing pole and pole-top assembly will be removed under section I and the new pole and pole-top assembly will be installed according to section N and no H units will be involved. Conversion assemblies are listed in three subsections for converting pole-top assemblies from single to V phase, single to three phase, and V to three phase. The following descriptions apply to only those conversion units not sufficiently explicit: ␣ 1Unit 1Description ␣ l Subsection H (B&hyph;A)␣1 Phase to V Phase ␣ 1Unit No. 1Unit labor price ␣ l Subsection H (C&hyph;A)␣1 Phase to 3 Phase ␣ 1Unit No. 1Unit labor price ␣ l
