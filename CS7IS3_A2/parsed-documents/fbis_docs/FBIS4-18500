The leader of Forza Italia said that negotiations were being broken off and that Oscar Luigi Scalfaro would have the task of appointing the government. Berlusconi said that if his party were chosen, it already had in place a team of ministers and a program for government that it would submit to a parliamentary vote. If rejected by parliament, Berlusconi said that the country would return to the polling booths in order to finish the clean-up operation. This view was shared by Gianfranco Fini [leader of the National Alliance] and by Pierferdinando Casini [leader of the Christian Democrat Center party]. Meanwhile, the left is making positive overtures towards the Northern League. However, Roberto Maroni quickly extinguished any hopes. He said that it was one thing to contact all the parties concerning the issue of federalism, but it was another as far as governing the country was concerned. Maroni said that there could be no room for doubt; the task of government had to go to the Freedom Alliance -- the choice of the voters.
