The Israeli military siege is being tightened on all Arab citizens and is preventing the provision of food, medicine, and basic needs for children and sick people. The Israeli Army continues its acts of repression, torture, and indiscriminate shooting. The injured people number in the scores everyday. The images of the horrifying massacre in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque, where worshipers were killed by Zionist settlers while performing their prayers, are still fresh in the minds of the sons of the occupied homeland and remind everyone that there can be no security and comfort until the removal of the Israeli nightmare of occupation. The peace aspired to by the hearts and the souls is very farfetched because Israel, very simply, does not want peace and its objective is to expand and build settlements. This is in terms of the occupied territories. As for southern Lebanon, the barbaric Israeli bombardment has become a daily practice. This practice intensified in recent days to include as many villages and towns as possible and to cause as much human and material losses as possible. This is the Israel which falsely claims peace and works against it. This is the Israel which those in the Western world want to raise the banner of peace while they are tempting it with billions of dollars, economic aid, and sophisticated weapons of destruction, are racing to strike military deals with it, and are providing it with nuclear technology. The results are totally the opposite. Israel's arrogance and rejection of peace is building up and its greed for expansion and settlement building is increasing. Israel is using weapons the West is placing in its hands to perpetrate massacres and crimes and to foil the hopes for peace. While the Security Council is supposed to rise up to its international responsibilities and take the initiative to protect the Palestinian and Lebanese people from Israel's daily crimes, this highest international authority is drowning in the labyrinths of endless deliberations. It is seeking a resolution that satisfies Israel and does not hurt the feelings of its rulers. As for the rulers of Israel, they continue to make misleading statements. They claim peace and concern about the Palestinians while it is known that one of their senior military commanders revealed that the Israeli Army has strict orders not to stand in the way of settlers even if they were shooting at defenseless Arab citizens. The Washington talks have entered their third year. Not a single Israeli negotiator uttered the word "withdrawal." The Arabs and Syria talked about a full, real, just, and comprehensive peace. No one heard Israel say the word "full withdrawal." Indeed, the Israelis' main concern in Washington was to drown the talks in the labyrinth of their security demands and turn the peace process into mere security arrangements that would guarantee for Israel, in the name of security, the continuation of its occupation, the continuation of acts of repression and terrorism, keeping the settlements and settlers, and the freedom of stockpiling all kinds of weapons. This is at a time when Israeli shells are continuously bombarding southern Lebanon, when Palestinians are being killed while performing their prayers to God, and when any Syrian citizen in the occupied Golan, who affirms his affiliation to Syria and Arabism, is being repressed. The peace process in Middle East so far has been receiving a response from one side; that is, the Arab side. As for Israel, it did not offer anything and continues to blackmail, evade, prevaricate, and procrastinate. Moreover, it is clear that Israel will not submit to the conditions of a just peace unless the international community makes an effective and decisive move to impose respect for UN principles and resolutions. Tempting Israel with billions of dollars and arsenals of weapons so far has only yielded opposite results. It added to the arrogance of the rulers of Israel and to their disregard of all human values. The massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque will continue to be a nightmare that haunts those who encouraged Israel, especially since it will not be the last massacre. Other more horrifying massacres will inevitably be perpetrated if the international community does not put an end to Zionist belligerence by ending the occupation and restoring rights.
