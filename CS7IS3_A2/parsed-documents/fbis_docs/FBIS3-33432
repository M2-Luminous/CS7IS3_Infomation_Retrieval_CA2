This miniplan is not global, he says, and does not replace the Governors Island accord; but it constitutes a significant development because it was suggested by both opponents and supporters of Aristide. This statement was made by Caputo during a press conference on 22 February at the UN Headquarters. [passage omitted] It should be noted that this plan, which was rejected by President Aristide, is supported by the United States and provides for the nomination of a new prime minister, the anticipated retirement of the Army commander in chief, and amnesty for the military who overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. In a letter addressed on Sunday to the UN Security Council, Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali implicitly supported the plan of the Haitian legislators. Caputo said that he was waiting for President Aristide's response to the legislators' initiative that was communicated to the UN secretary general during the past weekend. However, during a meeting in Washington with the legislators last week, President Aristide had rejected the plan which does not set an effective date for his return to power. Some of his concerns are totally legitimate and we think that the international community could answer to them, states Caputo. The mediator noted Jean-Bertrand Aristide's cooperation while specifying that the president in exile is concerned about the means implemented in order to overcome the deadlock and the necessity to avoid the kinds of experiences which in the past did not yield the expected results, he said. On 21 February, President Aristide once more asked the international community to reinforce the sanctions against Haiti in order to compel the military to leave power. Mediator Caputo considered that the international sanctions are a means to favor a solution to the crisis and not a solution in themselves. However, he added that if the nondemocratic sectors in Haiti continue to block the situation, new sanctions will probably be imposed by the Security Council.
