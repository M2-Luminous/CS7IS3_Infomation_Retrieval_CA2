Proposed Amendment By letters dated June 16 and July 28, 1993 (Administrative Record No. MT&hyph;11&hyph;01), Montana submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Montana submitted the proposed amendment in response to statutory changes adopted by the Montana 1993 Legislative session, regarding notice of intent for ``prospecting'', ownership and control provisions, violation history updates, and editorial changes.
