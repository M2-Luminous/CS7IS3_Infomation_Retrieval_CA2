What will the investment situation be in 1994? We could say that this is a question that all people, from top to bottom, are very concerned about, since it is related to whether or not the national economy can achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang di fa zhan 2070 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4104 4099 1455]. In the spring of this year, in a packed meeting room of the Investment Research Institute of the State Planning Commission, scores of experts and scholars from the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Domestic Trade, the China Materials and Equipment Center, the State Information Center, the Quantitative and Technical Economics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and the State Planning Commission's General Department of National Economy, Center for Economic Research, and China Prices Information Center directly participated in a wide-ranging and vigorous discussion on the investment situation in 1994. The main views they expressed are presented below. The participants agreed that the current economic situation as a whole is good, with the economic growth rate reaching 13.4 percent in 1993 and a comparatively high level expected to be maintained this year. In 1993, China's total social investment in fixed assets exceeded 1,180 billion yuan, a rise of more than 50 percent over the previous year, and the greatest increase for any year since the introduction of reform and opening up. However, if we exclude price rises, the quantity of goods produced increased approximately 20 percent, lower than the 23 percent rate of increase for 1992. From the perspective of the economic situation in 1994, since various regions are still very enthusiastic in developing the economy, and the numerous new projects initiated in the last two years still require comparatively great investment for their completion, plus the increase in the retail price index of 13.2 percent in 1993, this year will be a period of high-speed expansion of the economy and we will be faced with the prospect of relatively large investment and the pressure of inflation. Investment Growth Will Remain High and The Investment Structure Will Remain Poor According to estimates by Zhang Hanya, a research fellow from the Investment Research Institute of the State Planning Commission, in 1994, to compensate for depreciation, the input of capital should not be less than 290 billion yuan; and to ensure that the new projects initiated in the last two years are completed on time investment must not fall below 790 billion yuan--the total of 1,080 billion yuan is the minimum investment for 1994. Zhang stated that the level of supply of raw materials will limit the total volume of investment, with domestic production and financial resources playing a major role. Generally speaking, if the GNP increases by 1 percent then it could sustain a 1.5 percent increase in investment. It is estimated that in 1994 the GNP growth in China will probably reach 10 percent, which means that physical quantity investment could increase to approximately 15 percent, and will probably reach 1,860 billion yuan. If we consider an investment price index of 7-10 percent, in 1994 investment currency will increase by 23-26.5 percent to between 1,460 and 1,500 billion yuan. The various reform measures to be introduced this year, such as reform of the banking system, will also probably influence the scale of investment. Comrade Wang Yida of the Comprehensive Planning Department of the Ministry of Finance said that the Central Bank's method of controlling loans granted to specialized banks would be changed from administrative distribution to management of asset-to- liability ratio. This will reduce the restrictions on loans granted to various commercial banks, but there is the possibility that this will result in a rapid increase in fixed-asset investment loans and thus foster fixed-asset investment inflation. Wang Tongsan, a research fellow from the Quantitative and Technical Economics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that at present economic development in China is primarily dependent on investment, and that if investment is suspended, the economy will not be able to develop as rapidly. Of China's enterprises, 80 percent are manufacturing intermediate products, and only 20 percent are producing end products. If there is not considerable investment then this 80 percent will be hard- pressed and experience difficulties. In 1993 the scale of investment was already very high, and it is reasonable to forecast that the investment scale will be approximately 1,400 billion yuan in 1994. If we can control investment within this increased limit, no major problems should develop in the economy. If not, then the economy will slide. Comrade Xu Hongyuan from the State Information Center pointed out that on the basis of the turnpike theorems [da dao ding li 1129 6670 1353 3810], when the per capita GNP reaches between $400 and $2,000 a nation should experience a stage of high-speed growth. This is the turnpike for economic growth. This high-speed growth means that probably within 10-15 years a state's industrialization will be completed. According to our calculations, China's per capita GNP should be $470. We have the necessary conditions to bring about this so-called turnpike of high-speed growth. Investment and consumption are the driving forces behind economic development, but since we are a developing country, consumer goods cannot reach a very high level. Because of this the main factor determining growth is still investment. The Japanese rate of investment at its highest was 47 percent and was maintained at 40 percent for a long period of time. The "four little tigers" have also reached in excess of 40 percent. Last year China's investment rate reached 36-37 percent, which is appropriate. While the total social investment is growing at an ultra-high speed, there also exist the problems of a nonrational investment structure and low returns on investment. Qiu Quanning, an associate research fellow from the Investment Research Institute of the State Planning Commission, pointed out that: a) There has been a comparative reduction in personal investment in agriculture; in 1992 there was a negative increase and last year the rate of increase was only 10.2 percent--only one-fifth of the national average. At the same time, the per capita incomes of the close to 80 percent of the population who live in the countryside have fluctuated at a low speed for a long time, and the gap between their incomes and those of the population living in the cities and towns has gradually widened. This serious imbalance in the development of the economy has a negative impact on the maintenance of sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development, and even on social stability. b) Since the beginning of the nineties, the increased investment in state-owned units has been constantly higher than the average rate for society as a whole. Last year the proportion of investment in state-owned units had already reached 70.8 percent, the highest since reforms were introduced 13 years ago. However, in the same year the industrial growth rate in state-owned industrial enterprises increased at a rate of only 9 percent, less than half the average for society as a whole. That is to say, state-owned enterprises were set in motion by investment higher than the social average, but their output yield was much lower than the social average. To centralize resources in low-yield sectors goes against market economics, and high input but low yield will inevitably result in a great wastage of resources. For this reason, the reform should be speeded up and investment policy and management structure need to be established and perfected, various unregulated government actions corrected and overcome, and the wasteful use of investment reformed in order to improve the benefits from investment. Although the Channels for Financing Decreased, the Financing Volume Was Still Large With regard to the sources of investment funds, Comrade Ma Ruohong of the People's Bank of China pointed out that between January and November last year, 47.8 percent of the investment for capital construction and renovation in state-owned units was self- funded, primarily from a large stock of money obtained by various means to support investment. After the disorderly accumulation of funds was stopped, although the channels for financing decreased, the financing volume was still large. In the first half of last year, self-funding amounted to 90.1 billion yuan, an increase of 69 percent over the same period in 1992. This shows that if there is a large amount of capital and household savings, then except when returns from investment are lower than the interest rate or when the government uses political measures to limit investment, investment will otherwise sustain high-speed growth. Jia Fang, deputy leader of the Comprehensive Group of the Economic Research Center of the State Planning Commission, pointed out that from 1988 to 1991 foreign funds actually used averaged just over 10 billion yuan per annum; in 1991 this figure reached 11.5 billion yuan; in 1992 it grew to 19.8 billion yuan; and in 1993 it was approximately 30 billion yuan. This is a very influential factor. If the foreign exchange rate is calculated at six yuan (to the dollar), foreign funds used in 1993 amounted to approximately 180 billion yuan in fixed assets. Apart from this, there should also be funds to match the foreign currency. It has been estimated that in 1986 one dollar of foreign capital required a corresponding one yuan, while today one dollar calls for three yuan and in 1993 the corresponding capital would have been approximately 100 billion yuan. If we take last year's investment at the current increased rate of 50 percent, it is close to 300 billion yuan and means that China's investment has increased by 16 percentage points. The current situation is excellent in terms of opportunities in the international arena. At present, overseas interest rates have fallen 2-3 percentage points, which presents a very good opportunity for a low-income developing nation such as China to use foreign capital. To Reduce the Remaining Inflationary Pressure the Key Is To Control Excessive Increases in the Rate of Investment Both the cost-push and demand-pull models of inflation exist at the same time, but there is the question of which is the principal factor. Analyzed in terms of currency, Comrade Ma Ruohong pointed out that the current inflationary pressure is caused by the money supply being approximately 600 billion yuan in excess in the period from 1990 to 1992. Although the money supply was not excessive in 1993, there was no obvious tightening of the money supply. Because of this, hidden inflationary pressure continues to exist in 1994. If the scale of investment this year remains relatively large, the prices of investment products will continue to escalate. Added to this will be the concurrent influence of a rise in the prices of crude oil and coal and the reunification of the exchange rate, which will also in large part be reflected in the price of investment commodities. Whether or not the inflationary pressures left over from the past can be released this year depends on whether the current excessive rate of investment in fixed assets can be controlled at the reasonable level of approximately 20 percent. The rise in the retail commodity price index will depend on whether or not in 1994 we can stabilize the consumption behavior of those living in the cities and towns in terms of macropolicy. Before the rate of inflation can reach a lower level, if a high rate of interest can be maintained to stabilize consumption behavior, it will still be possible to control the retail price index to within single-digit figures. From the perspective of the prices of the means of production, Dai Dingyi, deputy director of the China Materials and Equipment Information Center, remarked: Now that prices have been deregulated, and the channels at home and abroad have been opened up, the bottleneck in supplies for building up production will be reduced considerably. This bottleneck is mainly in communications, and for the most part raw materials are no longer the major factor. All we need is money, and then we can buy whatever China lacks from overseas. Both circulation and materials and equipment enterprises expect that the more investment the better. Price rises for the means of production are not the main reason for rising prices, but fluctuations in the economy have a profound effect on fluctuations in the production of capital goods. Based on historical experience, this year's inflationary pressure will chiefly have an effect on inflation next year. Comrade Wang Yida noted that in 1993 the rate of currency circulation was 30 percent in excess, causing the general price level this year to rise by more than 8 percent. In terms of demand, the inflation caused by demand usually comes a little delayed, and the effect of the inertia of high investment in 1993 will be maintained for a time this year. Approximately 40 percent of investment will be transferred to consumption funds, and this transformation will be reflected in the market. The main reason for the nation's economy being currently overheated is investment. Even if we adopt macroeconomic regulatory and control measures to gradually stabilize the prices of investment products and means of production, retail market prices and the prices of consumer goods will continue to rise for a time because of the costs. However, this year's measures for price reform and other reforms will, more or less, directly and indirectly, force prices upward. Because of this we must aim to control price increases to within 10 percent. Increases in the scale of investment must also be maintained within appropriate limits in order to ensure the sustained, rapid and healthy development of the economy.
