FR940429-0-00008 FR940429-0-00005 Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 1 [CGD 92&hyph;066] RIN 2115&hyph;AE32 Recreational Vessel Fees AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Adoption of interim rule as final. SUMMARY: This rule adopts as final, the changes to Recreational Vessel Fee regulations which were published as an interim final rule on February 17, 1993. The interim final rule changed the length categories of recreational vessels subject to the recreational vessel fee (RVF) for calendar years 1993 and 1994, as required by the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992. This final rule also removes Lake Roosevelt, WA, from the listing of specific waters where the Coast Guard has a presence. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referred to in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Carlton Perry, Project Manager, Auxiliary, Boating, and Consumer Affairs Division, and C.G. Green, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Regulatory History On February 17, 1993, the Coast Guard published an interim final rule entitled ``Recreational Vessel Fees'' in the Federal Register (58 FR 8884). The rule was made effective on October 1, 1992, to coincide with the effective date of the statutory revisions in section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;582). A delay in amending the existing regulations could have resulted in vessel owners or operators paying a fee which was no longer required. The Coast Guard received one letter commenting on the interim final rule; it supported the announced phaseout of the fees. No public hearing was requested and none was held. On March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12549), the Coast Guard published a technical amendment to restore text in the CFR mistakenly removed by the interim final rule. Background and Purpose The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 2110 of title 46, United States Code, to require the Secretary of Transportation to establish a fee or charge for recreational vessels and to collect it annually in fiscal years (FY) 1991 through 1995 from the vessel owner or operator. Section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, enacted October 16, 1992, amends 46 U.S.C. 2110(b)(1) to limit collection of the annual fee to fiscal years 1993 and 1994, to reduce the number of recreational vessels subject to the annual fee by limiting the vessel length categories partially in fiscal year 1993 and even more in 1994, and to rescind the fee in fiscal year 1995. This rule adopts the interim final rule, as corrected. This rule also removes Lake Roosevelt (WA) as a specific body of water on which the fee applies. Lake Roosevelt (WA) was originally listed in ยง1.30&hyph;1(e) due to an actual Coast Guard presence for maintaining aids to navigation. The Coast Guard entered into a memorandum of agreement transferring maintenance of the aids to navigation on Lake Washington to the National Park Service in January 1993. With this transfer, the Coast Guard no longer has an actual presence on Lake Roosevelt and the fees should no longer apply on the Lake. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest to relieve owners or operators of vessels on Lake Washington no longer subject to the fees from unnecessarily paying the fees.
