The disclosure was made to AFP this morning by one of their spokesmen in Lagos. One of the former senators, contacted by AFP on 7 June on his underground telephone, had indicated that a group of his colleagues planned to surrender "within 48 hours" to the police "for the security forces to do what they like with us, and the earlier the better." The spokesman, speaking in a telephone interview from his hideout, pointed out that "we have reconsidered our decision. I think we can be more effective outside rather than inside the prison walls." He further said that "it is perhaps silly to surrender so easily and be imprisoned, whereas there are so many things that we can deal with while we are free." The former senators issued a communique yesterday in which they described the regime as illegal, and called on it to take all the necessary steps to proclaim Chief Moshood Abiola the presumed winner of the 12 June 1993 presidential election, which were annulled by the military government. Last week the Nigerian security forces began a series of arrests within the opposition ranks, which had called on General Abacha to relinquish power and hand over the reins of office to Moshood Abiola. Two arrested persons, former Senate President Ameh Ebute and one of his colleagues, Polycarp Nwite, were charged on 6 June with "plotting and treason," an offense punishable by life imprisonment. Instead of surrendering in a group to the police, the senators plan to file a legal suit to prevent the government from "harassing" them, their spokesman stressed.
