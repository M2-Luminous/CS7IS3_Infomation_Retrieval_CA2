Madhavan] [Text] The signing of the declaration for a new multilateral trade regime at Marrakesh by 125 countries, including India, marks the end of a long and arduous journey that began at Punta Del Este in Uruguay across the Atlantic nearly a decade ago, but there may still be some hurdles to go. Even as the agreement for a new multilateral trade regime was being signed, other indications signalled that some irritants still remain. The United States and Japan have not quite ended their trade dispute and the United States and the European Union have not taken back the demand to link social issues like labor standards out of the basic framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Nevertheless, the Marrakesh accord signed last night is a historic step because it considerably reduces the walls of protectionism which stood in the way of freer trade. For one, tariff barriers are expected to come down by 40 percent in all member countries. Second, the accord clears the way for the World Trade Organization -- WTO -- which will replace the GATT from 1 January next year and police world trade disputes. The final hurdle remains in the form of the national level ratification of the agreement in the legislatures of member countries, but it can be safely said that the ground has been laid for a body which will act as the arbiter in trade disputes. Further, the success of the Marrakesh accord will depend upon the ability of member countries to stick to their promises of functioning under the WTO and not resort to any act which will undermine it pending its creation. In particular, countries like the United States will have to stay away from selective bilateral action such as the invocation of Super 301 Law which forbids investment in bilateral (?grounds). For the developing countries, this opens up crucial avenues. India particularly stands to gain by greater market access for its exports in agriculture and textiles, but it will have to ensure that the code is implemented in letter and spirit so that in aspects like patenting of seeds and drug prices apprehensions that India may be affected do not come true. India will also have to guard against the misuse of social issues like human rights, environmental safety norms, and labor standards for trade purposes by powerful countries. India is committed to these values itself, but both the timing and the manner in which these issues have been smuggled into the context of the Uruguay round shows that the WTO may be here, but a watchful eye is needed all the same. However, India has once again shown that it articulates and leads Third World's interests by raising the issue of immigration barriers in developed countries which act as a deterrent to the flow of labor which is an economic service. In sum, it is clear that India and the world must ensure that the gains from trade must go hand in hand with concern for justice and equality.
