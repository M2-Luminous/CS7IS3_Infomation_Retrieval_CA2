The aforementioned report was made public a few weeks ago. Nikkens states that human rights violations persist in our country. However, Gen. Corado believes that "these violations are not systematic nor are the number of violations as high as years ago. The report gives the impression that in our country there is a lot fear and that no activities can be conducted because it is not safe." Gen. Corado said: "It is indispensable that the United Nations draft these reports in a balanced and impartial manner and not politicize them." With regard to the legalization of private weapons, Minister Corado said that the Defense Ministry is opening a special office where interested parties can go and request a license to carry a weapon. The first office will be opened in San Salvador. At a later date offices will be opened throughout the country. Corado said that the appropriate guidelines are being drafted and that they should be ready in the next few days. Regarding the Salvadoran Air Force A-37 aircraft that crashed at sea off the coast of La Paz Department, Gen. Corado said that despite the efforts made it has been impossible to rescue the crew and that it is believed that the pilot, Captain Julio Cesar Godoy Aguirre, and technician, Juan Carlos Ramirez, died in the accident.
