In a news conference given a few hours after arriving in Santiago, Peres, who was protected by a strong security force, said Israel has "a very long agenda" for its Arab neighbors, and reiterated that it is willing to continue with the peace process. He said that he was, however, "bewildered" by the recent remarks of Yasir 'Arafat about the "holy war," although he said that to judge a situation one must look at the initiatives and the facts. Peres said 'Arafat had made a mistake, and that his comments do not contribute to the peace process. But he preferred to base his judgement on the implementation of the agreement, which shows "that a new reality is taking place in Gaza and Jerico." He noted that the PLO has not carried out terrorist actions in those territories, and that despite the pain of this old language used by 'Arafat, the plan is promising. He recalled that the agreement granting autonomy to the Palestinians of Gaza and Jericho is "temporary, for five years," and that after the political enrivonment changes permanent agreements will be established. He advocated relations with Latin America for the opening up of new markets. He is also sure that the region will become like the European Community, as the right trend is to make "geographic proximity into economic advantage." Peres praised the Chilean process, which he considered "impressive" because of its political freedom and economic stability which, he said, is quite an exception in the region. Perez met this morning with Chilean President Eduardo Frei, who reiterated Chilean support for the peace process with the Palestinian people. Peres said: "We talked about strengthening the old friendship between the two countries in the fields of economy, trade, and technological and scientific development." Peres also met with Chilean Agriculture Minister Emiliano Ortega and with his Chilean counterpart Carlos Figueroa, to exchange views on the possibility of establishing joint business initiatives and to share Israeli technology for recovering the desert. This program is one of the points of greater interest for Chile, which has a large desert in the north. Peres said his country is willing to provide all possible aid in this field. He also said that Israel is open to trade negotiations with Chile like the ones it proposed to Mexico and Colombia, the other two countries included in his Latin American tour, which ends tomorrow in Santiago. Regarding international relations, Peres said that Israel expects to receive Chilean support in its peace negotiations with the Arabs at the United Nations, and that Chile will take an "objective" position in that international organization. He recalled that in Chile there is an important Arab community which, he believes, should support Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho just as the Jewish communities abroad support Israel. Peres declined to answer if his country would receive Chilean Army Commander General Augusto Pinochet, whose trip to Israel has been announced a number of times. Peres said this possibility has not emerged, and therefore it has no answer. Peres also met today with Chilean Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, and plans to lecture at the Chilean Foreign Ministry.
