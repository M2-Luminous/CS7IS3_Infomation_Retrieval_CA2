"Filatov was, is, and will remain in a test period as one of the president's closest staff associates, and there can be no talk of his resignation," said Mr. Kostikov, as reported by the POSTFACTUM news agency. Let us merely note that the information concerning Filatov's resignation as a matter which has already been decided was reported to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA by persons whose names we do not wish to publish. But allow us to assure our readers and the president's press secretary himself that--by their rank within the presidential hierarchy--they are higher than Mr. Kostikov and, therefore, better informed than he is.
