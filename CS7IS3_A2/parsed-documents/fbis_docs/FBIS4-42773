Bill Clinton will deliver today to the National Assembly the only "political" speech of his European tour, at a time when his ability to show real leadership in foreign affairs has been increasingly in doubt. Several international crises -- North Korea, Bosnia, Haiti -- have proven tough tests for America's determination and leadership, casting an unflattering light on Bill Clinton's weaknesses as well as those of his diplomatic team. In Paris, his aides indicated, he will likely insist on the future of Europe and transatlantic relations. This is a presumably safe issue, as it is the one on which the U.S. President has proved the least fumble-footed. Europe is probably the only field in which Bill Clinton has not committed any blunder since taking office, one in which he has actually been rather successful. Due to his intellectual and generational background, he is the first U.S. President to believe in European integration, as a result of a combination of convictions and self-interest, and to favor it unreservedly. Owing to his training, culture, and analysis, he does not have the protective -- sometimes imperial -- reflex which his predecessors, because of their war experience, tended to harbor with respect to Europe. He considers the Old Continent as politically mature and an economic competitor. Therefore he is ready to embrace equality, but also competition. To be sure, there have been many inept moves, especially in the administration's first months, on the part of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who bluntly told the Europeans they were no longer at the center of U.S. diplomacy and that Asia and its potential markets were now Washington's chief concern. To be sure, there was the lingering feeling that on the Old Continent itself Russia mattered more to Washington than did its former allies. However, since he came to power, Bill Clinton has managed to avoid major disputes with Europe. He even displayed some imagination: His idea of a partnership for peace -- a way to extend NATO's sphere of influence without altering its structure for the time being while crossing old military divides -- was adopted by every Alliance member in January. Even Russia chose to join. The confrontation with Europe -- and France in particular -- on GATT is now forgotten, with people mostly remembering that the agreement meant to deregulate world trade was eventually signed by all parties. However, relations between Europe and the United States are not just bilateral. At the moment, Mr. Clinton's main problem is one of credibility with regard to public opinion. His European partners are visibly unconcerned by the fact that the President who is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landing was never himself a soldier. Nor is his supposed lack of a "vision" of the world and its future, of an operational concept that he could navigate by -- a charge leveled by Henry Kissinger in NEWSWEEK -- the main concern of Europeans. What they worry about is a diplomacy that is exceedingly responsive to U.S. opinion, and the botched jobs observed in Bosnia or Haiti, with the President too often appearing to agree with the most vocal lobby, as dictated by the sophisticated political and strategic calculations of his pollsters or the latest pictures broadcast by CNN. In the last few days, Bill Clinton and his aides have faced an onslaught of questions on the North Korea crisis and Pyongyang's statement that any sanctions would be considered an "act of war." This inquisitiveness on the part of U.S. media mostly reflects a will to find an answer to the following question: In a crisis that would directly involve U.S. strategic interests, would Bill Clinton prove equal to the situation?
