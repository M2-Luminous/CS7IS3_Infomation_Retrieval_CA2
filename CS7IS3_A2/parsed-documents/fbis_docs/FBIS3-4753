The Malian president voiced support to the proposal for national reunification clarified by his excellency President Kim Il-song, saying he stands behind the principled stand of the DPRK to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The Equatorial Guinean prime minister said that the United States is resorting to all intrigues to stifle the Governments of Equatorial Guinea and Korea on the pretext of non-existent "human rights issue". This is part of its moves to stifle non-aligned countries, he added. He noted that the struggle of Korea to defend its sovereignty fully accords with the interests of non-aligned countries. Rigoberto Padilla Ruz, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Honduras, when he received the DPRK ambassador to Nicaragua on February 22, said that the proposal for reunification through confederacy advanced by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is the most realistic and just overture. He said he would always extend support and solidarity to the Korean people in their struggle for the reunification of the country.
