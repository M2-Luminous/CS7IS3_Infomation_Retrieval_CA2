Today, the police continue defusing explosives in the installation, Patricio Ribadeneira, manager of the Municipal Drinking Water Enterprise (EMAP), stated. The explosives destroyed the energy tower that allows the plant to function. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which "regrettably means the suspension of drinking water service in a large area of the city for several days," the manager noted. "The police are also helping workers of EMAP and the electricity enterprise handle the problem, because some charges have not exploded and constitute an imminent danger," Ribadeneira added.
