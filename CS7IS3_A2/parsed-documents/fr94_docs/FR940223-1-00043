FR940223-1-00043 FR940223-1-00006 The proposed relief would be of economic significance to the industry and is consistent with recent recommendations from the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (Commission), a Presidential task force formed in April 1993 to make policy recommendations about the financial health and future competitiveness of the U.S. airline and aerospace industries. In light of the Commission recommendations and the information submitted, the FAA has determined that the ATA has presented a persuasive case concerning the changing conditions and difficulties that carriers have encountered in attempting to meet the May 26, 1994, DFDR compliance date. The FAA does not anticipate any significant impact on safety if this proposal is adopted. Flight data recorders, regardless of the number of operational parameters they record, have no direct effect on the safe operation of an airplane. The importance of flight data recorders lies in their ability to reveal the status and operational parameters of an airplane after it is involved in an accident or other incident. Depending on what is revealed, such data can be used as the basis for altering the operation or physical characteristics of similar airplanes. Thus, for the proposed rule to have a negative impact, one of the airplanes covered by it would have to be involved in an accident in the additional 1 year, and information essential to the determination of cause must be a part of one of the five additional parameters recorded on the upgraded DFDR but not on the currently required six-parameter flight data recorders. The FAA has concluded that the chance of these particular circumstances occurring is remote. Further, the FAA has sought to limit this possibility by extending the compliance date only for Stage 2 airplanes, some of which are expected to leave the fleet by December 31, 1994, under the noise transition regulations. By requiring all other airplanes to comply with the DFDR rule are promulgated in 1987, the FAA seeks to maximize the benefit of DFDR installation. The FAA stresses that all airplanes covered under the proposed extension must still be equipped with one or more approved flight data recorders that record those parameters specified in part 121. It is only the upgrade to 11-parameter DFDR's that would be extended for a limited number of airplanes. The FAA also stresses that the proposed relief would have no effect on compliance with the Stage 3 transition. The proposed relief would not be available for Stage 2 airplanes not subject to the Stage 3 transition rule, i.e., Stage 2 airplanes that weigh less than 75,000 pounds. The proposed rule provision that requires DFDR installation at the time of the next heavy maintenance check after May 26, 1994, is the FAA's admonition to carriers that the agency expects DFDR installation to be accomplished at the earliest feasible time. A ``heavy maintenance check'' is considered to be any occasion on which the airplane is taken out of service for 4 or more days for maintenance; the FAA recognizes that carriers may have different terminology to describe this concept, and the term ``heavy maintenance check'' as used in this proposal is not meant to describe a specific recognized circumstance or event. In petitioning for an exemption from ยง121.343(c), the ATA based its argument of cost without benefit on the regulations requiring the transition to an all Stage 3 fleet. In granting the requested exemption, the FAA emphasized that the Stage 3 transition rule does not require the retirement of any Stage 2 airplanes. The exemption was thus limited to those aircraft that operators actually planned to retire rather than retrofit to meet Stage 3 noise levels. However, the operators indicated that the equipment usage and retirement plans mandated by the granted exemption were incompatible with both fleet planning capabilities and the less restrictive compliance requirements of the Stage 3 transition rule. The FAA acknowledges that the relief proposed here is not as broad as that described in the ATA petition. The FAA seeks comment from affected operators on the extent to which this proposed extension will relieve recent problems experienced in DFDR retrofits of Stage 2 airplanes. The FAA specifically requests economic data that details the costs of compliance with the current May 1994 compliance date and any costs savings anticipated from the extension proposed here. Comments that contain information concerning any quantifiable impact on safety in delaying compliance are also requested. The FAA stresses that carriers should not consider the extension as a period of deferred retrofit action. The FAA does not anticipate granting any further relief from the DFDR requirements for any airplanes beyond that proposed here. The DFDR rule was promulgated in 1987 and should have been incorporated into fleet planning by part 121 operators. The FAA acknowledges that circumstances such as the Stage 3 transition rules require some reconsideration of rule impacts, and in light of the reported difficulties in obtaining the necessary equipment and support to comply with the DFDR rule, this extension is an example of the kind of relief that the FAA considers to be justified. To date, no other substantial, quantifiable data has been presented to support further delay in compliance with the DFDR regulation. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements associated with this rule are being submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval in accordance with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 under OMB No.: New. Title: Certification and Operations: Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Air Carriers and Commercial Operators of Large Aircraft. Proposed Use of Information: Compliance enforcement. Frequency: One time per carrier. Burden estimate: $25 per air carrier. Respondents: Approximately 50 part 121 air carriers with Stage 2 aircraft. Form(s): Not applicable. Average Burden hours per respondent: 1/2 hours. For further information, contact: The Information Management Division, M&hyph;34, Office of the Secretary of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366&hyph;4735. Comments on the proposed information collection requirements should be submitted to: Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Aviation Administration. It is requested that comments sent to OMB also be sent to the FAA rulemaking docket for this proposed action. Regulatory Evaluation Summary Executive Order 12866 established the requirement that, within the extent permitted by law, a Federal regulatory action may be undertaken only if the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs to society. In response to this requirement, and in accordance with Department of Transportation policies and procedures, the FAA has estimated the anticipated benefits and costs of this rulemaking action. The FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant rulemaking action,'' as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The results are summarized in this section. The proposed rule, by extending the compliance date by up to 1 year, would allow for the installation of DFDR to coincide with the installation of noise suppression kits for those aircraft that are affected by the December 31, 1994, noise compliance date. The current exemption limits the relief from the current deadline for installing DFDR on Stage 2 airplanes that will be retired by the end of the decade, leaving aircraft intended for retrofitting with noise suppression equipment subject to the current deadline of May 1994. Any aircraft that are scheduled for retirement by the end of the decade for which an exemption has not been obtained would also be subject to this deadline.
