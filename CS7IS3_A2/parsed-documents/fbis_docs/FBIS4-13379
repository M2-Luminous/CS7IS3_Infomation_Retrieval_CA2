FBIS4-13379 "drnes076_r_94005" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 India Russian Official on Sale of F-16's, Arms Race Russian Official on Sale of F-16's, Arms Race BK1504121394 Delhi THE HINDUSTAN TIMES in English 9 Apr 94 p 9 BK1504121394 Delhi THE HINDUSTAN TIMES English BFN [Text] NEW DELHI, 8 April--The Russian Federation is of the view that the American offer of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan in return for a "verifiable" capping of the latter's fissile material production programme could unleash an arms race in South Asia. This was stated at a Press conference here today by Mr. Aleksandr Panov, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia. He said Moscow favours international guarantees rather than "trade-offs" of the nature being attempted by Washington to promote its non-proliferation objectives. That the U.S. has offered to Islamabad a one-time waiver of the Pressler Law to facilitate the supply of the deep-penetration jets, was confirmed by Mr. Strobe Talbott, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, before leaving for the Pakistani capital this afternoon following discussions in New Delhi. Asked whether the American proposal made any sense to him, Mr. Panov, who is leading his country's delegation at the ongoing 50th session of ESCAP, quipped "It makes sense for the U.S. industry which is manufacturing the F-16 aircraft. The Russian Minister's observations clearly indicated that Moscow's support can no longer be taken for granted by Washington on crucial international issues. Mr. Panov said though the U.S. was contemplating similar trade-offs in the Korean Peninsula, the resolution of the nuclear imbroglio there wouldn't be possible without the involvement of the Russian Federation. "Our highest priority is to strengthen the non-proliferation regimes," he observed to add: "We are for international guarantees..." The Minister remarked that in cases where the treaty (NPT) or regime was already in place, the emphasis should be on its compliance. As for South Asia, he suggested that an international conference with broad participation could be convened. Various CBMs (Confidence Building Measures) and procedures for transparency in military activities could also be discussed under its umbrella besides non-proliferation. "Your country stands for broader participation (in such a conference). We support that," the Minister noted. He said the exact number of participants at the conference can be determined once there was agreement in principle to hold it. Commenting on the U.S. proposal listing Germany, Japan, India and Pakistan besides the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Mr. Panov mentioned that Kazakhstan has also evinced interest and would like to be part of the exercise. The efforts by the U.S. and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] to resolve bilaterally the nuclear problem in the Korean peninsula haven't shown results, the Minister said. He offered as an option a multilateral conference with representatives of the UN and the IAEA. Mr. Panov disclosed that it has been agreed in principle that Prime Minister Narasimha Rao would visit Moscow in June, possibly mid-June, though the exact dates were yet to be finalised. Discussions are currently underway on the "substance" of the visit and agreements to be signed. Various possibilities to enhance militancy [as published] cooperation between India and Russia were being explored. One among them was the supply of MiG 29 aircraft though the parleys are at the initial stage, Mr. Panov informed. He said agreements on aviation transportation and cooperation in "Space Development" were likely during Mr. Rao's visit. Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev's visit to India that was postponed due to sudden developments in West Asia, was very much on the Indo-Russian agenda and could take place after Mr. Rao has been to Moscow.
