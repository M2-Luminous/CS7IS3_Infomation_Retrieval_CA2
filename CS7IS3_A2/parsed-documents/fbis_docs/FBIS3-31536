Correspondent David Stahlavsky talked with Kozyrev about his planned talks with Czech officials. [Stahlavsky] The Russian foreign minister is convinced that the talks will concern the Bosnian issue, among other things, because the stability of the Central and East European region is in the interests of all. Andrey Kozyrev said that relations between the Czech Republic and Russia are based on history and enjoy good prospects. An assessment should be made of the ways in which European partnership could be developed. This assessment should be free of prejudice and mutual suspicions. Kozyrev told Czech Radio that he is against reviving the old doctrines on the inequality of relations. The main thing is to build a new, big, and united Europe. The Russian minister of foreign affairs emphasized that no one has a ready-made prescription for doing this. He went on to add: [Begin Kozyrev recording in Russian, fading to superimposed Czech translation] Partnership for Peace is one of the variants for joining NATO. We do not prevent anyone from doing so because this is a matter on which all of the states, including the Czech Republic, will have to decide themselves. [end recording] [Stahlavsky] But Andrey Kozyrev emphasized that there is no need to focus only on NATO and recalled the existence of the Visegrad Four, the CSCE, and others. There is no need to work against these forms of cooperation. All of the options should be used in the interest of political, economic, and cultural benefit, Kozyrev said.
