The front's statement says: We pity and feel deep sorrow for our brother and comrade, Mustafa, because of his recent psychological and nervous deterioration. Therefore, we attach no importance whatsoever to the contents of that statement, the whole issue is considered an idle talk and an object of mockery. Despite this, the lengthy statement says that Khamis suffers from a superiority complex and psychological trouble, and that this was caused when he was arrested in 1967 by the Zionist enemy and was exposed, like other strugglers, to brutal torture, which he could not stand because of its fierceness and his weak metal state. The front says that Khamis rejected the logic of financial rationing and accountability and insisted on improvised and secret accounts. Concluding, the statement says that all this expresses an incoherent personality and deep changes in his awareness and behavior. The front's statement, however, asserts that brother Mustafa was one of the nationalists of whom the front was proud.
