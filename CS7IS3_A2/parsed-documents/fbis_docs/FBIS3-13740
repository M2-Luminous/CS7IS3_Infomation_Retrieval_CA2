Details of the statement from my colleague Nacera Bouzid: [Bouzid] The statement by the General Staff of the People's National Army says that however legitimate the preoccupations of public opinion on this subject, such calculations are mistaken and it will once more be impossible for the People's National Army to fail again in its duty of reiterating, without ambiguity, the spirit of responsibility with which it is endowed. The People's National Army, which is not unaware that these imaginary differences are intentionally propagated and circulated by certain sources and circles with the aim of causing harm, insists on reassuring public opinion and the vital national forces that the Army will fulfill the obligations already announced toward the institutions of the state, the Constitution, the options, and the recommendations sanctioned by the National Conference. The Armed Forces' public role, the statement added, is to remain under the orders of the state authority, which exercises political power. As far as speculations, which were the outcome of the political initiative [dialogue with other forces] were concerned, the People's National Army, with all its formations, cannot but reiterate its confidence in the head of state performing his sensitive task. Concerning the criminal acts of terrorism and sabotage that the country and the population have been suffering daily, it is clear, the statement pointed out, that they are two diseases that cannot under any circumstances be accepted by the Algerian state. The People's National Army will, therefore, continue, together with all other security services, forces, and the population to fight them regardless of the price in order to restore security, stability, and tranquillity and to protect a republican, democratic, pluralist state that guarantees basic national values, as well as individual and collective rights and freedoms.
