Gopalsami launched his election campaign at Mylapore on Friday night in support of his party, the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) candidate, Mr. (Kalaipuli) S. Dhanu. Only 12 hours earlier, the name and the design of his party flag were finalised and announced marking his group's complete break with the parent organisation, the DMK which once held him out as its `battle sword'. Mr. Gopalsami began his speech well after midnight and kept his sway over the audience till the end. The late C.N. Annadurai was sought to be projected at the venue of the meeting through an illuminated cutout and a huge painting which formed the backdrop at the dais. While his attack on the AIADMK was sharp and forthright, his snide remarks on the DMK drew cheers from the crowd. Mr. Gopalsami relied on the record of his group's conduct in politics in the last six months since its exit from the DMK to make that appeal to the electorate of Mylapore. `People should realise that Tamil Nadu now needs a disciplined force like ours', he said and shared his perception that the electoral verdict in Mylapore and Perundurai would decide the future of the State. That he was keen to woo all segments of society was evident from the way he began his speech. He recalled the great people in the different sects who had made Mylapore proud and said he had come to the same place to seek the support of the people. He branded the AIADMK Government under Ms. Jayalalitha as the most corrupt in the whole country. `We don't want gun culture; we don't also want suitcase culture,' he said. The sizeable Brahmin population in the constituency appeared to have weighed with some of the speakers. Mr. L. Ganesan, the theoretician for the MDMK said the word `Marumalarchi' (renaissance) in the party's name did not mean going back to the roots of the Dravidian movement and revive the anti-Brahmin attitude. At one point of time a movement against Brahmins was needed but now it was only against brahminism. Brahminism need not be with Brahmins alone but could be found in other sections of society also. The party was also not irreligious. The candidate Mr. Dhanu himself opened the speech by reciting Sanskrit slokas and a reference to his worshipping at the temple before setting out to file his nomination. What, however, went down well with the crowd was his offer of thanks to the 67 candidates who had arrayed themselves against him in the election and his homage to late T.M. Rangarajan whose death in an accident caused the bye-election.
