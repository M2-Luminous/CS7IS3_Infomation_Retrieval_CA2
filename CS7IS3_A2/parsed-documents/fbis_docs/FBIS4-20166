The Russian Foreign Ministry has announced that the border is being closed for construction work, which will start at the beginning of June. Russia estimates that the work will be completed by mid-August. Finland is seeking to gain further clarification about the closure of Vaertsilae by organizing a meeting of Finnish and Russian frontier delegates. The Vaertsilae border crossing station near Niirala in northern Karelia has been kept open by mutual agreement between the frontier delegates. Thus far, it has not been open to international traffic. During Vaertsilae's closure, the Russian authorities recommend that goods traffic use the Uukuniemi and that passenger traffic use the Vartius border crossing points.
