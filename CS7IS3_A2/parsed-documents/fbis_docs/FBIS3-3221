The FEC recommended that the "Report on the Implementation of the 1993 Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Draft 1994 Plan" delivered by Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, be approved and a draft 1994 plan for national economic and social development be adopted. In the process of carrying out the national plan, any partial adjustment of the plan necessitated by major changes of the circumstances has to be reported in advance to the NPC Standing Committee for examination and approval. The examination report points out: In 1993, people of all nationalities across the country -- under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and in accordance with the guidelines of the First Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC -- worked in unity and scored major progress in economic construction, reform and opening up. The national economy registered sustained growth, a good harvest was recorded in agriculture, and grain output grew continuously. Industrial production maintained a rather high growth rate and state plans for major products were fulfilled. A number of key construction projects and technical upgrading projects of the state were completed and put into operation. The market at home and abroad was brisk, income in both urban and rural areas grew, and living standards continued to improve. China's opening up continued to advance to higher levels and expanded in all directions and in all domains. There was a sharp rise in the utilization of foreign capital and further progress was achieved in science and technology, education, and other social undertakings. The report believes that in spite of the progress, there are some problems meriting our attention. The major ones are: Insufficient capacity for sustained growth in agriculture, grain production in particular; a rather sharp drop in cotton output; an overly large volume of investment in fixed assets; irrational structures; slow progress in industrial restructuring; a worsening of "bottleneck" restraints regarding some infrastructure facilities and basic industries, with a large proportion of enterprises operating in the red and with large deficits; high inflation; and an import growth rate higher than that of export. We must take these problems seriously and conscientiously solve them in the new year. The FEC offered the following suggestions for the smooth implementation of the 1994 plan: 1. Extend every effort to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control in order to ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. 2. Continue to develop the rural economy in an all-round way and protect peasants' economic interests. 3. Continue efforts to improve economic efficiency. 4. Exercise strict control over the volume of investment in fixed assets and optimize the investment pattern. 5. Maintain tight control on credit volume and issuance of currency. 6. Strictly control inflation and display genuine concern for the people's livelihood. 7. Properly solve some of the problems in science and technology, education, culture, public health, other social undertakings about which the people care. The report points out: The tasks of reform, opening up, and economic development in 1994 are onerous. New situations and new problems are bound to arise in our march forward. Favorable conditions, however, also abound. In order to successfully accomplish the various tasks, we must unify our thinking in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, and the decision adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and seize and take full advantage of the opportunity. Government at all levels must further mobilize the initiative of the masses, get them mobilized and organized, and get them to understand and support reform with the utmost enthusiasm and plunge themselves into the great practice of reform. Leading cadres at all levels must work with one heart and one mind, set a good example, work hard and do solid work, tell the truth, provide real services, and guard against going through the motions or doing things for appearance's sake. We must go deeply into the realities of life, maintain close contact with the masses, serve the people wholeheartedly, and strive for the successful accomplishment of the 1994 Plan for National Economic and Social Development.
