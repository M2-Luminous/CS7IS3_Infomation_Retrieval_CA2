M-11, -12, -13, -14, -15--automatic freight vessels. Purpose of launch was to deliver consumables and various freight to Mir orbital station. Kosmos--name of series of artificial Earth satellites that have been launched regularly from the country's cosmodromes (starting on 16 March 1962). Their tasks include: --study of the concentration of charged particles in the ionosphere for the purpose of researching the propagation of radio waves, corpuscular streams and particles of small energies, the energy composition of the radiation belts of the Earth to assess the radiation hazard in prolonged space flights, processes of adaptation and weightlessness, the primary composition of cosmic rays and variations in their intensity, the magnetic field of the Earth, the shortwave emissions of the sun and other heavenly bodies, the upper layers of the atmosphere and the effects of meteoric matter on structural elements of space objects; --research on space materials science, determining the influence of factors of space flight on living organisms, the receipt of efficient information on the Earth's natural resources in the interests of various sectors of the national economy and international collaboration; --trying out elements and apparatus of space navigational systems (being created for the purpose of determining the locations of aircraft and maritime vessels), experimental apparatus intended for the system for determining the location of ships and aircraft that are lost, experimental apparatus for the relay of telegraph and telephone information, equipment, units and elements of the structural elements of satellites in various flight modes, including joint; --receipt of efficient information and continuation of run-through of new types of information-measurement apparatus and methods of remote research of the Earth's surface, atmosphere and oceans in the interests of various sectors of the national economy, science and international collaboration. Molniya-1--a communications satellite intended to support the operations of long-range telephone and telegraph radio communications systems, as well as the transmission of programs from Central Television to points on the Orbita network. Soyuz TM-14, -15--improved spacecraft intended for the delivery of crews to multipurpose manned systems of a modular type. New systems for approach and docking, radio communications and emergency rescue, as well as a new combined engine and parachute system, have been installed on the craft. Gorizont--communications satellite to support around-the- clock long-range telephone and telegraph radio communications and the transmission of television programs to stations of the Orbita and Moskva networks, as well as for use in the Intersputnik international satellite communications system. Resurs-F--a satellite intended for the performance of multiple-zone and spectral-zone photographing in various scales for the purpose of researching the Earth's natural resources in the interests of various sectors of the national economy and accomplishing tasks of ecology and international collaboration. Foton--a satellite intended for researching space materials science. The flight program envisaged the conduct of experiments to obtain crystals of proteins and semiconductor materials with improved properties under the conditions of microgravitation, as well as to try out technologies for their experimental industrial production. Scientific-research apparatus was also installed on the satellite for the National Center for Space Research of France. Molniya-3--a communications satellite to support the operations of long-range telegraph and telephone radio communications, the transmission of the programs of Central Television to points on the Orbita network and international collaboration. Ekran--a satellite for television broadcasting with on-board relay gear supporting the transmission of the programs of Central Television to shared receiving devices in the decimeter waveband. There were 75 spacecraft in all launched into orbit in 1992, including the Kosmos 2177--Kosmos 2179, Kosmos 2187--Kosmos 2194, Kosmos 2197--Kosmos 2202, Kosmos 2204--Kosmos 2206 and Kosmos 2211--Kosmos 2216 using the same launch vehicle.
