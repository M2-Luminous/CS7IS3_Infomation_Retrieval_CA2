What were the most important decisions that were made? [Wlosowicz] If it were not for the painful burden of the drama of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the current session could be regarded as peaceful. An atmosphere of cooperation prevailed, even though a lot of emotions were stirred up by the negotiations on establishing the post of a high commissioner for human rights. There was even a point when reaching compromise on this controversial issue seemed impossible. And yet agreement was reached, which is another proof of ideological differences being less and less of an obstacle in the UN's functioning. Initiating a debate on reforms of the Security Council was another significant part of the session--for the first time, a general debate on the issue took place. A unanimous lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa, with the hope of a permanent breaking with the apartheid phenomenon--that was a historical event. From Poland's perspective, what is important is the fact that the concept of "countries of economies in a transitional period" obtained recognition in the UN vocabulary. We have initiated the idea. Until recently, Poland was classified as a developed country. That was perhaps nice but it was also impractical because it placed the country beyond the scope of assistance programs from which developing countries benefit. The recognition by the UN of the existence of a group of countries with economies in a transitional period, creates a much more advantageous situation for us. [passage omitted] [Walczak] What is the fate of the initiative to establish a UN Center for Human Rights in East and Central Europe, which would be headquartered in Warsaw? [Wlosowicz] The initiative was submitted by [former] Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski during a general debate in October of last year. The Foreign Ministry is working on coming up with a specific formula for the planned center, which could then be proposed to the international community. [passage omitted] [Walczak] Some proposals have emerged that aimed at extending the list of the Security Council's permanent members, to also include Germany and Japan. Is there anyone to oppose that? Who are the other candidates? [Wlosowicz] Indeed, even though the concerned countries themselves are acting with restraint, there are ever more views being raised to the effect that Germany and Japan, due to their political and economic positions, should be included in the Security Council as its permanent members. Practically speaking, no one is putting that in question anymore, and a consensus on that issue is emerging. Yet the opening up of the Security Council to new members gives rise to another problem: Who else should be included? All regions would like to see their representatives as the Security Council's permanent members. Separate from that, proposals are being voiced to extend the Security Council to the level of 20-25 members. Poland does not oppose changes, generally speaking, but its view is that the interest of the countries of East and Central Europe should also be taken into account in the process of restructuring the Security Council. Debate on this issue is just beginning, and no one actually has a rigid position on it. [passage omitted] [Walczak] What is your position on the proposal to establish a 10,000-strong UN army? The initiative was submitted by a commission set up by the U.S. Congress, whose goal is to examine possible ways of reforming the UN. Is the proposal realistic? Perhaps what would be more realistic is the establishment by the individual countries of special units of rapid deployment that would be ready for action immediately once a signal from the UN came in. What is Poland's position on that issue? [Wlosowicz] Poland supports the idea of establishing forces that would be at the disposal of the secretary general. The shape these forces will take and the way they will function are the subject of proceedings of a team that has been established especially for that purpose and that also includes a Polish staff military officer. Eighty countries, including Poland, expressed their readiness to form units to participate in such forces. Right now, the biggest problem is not so much a lack of volunteers to participate in permanent UN forces as reservations being made by many countries concerning the secretary general's discretion applied in each case regarding whether the countries' units should be deployed. That could place a serious limitation on the efficiency of future permanent UN forces. On the other hand, the countries' concern for their own troops is understandable. [Walczak] Is a change of the peacekeeping operations' formula possible without close participation by the United States? As is well known, the Americans do not participate in operations by the "Blue Helmets" because they follow the rule that U.S. soldiers cannot serve under a foreign commander (the U.S. troops in Somalia act outside of the structure of UN forces). During his speech at the General Assembly, President Bill Clinton stated that future peacekeeping operations will have to meet some strictly defined criteria in order for the Americans to participate in them. Doesn't that mean that the United States is unwilling to take part in peacekeeping operations? [Wlosowicz] We are witnessing increased involvement by the United States not only in direct participation but also in an active formulation of a new concept of "peacekeeping." This process was initiated as early as during the last period of the previous [U.S.] administration. Right now, we are witnessing many U.S. initiatives, including informal ones, like the "contact group for peacekeeping operations," which discussed some practical aspects of those initiatives. We should keep in mind that the United States will always be interested in peacekeeping operations. That is because practically one-third of the expenditures associated with each of those operations comes from U.S. taxpayers. Therefore, President Clinton's statement should be perceived mainly as an expression of concern about the operations' goal and effectiveness, and only secondarily as a need by the UN to fulfill formal requirements enabling U.S. troops to participate in peacekeeping operations. [Walczak] The permanent representation you have been in charge of for a year now is famous for its significant political and cultural activity, also beyond the UN. How do you manage to take care of all of the ingredients of this responsible job? [Wlosowicz] I perceive my mission in very broad terms, and that is also the way I perform it. We must keep in mind that we continue to be at the stage of creating a new image of Poland abroad. So I use every possible opportunity to contribute to that goal. The UN is firmly placed in the realities of U.S. political, economic, and cultural life, and that is why I frequently take part in other forums. Apart form that, the United States is also a country with a huge and influential group of people of Polish origin. There is never too much contact with them.
