Pensioners have turned out to be one of the most socially unprotected categories of the population. Even though people who have worked honestly all their lives have a right to count on the support of the state and a fitting old age. Pension reform is still at the revision stage, but it appears that its main outlines have already been drawn. In particular, it is most likely that the procedure for recalculation of the size of pensions in connection with the increase in prices for consumer goods and services that has been worked out to the present time will be retained. Periodically (for example, once a quarter), the old age pensions computed by the social insurance organs will be increased either by a specific sum (called "compensation"), or by a specific percentage ("indexation"). But two questions arise: Which variant is better? And will the increased pension cover the increase in prices? Let us try to analyze this. Until November 1993 the recalculation of pensions was conducted by means of indexation of its previously computed quantity in accordance with the price increase index. If in the quarter prices grew by a factor of 1.9, the pension was correspondingly increased by a factor of 1.9; its purchasing power did not change, i.e., the quantity of goods and services a pensioner could pay for remained unchanged. In November, instead of the regular indexation of pensions the government introduced "compensation" for price increases. All pensions were increased by one and the same figure--11,700 rubles [R]. This procedure was repeated in February 1994. Every pensioner received a pension addition of R8,000. The thesis of social justice was advanced as the main argument for the transition to this form, inasmuch as it guaranteed a greater degree of social support of pensioners who receive the minimum pension and who are in the most difficult material situation. As a matter of fact, the change in the compensation method of recalculating pensions was obviously made for the purpose of saving the monetary resources of the state budget and the Pension Fund (which turned out to be practically empty at the end of October), and had little to do with the principle of social justice. The introduction of additions to pensions did not ensure compensation for price increases even at its minimum size, although theoretically they were supposed to be calculated in a percentage term precisely from the minimum pension. The first compensation sum was determined precisely this way: For the August-October period prices increased by a factor of 1.8, or 180 percent. The compensation amount was R11,700 (80 percent of the minimum pension of R14,620), and accordingly the minimum sum of payments totaled R26,320 (more than the minimum pension by a factor of 1.8). However, over November-January, with a price increase of a factor of 1.6, the minimum pension was increased by a factor of 1.3. This occurred because the February compensation (R8,000) was established not on the actual minimum pension (R26,320) but based on its official value, which remained unchanged. It was this figure that was indexed in accordance with the increase in prices. But the purchasing power of the remaining part of the pension was correspondingly decreased by a factor of 1.6. The change in the procedure for revising pensions was reflected in a substantially more negative way on pensioners who had a pension that was higher than the minimum, since an even lesser part of the pension was indexed for them. Thus, for example, the purchasing power of a maximum old age pension (the size of which in August 1993 was R52,632, given a length of service of 40 years and more, and in February 1994--R72,332) was reduced by more than a factor of two (with an increase in prices for this period of a factor of 2.9, the pension increased by a factor of 1.37). If the indexation procedure for revising pensions had been maintained, in February 1994 the minimum pension would have totaled R42,100 instead of R34,320 (14,620 + 11,700 + 8,000), and the maximum--R153,000, which is comparable to the average wage in February. However, a 1:2 ratio of maximum old age pension to average wage cannot be considered satisfactory, taking into account the fact that the question concerns specifically the maximum value of a pension, whose reference point should be the 75 percent level of the wage that a worker receives. As a result of the use of the compensation method, a substantial reduction occurred in the ratio between the maximum and minimum old age pension from 3.6:1 to 2.1:1, which reduced the importance of work length of service and professional qualifications and appropriately aroused the indignation of pensioners who had worked all their lives. In May the government once again returned to the indexation method of recalculating pensions, increasing previously calculated pensions by a factor of 1.3 (according to the statistics of the State Committee for Statistics of the Russian Federation, prices increased this much in the February-May period). Thus, the minimum pension was R19,000 (14,620 x 1.3), which was also fixed as the official minimum. Added to this is the previously introduced compensation of R19,700, giving a total of R38,700. It would seem that this time the increase in computed pensions covered the increase in prices, but it turns out that by far not all pensioners can be happy. In accordance with pension legislation in effect, old age pensions cannot exceed three of its minimum values. And although the minimum pension in May amounts to R38,700, the official minimum of R19,000 is used for calculating the "ceiling." But the "ceiling" itself in May is being determined in the following way: Three minimum pensions (R19,000 x 3 = R57,000) plus compensation (R19,700)--for a total of R76,700. Additional percentages for length of service can increase the first constituted maximum pension up to R68,400 (given a length of service of 40 years and more). If, in addition, a person was born before 1931, it is considered that he worked during the war, and he can count on another 50 percent of the minimum pension; i.e., R9,500. Totaling the enumerated figures, we get R97,600. Thus, those whose pensions, calculated before May 1994, were more than R75,077 (taking all additions into account) will not be able to use the results of the May indexation of pensions in full measure, and the purchasing power of their pensions will be reduced once more. Naturally there is no question of any kind of compensation for previous debts to pensioners. In April 1994 a revision was started of the base for calculating pensions for those formulated before 1993, with an increase of a factor of 1.8. This measure is directed at correcting errors committed in establishing the coefficients for "updating" past earnings. Undoubtedly, it will make it possible to improve the material situation of a rather numerous category of pensioners; however, in this case as well, those whose pension was less (did not exceed R27,000) will end up winning most. For the others, the limiter on increasing the scale of pensions will be the very same old age pension "ceiling," and the increase in the base of the calculation by a factor of 1.8 will not lead to a corresponding increase in pensions. Everything that has been said makes it possible to come to the conclusion that the measures being undertaken by the government for regulating pensions, while ensuring a certain protection of the incomes of pensioners from inflation, do not fully compensate for price increases. The more pension a person receives, the less compensation, consequently a leveling of pensions is occurring regardless of preceding work contribution.
