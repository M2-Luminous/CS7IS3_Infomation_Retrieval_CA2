Luzhkov expressed his disgreement in an offficial message addressed to the Russian prime minister. The document, which came to ITAR-TASS today, says that Luzhkov cannot put up with the fact that the Russian prime minister did not support proposals nade by the city administration about special ways of holding privatisation in Moscow. In Luzhkov's opinion, "special conditions" suggest that the mayor's office can manage facilities of federal property located on the territory of the capital, reserve the right to control a package of shares of privatised enterprises and independently determine the size of the authorized stock of auctioned enterprises. Luzhkov believes that all this runs contrary to the law on privatisation, including in part that a considerable part of colossal property concentrated in the capital will not be exchnaged into privatisation vouchers. Earlier, it was reported that Russian President Boris Yeltsin familiarised himself with a draft law worked out by the Moscow city authorities in 1993 " on the introduction of a special order of privatisation in Moscow" and instructed the Russian government and the Russian Committee for State Property to jointly work out "compromise proposals." However, officials of the Moscow government reported that the Moscow authorities had not yet sat down at the negotiating table with experts of the Russian Committee for State Property. Recent developments show that a conflict between the Moscow mayor's office and the Committee for State Property over the pravatisation of the city property might turn into a conflict between the Moscow authorities and the federal government.
