FR940906-0-00052 FR940906-0-00019 Comment 6. The first-year fee collection program should be restructured to avoid the proposed ``double payment'' program requiring vessels using observers to pay the costs of observer coverage in addition to paying the Research Plan fee, with a later rebate for observer costs. Alternative fee collection programs include crediting billed fee assessments for observer costs, an accelerated rebate of costs for observer coverage over the 2-percent assessment rate, or a system where vessels and processors currently paying for observers would not be required to pay the Research Plan fee. Response. NMFS agrees and has implemented a revised program for the first year of the Research Plan that allows processors to subtract from their billed fee assessments observer costs incurred by the processor during 1995. Groundfish catcher vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) length overall (LOA) and crab catcher vessels required to carry observers while participating in specified crab fisheries will be exempt from fee assessments during 1995 because these two sectors of the Research Plan fisheries currently pay costs for observer coverage that are equal to or greater than amounts they would contribute under the Research Plan fee assessment program. Comment 7. The proposed rebate program during the first year of the Research Plan constitutes an unfair imposition on the segment of the industry that supposedly has already been unfairly burdened, particularly vessels that currently are required to obtain 100-percent observer coverage. A different approach is recommended under which industry participants who are not now paying any observer costs would pay the 2-percent fee; those who are paying for 30-percent observer coverage would continue to pay for that coverage, without rebate, and would pay 70 percent of the 2-percent fee; and those who are paying for 100-percent observer coverage would continue to pay for that coverage, without rebate, and would not pay any portion of the 2-percent fee. In the second year, all participants would be assessed the same fee percentage under the percentage fee system. Response. NMFS has revised the first year of the Research Plan to eliminate the proposed rebate program. The final rule exempts from the first-year fee assessment program those operations that currently pay costs for observer coverage that equal or exceed costs that they would pay under the Research Plan once it is fully implemented (see the response to Comment 6). Furthermore, participants in the Research Plan fisheries who currently are not required to obtain observer coverage will pay their full portion of the 1995 fee percentage. Because the fee percentage authorized under the Research Plan is assessed against the exvessel value of retained catch, fee assessments can exceed current costs for observer coverage by vessels and processors required to have 100-percent observer coverage. These operations will be required to pay the difference between the fee assessment and observer costs. Once the Research Plan is fully implemented, all participants in the Research Plan fisheries will contribute equitably to the payment of Research Plan fee assessments based on the annual fee percentage and the exvessel value of retained catch. Comment 8. If the proposed rule is revised to eliminate the first-year rebate program, concern exists that insufficient start-up funds would be collected to allow full implementation of the Research Plan by January 1996. This is of particular concern if fees are assessed only against fish harvested and processed by vessels or processors not required to obtain observer coverage. Response. See the response to Comment 6. The revised program for the first year of the Research Plan will collect fees from all participants in the Research Plan fisheries except from those persons who pay costs for required observer coverage that exceed their fee liability under the Research Plan. Based on the analysis presented in the final environmental assessment/regulatory impact review (EA/RIR) and assuming a 2-percent fee percentage for 1995, the revised program should provide sufficient start-up funds for full implementation of the Research Plan by January 1996. Comment 9. If a rebate program is implemented for the first year of the Research Plan, rebates should be based on actual costs for observer coverage and not on a ``standardized cost of an observer day.'' Response. NMFS agrees. Although the final rule implementing the Research Plan does not include a rebate program, a processor can subtract from its portion of a billed fee assessment the actual costs incurred by the processor for observer coverage during 1995. Comment 10. The Research Plan should include a requirement for an annual audit of the program by an independent (non-government) auditor. Response. At this time NMFS believes that a regulatory requirement for an annual audit of the Research Plan by an independent (non-government) auditor is unnecessary. Under the Department of Commerce (DOC) Financial Management System (FIMA), annual financial reports that summarize all financial activity within the Observer Fund will be prepared for review by the Council's Observer Oversight Committee (OOC) and the Council. Special audits by a non-government or independent governmental agency, such as the General Accounting Office (GAO) or the DOC Inspector General, can be solicited by the Council, provided the intended extent of the audit is clearly defined and the audit utilizes generally accepted governmental auditing standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. NMFS believes costs associated with a special audit would be recoverable under the Research Plan. Comment 11. The proposed requirements for 60-day and 10-day advance notice to observer contractors for observer coverage do not pose a problem for those fishing seasons that are scheduled regularly and well in advance. These requirements will be impossible to meet when inseason changes in season opening dates occur, or when reserves are released. These latter types of announcements are frequently made with notice of a week or less, obviously precluding any ability to arrange for an observer 60, or even 10 days, in advance. The proposed rule should be revised to provide an exception for situations in which advance notice cannot be given due to circumstances outside the control of the vessel owner. Response. The final rule implementing the Research Plan does not change the proposed criteria for notifying an observer contractor of a vessel's or processor's observer needs. The 60-day and 10-day notification periods are necessary to guarantee the availability of observers to meet observer coverage requirements, particularly if additional observer training classes must be arranged to meet the demand for observer coverage. NMFS agrees that circumstances could occur that would preclude a person from providing a 60-day or 10-day notice to an observer contractor for observer coverage. If this should occur, NMFS cannot guarantee the availability of observers to satisfy observer coverage requirements. NMFS is aware of the logistic and planning problems that can arise when fisheries are opened on short notice and will attempt to provide sufficient advance notice of inseason fishery openings to allow vessels and processors to comply with observer coverage requirements. Comment 12. Designated observer embarkment/disembarkment locations were proposed for Alaska in the preamble to the proposed rule. Vessels based in Washington State often proceed directly to the fishing grounds and the proposed rule should be revised to add one or two locations for embarkment/disembarkment of observers in Washington.
