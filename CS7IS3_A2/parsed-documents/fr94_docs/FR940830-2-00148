Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board will hold its fall meeting October 12, 1994, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The meeting will be held at the Alexis Park Hotel, 375 East Harmon, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109; Tel (702) 796&hyph;3300; Fax (202) 796&hyph;4334. The pubic is welcome to attend the meeting, which will begin at 8:30 A.M. Presentations during the one-day meeting will address the process of site-suitability determination, the Department of Energy's (DOE) priorities in testing and data collection and the rationale for those priorities, and views on the role of natural and engineered barriers, including those form nuclear waste programs outside the United States. Discussions during the course of the day will focus on the DOE's waste isolation strategy, site-suitability issues (including the use of expert judgment), and those features, events, and processes that could pose a serious challenge to Yucca Mountain's viability as the site of a potential repository. A final round-table discussion will explore the role that natural and engineered barriers should play in assessing site suitability. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 to evaluate the technical and scientific validity of activities undertaken by the DOE in its program to manage the disposal of the nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste. In that same legislation, Congress directed the DOE to characterize a site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for its suitability as a potential location for a permanent repository for the disposal of that waste. Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning November 28, 1994.
