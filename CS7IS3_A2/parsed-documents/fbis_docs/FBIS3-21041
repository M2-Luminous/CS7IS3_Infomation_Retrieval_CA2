The Brevel, intended for the operational needs of the French and German Armies, has been in development since October 1992 under an overall contract worth 1400 million FF [French Francs] (approximately 400 million DM [Deutsche Marks]), for a six-year period. Several technically ambitious subassemblies have already been developed for the program by MATRA DEFENSE and STN Systemtechnik Nord and are being tested intensively. The Brevel is an observation system built around drones (small pilotless aircraft) carrying IR camera and transmitting images of the area covered to a ground station in real time, during the day or at night. The ground reception station controls the drones and image processing. Because it is small, stealthy, easy to handle and move and highly reliable, the Brevel is ideal for executing dangerous reconnaissance missions with maximum precision and without involving a threat to the life of a pilot. The current political situation in Europe requires means for coping with crises, particularly, surveillance systems capable of providing civil and military authorities with data on which to base decisions. Because of its stealth qualities and resistance to all types of jamming an because it is remote guided, the Brevel is ideal for such missions.
