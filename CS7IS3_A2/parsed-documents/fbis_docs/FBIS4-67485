The guidelines are expected to urge APEC members to enhance antipollution measures and improve labor conditions like wages, the source said. Japan aims at presenting the draft for the guidelines to 17 APEC members in preparatory work for the annual ministerial meeting to be held in Jakarta in late November, he said. The APEC, established in 1989, groups Japan, Malaysia, Canada, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brunei, Indonesia, the United States, Philippines, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico. The guidelines will include protection of tropical forest, introduction of a minimum wage ceiling system and enforcement of compulsory education with their medium-and long-term targets, the source said. The camp of industrialized nations, led by the U.S. and France, calls for tightening trade curbs on such countries where preservation of environment and labor conditions remain below international standards, while developing countries fear such measures would risk their economic development.
