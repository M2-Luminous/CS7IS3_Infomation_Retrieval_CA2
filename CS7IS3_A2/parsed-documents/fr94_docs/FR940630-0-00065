FR940630-0-00065 FR940630-0-00023 34 CFR Part 668 RIN 1840&hyph;AC09 Student Assistance General Provisions AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of revised effective date; final regulations. SUMMARY: In the Federal Register of April 29, 1994 (59 FR 22278), the Secretary published interim final regulations with invitation to comment for the Student Assistance General Provisions, 34 CFR part 668. The Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations until July 1, 1994. By delaying the effective date, the Secretary seeks to reduce confusion about the effective date of these regulations by making the effective date consistent with the effective date of other changes to the regulations published by the Secretary at the same time. EFFECTIVE DATES: These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994, with the exception of ยง668.17 (f) and (h) which will become effective after the information collection requirements contained in this section have been submitted by the Department of Education and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Pamela A. Moran, Acting Chief, Loans Branch, Division of Policy Development, Policy, Training, and Analysis Service, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW. (room 4310, ROB&hyph;3), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5449. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;8242. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The interim final regulations which are subject to this change in effective date implement certain provisions of the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 relating to the determination of institutional cohort default rates in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The effective date of these regulations has been delayed until July 1, 1994 so that all of the regulations implementing changes to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (HEA), published by the Secretary on April 29, 1994 will take effect on July 1, 1994. The Secretary was informed that there was confusion about the effective date of the regulations because the other regulations published on April 29, 1994 and implementing changes to the HEA were not effective until July 1, 1994. The Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations to resolve the confusion and to afford participants in the FFEL program additional time to comply with the requirements of these regulations. Waiver of Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)), and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, because the Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations for only a brief period to reduce confusion and afford participants in the FFEL program additional time for compliance, the Secretary finds, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that the solicitation of public comment on this change in the effective date would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number: 84.032 Federal Family Education Loan Program) Dated: June 27, 1994. Richard W. Riley, Secretary of Education.
