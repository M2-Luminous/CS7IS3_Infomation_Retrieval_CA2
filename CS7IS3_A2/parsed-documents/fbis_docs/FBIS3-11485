As Caracol reported, Friday afternoon Fidel Castro told Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin that after having reviewed the list of participants to the Fourth Meeting of Solidarity, watching videos of the meeting, and looking at pictures that were taken of the event, the Cuban Government is able to guarantee -- his word of honor at stake -- that Ivan Marquez, Alfonso Cano, or Sincelejo Bishop Nel Beltran were not at that meeting, much less a guerrilla summit. Fidel Castro also denied that his government has given the Colombian Guerrilla Coordinating Board an office so it can carry out subversive operations in Colombia. Caracol can also confirm that reliable sources have reported that the alleged evidence and proof of subversive leaders participating in the alleged Havana summit given to the Colombian Government by the Prosecutor General's Office were based solely on statements by a nun, who had gone to the Prosecutor General's Office and offered her testimony. In her statement, she says she believes she saw Nel Beltran at that conference, that he was a person that looked very much like a person she had met in our country. This is too flimsy, too weak a testimony and will probably be considered meaningless in the next few hours once it is established that the nun's testimony saying she saw Nel Beltran and the guerrilla leaders in Havana is the only testimony of that kind. The embarrassing situation caused by EL TIEMPO will be resolved this week and relations will not be broken. The Gaviria administration will find President Fidel Castro's explanation satisfactory, and that will be the end of it.
