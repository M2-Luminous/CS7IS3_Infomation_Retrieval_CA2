The citizens have long been accustomed to putting up with the rules and practices of the single-party system when it comes to managing and taking responsibility for social concerns. Under that system, any initiative outside the official institutions of the state was not permitted, and the citizens found themselves subject to all kinds of favorable or unfavorable measures adopted by the government on the strength of its social prerogatives. The continuation of that code of management in our country for more than a quarter of a century is at the origin of the citizen's lack of concern over any public action not affecting him directly. Despite that attitude, which has become an undeniable social reality, the process of setting up neighborhood committees and rural centers, which was begun precisely for the purpose of involving the citizens in the management of public affairs, has had a more or less favorable impact on the population. The legislative elections in December 1991 enabled the members of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] to control most of the APC's [People's Communal Assemblies] across the country. As a result of the weakness and deterioration of the services they were providing, the Ministry of Interior and Local Communities decided to establish 10,000 neighborhood committees and rural centers as part of its operation for "citizen participation in the management of local affairs." That operation was launched in the form of directives and instructions issued to local authorities. The purpose is to involve the citizen in his problems of an administrative or social nature, examples being sewage, drinking water, repairs to streets and sidewalks, trash collection, street lighting, the opening of trails, and the construction of youth centers, as well as contributions to the embellishment of his neighborhood. As of now, 2,000 projects and miniprojects are already under way. How To Set Up a Committee To set up a committee, residents of the same neighborhood hold a general meeting and elect 15 people, all of whom are from that same neighborhood. Those 15 elected individuals then constitute the neighborhood committee. As elected representatives, they draw up the minutes of the meeting and submit them to the DEC [local executive office] for approval and also so that premises in the neighborhood can be assigned to them. The committee will manage the neighborhood both administratively and socially. It will be regarded as the spokesman for the citizens and as the safeguard for protecting the property of the citizens and the state. According to a summary of the statistics submitted by the various governorates and communes, 3,667 neighborhood committees and rural centers are planned. The budget made available for that purpose in 1994 by the Common Fund for Local Communities (FCCL) totals 500 million dinars [DA]. According to the same summary, the number of communal coordinating boards totals 630, with 203,986 members. They represent an estimated population of 3,847,042. In that regard, 1,500 agreements totaling DA176,367,819 have been signed nationwide, and 2,023 additional agreements are under study. According to a report evaluating the projects submitted by the departments concerned, it should be noted that in the Alger Governorate, the operation for "citizen participation in the management of local affairs" is proceeding satisfactorily. In that governorate, 17 projects have been targeted. They are concerned with the repair and embellishment of green spaces and playgrounds. The total subsidy granted is on the order of DA47,888,730 and covers seven agreements signed with neighborhood committees. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Principal Neighborhood Committees in Algiers | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Neighborhood Committee |Address | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Casbah |11 rue Med Haddad, Bab El Oued | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |El Moustakbel |6 rue Staoueli, La Casbah | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |El Khettabi (formerly Pasteur) |1 rue El Khettabi, Algiers | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lafarge |Rue Amoura Abdelkader, H.

The population represented totals 252,100. Here are some figures for a number of other governorates: Bejaia: 126 neighborhood committees approved Jijel: 170 rural committees approved Blida: 65 neighborhood centers approved Bouira: 417 neighborhood committees approved Tizi-Ouzou: 436 neighborhood committees approved Setif: 237 neighborhood committees approved Chlef: 127 rural centers approved Tlemcen: 339 rural committees approved Constantine: 222 neighborhood committees approved Medea: 480 neighborhood committees approved The reluctance and distrust being displayed here and there by certain fringes of the population in response to this operation are due to a misunderstanding of the nature of the operation's objectives. In addition, there is reason to point out that in certain conservative regions--especially in the rural areas--disinformation is being spread with such intensity that the operation is perceived as being a new form of social organization dictated by the government to replace existing customs and traditions. That interpretation has caused considerable reluctance among many citizens in those regions. Apart from the security aspect and the constraints of a methodological or bureaucratic nature, the impact of the operation remains considerable. An explanatory guide will be issued in the near future as appropriate. Later, the neighborhood committees will be converted into local advisory councils.
