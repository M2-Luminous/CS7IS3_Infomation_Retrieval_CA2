The last of these exposed lies is the claim about the arrest of five Iraqi pilots who, in fact, are teachers of fine arts and physical education. Iraqi and Yemeni departments have documents proving they are nothing more than teachers. It is clear from the course of events that this absurd claim coincided with the successive defeats of the separatists and the emergence of a suspect role spearheaded by Riyadh on behalf of Washington against the Arab nation and its legitimate advancement. This confirms the deep involvement of the separatist clique in the hostile plan of Washington and Zionism to undermine Arab will and the source of its strength. It also confirms the failure of the agent clique's suspect plot. If these are some of the reasons for the separatist clique's resort to the fabrication of lies against Iraq, the other reason is the clean Arab stand Iraq has adopted in support of legitimacy and the unity state, which is a result of the will of the Yemeni people and all their political parties, including that of the separatists themselves. Another reason is the mean and trivial attempt of the separatists to exploit the anomalous political attitude toward Iraq, due to the mean conspiratorial role played by the clique of Gulf rulers, the odious attempt on Yemeni legitimacy, and the attempt to carry out a reactionary movement embodied by the condemned secession. This imposed Gulf stand has been condemned by the unionists of southern Yemen, headed by Muhammad Basandwah. No sooner had the subject of Saudi military intervention been exposed, especially by the Yemeni legitimacy forces' seizure of 80 tanks, than the separatists made up the lie about the arrest of five Iraqis, and Saudi television showed pictures of these Iraqis. The Saudi regime and its overlords know better. These Iraqis are just teachers. This method of making false accusations and instigations, despite the aforementioned facts, confirms the miserable political and moral bankruptcy of the clique of separatists and those standing behind them. It also acquits Iraq of any charges.
