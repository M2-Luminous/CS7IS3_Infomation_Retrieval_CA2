In his personal view the air strikes which the NATO Council threatened Bosnian Serbs with unless they withdraw heavy artillery from surrounding Sarajevo are "unfair". "Personally I see it as a little unfair to say: Ground troops no but from the air yes. That seems too easy to me and I don't know if it is fair," Klaus said. Given the non-existence of a front and the unclear positions of the armies, the government considers external intervention could lead to "far greater massacres and catastrophes," Klaus said. On Wednesday [9 February] the NATO Council gave the Bosnian Serbs 10 days from February 10 to withdraw all heavy artillery including tanks and mortars to a distance of 20 km from the center of the besieged Bosnian city of Sarajevo and deliver them into the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops, NATO will conduct air strikes against their positions.
