Small industries develop the private sector, depend upon local resources, and do not require specialized skills. The revival in those industries satisfies the essential needs of society and provides it with job opportunities. There are successful examples of small industries in the advanced and developing countries; indeed, the prominent role of large-scale and giant industrial projects is the result of the development in production equipment produced by the contemporary scientific and technological revolution, and the accompanying evolution in industrial methods and management. None of this has affected the role played by small industries, which still help to achieve industrial development in particular, and comprehensive development in general, in most successful experiences in the world. The successful role of small industries in some industrially advanced countries such as Japan and Korea had a noteworthy effect on these countries' economic growth; in fact, attention to these industries was the engine of comprehensive development in the industrial sector. Small Industries and Technological Development There are three major dimensions affecting the technological development of small industries: 1. Small industries and intermeshed sectors. The intermeshing of sectors in industry is achieved by "reciprocal credit" relations between large and small industries at the technological and technical aspect, this is, the main level, including integration relations, most importantly subcontracting. 2. Small industries and the question of industrial and technological penetration, production equipment, which allow small- and medium-sized industries to take part in achieving this mission by the manufacture of electrical tools and appliances in general, and machine tool industries. 3. Small technological industries suitable for self-sufficient development. Small industries can be incorporated into them through integrated science and technology courses starting with technological research and development (R&D), including the primary and secondary industrial and engineering planning process, and ending with the manufacture of technological goods. The course would focus on innovation, adaption, and development. This can be illustrated by three basic concepts: Subcontracting. Machine Tool Industries. The role of research, planning, and manufacturing. Subcontracting Subcontracting consists of one company seeking out another to produce, at its expense, certain parts or components, or to do assembly or partial assembly of some of these parts and components, with the aim of incorporating them into a given product to be sold by the primary contractor. This usually occurs between large installations on one hand and small ones on the other. This provides a high degree of specialization, based on cooperation in production and investment decisions. From this relationship, the parent installation can exercise a large amount of control over its contractors through technical, financial, marketing, and other links. There are four types of subcontracting: 1. Contracting for the manufacture of components, with the parent company concentrating on specializing in a limited number of phases to produce a certain final product, technology-intensive, with assembly, marketing, and after-sale services, on research and development. This type of operating industry is for minerals, equipment, and appliances. 2. Subcontracting for certain productive activities and operations in their entirety. This occurs, for example, in the cotton textiles industry, where large plants do the spinning, with other plants paid to do the weaving; the textiles then go to a specialized plant for printing the fabric. 3. Subcontracting for assembly operations, with small and family projects taking on the assembly of a final product in a labor-intensive and skill-intensive way. Examples would be the electronics industry, with large plants specializing in the production of high-technology components and intensive scientific research, such as microchips and transistors, with small plants assembling the final product. 4. Product subcontracting, with the subcontractor manufacturing the entire product, with the role of the parent company confined to marketing. This is closer to commercial contracting, prevalent in many industries such as the ready-to-wear apparel, shoes and leather goods, small motors, and some electrical appliances. It is clear from these systems that there is a principal base it rests on, which is the division of industrial labor, with small plants specializing in cheap labor-intensive activities and products, while large plants provide the small ones with information, technical assistance, and technological know-how, in addition to financial, administrative, and marketing facilities. Thus it is possible to link reciprocally industries of diverse scale to participate in achieving a high degree of integration, particularly through the technological and production ties reflected by technical operations. Merits of the System 1. The supply of the goods necessary to complete a productive and technological course by providing production elements, with the aim of producing an unfinished or final product, or assembling it, with marketing opportunities, after the provision of a funding opportunity and planning requirements, and perhaps spare parts and applicances. 2. Raising the living standard by: a. Providing additional job opportunities b. Helping to improve competence at the economic level. c. Producing lower-priced basic commodities. d. Generating extra income. Small Industries in Japan The Japanese experience with small industries has had a crucial role in Japanese industrial development. Large plants had an effect on small industries, providing them with technological know-how, and the needed administrative and material assistance. Hence opportunities to adhere to high technological standards, quality control, and the assimilation of primary technology transfer specifically in providing research facilities, and the supplies and equipments themselves, the reception of trained people, and sending out of the technological leaders of the small projects. After the major justifications for subcontracts had revolved around the benefits of low wages and production costs, these justifications have receded and been replaced by purely technical justifications: the benefit from specialized equipment and skills of subcontractors, and covering the gap in parent companies' productive capacities. This has led to the technological development of small industries to decrease costs and the improvement of practical management methods such as quality control and stock regulation. In Japan, subcontracting has spread to the point where two thirds of small- and medium-sized plants in conversion industries consist of plants subcontracted by larger plants. The total number of plants is estimated at 46,500, with 80 percent of them in the ready-to-wear apparel and textile and tool industry, with 49 percent of these subcontract plants using mechatronic devices, and 36 using computers, and 15 percent using robots. Small industries have expanded in India, and strengthened their links with large industries. India has made a great effort towards an integrated policy to achieve this, with tax exemptions for small projects and expanded credit with low interest. The specific types of products are limited to small projects and the encouragement of "positive buying" of tools and equipment, help with raw materials, the offer of special sites in industrial zones, and various administrative and consulting aids; all this led to an increase in small industries. Therefore the number of small projects rose from 60,000 in 1950 to more than 1 million in 1983. The productivity of these factories rose by five times between 1973 and 1983, the workforce doubled, and exports rose six times. International Subcontracting International subcontracting means an agreement between plants located in the advanced, industrialized world, which are the primary contractors, and plants located in the Third World, which are the subcontracted firms, for the latter plants to perform certain operations or activities for the first plant, whether by manufacturing certain components or parts, assembling a finished product, or producing a whole product with the objective of marketing it in the parent company's country. The reason for the spread of international subcontracting is the benefit of the cost differential between the advanced industrialized countries and the countries of the Third World; in other words, benefit from cheap labor for the production of "commodity items" for specialized consumption, usually in the industrial world. This process relies upon an unequal formula for the division of global industrial labor, with the plants of the advanced capitalist world specializing in the more technologically advanced industries and operations, with the transferring out of the less advanced industries and operations--the labor-intensive and energy-intensive ones. The United States uses this method, and is followed by the countries of Western Europe and Japan. Thus these three have developed export-directed activities in some Third World countries: starting with electronics (such as communications, radio tubes, and controlling devices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Mexico, as well as the manufacture of automobile components in Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, Thailand, and India). In summation, this part of international subcontracting leads to an increased dependency on foreign countries, technologically, financially, and commercially, with the accompanying weakening of the ties between local economic sectors. Machine Tools This is based on tools or capital goods, chiefly electrical and non-electrical tools. Machine tools fall into the subsector of non-electrical tools, chiefly tools producing chemical goods, machine tools, wood manufacturing tools, foodstuff preparation tools, agricultural tools and engines, and building and construction tools. The major industries necessary for these are the iron and steel industry and the engineering industries, including electrical and non-electrical tools. And so subcontracting has spread in this industry, with the machine tool industry divided into two broad sections, one of which is metal parts tools and the other being metal shaping tools. Parts tools accounted for 75 percent of global production of machine tools, and according to the nature of the use, there are multi-use tools, multi-purpose tools, universal machines, and special-purpose machines. It is clear that the first is used in several industries such as delivery equipment, heating and cooling equipment, and others, while the second in basic, agricultural industries. For example, if we wished to produce a certain tool or device, we must manufacture parts by thermal treatment of iron, steel, and other materials. The assembly of these parts follows. After the manufacture of the parts by machine tools, the most important parts of the manufacturing process, both in terms of manufacturing steps or the workshop, forms the basis of a mechanized society. No manufactured commodity comes out of the foundry, turning, screening, metal working, and surface stamping and coating processes. If you have mastered industrial operations, you are able to produce whatever commodity you want. Research, Planning, and Industrialization Units This is the third axis of development and the technological development of small industries. The core of manufacturing is industrial operations, and the heart of industrial operations is the building of production equipment, or the making of capital goods or equipment. The joint equipment components are: motors, generators, energy, control and measuring devices, metal and non-metal frameworks. To do this, one must have a prior concept of each one, as an integrated system, an automated system, capable of being assimilated into the major system, which is the production line in the factory. Is it feasible to manufacture without planning? Is manufacturing activity possible without know-how? And so planning is essential to conduct scientific research, whether basic or applicative. The Importance of Small Industries to the Kingdom This part of the study explains the role that small industries play in the Kingdom, and which we summarize in the following points: 1. The Saudi private sector enjoys great financial resources, exceeding current investment opportunities. The funds are seeking new investment opportunities both at home and abroad. Small industries represent an investment alternative for the absorption of these funds, and can also provide job opportunities for job seekers, especially for local technicians who have sufficient experience in the field of traditional and artisan industries which usually require semi-skilled workers, such as the cloak, veil, and carpet industry. In addition, the use of private funds toward the establishment of small industries provides job opportunities for seekers of employment independence, representing gradual progress toward industrialization for the Kingdom. 2. Subcontracting is a widespread arrangement in the Kingdom, and, as is well-known, subcontracting happens when a plant moves to support production or manufacture specific other parts, and the plant uses them to produce a commodity and sell it. It is widespread in the Kingdom; one of the most important characteristics is the achievement of the best use of capital and labor, by benefitting from foreign economies of scale. After the establishment of small industries, the helper role of the large industries are of the greatest importance to the Kingdom, especially in the case of foreign investments. The lack of a sector of auxiliary industries--in this case--leads foreign investors to bring in contractors from abroad, and this trend could weaken the integration among the various productive sectors and lead to an increase in foreign workers. This outcome is not in line with the Kingdom's development plans, whose purpose is to boost the rate of "Saudization" and transfer technology; the competitive capability of large industries' products depends upon the sector being supplied with parts in the needed variety and quality, produced by the small industries. In the Kingdom, one may be acquainted with three cases, in which the small industries--through subcontracting--to play an auxiliary and integrative role for the large industries. The first case: when the large industries face a lack of specialized skills or abilities domestically for the production of specific parts. Of course it will seek the help of small industries in producing some of the parts. The second case: a large organization may have the necessary ability and skills to produce the needed parts. But this--because of the wide disparity and and required quantity--makes the production of them in-house "through the organization" an economically unfeasible process, leading to the use of small industries to perform the task. The third case: the large industry may have a shortfall in productive capacity as the result of an unexpected rise in demand for its products. It will turn to small industries to help meet the increased demand. 3. With the constant growth the Saudi economy has achieved, which has led to a marked increase in individual income, we find there is a change in the type of consumption among individuals in society, towards products which have financial quality. This change, of course, provided new investment opportunities that small industries can exploit. It is not difficult to define or identify a number of consumer goods that small industries can manufacture and achieve an economic benefit, "reduced cost." 4. The small industries can set up in rural areas, where there are raw materials, especially agricultural ones, such as: the growing and packaging of dates, and storing vegetables. What encourages this is the fact that the small industry profits do not depend upon long-term production, meaning that they can produce some seasonal commodities for local sale. 5. Small industries in the Kingdom play a significant role in procuring and adapting to technology in some specialized fields. So international companies might be more prepared to transfer technology to small-scale industrial companies, which do not threaten their stake in regional markets, as would be the case with large industries. The best example of this is what is occurring in the electronics industries and personal accounts, and the medical instruments industry. 6. There are a number of traditional and artisan industries which are still widespread in the Kingdom, such as the manufacture of cloaks, veils, and ceramics, whose production requires uncomplicated methods which, to a large extent, suit the capabilities and capacities of small sectors. Thus the best way of preserving these industries is to see that small industries produce them. 7. Small industries, because of the small scale of investment in them, may be owned by family members or local individuals, as it preserves the extended family system, which is one of the good traits of Saudi society, and becomes more important when we realize that social values and cultural traditions are priceless. They are a trait of personality, or national identity. 8. Self-sufficiency in some commodities is still low, despite the availability of production elements for most of these commodities, thus providing investment opportunities for small industries. 9. The performance level of the free economies influence, to a large degree, global economic changes, and possibly small industries--through the flexibility they enjoy--can resist the fluctuations in economic conditions, adapting better to market conditions, compared to large industries, with the expansion of the small industry base in the Kingdom. This can gain the Saudi economy the ability to withstand global economic upsets. The Problems of Small Industries Despite the economic distinctions and characteristics and the role played by small industries in the economy of any country, the severity and effect of these problems are greater and harsher for small industries, compared to large ones. These problems might result from the nature of small industries themselves, or of the general environment in which the small industries function. A glance at the small industries in the Kingdom permits us to learn some of the most important problems they face. We must note here that these problems are the outcome of some field studies, the practical experiences of some businessmen and personal interviews conducted by researchers with some businessmen and chamber of commerce and industry officials. Some of the major problems are: 1. The management of some small industries is centered in one person, the "owner-manager." He is responsible for management and production, marketing and funding. While this person may be qualified and brilliant in a position and branches of management, he is usually lacking the technical skills for other management positions, making his decisions prone to error at times. These problems are not limited to the Kingdom alone; many countries share them. 2. There are no defined programs for the development of the small industries, but there are some efforts in the Kingdom to seek to develop small industries and give them attention. These efforts are exemplified in the Ministry of Industry's policy of gathering small industries, by encouraging chambers of commerce to prepare a program explaining the benefits from which small industries may benefit, and the areas that are relevant, instead of explaining the ways in which this industry must act; in addition to that, many conferences have been held to explain the role of the industries and small plants in development, and the problems they face, without these actions leading to the enactment of a specific program with goals and a method. 3. The policy of investment in the private sector--regulated by the Investment Encouragement Statute of 1406H [Hijra] [1986]--makes no distinction between small and large industries, but is based on the offering of customs exemptions and financial concessions for all industrial sectors, regardless of the size of the industry. The result of this situation is that the statute to encourage investment helps to draw investments into large rather than small industries. 4. There is insufficient protection for the products of small "infant industries." This is due to the current Saudi ecnomic philosophy of free competition, though the policy does not necessarily negate the enactment of an appropriate level of temporary protection for these industries by directing aid along the lines of countries with free economies, such as the United States, or Britain, which has specific programs aimed at developing small industries. 5. Despite the fact that funding may not be a large obstacle for Saudi investors in the industrial sector, the method for obtaining it is surrounded by obstacles. The Industrial Development Fund, for example, is a major source of funding for the industrial sector. Some studies have shown that the Fund's measures and the steady drop in loans offered was often forced by the facilities various industries can obtain. In light of small industries' limited financial capability, and the guarantees they must provide, these industries are more affected. In addition to that, the small industries have less ability to wait very long to obtain lesser funding, compared to large industries in 1409H [1989]. Turning to commercial banks, their funding is usually limited to short-term funding--"working capital." This bars small industries from the funding they need for long-term investment. In addition, the guarantees that commercial banks demand might exceed the small industry's capabilities. And in addition to that, commercial banks' interest rates may be high on one hand, and, on the other, could cause small industry owners to hold off from dealing with them for religious reasons. 6. Most small industries tend to be traditional in founding their establishments, with diversification, and this could lead to a focus on some areas rather than others, and without taking into consideration the absorptive energy of the local and regional market. This is the result of the absence of defined industrial priorities in conformity with the industrialization process, and of the newness of industrialization in Saudi Arabia. Example: shops for metalsmithing, carpentry, measurement, and decor. 7. Small industries lack a specialized national workforce in development, innovation, and upgrading. If it existed, owners of small industries would be slow to hire for several reasons, chiefly the fact that the financial costs might not be in line with scale of the plant. (1410H [1990]) 8. The weak links between the various industries, due to the trend, common until recently, of covering the consumer market with finished products. This costs the small industries investment opportunities linked to production and manufacturing to meet the needs of the industrial market, especially in areas where primary and intermediate materials are available--the petrochemical industry, for example. 9. Many small industries function independently in production, instead of integrating with large industries. This situation could lead to their not benefitting from those industries' available raw materials, failure to exploit their whole productive capacity, the danger of new brands coming in, increases in marketing and transport costs, and failure to benefit from the expertise and abilities of large firms. This situation could harm small industries by exposing them to unequal competition, in terms of size. (1411H [1991]) 10. Some have started to plan for small industries, on the basis of using low-cost non-Saudi workers. This has resulted in the majority of small industry employeess being foreign, which is not in conformity with the goals of Saudization development plans. Summary The experience of developing and industrial countries confirms the effective role played by small industries in this field. The prominent role of large-scale or giant industrial projects is the result of the development in production equipment produced by the contemporary scientific and technological revolution, and the accompanying matching evolution in industrial methods and management. None of this has affected the role played by small industries, which still help to achieve industrial development in particular and comprehensive development in general in most successful experiences in the world. Small industries have kept their clear and bright role in the experience of some advanced industrial countries such as Japan and Korea. Attention to small industry is the core of comprehensive development in the industrial sector, and attention begins with a practical tendency with all support and protection given to the parts and components industry, as these are the manufacturing activities which naturally lend themselves to the scale of small industries.
