However, the former dean of the Komensky University Law School and later minister of foreign affairs in Meciar's government is a level-headed person and untruths, as is evident, do not upset him. [Rajecky] Mr. Prime Minister, although only a few weeks have gone by since you assumed your position as prime minister, can you tell us how you would evaluate the activity of the present government thus far, and what are, in your opinion, its greatest difficulties? [Moravcik] Little more than one month is really a very short time to evaluate successes and failures. However, we created such conditions that will enable us to be successful and realize our announced governmental program. As an example, I could mention our successful negotiations with the IMF. A very favorable international climate has been created which the Slovak government could utilize for Slovakia's benefit. We are pleased that it is clear from the reaction of many citizens that at last a calm atmosphere reigns in our country. And what things did not work out? First of all, so far we have not succeeded in coming to an agreement on the funding of social programs. We are now looking for ways to make a correction in the budget, so that we do not keep increasing the deficit, but at the same time can free up a sufficient amount of money that would enable us to save primarily health care and education from collapse. [Rajecky] The opposition accuses you, among other things, that by giving too many concessions to the Czech partner you are ruining everything that the previous government fought for and gained for Slovakia. According to some, it is even quite possible that you are endeavoring to restore the federation.... [Moravcik] That is a very fallacious view on the part of the opposition. As far as relations with the Czech Republic are concerned, we have ideas on many issues about possible compromises that could give the impression that we are too accommodating. But matters must be judged from the viewpoint of their long-term impact and final results. Therefore, in this respect I consider the course of action the present government has taken prudent, consistently ensuring the realization of our goals. And as to the notion that we are endeavoring to establish a new federation--I believe that neither side takes the renewal of the federation into consideration. The creation of some kind of union would not bring the desired results either. But I would like to emphasize that I consider that idea an historically wasted opportunity. When the state was being split up, we could have, in my opinion, created a union and the disintegration of the federation did not have to happen. [Rajecky] At present there is quite a lot of talk about the unresolved questions of the borders, division of former federal property, gold, and, most recently, certificates. Don't you think that some decisions of the Slovak Government, for example, precisely about certificates, could have an adverse effect on mutual relations? [Moravcik] All the difficulties you mentioned have their specific, individual character. We could divide them into two groups--problems which remain from the time of the federation, and those which concern our future relations. I do not think that it is necessary to give a lot of attention to the first group. The second group is of more importance to us, especially as far as the certificates and the customs union are concerned, where, by the way, very close connections exist, because that cooperation also has its political aspects, even though the economic ones are dominant. What is important is that both sides have a political interest in maintaining mutual cooperation and mutual linkages minimally at the present level. But I do not rule out the possibility that we could have a situation where one side comes to the conclusion that cooperation in its present form is not to its advantage. Then we would have to look for other solutions. But I would not consider it a tragedy in any case, and for less a possibility that it would lead to a worsening of our mutual relations. [Rajecky] There is a lot of work to do, and you do not have much time in which to realize your goals. Nevertheless--are you not planning a meeting with your Czech counterpart, Vaclav Klaus, in the near future? [Moravcik] It is incumbent on politicians to meet with their foreign partners whenever it is useful. But I have to say that a meeting with Prime Minister Klaus is not being planned for the immediate future. [Rajecky] You are said to be a reasonable, thoughtful, and hard-working person. Are you not upset, therefore, by some of the accusations leveled at you, for example, that while prime minister you became chairman of a new political party, which broke the coalition agreements, as the chairman of the Party of Democratic Left [SDL], Peter Weiss, asserted? [Moravcik] If criticism is based on truthful arguments, it cannot upset me. But I admit that not even unsubstantiated criticism upsets me, although in Slovakia there is more of it than of the justified kind. It demonstrates the fact that political culture here is not always of the optimal level. As far as my chairmanship of the Slovak Democratic Union [DEUS] is concerned, Petr Weiss and I have already cleared the entire matter up between us. He appreciated the fact that it says in our bylaws that if the chairman of DEUS is named to a government position his function is perfomed by a statutory deputy. [Rajecky] The opposition also criticizes you for the fact that although the main task of your government was to lead the country to early parliamentary elections, your plans extend well beyond the pre-election period. Do you expect, then, that your government will be here even after the fall elections? [Moravcik] The measures that are adopted always must be of a long-term character. After all, not even laws are passed for just six months, but for four years, even decades. From this viewpoint, it would be very wrong if we were to concentrate only on the period before the early elections. And as to the duration of our mandate? That, after all, will not be decided by the opposition. We have a constitutional mandate and responsibility for executive power. We are not responsible to the opposition but to all the citizens of Slovakia. [Rajecky] Let's go back to the international issues. There has been a lot of talk lately about the possibility that you will meet with the Hungarian prime minister, but you are said to have laid down conditions that are unacceptable to the Hungarians. At the same time, the solution of the "Hungarian" issue is vitally important for SR.... [Moravcik] ...both sides insist that they are ready to talk, but so far a meeting has not taken place. But the truth is that only an unofficial meeting is under consideration, because official contacts should always produce some concrete result, some concrete document. I admit--such is not ready. But in any case, even an unofficial meeting has its value, because at the very least it provides opportunity for an exchange views and mutual consultations. At this time we are interested in an informal meeting with the Hungarian side. [Rajecky] Isn't it something of a speculation on your part, that since there will be elections in Hungary before long, you would rather wait to negotiate with the new government? [Moravcik] No, there is no speculation on our part. When it comes to the solving of serious problems, the question of elections really stays in the background. Hungary and Slovakia have formulated the basic features of their foreign policy concepts, and those do not change. [Rajecky] In conclusion a question concerning your deputy prime minister and party colleague, Roman Kovac. The opposition, specifically the HZDS deputies' club in the SR National Council, demands his removal. What do you think about the reasons they give? [Moravcik] They do not have concrete arguments, they use only general accusations. As I know the authors of these slanders, they are capable of making up most anything."
