This information, however, is a bombshell. The dateline on the item is Cabaiguan, Sancti Spiritus Province, and in its first paragraph, the leader as we reporters say, informs that the Sergio Soto Refinery has produced, for the first time, oil for electric transformers. This oil is used within the transformers, vital electrical equipment used for transmitting and distributing electricity. This is an extraordinary accomplishment, not because it is a first, but because it is an expensive resource that Cuba has been forced to import. Cuba has had to and has to import it because without transformers there is no electric energy going anywhere. Therefore when the production of this oil increases and stabilizes we will be freed from a heavy burden. Reporter Juan Antonio Boreu's news item was very extensive. I believe it is loaded with new and good things, in a little over a column. We turn each line written into a good commentary. The reporter from Cabaiguan informs that this small refinery, founded before the triumph of the Revolution, where gasoline was produced and marketed under the name of (Reca), now produces the I-12 oil, oil used in the production of industrial oils; (Termosic) oil, a special oil used by industrial plants; (Fibrasin) oil, used in the production of rope; and the (Sigrafic) solvent used in the cleanup of printing equipment. All these products are very expensive in terms of hard currency. Their production in Cabaiguan is an important event. The report points out that at the refinery's basic oils plant, the only one of its kind in Cuba, cooling oils are produced from water used in cleaning. This product, of fundamental importance, is used in tooling equipment. The Sergio Soto Refinery has also achieved the neutralization of its highly corrosive and polluting level of residual discharges. The refinery converted the discharges into another energy resource which fuels the nearby Siboney Cement Factory. What more can be said, things speak for themselves. We see here several things, the first of which is the skill and determination of the refinery's technicians and workers, which should be praised. There is something here that I have not mentioned but which is essential: If the special basic oils produced by the refinery were to be imported, as we have done before, they would be very expensive, if available on the market at all. These oils are produced here thanks to the petroleum obtained from Ciego de Avila's Pina oil deposit, of excellent quality. This new oil field, discovered two years ago, has not been characterized by huge production but by the low density of its crude oil, which makes it ideal for the production of these lubricants. I believe I have been unsuccessful in my attempt to not add words to this information sent from Cabaiguan, yet it was not bad to repeat it, especially because it was good news. Not because it was well written but because it contains elements that denote the struggle of our people to move forward in the midst of the special period.
