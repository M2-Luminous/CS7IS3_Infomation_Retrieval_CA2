Owing to this serious irregularity, which has prevented medications from being purchased, there are currently more than 250 cases of cholera, 200 cases of malaria, and 75 cases of yellow fever, and more than 15,000 natives have been struck by tuberculosis in Shipibo communities in this region. One-thousand five-hundred of the victims died from January to October of this year owing to the lack of medications and specialized medical care. A delegation from the Association for the Development of the Shipibo-Conivo Culture, headed by coordinator Andres Castaneda Saavedra, arrived in the capital to explain this tragic situation to government officials. The coordinator told LA REPUBLICA that about 35,000 members of this ethnic group in 108 native communities have suffered losses because of the flooding of the Ucayali River, aside from the diseases that the flooding has caused. The flooding started in January of this year and resumed in recent months, burying huge fields of rice, yucca, corn, and beans in the Ucayali Valley under more than two meters of water. The local communities consume these crops themselves. All of the crops were lost, and since other food was not forthcoming from elsewhere in the country, owing to the lack of roads and vehicles, hunger began to decimate the population, causing the more than 15,000 cases of tuberculosis. The huge swamps and pools of stagnant water became breeding grounds for cholera, malaria, and yellow fever, which spread rapidly, especially among children and the elderly. The chiefs of the native communities worriedly gathered together early in the year and asked the Health Ministry directly to declare a state of emergency in the Ucayali region. The ministry did not declare a health emergency in the region until this past October and on the seventh of the month approved 73,363 new soles in funds to combat these epidemics in Ucayali. The money was sent to the director of the Ucayali Health Region, Dr. Antonio Mundine Medrano, who was supposed to purchase medications and see to it that patients were treated immediately. Nevertheless, the incidence of cholera, malaria, and yellow fever remained unchanged, and patients seemed to be receiving no treatment whatsoever. The Shipibo culture association contacted the chiefs of the various native communities to check whether medicine had been received or medical care delivered. All said that they had received no medications or visits from physicians, and the hovels that function as medical posts have lacked basic items for medical care since last year. According to Castaneda Saavedra, Dr. Mundine Medrano has not accounted for the alleged aid shipment to the communities that requested it, contending only that the aid has already been distributed and that if it did not reach certain communities, it did reach others, which he did not specify.
