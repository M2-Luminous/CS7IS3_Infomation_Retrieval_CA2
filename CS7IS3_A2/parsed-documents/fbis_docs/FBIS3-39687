After the FDP Presidium's weekly meeting on Monday [21 February], FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel only said that the FDP will announce "where we will go" at an "appropriate time" before the elections. He left it open whether this is to be done at the federal party congress in September. The Presidium decided on Monday to move the date of the congress, which was originally planned for 17-18 September in Berlin, to 3-4 September in Nuremberg in order to gain more time before the Bundestag elections. The liberals want to make an election appeal in Nuremberg. The election program is to be adopted at a preceding federal party congress in Rostock on 3-5 June.
