FR941220-0-00070 FR941220-0-00012 The amendments adopted today were proposed by the Commission on April 19, 1994. 23 Comment letters received from registrants, accounting firms, and related professional membership associations generally supported the proposals and frequently commented that the schedules were generally redundant to information already required in the financial statements and that the costs of preparing the schedules therefore outweighed the benefit. Comments by financial analysts were critical of the proposed amendments, expressing a general concern about a perceived relaxation of disclosure requirements. 24 The Commission believes concerns regarding the revised requirements do not consider fully the offsetting effects of other disclosure requirements that must be met by reporting companies. The amendments are being adopted substantially as proposed because the Commission believes they will result in reduced costs of registration and reporting by public companies without loss of material basic disclosure for the protection of investors. 23 See Securities Act Release No. 7055 (April 19, 1994) (59 FR 21814) (the ``Proposing Release''). 24 Forty-one comment letters on the Proposing Release were received. Those letters and a summary of comments are available for public inspection and copying in File No. S7&hyph;12&hyph;94 at the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC. II. Financial Statements of Significant Business Acquisitions and Equity Investees The changes to Regulation S&hyph;X and Form 20&hyph;F adopted today revise the tests of significance which determine whether financial statements of an equity investee must be provided, and modify the requirements for reconciliation to U.S. GAAP of the financial statements of the significant foreign business acquisitions and foreign investees of domestic registrants. A. Tests of Significance of Equity Investees Separate audited financial statements of a company accounted for by the registrants using the equity method of accounting (an ``equity investee'') must be provided if the investee is ``significant'' as measured pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation S&hyph;X. The amendments adopted today eliminate one of the three tests of significance made pursuant to that rule. Pursuant to the adopted rule, significance of an investee is measured by comparison of the registrant's proportionate share of the investee's pretax income to that of the registrant and of the registrant's investment in the investee to the registrant's total assets. The determination of significance will no longer require comparison of the investee's total assets to the total assets of the registrant. While generally favored by commenters, several financial analysts observed that the two tests retained under the adopted rule may lead to the omission of financial statements of highly leveraged investees because the registrant's investment and proportion of earnings will be minimized as a result of the investee's debt. However, exclusion of separate audited financial statements appears reasonable given that the unfavorable financial impact of the investee is generally limited to the registrant's investment in that entity; losses in excess of that investment generally are not recognized under GAAP. To the extent that a registrant has guaranteed an investee's debt or is otherwise committed to fund its operations, the registrant must continue to recognize losses of the investee, 25 and such losses would continue to be considered in one prong of the two-pronged test for significance. If there are other material consequences of a registrant's investment in a highly leveraged investee, the Commission believes discussion of these will be elicited by Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K, ``Management's Discussion and Analysis.'' 26 In addition, summarized financial information, pursuant to Rule 4&hyph;08(g) of Regulation S&hyph;X, 27 that would be required to be provided in a note to the financial statements if the significance of the investees individually or in aggregate exceeds the 10% level under any of the three tests, would generally provide sufficient information in these or similar circumstances. 25 Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, ``The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.'' 26 17 CFR 229.303. 27 17 CFR 210.4&hyph;08(g). B. Reconciliation of Financial Statements of Significant Foreign Equity Investees and Foreign Acquirees The amendments adopted today permit domestic issuers to furnish financial statements of significant foreign business acquisitions and foreign equity investees on substantially the same basis as may foreign private issuers. That is, the financial statements of foreign acquirees, furnished pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;05 of Regulation S&hyph;X as amended, 28 or investees, furnished pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation S&hyph;X as amended, in periodic reports or registrations statements of domestic issuers need only comply with Item 17 of Form 20&hyph;F. Although some commenters questioned whether the cost of compliance with existing requirements justified the accommodation, most commenters cited the significant compliance costs incurred under the prior rule and strongly favored the proposal. 28 17 CFR 210.3&hyph;05. Pursuant to Item 17, the financial statements may be prepared on a comprehensive basis other than U.S. GAAP. Quantitative reconciliation of net income and material balance sheet items is required, but the additional information specified by U.S. GAAP for disclosure in notes to financial statements is not necessary. However, no reconciliation is required at all if the foreign business does not exceed the 30% level under the tests of significance which call for the inclusion of its financial statements of a significant business acquisition 29 or significant investee. 30 29 Consistent with the recently adopted amendments for foreign private issuers ( See Securities Act Release No. 7053 (April 19, 1994)), reconciliation to U.S. GAAP would continue to be required for pro forma financial information depicting the effects of a registrant's acquisition of a foreign business. 30 In circumstances where a registrant furnishes separate financial statements of an equity investee pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation S&hyph;X, the staff has not required the registrant to also furnish summarized financial data of the investee pursuant to Rule 4&hyph;08(g) of Regulation S&hyph;X. ( See Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 44, Topic 6:K (March 3, 1983) (47 FR 10789). However, consistent with the recently adopted amendments for foreign private issuers ( See Securities Act Release No. 7053 (April 19, 1994)), a domestic registrant that furnishes separate financial statements of a foreign investee that are not reconciled pursuant to the proposed rule should furnish the summarized financial data pursuant to Rule 4&hyph;08(g) in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its primary financial statements. The adopted rules are applicable to a foreign business, as defined. Several commenters recommended that the definition be identical to the definition of a foreign private issuer, but it is adopted as proposed. 31 The adopted definition of a foreign business varies from the definition of a foreign private issuer because the relief available under the rule is intended to be applicable to a branch or other component of an entity, rather than only to a legally recognized business entity. Also, the rule is not intended to be applicable to a business that is incorporated outside the U.S. but that is, prior to the registrant's investment, majority owned by one or more U.S. shareholders, because such an entity can be expected to maintain its books and records on a basis permitting reconciliation to U.S. GAAP without unreasonable cost. 32 31 If the acquired business or investee does not meet the definition of a foreign business, the issuer can file financial statements prepared in accordance with a basis of accounting other than US GAAP provided a reconciliation to US GAAP under Item 18 of Form 20&hyph;F is included regardless of the level of materiality. This is consistent with current staff practice. 32 Ownership is measured prior to the acquisition of the business.
