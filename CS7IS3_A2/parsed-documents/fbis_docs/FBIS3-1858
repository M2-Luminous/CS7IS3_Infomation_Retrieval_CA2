Information from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) showed that the retail sales of consumer goods last year was 1,223.7 billion yuan, up 26.1 percent (or a real growth of 11.6 percent if increase in price is excluded). Of this total, sales in urban markets were 717.6 billion yuan, up 31.2 percent, while sales in rural areas were 506.1 billion yuan, up 19.5 percent. Analyzing by categories of consumer goods, it was found that there were ups and downs among different food items. Among clothing items, the sales of cotton cloth remained unchanged from the previous year, the sales of garments went up 16.1 percent, while sales of woolen piecegoods and silk and satin textiles went down. Growth by various margins was scored in the sale of all durable consumer goods, except for electric fans, black-and-white TV sets and bicycles. The total purchase of means of production by materials supply and marketing departments at and above the county level was 742.3 billion yuan in 1993, up 34.6 percent, while their sales were 779.6 billion yuan, up 32.3 percent. However, the sales of means of agricultural production suffered a fall of 7.8 percent if change in price is excluded. In 1993, the government strengthened price reform through a series of policies, including freeing the producer's prices for most rolled steel products, cement and coal of state-owned coal mines, raising the prices of crude oil, electricity and railway freight transportation, and further freeing the purchasing and selling prices of grain. The SSB said that these policies played an important role in adjusting the relatively low prices of basic products and infrastructural facilities and in promoting the establishment of the market mechanism. However, the overall increase in market prices was rather high, particularly in large and medium cities, and the momentum of increase in the prices of services remained strong.
