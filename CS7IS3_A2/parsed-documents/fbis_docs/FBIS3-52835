Thousands of people are fleeing the capital, Kabul. The truce came into effect at 0600 today. The cease-fire appeal was made by Pakistan to evacuate diplomats, aid workers, and the wounded to safer places. Pakistan had urged the warring factions to start negotiations for resolving the present crisis. A convoy of about 70 vehicles carrying foreign nationals and diplomats has left Kabul. Thursday's bombardment has caused extensive damage in the center of the city. Markets and shops are ablaze and the streets are littered with debris. Pakistan has offered to use its good offices to end the fighting. According to informed sources, Iran, Turkey, Libya, and China have asked Pakistan to take the first step and try to convince the warring factions for a complete cease-fire. Iran and Saudi Arabia will later join these efforts to bring normalcy in the war-torn country.
