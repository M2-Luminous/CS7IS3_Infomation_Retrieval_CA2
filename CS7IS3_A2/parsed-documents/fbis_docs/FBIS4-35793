France is a mortal enemy to the African peoples. It is the power that colonized and destroyed it, exploited its wealth, and despised its people. It is still spreading its domination over Africa by military force, and has not recognized the independence of the African states, including Chad. It considers them its colonies and works toward creating an international status before the United States and in Europe via its domination of the African continent. It has created for that purpose the traditional annual Francophone summit. This imperialist policy is exposed and condemned by the African peoples. What justification does France have to keep its forces in Chad after the end of the border dispute between Libya and Chad? It used to claim that there was an occupied Chadian territory and that there was a border dispute to keep its military forces to defend Chad. What will France say after this dispute comes to an end? How will it justify its presence in Chad after today? Certainly, there is no justification, except that it wants to occupy Chadian territory and wants Chad to remain its colony; otherwise it should go back to where it came from. [passage omitted]
