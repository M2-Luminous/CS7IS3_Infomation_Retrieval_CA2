I. Making and Issuing of Plans 1. All units, consonant with the development plan of their particular business, are to draw up long-term (three- or five-year) capital construction plans in accordance with the requirements issued by MOFERT, and to submit them to MOFERT in a timely manner. 2. All units, according to the needs of their business and the fulfillment of the capital construction budget for the year, are to complete and submit to MOFERT every August their plans for application for investment in capital construction for the coming year (together with the application form), along with the necessary explanatory notes (including reasons for the construction of major projects, equipment available, and location of construction; in cases of production projects, a description of raw materials and resources used and of the economic results following completion of the projects also is required). Should application plans of units located in Beijing include new projects to be constructed, these units at the same time are to complete and submit the relevant forms for building construction in Beijing. 3. All units, in accordance with the figures for controlling investment in capital construction for the year, as released by MOFERT, are to compile and submit to MOFERT their draft plans for annual investment in capital construction. 4. Following evaluation and adjustment for overall balance by MOFERT, the annual capital construction draft investment plans submitted by all units are to be issued as formal plans for implementation by the units. On receiving the plans, all units are to immediately assign construction units to study concrete measures for carrying them out, and should lose no time in acquiring the necessary land, doing the design work, preparing materials, and launching construction, so as to guarantee fulfillment of the plans. 5. National corporations with subsidiary companies are to be responsible for examining and summarizing the long-term plans, application plans, and draft plans of their subsidiaries, and for submitting them to MOFERT. II. Compilation, Submission, and Approval of Design Documents (I) Project Proposals and Design Reports 1. With regard to the construction of large- and medium-sized projects and of projects with investment limitations set by the state (cold storage warehouses having a capacity of more than 10,000 tons or projects involving a total investment of more than 30 million yuan) -- if they fall into the category of production projects -- all units, when making long-term plans, are to submit five copies of the project proposal to MOFERT and one copy to the State Planning Commission. After conducting a preliminary evaluation, MOFERT is to submit the proposal to the State Planning Commission for evaluation and approval. With regard to nonproduction projects, prior to submitting the application plans, all units are to forward design reports to MOFERT, which is to refer them to the State Planning Commission for evaluation and approval. Once project proposals or design reports have been approved by the State Planning Commission, the projects may be included in the annual capital construction and investment plans. 2. With regard to construction projects involving a total investment between 10 million and 30 million yuan, design reports are to be compiled and submitted to MOFERT -- together with the application plans -- for evaluation and approval. Once approved, such projects may be included in the annual plan. 3. With regard to projects involving a total investment between five million and 10 million yuan, the design report compiled by the units is to be approved first by the departments concerned and then submitted to MOFERT for the record. 4. With regard to projects involving an investment of five million yuan or less, a simple design report will suffice, and once approved by the departments concerned, may be kept in the files of the applicant units. 5. Project proposals and design reports should be simple and clear, and should include the following: name of the project, its content and scale, the basis and conditions for its construction (location, resources, water and electricity supplies, communications and transportation), pace of construction, source of investment, estimated amount of materials and equipment, construction site, land to be occupied by the project, and economic results. If necessary, a copy of the total layout plan of the construction site may be required. (II) Preliminary Expansion Designs and Engineering Budget Estimates 1. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget estimates are to be made by design departments in accordance with the project proposal or design report (mainly concerning construction scale and total investment) and submitted to MOFERT by the applicant units, either for evaluation and approval or for the record. 2. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget estimates of large- and medium-sized projects or projects involving investments exceeding state-set limitations are to be submitted to MOFERT by the applicant units for evaluation and approval conducted by MOFERT in conjunction with the departments concerned. 3. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget estimates for projects involving a total investment between 10 million and 30 million yuan are to be submitted by the applicant units for evaluation and approval by MOFERT. 4. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget estimates for projects involving a total investment between five mi@lion and 10 million yuan are to be examined by departments entrusted by the applicant units, then submitted to MOFERT for the record. 5. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget estimates for projects involving a total investment under five million yuan are to be examined by the applicant units, together with the departments concerned, and are to be kept in the files of the applicant units. 6. Once the preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget estimates have been evaluated and approved, they are to be the basis for controlling project investment and for drawing up construction budgets and engineering blueprints. (III) Construction Drawings and Budgets On completion of the construction drawings and the budget for a construction project, the construction unit will entrust the departments concerned with evaluating and approving them. III. Planned Management 1. Planned management of capital construction projects is to be strengthened. All capital construction projects are to be included in the plan, and no extra-plan projects are to be allowed. For projects financed by units themselves, there must be effectively guaranteed financing, obtained through the proper channels, before the projects can be included in the plan. 2. Once the annual investment plan for capital construction is finalized, no expansion of the scale or other alteration of the project is to be allowed. When changes are necessary, an application for approval of the changes must be submitted to the unit that approved the project. 3. Once the project proposal, design report, and preliminary design are approved, no changes are to be made without authorization. If changes are necessary in total investment, construction scale, construction site, or any single item of the project, an application for such changes must be submitted to the unit that approved the project. 4. Examination of the implementation of the plans must be strengthened. Questions that arise during the implementation of a plan must be dealt with in good time. If the plan cannot be fulfilled, or if an increase or an adjustment to the plan is necessary, a report must be submitted to MOFERT for examination and approval. IV. Construction Management and Acceptance of Work 1. Efforts must be made to improve construction management and increase return on investment. The policy of concentrating resources for completing projects must be adhered to. Projects should be listed according to conditions with regard to materials, equipment, investment, and work forces, and construction work carried out in different phases in line with the degree of their importance and urgency. During construction, attention must be paid to economic results. There must be specific rates of consumption, standards for expenses, and verification of cost accounting, so as to reduce construction costs. 2. The quality of projects must be guaranteed and quality control must be improved. On completion, a project must be checked and accepted according to the regulations, and reports of project completion and final accounts of expenditure must be made. At the same time, a list of property transfers must be compiled and should be supplemented with drawings indicating the completion of the project and with technical archives -- including records of concealed engineering works -- for safekeeping by construction units and for the convenience of later maintenance and expansion. 3. Large- and medium-sized projects, as well as other projects involving investment in excess of state-set limitations are to be checked and accepted by MOFERT, together with the departments concerned. Projects involving investment under 30 million yuan are to be checked and accepted by the departments concerned at the invitation of the applicant units, and when necessary, with the participation of MOFERT personnel. With regard to projects involving investment over 10 million yuan, the applicant units are to submit reports on completion of construction and final accounts of expenditure to MOFERT for the record. V. Tables of Capital Construction Statistics 1. In order to promptly make known the implementation of the capital construction plan and existing problems, all applicant units are to complete every month the "Monthly Table of Capital Construction Progress" and submit it to MOFERT no later than the 10th of the following month. 2. At the end of each year, all aplicant units are to complete the "Annual Table of Capital Construction Progress" (similar to the Monthly Table) and submit it to MOFERT before the end of January of the following year. 3. All monthly and annual tables of capital construction progress should be accompanied by notes explaining the reasons for rapid or slow progress, the existing problems, and measures to be taken. The tables should have accurate figures and be completed in full. 4. Controlling corporations with subsidiary companies are responsible for evaluating and checking the monthly and annual tables of their subsidiaries, and for submitting summary reports to MOFERT on schedule. VI. Capital Construction Finances 1. All units directly under MOFERT are to compile annual capital construction finance plans and submit them to MOFERT within the prescribed time, in accordance with the annual planned investment for capital construction prescribed by MOFERT and with the requirements and tables stipulated and described in the notice issued by MOFERT with regard to the compiling of annual capital construction finance plans. 2. Limitations are to be set for nonoperational investment included in the funds for invesstment. In accordance with the progress of the construction and actual need for funding, investment is to be allocated and made available by MOFERT to the units using the investment through the head office of the Construction Bank of China in accordance with the capital construction plans approved by the State Planning Commission and the finance plans compiled and submitted by various units, and within the prescribed limit of phased appropriation of funds approved by the head office of the Construction Bank of China. All units using such investment must open accounts at the head office of the Construction Bank of China, as required by the regulations. 3. In the case of construction projects financed by operational investment, construction units, on receiving capital construction plans issued by MOFERT, are to sign loan contracts at once with branches of the Construction Bank of China, which will serve as evidence for obtaining and repaying the loan. 4. In the case of construction projects financed by units themselves, construction units are to deposit at the Construction Bank of China the funds they have raised. They must observe the principle of "depositing the fund before obtaining approval, and obtaining approval before making use of the fund." The fund must be kept at the bank for no less than six months before it can be used under the supervision of the Construction Bank of China. 5. In the case of construction projects financed by loans from the Construction Bank of China -- and if they are projects with renewed loans -- construction units may go through loan procedures immediately with the local office of the Construction Bank of China, once the head office of the Construction Bank of China has notified its local offices of the loan plan. If they are new projects to be financed by bank loans, construction units are to cooperate with local bank branches to complete project evaluations and go through loan procedures after the head office of the Construction Bank of China has approved and issued the loan plans. Units using loans from other banks to finance their construction projects are to complete the procedures for obtaining and paying the loans in accordance with the regulations of the banks concerned. 6. The monthly capital construction finance reports are the main basis for appropriation by MOFERT, and all units are to submit them to MOFERT within eight days folloing the end of the month. (If there is not enough time to complete the paperwork, a report may be made by telegraph or telephone.) 7. The annual final accounts of capital construction expenditure are tables reflecting the entire economic performances of the construction units and departments. They are a summary of the implementation and execution of the annual capital construction and finance plans. All units are to compile the annual final accounts of capital construction expenditure in a timely and accurate manner and in accordance with the requirements and tables stipulated and prescribed by MOFERT and are to submit them to MOFERT for evaluation and approval. 8. Controlling corporations with subsidiary companies should appoint people to take special charge of evaluating and checking the financial plans, monthly financial reports, and annual final accounts of expenditure of their subsidiaries, and should submit summary reports to MOFERT. VII. Supplementary Regulations 1. Units directly under MOFERT may draw up implementation regulations in accordance with these "Procedures." 2. These "Procedures" go into effect on 1 January 1989.
