Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on the New Tasks of Russian Foreign Policy"] [Text] Russian diplomacy has entered the new year, 1994, with a wide agenda for both the immediate and medium term. The consistent orientation of our foreign policy toward the promotion of national interests through openness and cooperation with the outside world strengthens Russia's positions in the international arena and creates a favorable climate for internal development. At the same time the end of the Cold War certainly does not mean that international relations have become idyllic. The emerging multipolar world is in many ways more complex and unpredictable than the old bipolar world. Instead of two rival blocs there exist many "centers of influence" with different and sometimes competing interests. New threats to our interests are appearing, above all in connection with instability and armed conflict in the area of the former USSR. In these conditions we are faced with the task of energetically -- and where necessary, uncompromisingly -- defending and promoting our interests, while, of course, remaining within the bounds of international law and the search for a rational balance of interests. In order to carry out this policy we need a robust democratic state system. The new Russian Constitution creates the necessary prerequisites for this. Foreign policy remains in the president's hands, which rules out its invasion by manifestations of adventurism and self-interest. In the practical sphere we shall operate in the following main areas. In the past two years Russia has concluded dozens of bilateral treaties and agreements, joined the key international economic organizations, and acquired a whole series of partners in various regions of the world. Now these accords must be given substance. This is not a departmental, but a statewide task. In the sphere of national security our priorities will be, as before, to eliminate hotbeds of armed conflict along Russia's borders, to reinforce the arrangements relating to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the latest military technologies, and to increase the accountabilty and transparency of the international arms trade, while unconditionally safeguarding our commercial interests in this sphere. The START II treaty and the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons need to be brought into force. The former Supreme Soviet ducked out of ratifying these important disarmament treaties. I hope that the Federal Assembly will approach this question with more responsibility and with less prejudice, especially as it is a question of an important phase of the implementation of Russia's new military doctrine. The agreement between the Russian Federation, the United States, and Ukraine on the total elimination of strategic nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory signed in Moscow creates a favorable climate for the ratification of the START II treaty. We will concentrate our efforts on the all-around development of the CIS and its speedy transformation into a full-fledged regional organization with an increasing level of economic integration and political cooperation. The opportunities presented by the Russian chairmanship of the Commonwealth in the first half of this year will be actively exploited to achieve this task. The defense of the rights of the Russian-speaking population remains of paramount importance. In 1992-1993 the government was forced to spend 51.5 billion rubles on catering for refugees and persons forced to emigrate from regions of interethnic tension and conflict. Hence not only humanitarian principles, but also the country's pragmatic interests oblige us to ensure that UN and CSCE standards in the sphere of human and national minority rights are genuinely observed in the CIS and the Baltic region. It is important to speed up the "launch" of Commonwealth human rights protection mechanisms -- first and foremost a CIS Commission for Human Rights. Russia finds equally unacceptable both "neo-imperialist" and isolationist approaches to problems in the former USSR, where we find concentrated not only our vital interests but also the main sources of threats to these interests and, at the same time, great opportunities for cooperation. Russia objectively carries a special responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in this huge area. We will persistently seek to increase the CIS' peace-making potential and to further cooperation in strengthening its external borders. Special attention will be devoted to conflict regions and to Tajikistan, where dialogue between the government and the political opposition must finally get started. In the European sphere our central task is to participate in building a peaceful, democratic, united Europe. The main instrument in the political sphere is to be the CSCE, and in the military sphere, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC], which could act as the coordinator of the work of the regional organizations of NATO, the Western European Union, and the CIS in the sphere of maintaining peace and strengthening stability in Europe, increasing the openness of military activity, and carrying out conversion of the military-industrial complex. An important stage in the creation of a security system in Europe will be the forthcoming regular CSCE summit in Budapest this year. The "Partnership for Peace" concept adopted by NATO in Brussels was a major incentive to dialogue on these problems. Displaying a responsible approach, our partners did not succumb to the temptation of "quick-fix" solutions to security problems and did not opt for the extension of NATO membership to the East, which was fraught with the danger of provoking a new split in Europe. Instead of this, emphasis was placed on developing cooperation with all states on an equal basis. It is important now that we not only do not lag behind other countries, but move more quickly than they on the road of establishing genuine partnership, above all in the military area. Otherwise the isolation of Russia, which we managed to avoid on the political level, could occur on the practical level. At the same time Russian diplomacy is not limited to just the partnership for peace option. We are promoting wider and more far reaching initiatives for the formation of the new Europe, including the extension of the NACC to include the neutral states of Europe, and also in the area of offering Central European countries interlocking security guarantees from Russia and several of our West European partners. In the sphere of bilateral relations with the leading West European states we will continue top-level dialogue with the FRG, France, Britain, and Spain. We hope in the near future to complete talks with the European Union on an agreement on partnership and cooperation. Russia will continue to develop relations with the countries of Central and East Europe on a new basis. We start from the premise that the common interests of our countries as regards democratic reforms, transition to effective market economies, and the preservation of traditional ties between our peoples significantly outweigh old grievances and suspicions. In recent years the treaty-legal basis of our relations with the majority of Central and East European countries has been radically renewed. We expect to complete this process by drafting political treaties with Romania and Albania. Russia will continue to participate actively in the search for a settlement to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. To the extent that Federal Republic of Yugoslavia complies with UN demands, we will seek to have the sanctions against this country rescinded and to restore its status in the United Nations and other international organizations. The visits to Moscow of U.S. President B. Clinton and Vice President A. Gore consolidated the aim of moving toward mature partnership in Russian-U.S. relations. Now the task is to exploit to the full the newly opened opportunities for cooperation in the political, economic, scientific and technical, and other spheres. An important step toward lifting restrictions on our foreign economic relations will be the forthcoming abolition of COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] in spring 1994. The creation of new international arrangements for monitoring trading in arms and "dual" technologies presupposes the participation of Russia -- a major producer of arms and military "know-how." New steps will be made to bring Russia closer to the G-7. Following the Tokyo meeting between B.N. Yeltsin and the G-7 leaders our dialogue with the G-7 has acquired a regular, working character. A G-7 mission in Moscow has been set up, and our diplomats and financiers participate in meetings with its experts. At the forthcoming G-7 summit in Naples Russia intends to propose beginning the practical transformation of this formation into a G-8, starting with the political sphere. An important foreign policy task is the use in Russia's interests of its unique position as a Eurasian power. In recent years we have managed to a significant degree to pave the way to large-scale cooperation with leading Asian states -- India, China, Japan -- and also to begin developing relations with new partners (South Korea and the countries of ASEAN and the Persian Gulf). Now these new opportunites in the sphere of economic and scientific and technical cooperation must be exploited. The strategic guideline in the Asia-Pacific region is the effective incorporation of he regions of Siberia and the Far East in international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. The promotion of our interests in the southern direction is linked above all with ensuring stability there and removing hotbeds of tension. We will actively pursue the course of neutralizing threats to the security of Russia and the Commonwealth countries and opposing religious extremism and aggressive nationalism. Russia is deeply committed to the settlement of the Near East problem. Our efforts will center on continuing, in close collaboration with the United States, Russia's role as a cosponsor of the peace process and on helping to promote the realization of the aspirations of the Palestinian people. We will seek to develop broad economic cooperation with countries of the Arab world with the aim of involving their financial resources in the economic modernization of Russia and consolidating its positions on world markets, including the arms market. Our relations with the countries of Latin America, with many of whom we have interesting experience in the economic, technological, and other spheres, will be stepped up. Continuing our course toward developing cooperation with the countries of Africa, Russia will maintain its active involvement in the settlement processes under UN auspices in Somalia, Angola, and Mozambique. In the sphere of multilateral diplomacy we will energetically promote the strengthening of the United Nations. We will seek a model for reforming this organization -- including its Security Council -- which leads to the increase of the effectiveness of the United Nations as the leading institution of international cooperation. Our priorities are to involve the United Nations in actively supporting Russia's peace-making activity and protecting human and national minority rights, and also the rights of the victims of armed conflicts. The "domestic" agenda of Russian diplomats' work also promises to be extensive. One important avenue of this work is to offer support to Russian regions entering into direct international relations. In recent times, with Russia's active cooperation, a whole series of cooperation structures have been set up in the region of the Baltic, the Black Sea, and the Barents Sea/Euroarctic region. Now the most difficult task remains -- to ensure that the mechanisms of cooperation that have been set up genuinely start to work for the specific socioeconomic needs of wide areas of Russia. This has special significance for our Northwest region, which until recently was completely isolated from the outside world by a veil of secrecy. Now the state must repay its debt to the Russian North. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to continue to actively help Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Oblasts and Karelia to establish direct links with business partners in Scandinavia and West Europe. In implementing its foreign policy the Ministry of Foreign Affairs counts on constructive collaboration with the new Russian parliament. We expect the Federal Assembly to play an active part in the formation of a legislative basis for Russia's foreign policy activity.
