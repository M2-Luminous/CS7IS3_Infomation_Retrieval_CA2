The computer data base will hold intelligence on container cargoes, shipping and trading companies and smuggling trends. It will enable Customs officers to identify potential targets and alert search teams to be ready as ships dock. Due to begin within four years, the computer would link British ports including Southampton, Felixstowe, Liverpool and London with Rotterdam, Antwerp, Le Havre, Hamburg and Bremen. The link is an extension of an electronic mailing system with more than 200 terminals round Europe, and a container profile scheme being used in Britain and mainland Europe. The system is so successful that Dutch officials say they have a 50-75 per cent success rate with every container they search.
