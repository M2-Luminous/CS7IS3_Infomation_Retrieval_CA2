After reviewing the 1993 work done by the provincial higher people's court, he said: In 1993, under the leadership and supervision of the provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, and the Supreme People's Court, the people's courts at various levels across the province persisted in the guiding ideology of setting up the socialist market economic system; made achievements in safeguarding the national political and social stability, promoting a fast economic development, and promoting the struggle against corruption; comprehensively strengthened the judicial work; made efforts to upgrade the law enforcement level; and better accomplished the judicial work tasks assigned by the party and the state. Over the past year, the courts at various levels across the province accepted and handled 248,080 cases of various categories, an increase of 3 percent over the previous year; and concluded 227,265 cases of various categories according to the constitution and the law, accounting for 4.5 percent. Of this total, the courts concluded in first trials 21,102 criminal cases, accounting for 9.3 percent; 119,612 civil cases, accounting for 52.6 percent; 44,827 cases of economic disputes, accounting for 19.7 percent; and 41,724 cases of appealing to higher courts and presenting cases in courts as well as administrative and executive criminal cases, accounting for 18.4 percent. The courts comprehensively launched the judicial activities according to laws, dealt blows to various criminal activities, protected the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal persons, readjusted the economic relations, and played a positive role in safeguarding social stability and promoting the deep development of reform and the setup of the socialist market economic system. He reported, in detail, on the work in the following five aspects: 1. We Dealt Strict Blows to the Criminal Activities of Jeopardizing Social Order and Safeguarded the Stability of the State and Society [subhead] In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics and with the general goal of setting up the socialist market economic system as set forth by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, we unswervingly deepened reform, expanded the scale of opening up, and maintained political stability, economic development, national unity, and social progress. Like the whole country, our province's situation was good. However, many problems still existed. The criminal cases judged by the courts last year were shown as follows: First, the serious criminal cases accounted for a large proportion. Last year, the courts across the province accepted and handled 21,786 cases in first trials, a drop of 5.6 percent from the previous year and concluded 21,102 criminal cases in first trials, a drop of 5.3 percent. However, the extraordinarily serious criminal cases accounted for 42.2 percent of the total criminal cases. Second, the number of criminal gangs that brazenly looked down upon society increased. Last year, the courts across the province concluded 2,810 cases of crimes committed by gangs of criminals, accounting for 18.8 percent of the criminal cases that were concluded through first trials. In particular, some underworld criminal gangs appeared in succession and they brought about extremely serious damages to the social order. For instance, several cases committed by criminal gangs in Yixian County and the Xiuyan Man Nationality Autonomous County were tried. Third, the criminal cases of money embezzlement were comparatively concentrated. The theft, speculation, robbery, blackmailing, and economic criminal cases accounted for a considerably large proportion. Fourth, many all-round and serialized criminal cases took place. Some criminal offenders committed various kinds of crimes, such as looting, stealing, murdering, and kidnapping and blackmailing. Social order directly affects the overall situation of reform, opening up, and economic construction as well as the setup of the socialist market economic system. So, social order has constantly been a hot-debated issue that the masses of the people have generally paid attention to. Therefore, in conducting the judicial work, the courts at various levels persistently implemented the principle of rapid and strict punishment and prominently dealt blows to criminal activities. A total of 21,313 criminals that produced legal effect were judged during the year. Of this, 1,052 were sentenced to death, to death with stay of execution, or to life imprisonment. Some 59.1 percent of the criminals were sentenced to the imprisonment of five years or more. Four hundred and fifty large-scale public trials were held. This maintained the prestige and trend of the concentrative attacks. Launching a special struggle to improve public security in a specific area is a successful experience for solving regional public security problems. Our province has a vast territory with coastal development zones, large inland cities, oil fields, mining areas, and some economically underdeveloped rural areas. Different public security problems have occurred at different times and in different localities. Cases of committing a crime with a gun, kidnapping, blackmailing, robbing rental cars, killing taxi drivers, and hiring someone to kill somebody have mostly happened in big cities; criminal gangs with the nature of underworld society which dominated a certain area have mostly appeared in rural areas, county seats, and towns; and cases on theft of industrial raw materials and damage of power facilities have mostly appeared in oil fields and mining areas. Courts in various localities defined the tasks for this special struggle in line with local conditions and effectively resolved the prominent public security problems in their localities in a timely manner. The central authorities have clearly defined that in solving public security problems we must strengthen comprehensive public security management. During trials, courts at all levels persisted in implementing the comprehensive public security management system. First of all, they gave full play to their judicial functions and tried all kinds of cases in line with the law. They succeeded in maintaining social stability through trying criminal cases; properly handled the internal contradictions among the people and guarded against and reduced the number of crimes by trying civil, economic, and administrative cases; and eliminated destabilizing factors by doing a good job in handling lawsuits. Second, they appropriately extended judicial work. Through conducting open trials and trying and meting out punishment locally, courts at all levels succeeded in increasing the number of areas influenced by education on the legal system; strengthened the social effect of judicial work by establishing special collegiate benches for trying delinquents; strengthened the work of supervising and transforming criminals by visiting and investigating criminals who were placed under the control and temporary suspension of the execution of a sentence, or exempted from punishment; and resolved hosts of contradictions and disputes at the grass roots and eliminated crimes in the bud by intensifying the role of the people's courts. Third, they paid attention to expanding the social effect of judicial work. Last year courts at all levels printed over 100,000 copies of propaganda materials on typical cases and the legal system in the course of trials, gave 1,180 lectures on law and legal consulting services, promptly proposed 1,224 judicial suggestions for relevant departments, and publicized law through radio and television broadcast, press, and other media means, which were generally valued. 2. We Strictly Punished Criminal Activities Seriously Disrupting the Economy and Unceasingly Deepened Anticorruption Struggle Deeply conducting an anticorruption struggle and promoting administrative honesty is a major affair which the party and the country should grasp at present and in the future. In line with the central plan that noticeable results should be achieved in an anticorruption struggle within a certain period of time, courts at all levels further strengthened trial of serious economic cases. Judging from the economic criminal cases accepted by courts across the province last year, we noticed the following characteristics: First, the number of cases accepted declined during the year. Last year courts across the province accepted 1,528 economic criminal cases (excluding 103 old cases), showing a decline of 22 percent from the previous year's figure of 1,950 cases. Second, the number of this category of cases declined first and then increased again. During last year's first nine months, courts across the province accepted 972 economic criminal cases as against 1,505 cases accepted during the corresponding period of the previous year, showing a decline of 35.4 percent. During the year's third quarter, the central authorities proposed efforts be made to achieve noticeable expected progress in the anticorruption struggle. The number of cases accepted by courts began to rise again. During last year's fourth quarter, courts accepted 556 cases compared to 445 cases during the corresponding period of the previous year, showing an increase of 24.9 percent. Third, most of the cases concentrated on economic crimes. Of the total number of economic criminal cases accepted by the courts last year, 1,208 were cases of the four categories, namely, corruption, cheating, misappropriation of public funds, and bribe-taking, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of cases accepted. Of these cases, 37.8 percent were cases of corruption; 16.7 percent, cheating; 13.3 percent, misappropriation of public funds; and 12.2 percent, bribe-taking. Fourth, the proportion of criminal cases involving party members and cadres was quite big. Of the court decisions that had legal effect, 40.2 percent involved party members and cadres. Over the past year, courts across the province tried 1,529 economic criminal cases. Owing to the complicated social situation and the difficulties in obtaining evidence and conducting investigations, 506 cases were rejected for reinvestigation because the facts for fixing the crimes and determining the sentence were unclear, and the evidence was not adequate. Among the 1,084 criminals covered by legal consequences, 435 involved the amount in excess of 10,000 yuan. Of them, 309 criminals involved amounts between 50,000 and 10,000 yuan, 60 involved amounts between 100,000 and 50,000 yuan, and 66 involved the amount in excess of 100,000 yuan. Of these criminals, 11 were given death sentences, suspended death sentences, and life imprisonment, and 286 were given an imprisonment of over five years. As a result, a total of 27.81 million yuan in economic losses was retrieved for the state. In trying economic cases, courts at all levels always persisted in the principle of "being both resolute and prudent to ensure correctness" and offered corresponding policies and ideas for handling the bribery cases taken place among contracted and leased enterprises, the criminal cases committed by scientific and technological personnel, and the cases of misappropriation of public funds, and the cases of illegal money lending, thus ensuring the quality of the trial of economic cases. 3. We Vigorously Strengthened the Trial of Economic Cases and Deepened the Functional Role of Readjusting Economic Relations Along with the establishment and development of the socialist market economic structure, last year all courts in the province received a total of 49,142 economic dispute cases of various kinds, an increase of 23.4 percent over the previous year, and the total volume involved by lawsuits exceeded 4.27 billion yuan, a high record in history. These cases increasingly manifested the characteristics of large amounts of money involved by lawsuits, the increase in cases of new categories, and the complexity of legal relations. Many cases spanned several localities and trades and their legal relations overlapped, thus making it more difficult to handle them. First, in trying and handling these cases, people's courts, on the one hand, resolutely exercised overall control in consideration of the state overall interest, supported banks to withdraw unreasonable loans, banned the funds under illegal circulation, and prevented the "circulation of funds outside the legal entities." On the other hand, people's courts gave consideration to the objective factors of policy readjustment, reasonably judged the right or wrong of the related parties, and tried every possible means to reduce the economic losses of both parties involved in a case. Second, people's courts protected according to law the fair competition in the main body of markets. As an economy based on the legal system, the market economy has set an even higher demand on law enforcement. After the convocation of the 14th CPC Congress, in the process of changing from enforcing laws under the product economic structure to enforcing laws under the socialist market economic structure, courts at all levels paid attention to guiding the vast numbers of judicial cadres to overcome the legal concepts and traditional habits formed under the old economic mode and to learn to correctly enforce laws under the new economic structure. Third, people's courts continuously expanded the sphere of service. In trying economic cases, courts at all levels, on the one hand, correctly handled economic disputes in a correct and timely manner, and, on the other hand, positively helped enterprises develop production. By voluntarily going deep into enterprises to help them examine contracts and rationalize contract relations, people's courts achieved better social results in orienting the trail of economic cases to economic construction. 4. We Comprehensively Tried Civil and Administrative Cases and Protected the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Citizens and Legal Entities Among the cases tried by courts, civil cases accounted for the largest part. Last year, courts throughout the province received a total of 125,824 civil cases of various kinds, accounting for 50.6 percent of the total, or an increase of 9.3 percent over the previous year. Courts at all levels strictly enforced the "General Principles for Civil Code of the PRC" and the "PRC's Law on Civil Procedures," continuously strengthened the trial of civil cases, and continuously improved the quality, efficiency, and social effect of the trial. In handling cases, courts strengthened the sense of law enforcement and changed from handling cases based on experiences to handling cases according to the law. In terms of the time to try cases, courts strengthened the sense of time limit and changed from handling cases at will to handling cases efficiently. In the form of trial, courts strengthened the sense of evidence and changed from completely depending on investigations to combining evidence with investigation. First, courts conscientiously handled the frequently occurred civil cases. Second, courts prudently handled the cases of new categories and other sensitive cases. Due to the influence of the upsurge in real estate, stocks, negotiable securities, and business in the previous stage, new types of civil cases increased with each passing day. The lawsuits due to the disputes over development of real estate, transfer of negotiable securities, labor services, copyrights, and reputation rights were brought to the courts in succession. Third, the construction of the people's courts was strengthened, and the contradictions and disputes were solved among the grass roots. Larger numbers of civil disputes took place in the grass roots. The people's at various levels paid attention to strengthening the grass-roots work. Through readjustment, the province had 386 courts. Last year, the people's courts guided the grass roots to mediate and handle 230,741 civil disputes. So, 215,188 contradictions were nipped in the bud and among the grass roots. In the past three years after the enforcement of the law governing administrative procedures, the courts in the province accepted 2,083 administrative cases in first trials and concluded 2,033 of them. Thus, greater headway was made in the administrative judicial work. In trying the administrative cases, the courts at various levels not only protected the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal persons but also enabled the administrative organs to exercise their functions and strictly handle affairs according to the laws. They conscientiously examined, according to the laws, the specific administrative activities and made judgments in line with the principle of seeking truth from facts. In particular, they paid attention to examining and handling the administrative cases closely relating to reform, opening up, macroeconomic regulation and control, and change of government functions, including the cases of affecting the change of enterprise managerial mechanisms, wantonly collecting funds, wantonly apportioning expenses, and wantonly imposing fines, so as to protect the enterprises' decision-making right to management and to promote the setup and development of the socialist market economic system. The administrative cases that cropped up due to the restriction of the personal freedom were prudently treated and appropriately handled. So, the courts realistically safeguarded the citizens' legal rights and interests. Through administrative judicial activities, the courts forcefully supported the administrative organs to do administrative work according to laws; helped standardize the administrative management activities, upgrade the citizens' awareness of abiding by laws and disciplines, and protect the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal persons; and were welcomed and praised by all social circles. 5. We Strengthened the Construction of the Court Cadre Contingents and Ensured the Strict Enforcement of Laws Viewing the general situation, we know that the province's court cadre contingents are basically good and can be relied on the party and the people. However, they still lag far behind the requirements for deepening the development of reform and opening up and setting up the socialist market economic system. Over the past year, the courts at various levels across the province grasped the trial work with one hand and grasped the construction of the cadre contingents with the other. They regarded the improvement of the cadres and policemen's political integrity and professional quality as an important measure for achieving the court work. First of all, they unified the ideology of cadres and policemen with the guidelines of the 14th party congress. The courts at various levels conscientiously organized the broad masses of cadres and policemen to deeply study, according to their actual conditions, the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, to further emancipate the mind, to renew their ideas, to deepen the understanding about the market economic system, to firmly enhance the basic line of the party, to enhance the sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency for bringing into play the judicial functions to serve the acceleration of the setup of the socialist market economic system, and to enhance the ability to understand, analyze, and solve problems with the theory on socialist market economy. Under the conditions where the number of cadres continued to increase, there were no sufficient judicial forces, and the working conditions were comparatively poor, the broad masses of cadres and policemen carried forward the fine traditions of the judicial work, were inspired with enthusiasm, waged an arduous struggle, and worked harder for a long period of time. Thus, there emerged a group of advanced courts and outstanding judicial cadres that strictly enforced laws, were honest in performing their official duties, and served the people wholeheartedly. Second, they made efforts to upgrade the professional abilities of cadres and policemen. By the end of 1993, 54 percent of the cadres and policemen in the courts of the province had an education level of college degree or higher. Gigantic changes took place in the court cadres' educational and specialized structures. Third, they strengthened the improvement of administrative honesty and the supervision over the judicial work. In order to resist the interference which unhealthy social trends had brought to judicial work, courts at all levels persisted in managing the courts and police strictly, strictly enforced judicial discipline further and improved the mechanism of restraint through employing people to supervise administrative honesty work, establishing the law enforcement responsibility system and the system of reinvestigating wrong cases, conducting activities on vying to be an honest judge, and signing joint pledges on administrative honesty with the persons concerned. In line with the guidelines of the directives of the central authorities and the provincial party committee on the anticorruption struggle, courts at all levels conscientiously investigated and resolved their own problems and adopted resolute measures to straighten out and handle two prominent problems on above-quota collection of fees and confusing the set-up of judicial organs with their administrative power. Fees which were collected above quota or should not be collected had been refunded within a set time limit; and all authorized organs whose administration and judicial powers were confused had all been abolished without exception. Problems on law and discipline violation emerged in judicial cadres had been strictly handled; those whose offenses constituted a crime had been resolutely punished in line with the law; the image of people's courts and the purity of the ranks of judicial workers were maintained. To guarantee strict enforcement of law, courts at all levels realistically strengthened judicial supervision, promptly resolved problems emerged in judicial work through the procedures of second trial and retrial, and through law enforcement inspections. Last year courts across the province tried 11,146 cases subject to second trial, handled 5,393 cases of appeal, received 278,129 visits from the masses, handled 5,393 letters from the masses, and changed the verdicts to straighten out in line with law those cases whose facts to support the original sentence were unclear and the evidences were inadequate, and that laws were not properly applied to them. Measures for improving the situation of failing to strictly implement the procedural law and for improving rough judicial work style were proposed in a timely manner. During the past year, our province made definite achievements in court work, but it still lagged far behind the demands of the party and the country and the unceasingly developed situation, which were mainly indicated in the following: Our ideology, concept, and professional quality were not totally compatible with the overall objective of establishing the socialist market economic structure; our ability to deal with the new situation and resolve new problems needed further enhancement; the problems that the masses of people found it difficult to bring a lawsuit to court and that courts found it difficult to put the verdicts into effect had not been thoroughly resolved; problems on failing to strictly enforce the law caused by the influence of protectionism of localities existed at varying degrees; problems on the rough work style and sloppy work of some judicial workers occurred frequently; some cases were not handled in a timely manner and a small number of cases were not properly handled; some cadres and policemen violated law and discipline, and, although such cases were not great in number, they had a very bad influence in the masses. We should adopt effective measures to resolve these problems in an effort to unceasingly improve the work of people's courts. Zhang Huanwen said at the end of his report: This year we should deeply study the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, take the party's basic line as the guidance and economic construction as the central task, act in line with the demand of the conference of presidents of the higher people's courts across the country, gain great prestige in dealing strict blows to criminals, grasp major and appalling cases until good results are achieved, make big progress in regulating the relations in various economic sectors, and comprehensive enhance the judicial level. It is necessary to safeguard social stability, better serve the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, guarantee the smooth progress of reform and opening up, and promote a sustained, rapid, and sound national economic development.
