FBIS4-28074 "dreas110_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 Thailand Ten-Point Policy on Khmer Rouge Outlined Ten-Point Policy on Khmer Rouge Outlined BK0406105394 Bangkok THE NATION in English 4 Jun 94 p A7 BK0406105394 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] The Thai army yesterday publicly outlined a 10-point policy to back up its claim that it no longer supports the Maoist guerrilla group. The army's do's and don'ts policy on Cambodia includes absolutely no contact at any level with the Khmer Rouge and absolutely no support to them, according to Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo, the commander of the First Army Region. He said it also strictly prohibits supplying of arms to all sides in Cambodia. Lt Gen Chettha, who oversees security along Thai-Cambodian border, briefed reporters on the policy in response to a fresh charge from the U.S. State Department concerning Thailand's relations with the Khmer Rouge. He said under the policy arms seized from the Khmer Rouge would not be returned to the rebel group. Arms belonging to the Cambodian army would be returned via the Thai Foreign Ministry, he said. The regional army chief said Army Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit had ordered that the policy be strictly observed in order to refute any accusations that Thailand still supports the Khmer Rouge or any other side in Cambodia. Lt Gen Chettha spelled out the policy after the U.S. State Department questioned Thailand about reports that it was still backing the Khmer Rouge. The charge was repeated in an article in THE WASHINGTON POST written by former U.S. ambassador to Thailand Morton Abramowitz who said that Thailand's stubborn support for the Maoist group had helped prolong the war in Cambodia. Lt Gen Chetha said Cen Wimon had issued firm instructions to all his subordinates demanding full adherence to the policy. "It is being adhered to one hundred per cent," Chettha said. The policy has been circulated to government agencies concerned, he said. It was formulated in February after the accusation by Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut that Thai Army tanks had been spotted in the Khmer Rouge zone. "We have a clear policy. We have come to the end of our efforts. There is nothing else to be afraid of. But doing more is impossible," Gen Chettha said. The accusations began in mid-February after the Khmer Rouge recaptured Anlung Veng which had been briefly taken over by Phnom Penh troops. The accusations escalated into a war of words between Bangkok and Phnom Penh after the Khmer Rouge retook Pailin from Cambodian government troops in March. The army's policy toward Cambodia as outlined by Lt Gen Chettha yesterday: -- Non-interference in Cambodia's internal affairs; -- Absolutely no support for the Khmer Rouge; -- Ban of arms supply to Cambodia; -- Absolutely no contact with the Khmer Rouge but liaison with the Cambodian government is permitted; -- Weapons seized from the Khmer Rouge are to be impounded; -- Weapons belonging to the Cambodian government are to be returned through the Foreign Ministry; -- The closing and opening of Thai-Cambodian border checkpoints is strictly under the control of the Interior Ministry; -- The army will provide support for border security only on the instructions of the Interior Ministry; -- All military units must strictly observe the above-mentioned policy; and -- The policy must to be seriously enforced to counter any further accusations against Thailand. Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said yesterday that all the accusations heaped against Thailand were part of an attempt to divert attention from the real cause of problems in Cambodia. Surin said he had clarified Thailand's position during his meeting with the new French ambassador.
