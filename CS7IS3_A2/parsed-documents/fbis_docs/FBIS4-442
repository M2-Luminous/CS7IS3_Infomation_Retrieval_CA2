However, the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] is hoping to increase the number of its staff in Kigali, but it also fears that the work of its staff will become increasingly difficult in the capital. (Daniel Oxberger) is the ICRC delegate: [Begin recording] [Oxberger] Unfortunately, the situation has worsened this evening. I take this opportunity to call on all Rwandans to respect the actions of the Red Cross, its humanitarian work, and to enable its staff to work. We are trying to help all civilians who are the victims of the conflict. The situation is extremely worrying today in Kigali, where we have lost count of the number of wounded and dead. Unfortunately, our work has become extremely difficult over the last few hours. It is important to repeat the need to respect the neutrality of the ICRC delegates who are trying to evacuate the numerous wounded people in town. [Unidentified correspondent] Has the ICRC already decided, whatever happens, to leave its staff on the ground? [Oxberger] If need be, we are going to call all delegates back to the ICRC headquarters in Kigali and, should the situation deteriorate further, we would consider other measures. For the time being, far from withdrawing, the ICRC is even increasing the number of its staff. As I speak, five medical staff are flying to Bujumbura and we are hoping that they will arrive in Kigali tomorrow morning if the roads are still open. [end recording]
