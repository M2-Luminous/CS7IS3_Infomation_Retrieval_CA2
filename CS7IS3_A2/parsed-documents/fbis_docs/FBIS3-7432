Suwit Wangli, the chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said after discussions with Cambodian Economic and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi the Cambodian Government had confirmed the agreements would be honoured. But there may be some alterations to bring them in line with the Government's policies, he said. Thai businessmen have invested heavily in logging and gemstone mining along the Thai-Cambodian border, much of which is under Khmer Rouge control. Such trade has caused chronic problems involving allegedly excessive profits and has been attacked by foreign newspapers over the years, said Mr Suwit. "Thai investment in the central region of Cambodia does not generate similar problems and the ruling Government agrees to support those investors. At present, several drafts, including civil and criminal laws, investment laws and mortgaging and pledging laws are being globalised," said Mr Suwit. "Besides, Thai investors have been requested to invest in labour-intensive industries, such as textiles and precious stones, to help relieve unemployment in Cambodia. The regulations and legislation ruling financial institutions under the central bank are also being strengthened," he said. "Each day, at least two foreign institutions apply to open in Cambodia but the Government has not approved any since last year. It has decided to do so once the country's central bank is stabilised and well-monitored." Prida Tiasuwan, the deputy chairman of the Jewelry and Ornament Association of Thailand, said the Cambodian Government charged only 1 percent and 20 percent for sales tax and corporate income tax respectively, while Thai law required sales (value added) tax of 7 percent and corporate income tax of 30 percent. As a result, more and more Thai investors were attracted to Cambodia. But some obstacles are yet to be overcome for smooth mutual trade in the future. Gemstone mining along the Thai-Cambodian border has not been legalised. Any trader can mine and take out stones at will as there is no legislation preventing them doing so which caused several problems in the mining areas. Mr Rangsi agreed to take this matter into consideratlon.
