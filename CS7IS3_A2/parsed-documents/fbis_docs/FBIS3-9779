ODS is the largest of the four coalition parties. The other three are the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), and the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL). Their chairmen met on Monday to discuss the electoral laws, local and central government reform, restitution and Jewish property issues. Speaking on Czech Radio, Klaus said that the coalition partners had different attitudes towards restitution and the creation of parliament's second chamber, the Senate, the need for which he said was "highly controversial." The third problem, he said, was regional administrative arrangements. "These opinions are truly different, and no amount of communication can level them in any way," Klaus said. The coalition would definitely find a compromise, he said. However, everybody had to be aware that a compromise was not "this or that smaller political party insisting that the problem will be solved precisely the way it wants."
