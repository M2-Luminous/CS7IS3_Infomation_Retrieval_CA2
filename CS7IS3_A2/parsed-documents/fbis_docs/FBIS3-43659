However, since this morning it has been observed that certain panic stricken businessmen closed their shops in order to change the prices of their commodities. Even thought it is normal for businessmen to close their shops in order to take stock, the government does not appreciate their attempts to increase prices arbitrarily. Consequently, the government condemns this practice and asks the Central African people to remain calm. The government recalls that the prices of commodities currently in the warehouses awaiting customs clearance and those ordered before the devaluation will not be increased. However, there are dossiers that will be examined case by case [words indistinct]. Furthermore, the government demands those businessmen who closed their shops this morning in order to change the price tags to stop the operation and obey the present instructions. Severe controls will be taken to this effect in order to detect defaulters. A word to the wise is sufficient.
