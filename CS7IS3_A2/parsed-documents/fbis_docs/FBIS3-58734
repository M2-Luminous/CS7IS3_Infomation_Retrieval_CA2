According to participants in the meeting, Herzog received 34 votes in favour in the secret ballot. One member of the executive voted against and one abstained. The CSU [Christian Social Union] leadership had already expressed support for Herzog last weekend. [passage omitted] FDP leader Klaus Kinkel said in an interview with `BILD AM SONNTAG' newspaper that only the CDU and CSU bodies had nominated their candidate. Roman Herzog was a respected man, but for the FDP the situation had not changed. "Our candidate is Hildegard Hamm- Bruecher." [passage omitted] Chancellor Kohl told journalists after the meeting the CDU executive was convinced that Herzog was the right man for this important office in such a difficult time of transition in the fatherland. [passage omitted] Herzog said he had told the CDU executive that he was willing to be nominated. The result of the secret ballot had greatly encouraged him. He would now have to wait for the joint proposal of the sister parties (CDU and CSU) before he accepted the nomination.
