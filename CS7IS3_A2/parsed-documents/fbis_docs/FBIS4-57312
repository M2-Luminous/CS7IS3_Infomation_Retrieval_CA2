The Spanish courts' petition has prompted a new controversy at the judicial branch level, as the interrogatories must include all Basque citizens who are allegedly ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] members, whether or not their extradition has been approved. One of the cases included in the petition was approved, and this elicited a reaction from the defense attorneys of those involved. Attorney Gustavo Puig has filed remedies of appeal and appeals for annulment. The legal issue now will therefore have to be resolved by the Court of Criminal Appeals.
