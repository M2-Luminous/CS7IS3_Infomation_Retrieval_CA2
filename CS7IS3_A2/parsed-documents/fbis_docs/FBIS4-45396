The half-hour meeting took place in U.S. Ambassador Pamela Harriman's residence in the rue du Faubourg St. Honore. The mayor of Paris was accompanied by Didier Quentin, the town's international relations director, and Pierre Lellouche, his foreign policy and defense adviser. Bill Clinton's entourage included U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Thomas McLarty, chief of the presidential staff. Jacques Chirac and Bill Clinton spent most of the meeting discussing international affairs, and in particular the Bosnian conflict. On this issue, they were agreed that the arms embargo should not be lifted. The RPR president also insisted on the seriousness of the situation in Algeria, which risks destabilizing the whole Maghreb region. Where nuclear testing is concerned, Jacques Chirac stressed the need for France to carry out a few more tests before switching over to test simulations. For his part, Bill Clinton expressed his concern about the growing risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological) and the danger that this represents, insofar as they could be used by terrorist groups. Working Group Moreover, Jacques Chirac explained at length to the U.S. President his views on the urgent and vital need to attack the narcotics problem at the production stage. In particular, he stressed the considerable increase in the production of heroin and its consequences, especially for young people. The former French prime minister also underscored the need to define a policy and take action, possibly under the aegis of the United Nations, to encourage countries producing narcotics to think about promoting alternative sources of revenue for their farmers. President Clinton showed much interest in this proposal. The two men decided that regular contacts would be established between experts on both sides and that a working group would be set up to define a policy for the fight against narcotics production.
