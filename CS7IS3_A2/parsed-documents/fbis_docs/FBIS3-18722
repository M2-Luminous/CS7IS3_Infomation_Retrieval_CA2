The draft of the new CDU basic program states that it contradicts the basic principle of making one's own provisions through contributions and makes the individual unreasonably dependent on decisions by the state. The program is to be approved at the Fifth All-German CDU Party Congress, which will take place in Hamburg from February 20 to 23 (HANDELSBLATT of 9 February 1994). The petition commission for the party congress meanwhile has discussed the petitions and made its recommendations. In the version of the basic program recommended for approval by the party congress, it is explicitly pointed out that earned income remains the basis for determining contributions. The CDU wants to maintain the graduated social security. It combines solidarity and subsidiarity. To preserve the functioning capability of the social benefits systems in the long term and to be able to ensure social security of the individual, fundamental revisions must be made. Not every risk in life can be safeguarded collectively. The CDU goal is not expansion of the social security systems, but rather their restructuring. In addition to greater promotion and demand of self-responsibility, self-provisions, and self-participation, the CDU wants to strengthen the insurance principle. The draft states that our social insurance must gradually be freed financially of those tasks which are national in nature and must be financed with tax money. The CDU supports preserving the several-generations contract as the regulative principle of the pension insurance system. To secure this, it supports a family-friendly society and family-friendly measures, particularly in the tax and social insurance law. It wants to balance the extra burdens on parents because of child rearing, and recognize more strongly than before in the pension law, the time spent in child rearing as a pension contribution. In the opinion of the CDU, pension insurance must remain contribution-related, and hence performance-related. However, the CDU leaves no doubt that, due to demographic developments, further adjustments in the pension law will become necessary. Pension entitlements already earned will remain secure. The economic development and the number of employed will determine what contribution the present pension system will provide to the next generation for old-age security. Private old-age provisions, among them company provisions, are of growing importance. The CDU means to promote them. A gradual extension of the working years is also an element to deal with the demographic development and the growing life expectancy of the population. The CDU also stands for subjecting in principle all permanent work positions to the social insurance obligation. With regard to statutory health insurance, it is said that the growing life expectancy and demographic change, as well as still-existing undesirable features, demand further measures for limiting costs. For this, the increased capability of the insured for self-responsibility must be drawn upon to a greater extent. A reorganization of the benefits catalogue will have to better differentiate which benefits will continue to be paid by the statutory health insurance from a health and social policy standpoint, which will have to be borne by the individual, and to what extent self-participation will be necessary. Extending the Working Years At the same time, the CDU wants to create more possibilities for a self-responsible shaping of insurance protection, and shape the structures of the health system in such a way that all participants have a self-interest in a humane, efficient, and low-cost health care system. In the opinion of the CDU, competition between health insurances and also between benefit providers must be strengthened. Within the framework of restructuring the social welfare state, the CDU wants to set another milestone in social policy with elderly care insurance. The need for care is a risk that can happen to anyone, without everyone being in a position to make the necessary provision for it. This demands collective safeguarding against this risk through a general elderly care insurance. The benefits of the elderly care insurance should above all promote home care. Supplementary private provisions on a voluntary basis are necessary and to be promoted by the state. The CDU advocates that humane working conditions, work protection and coparticipation possibilities at the workplace be better understood as important preconditions for entrepreneurial success. It expects of the wage agreement partners a new flexibility in setting working hours. This must take into account company requirements as well as improvement in reconciling family and work. "We want to make greater flexibility possible in determining daily, weekly, yearly, and lifetime working hours and shape the transitions between the sectors and stages of life more smoothly." The CDU calls on the public service sector to carry out its model function in offering and shaping flexible working hours. In the CDU's opinion, Sundays and holidays must be kept workfree in principle. Retaining Codetermination in the EU [European Union] The CDU holds the opinion that the side-by-side of civil servants and employees in public service has proven itself. It considers the permanent civil service indispensable for carrying out sovereign tasks. However, the party also advocates making the public service law more flexible and performance-oriented. The CDU supports expansion of parental leave time and unpaid leave to care for family members. It calls for more qualified part-time jobs and more flexible company and wage regulations of working hours for women and men. In its new program, the CDU supports codetermination. In its opinion, it should be maintained in the European Union. The increasing international interlocking of industry, states the program draft, demands that in enterprises active Europe-wide, border-transcending workers' representations with training and consulting rights are established abroad. The party congress was also presented with a petition by the party executive committee for growth and employment. Important demands of this program (HANDELSBLATT of 18 January 1994) were included in the Federal Government's action program for growth and employment. The petition commission will present its recommendations on the executive committee petition only at the CDU party congress.
