Garcia Lizardo thereby denied statements to the contrary, which were attributed to him by some news media. Noting that the vote count will begin on Wednesday [25 May], Garcia Lizardo said: "The people have already voted. What is left to be done is assessing the people's vote." In addition, JCE spokesmen recalled that the law does not call for an annulment of the elections or a runoff election. According to the law, the only action that could be taken would be holding partial or complementary elections in places where there were serious irregularities. Presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez called for a runoff election after alleging that a "scandalous fraud" was committed in the 16 May elections. The JCE has not proclaimed a winner yet. However, following the count of 98 percent of the votes, President Joaquin Balaguer was ahead of Pena Gomez by 1.01 percent.
