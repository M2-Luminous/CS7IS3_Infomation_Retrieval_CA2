That a gap would appear quite early in the supply and demand for domestic rice had long been predicted. Probably it was early July 1993. About then, the people involved had seen that rice imports could not be avoided. By late July, there was even talk of the volume imported possibly being over a million tons. By mid-July things were such that the Food Agency director rushed off on an inspection of crop conditions. Quite recently, the Food Agency director of that time has frankly admitted to "a tardy decision on importing." Why was it so slow? It was because the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] agricultural policy was a "dogmatic farm policy": We won't accept the import of even one grain; we'll maintain food security guarantees and domestic self-sufficiency in rice. (Preserving self-sufficiency is not dogmatic, however.) -- At that juncture, the Uruguay Round negotiations were being held and would get down to serious business in the early fall, so that in the ministry they could not say a word about imports. The general elections were held in July, and on 7 August the Hosokawa regime was born. It was about 20 August that officials ended their summer vacations and were back in their offices. Then, slowly and reluctantly, they had to get to work on imports. And yet, having a dogmatic agricultural policy, they had not checked on which countries raise how much of the rice that Japanese can eat, or how much of it is exportable. Only in September did all newspapers carry the data that the Food Agency had hastily prepared. That was statistics from the FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization] (United States Department of Agriculture) [as published]. But, according to that data, 14 million tons of Japanese rice were produced in 1992. That pads the actual figure by as much as 40 percent. All they had in hand were such flimsy statistics. Then they urged trading companies to collect information on rice produced everywhere, and it may have been about 10 September that they were finally becoming prepared. Next, they had the trading companies make purchases. It was mid-September when that finally began operating. It was about 20 September when the Chicago grain market price shot upward, underscoring this. How much was bought as a result? As for rice produced last year, in the United States and Australia most was raised under contract. Thailand produces just a little Japonica rice. Next, making the confusion worse, they bought processed rice, saying it was for staple food, and made the public eat that. Moreover, it was at such extralegal prices... It is blunder after blunder. So, why did it go so far as "rice riots"? From about the time of the 1992 crop they knew that rice stocks were inadequate. So, the open-market rice price was high in early 1993. What did the Food Agency do then? They quit publishing their supply and demand program. Things turned strange from that point; and since they were keeping the data hidden, instability on the market evoked even more instability. The reason the instability did not quiet down after the uproar began, no matter how many appeals the Food Agency and MAFF made on television, may have been because of their keeping all the information secret and not agreeing to make it public. The elderly want to eat the domestic rice they have consumed for many years. So, they frantically tried to get domestic rice. This is natural for consumers. And yet, the Food Agency is now trying to shift responsibility for that to some of the free rice dealers. However, that is wrong; and, particularly because they had kept the information hidden until the panic broke out, the instability grew more violent. That means the responsibility of the Food Agency and agricultural policy is greater. They opened up a gap of as much as 2.7-2.8 million tons and still their after-the-fact handling was almost haphazard. So, how will it be this year? To predict that, one must better analyze the structural reasons for why we had a crop failure last year. It is wrong simply to pass it off by saying it was the bad weather. There are a number of primary factors, the greatest being a structural cause: a decline in farmers' technological capacities. Since farmers for whom that is a secondary or side job are the overwhelming majority, they squeeze rice planting in during the May holidays. For both Aomori and Iwate, where the index of planting conditions was extremely bad, the best time for rice planting was about 18 May; but they did it during the early May holidays since they could not get time off. When they plant before temperatures have risen, damage will be great even from slight weather fluctuations. There also are problems with the varieties planted. Farmers say they cannot sell rice which is not the tasty Koshihikari strain of rice. This tendency grew strong especially with the market created in Tokyo and Osaka from December 1990. Yet, what we call agriculture has its basis in the proper land and proper crops. That is being disregarded. So, one cannot attribute the rice shortage of 2.7 million tons to weather factors alone. The extreme decline in farmers' technical abilities made it even worse. And the primary causes for the decline in their technical abilities are the food control system which postwar farm policies created and the paddy reduction policy. So long as these structures are not quickly changed, it is quite possible that the same kind of damage will emerge hereafter, too. Agricultural Policy Reform: Year One I believe this year is a very vital one for Japan's rice farming. Last December, the rice issue in the Uruguay Round was resolved in the form of a partial opening. I divide the time after that into three stages. First, 1994 is the first stage. 1995-2000, the period of minimum access, is the second stage. And 2001 and beyond is the third stage, that of tariffication. I think this first-stage year should be year one for reforms in agricultural policy. Which is to say that during the six years starting next year agricultural policy reforms will be required, differing from the past by giving answers within set time limits. Then, in 2001 tariffication will begin. The MAFF says it has not necessarily promised tariffication, but that is false. It may have been given a grace period for the very reason that it gave a secret promise of tariffication. All the more reason why it must take on reform of agricultural policy with firm resolve. What should it have done first this year? I think it should, in principle, have abolished paddy reduction and let rice be produced freely. Having the least price flexibility, grains need production coordination. But, there are problems in enforcement by community units, disregarding the individual's capacity for ingenuity, as our country's paddy-reduction policy has done. The MAFF says it has not used compulsion; but it has simply avoided soiling its own hands, using other ways to make local governments and agricultural cooperatives do it. Farmers have been angered by repeated paddy reductions, and the best young people have all left. What is vital is to let them produce freely. Also, subsidies would not be given to those producing freely. Instead, they would be allowed to sell freely. That is the foundation and is so-called optional production regulation. For those agreeing to production regulation, a set subsidy would be given. It is quite unfair to treat farmers with small farms and large-scale farmers the same in this. Yet, the government says that in the Uruguay Round negotiations last year it reluctantly agreed to market opening. That is false. The Food Agency well knows that if the market is not open there will be major trouble with its supply and demand program after the year 2000. They have done a certain simulation but are hiding it carefully. It says that, even if paddy reductions all cease after the year 2000, there will be constant shortages of two to three million tons just like last year's. One proof of that is in the pamphlet Points of a New Policy, which they put out. In it is to be found "Trends and Outlook for Those Engaged in Mainline Agriculture." This is a simulation, which the MAFF based on the 1990 census, of how the number of persons engaged in mainline agriculture will change by the year 2000. For example, persons including both men and women under age 60 engaged in mainline agriculture numbered 1.62 million in 1990. By 2000 they will number 810,000--just half as many. If those engaged in agriculture fall by half, a simple calculation would show that current productivity cannot be sustained unless the area each person farms doubles. Will it double in the next seven years? That is hopelessly impossible. If they cannot reform agricultural policy hereafter, a supply shortage of 2.5 million tons of rice will become an established fact, even if paddy reductions are eased. An era in which, if one eats four bowls of rice one would be imported rice, would come to stay after 2000. Not only that, but if we have slightly unusual weather like last year there could be shortages of 4-5 million tons and we could even see an era where one of every two bowls of rice would be imported rice. So, was not such a to-do created now because their awareness of the situation was too easy going? That is how hard-pressed Japan's agriculture is becoming. Induction of Competition Principle Naturally, reform of the food control system will be necessary. Indeed, rather than reform, first it should be abolished. After that there should be thorough discussion in the nation about how food controls should be. The government's role is to maintain emergency reserves. If the government takes responsibility as an independent nation for minimal reserves, could it not win public approval for that? Of course it would be the government's duty to have a rationing system in times of emergency. Yet, keeping the distribution of all rice under its control by a staff of as many as 12,000 even in normal times is anachronistic in the extreme. Moreover, food control and distribution is multi-tiered and based on farm cooperative organizational lines. The basic form is, first, from the primary collection agents to the economic associations, national farm cooperative association, wholesalers, retailers, and finally to consumers. Among other products, there are few that go through a distribution process of five to six stages. The stance is clear of vainly claiming a role for food controls in times of emergency and then protecting entrepreneurs with interests which they cling to. Farmers, too, should think about what merits the food control system has for them as producers. Aside from this year, a 72-liter sack of ordinary rice is 33,000 to 34,000 yen at the retail stage. With the producing farmers' take at 20,000 yen, a margin of 13,000 yen or almost 40 percent being added on is itself fundamentally strange. Is as much as 40 percent in intermediate distribution costs necessary? This should be thoroughly debated. The distribution of other products has been considerably rationalized, with pluses for producers and consumers alike. And yet, the food control system benefits neither producers nor consumers. The intermediate entrepreneurs in agricultural cooperative organizations and in wholesaling and retailing are taking a considerable margin. As all are licensed tradesmen, the competition principle ultimately does not operate. Henceforth we will enter the era of tariffication. Imported rice will come in constantly. Dramatic arguments will fly about such as that imported rice is risky and domestic rice is safe. This campaign waged by the central body of the national farm co-ops mocks producers and consumers alike. From now on, price, safety and flavor are things the consumer will choose. That is what the age of tariffication will be. The period for getting ready for that should be thought of as that of minimum access. What are we to do specifically to reform agricultural policy? First of all, we should abolish the food control system, and the government should play a minimal role, such as keeping a set amount in reserve. A staff of 3,000 would suffice. Then, freeing up domestic distribution, it should quickly accept the entry of new wholesalers and retailers. Competition principles would be introduced also for agricultural cooperatives. All should be competing. If that is done, rice consumption will surely grow. To reform agriculture or distribution while limiting new entries and protecting vested interests would be like spitting into the wind. With the farm population declining, we must devise measures for the successors with firm resolve. New entries have increased considerably in truck farming. Their not increasing in rice farming is due to the existence of the food control system and paddy reduction policy and always taking actions that limit competition. To make rice farming something with appeal we will make the competition principle prevail. If we do so, excellent young people will come and join in. They will want to make money in agriculture. Turn Attention to Farmland Problems with the farmland law may become the biggest topic. The farmland law is a bottleneck because it makes expansion in scale difficult. All have had their focus diverted to food controls and paddy reduction; but more attention should be directed at farmland, and public discussion should develop on it. The price of farmland is too high relative to its product. That is because it is a price valuated as a farmer's asset rather than as a means of farm production. So, they do not want to let go of it. Thus, they cannot buy farmland and cannot expand in scale. If they try to lease land, no one will lend it to them. One more problem is that of basic maintenance. The MAFF so far has invested much money in basic maintenance. On average its standard is 30 ares per paddy field; but this will not fit well with an era of tariffication. To date, an international sense and point of view on continuing to protect Japan's agriculture beyond the present day may have been wanting. Then, what should be done? In principle, it is to ease limits on farmland ownership and instead tighten restraints on usage and prevent diversions. Also, for farmers wishing to expand in scale the government should provide 100 percent financing. In exchange, resale would be barred for a certain number of years. The biggest point for farm administration reform henceforth is the course of rice prices. Now is a time of peak prices, so that eventually rice prices will fall. As of the year 2000, the price for domestically produced rice may fall by one-third of today's price. It is seen that in Hokkaido it will be 10,000 yen, 15,000 yen in average locations, and the Koshihikari rice from Uonuma County in Niigata will possibly top 20,000 yen. The question will be whether, at an average of 15,000 yen, farm management will be commercially profitable. Farm managers must create this management plan. What should be done to make it pay? The one thing to do is expand in scale. And make direct sales, eliminating the middleman's margin in distribution. However, since costs for farm direct sales such as home delivery charges are too high, I think that in any case it will die down unless substantial added value is applied to it. After all, will it not be desirable for the agricultural cooperatives to do it collectively or for large-scale producer groups to make direct sales as wholesalers and retailers? Most important now is to incorporate as a system the conditions that will cause young people to come in and let their individual ingenuity be fully exercised. I think that is a real burden-carrying measure. We need to change the approach of agricultural policies treating the community as their foundation, using compulsion and subsidies to make people listen. We must definitely have MAFF officials become aware that farm policies have failed because of these things. Speaking of the agricultural cooperatives, basically they make money on rice and financing. Agricultural co-op finances are extremely exposed to competition and troubled by holding large sums in bad loans. The same holds true, too, for rice--their other pillar of support. Last fiscal year more than 2 million tons of rice were imported; so their commissions were down for fertilizer and other farm chemicals for domestically produced rice. What are agricultural cooperatives to do about this? Moreover, tariffication of rice, while a plus for producers with get-up-and-go, may ultimately see the MAFF also giving priority to investing in farmers who have been selected out. At such time, if the agricultural cooperatives do not take countermeasures they will suffer their worst damage. What is important is for the agricultural cooperatives themselves to use this six years of minimum access era to create low-cost production and distribution systems. Without that, when tariffication begins in the year 2001 it will set up conditions under which they would not even be in the arena of competition. In name and fact it would mean the agricultural cooperatives would be completely forsaken. There are a variety of limiting conditions; but if reform of agricultural administration can be accomplished, superior farmers will thrive. Nor must the agricultural cooperatives fear competition. It is competition that is the wellspring of development. So, may not the only way to survive be to make a 100-percent change in past ways of doing things?
