This was stated by Yevgeniy Yasin, leader of the Russian Federation president's analysis center. In his opinion the rate of the reforms has slowed down somewhat in the same period. "We could and should have moved faster," he said. Yasin believes that the government's main task is "not to hold up the processes begun in 1992 but to provide the opportunity to implement the transformations at the level of enterprises and regions."
