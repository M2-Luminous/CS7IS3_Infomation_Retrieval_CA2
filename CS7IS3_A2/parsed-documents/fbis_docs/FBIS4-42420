[Vranitzky] Some people will turn against the government in the referendum. However, I do not expect their number to be very large. Should the Austrians reject Europe, we will not interpret their "no" vote as a motion of no confidence in the coalition. [KNACK] Your coalition partner has a large number of voters in regions that are against EU membership. You encountered difficulties in keeping the OeVP [Austrian People's Party] on the European path. [Vranitzky] Not in principle. Ever since the Social Democrats embarked on EU membership with the People's Party, our partner has always been in favor of accession. The OeVP proved more hesitant, and was more restrained in its pro-Europe statements. It did not recommend accession that fervently in public. Our "yes" sounded more solid, which will not, I hope, prevent things from running as we intended. [KNACK] The result of the popular referendum will influence the upcoming general elections. [Vranitzky] It is probably too soon to make a statement about that. I am not afraid of any link being made between the referendum and the general election. However, for the time being I assume that both events are not linked together. [KNACK] Why do you want to see Austria join the EU at all costs? [Vranitzky] There are many reasons for this. Three of them form the basis of my personal conviction. First, there is currently a contest under way between continents. And Austria must strengthen Europe in that contest. Second, we cannot solve a number of issues, such as environmental and transportation problems, by ourselves. Issues of transnational importance are best solved within a larger, European connection. Third, a country that is in the middle of the continent cannot remain a spectator on the sidelines. Austria is European historically, culturally, and also in terms of popular mentality. We must regard our membership as participation in one of the largest projects for decades. Only by adopting a common position will we be able to resolve the major issues. So we are not willing to form small alliances, like a German-speaking bloc. This is with a view to combating specific temptations. [KNACK] Who is that statement aimed at? [Vranitzky] At anyone who harbors doubts about our openness. Despite the agreements regarding language and culture concluded with Germany, we also enjoy equally good relations with a number of other countries. We are talking about so-called industrial nations. Admittedly, worldwide industrialization is making it increasingly difficult to justify that kind of terminology. Since the first oil crisis in the early 1970's, the number of jobs in industry has been on the decline. It is not enough to have forecasts made, then sit back and wait for the predictions to come true. We must work on the future of Europe together. [KNACK] Farmers and environmentalists have an almost instinctive distrust of Europe. Many other people in your country fear that standards will decline, both socially, from the point of view of consumers, and as regards democracy. [Vranitzky] Businessmen are now convincing company employees that the quality of Austrian life will not decline. As in other countries there is criticism of decisionmaking in the EU. Understandably so. The citizens of West Europe are used to a democratic game being played in their country, one in which they feel more closely involved than in the mechanism of the EU. They can scarcely accept less democracy. In order to prevent that, the European Parliament will, in the long term, have to play the role of legislator more emphatically. [KNACK] You came to Brussels to talk with European Commission (EC) President Jacques Delors, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, and Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. [Vranitzky] One of the topics that cropped up was the construction of a railroad line linking Munich and Verona. That line would run through western Austria, so as to alleviate a number of problems associated with road transport (via the Brenner Pass). The railroad line will feature on the agenda of the European summit to be held in Corfu at the end of June (making it a referendum trump card against resistance from anti-Europeans in the Tirol). [KNACK] Did you also come to lend your support to Dehaene as a candidate for the post of EC president? [Vranitzky] I have no comment on that. As is the case with the questions concerning the qualified majority with which Europe will make important decisions in the future. It is not good to send too many signals out into the world on subjects such as that, or to voice my own personal opinion. Austria is not eavesdropping. The referendum must be held on the basis of the issue in question. The debate must not be allowed to founder over some statement made in connection with a partial aspect. [KNACK] Are you more in favor of deepening or enlarging the EU? [Vranitzky] Equally in favor of both. European integration requires both intensification of its contents and a broadening of its framework. In my view, the prime aim must be to deepen its contents. [KNACK] Will the constitutionally neutral Austria remain outside the WEU [Western European Union], Europe's defense community? [Vranitzky] It is not out of the question that Austria will join the WEU in the capacity of an observer. However, we are in no hurry to do so. Incidentally, a large number of questions regarding defense remain to be settled between today's 12 member states and the WEU. [KNACK] In Italy, the government now includes some neofascists. How do you deal with that fact? [Vranitzky] I would have preferred it if our neighbor's government had not included any neofascists. However, I respect the choice of the Italian people. We will try and enjoy equally good relations with the new government as we did with previous governments in Rome. We must allow ourselves to be guided by what emerges from our working relations, not by prejudices.
