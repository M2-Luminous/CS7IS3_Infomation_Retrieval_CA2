A joint statement issued by the six said the draft budget, which is under study by the Finance Committee of the House, placed the greater burden of economic reform on the poor and thus deepened the gap between the rich and poor. The statement, a copy of which was made available to the JORDAN TIMES, was signed by the Jordanian Communist Party, the communist Arab Ba'th Party, the Jordanian Popular Unity Party, the Jordanian Democratic People's Party (Hashd), the Jordanian Socialist Democratic Party and the Jordanian Democratic Arab Party. It called on the House to reject the draft budget, presented to parliament in mid-December by Finance Minister Sami Qammuh, and "defend the people's right to their daily bread," Listing its own version of the objectives of the country's economic policy, the statement said that economic development in the past two years did not justify the increase in local revenues (mainly from indirect taxes and fees). The statement asserted that the expected introduction of a sales tax would "increase the production costs of the local industries and lead to a general price increase in market, and raise the poverty line..." Other byproducts of the sales tax, according to the statement, will be a decline in demand for local products and investment and an increase in unemployment. The statement called for a link between prices and wages and a minimum level of wages "in accordance with all related studies of living costs and the poverty line." It claimed that the increase in the income and profit taxes came mainly from shareholding companies and employees, "which indicates that the percentage of tax evasion is still very high." On expenditure, the statement claims that there is no serious attempt to reduce the deficit by decreasing expenditure, "rather it is about increasing revenues while maintaining the level of expenditure." The statement said that the budget is not "deficit-free" as described by Mr. Qammuh, but that there is a deficit of JD 450 million "to be covered by local and foreign aid and loans." The statement concluded by some suggestions to "treat the economic situation and the budget, including an increase in the salaries of active and retired civil servants and the military." In his daily column which appeared in the Arabic daily AL-RA'Y Monday economist Fahd al-Fanik accused those advocating an increase in salaries as being "irresponsible." He said that there is no guarantee that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will reschedule Jordan's debts "regardless of our adherence to the economic reform programme, which includes decreasing the budget deficit."
