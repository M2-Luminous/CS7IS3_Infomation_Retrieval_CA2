You have been involved from the start in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, first about self-rule and later about economic issues. Are you comfortable with the results? [Quray'] I cannot contain my relief over the agreement reached about the issues that we dealt with -- what we have called the Paris Economic Relations Pact. The interim stage and the self-rule laws restrict our ambition to start a completely independent institution. However, the results we have attained from these negotiations lay the foundations and sow the strong seeds of an independent Palestinian state. Let me give you an example. Take currency and banks... [Tarabayh, interrupting] So, from your perspective this is a general agreement that lays the foundations for the economic ties between Israel and the Palestinians. [Quray'] That's correct. It is also a contractual agreement for the interim stage, not a final agreement. It is not an agreement whereby tariffs are nonexistent, as some have said. It is not a free trade agreement, as has been rumored. It is a contractual agreement for a transition period during which relations will be regulated and the Israeli and Palestinian economies will be disengaged... [Tarabayh, interrupting] With the understanding that the agreement be reviewed later? [Quray'] Yes, periodically. And, in the final stage, it will be reviewed radically and completely. [Tarabayh] How does the agreement address the banking and monetary system? [Quray'] Right from the start of the occupation, the Israelis have sought to shut down the banks and take control of monetary institutions and replace any Arab or foreign banks with Israeli banks. Whoever has control of the money secures control over the economic lifeline. That has been the policy of the occupation authorities from the first day of occupation in 1967. The agreement breathes new life into Palestinian financial institutions. It also expressly provides for the establishment of a multi-purpose Palestinian monetary institution as the official point of reference for the National Palestinian Authority and the public sector. It will act as an advisory body and hold the reserves of the National Palestinian Authority. There will be a special administration that will be responsible for licensing commercial banks and specialized banks and exchange services and money markets. It will monitor their performance and transactions. [Tarabayh] Under what sort of monetary authority, a central bank, or what? [Quray'] It will be not be called a central bank, but will handle all the responsibilities of one, except issue Palestinian currency. The institution that was established is a Palestinian central bank minus the function of issuing currency. You know that in some Arab states there is what they call the monetary agency, as in Saudi Arabia. It enjoys the full powers of issuing and protecting currency, among other functions. Thus, the establishment of the Palesinian Monetary Authority is one of the important seeds of Palestinian sovereignty and national independence. It is the only and fundamental means of reinjecting the Palestinian economy's veins with blood that has dried up over the years of occupation. [Tarabayh] But, in this context, you have registered a retreat with regard to the Palestinian currency. What was the alternative? [Quray'] As a matter of fact, the issue has nothing to do with either a retreat or progress on our part. We never thought the issue of launching a Palestinian currency would be accomplished without difficulties. We do have the right to issue a Palestinian currency. This right has remained intact. The agreement has underscored the Palestinians' right to issue their own currency. Hence, the agreement stipulated that the talks will continue, through the Joint Palestinian-Israeli Committee, in the immediate aftermath of the signing of this agreement to examine and consider the issuance of Palestinian currency. They have made offers that we have categorically rejected. [Tarabayh] What are the offers they have made? [Quray'] For instance, they have offered the issuance of a currency similar to the Scottish currency. We have categorically rejected this. This Palestinian currency was meant to be guaranteed by the Central Bank of Israel. We rejected this. We are speaking of an independent Palestinian currency to be issued by the Palestinian National Authority. If not possible today, let it be issued six months, or one year, from now. [Tarabayh] Pending the materialization of this, what currency will be used? Will it be the Israeli shekel? [Quray'] First, there is the Jordanian dinar, which is a basic and major currency in circulation. Moreover, there is also the shekel, which is also in circulation. They wanted the shekel to be legal tender [preceding two words in English]. We rejected this. We eventually agreed that the shekel will be a circulated currency. It goes without saying that we cannot do without the shekel as a circulated currency. This issue must be clear. For what is important is not to stick to slogans, but rather to be aware of the practices on the ground. The shekel is circulated on the ground. There are 2 billion shekels in circulation among the people. The workers' revenues and wages, which exceed $500-700 million per year, are paid in shekels. The trade exchange is also a factor to be taken into account. You cannot forget about these three factors at will, or just to vindicate a slogan. But, you can streamline, examine, and control these factors until you reach the desired situation. Hence, during the interim period, this interim contractual economic agreement will determine our moves with regard to the Israeli, Jordanian, or Palestinian currencies. [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-'Ala': One of the outstanding issues concerned customs tariffs. There were Israeli concerns about this issue. By contrast, there was Palestinian determination regarding uncontrolled imports to the occupied territories. The Palestinians have eventually triumphed. [Quray'] As a matter of fact, I can say we have achieved a significant part of what we sought in this area. We have not achieved all that we wanted. It is impossible for us to achieve all that we want. [Tarabayh] How then have you dispelled Israeli concerns? [Quray'] Let me tell you how. First, during the interim period, there are no demarcated borders. Consequently, the movement of commodities will continue to be free. The free movement of commodities from one market to another will cause one market to lose considerably if the customs tariffs are not close to one another. This was one of the major arguments they have advanced in this regard. I also believe that there were political considerations at play here. For, since the occupation of 1967, they have erected a high and extremely stringent wall of customs tariffs around the occupied territories. They incorporated the exports and imports of the occupied territories into the exports and imports of Israel. This all became part and parcel of the Israeli trade balance. Hence, there was no regional or international trade status for the occupied Palestinian territories. This status lost its distinct identity, and became part of the Israeli economy. This is how they planned. Now, what has this agreement produced? This agreement has put forth three, or four highly significant basic principles. The first principle is that imports reflect the nature of the trade situation. There were no Arab ties at all with the occupied territories. Trade ties between the Arab countries and the occupied territories were one-sided. It is true that Arab countries received imports from the occupied territories. However, these countries have not exported commodities to these territories. Moreover, Palestinian merchants, businessmen, or lay men were unable to import commodities from Arab countries. The other issue is that there were no ties at all with the Islamic world. Such ties were banned and prohibited. The third issue is that the entire trade transactions, as well as the export and import operations with the outside world were part of the Israeli trade, as I have just mentioned. Therefore, this customs wall requires a shake, some disturbance, and a loophole if the new Palestinian baby is to be catapulted onto its strategic Arab stage, further onto its Islamic stage, and then onto the international stage. This has been achieved. Imports have been streamlined. There are four lists, in addition to a fifth one. The first list of commodities, on which we have agreed, concerns Arab products that will be procured by the occupied territories, particularly products coming from Egypt and Jordan. With regard to this list, it is the Palestinian authority that will make all customs and import policies regarding this list of commodities. Furthermore, it is the agency that will decide on the proper customs tariffs and fees in complete independence. There is another list called A2. This is also a completely independent list of commodities including the commodities that will be imported from Arab and Islamic states. It is the first time Islamic states are being dealt with. It is the Palestinian authority that will determine the policies and customs tariffs and fees regarding this list of commodities in total freedom. The third list concerns international aid, in development requirements, humanitarian aid, or construction equipment, etc. Once again, it is the Palestinian authority alone that will, by itself, decide on the customs fees of this list of commodities, the rates of these fees, and how these commodities enter the territories. This authority will make the overall policy regarding this list of commodities. [Tarabayh] How is the Israeli authority then involved in this? [Quray'] These lists are a Palestinian decision. The fourth list, which we called List B, is a very big one. The Palestinian authority decides all fees, custom tariffs, purchase tax, and others. However, imports, licenses, standards, and measurements will follow a joint policy. Luxury goods will also be subjected to joint tariffs and duties. This customs system, or customs wall, which was standing like steel around the occupied territory, has been shaken and the Palestinians emerged from it with a small customs book, which will undoubtedly grow and get bigger. For the sake of truth, it should be said that we were joined with brothers from Jordan on a very high level of knowledge, experience, expertise, and responsibility. They came from the high levels of power. They were with us for one and one-half months or more. We cooperated with each other, reached understanding, and discussed the overall proposed topics on a daily basis. We were also in constant and almost daily contact with our brothers in Egypt and a large number of experts and officials. We discussed things and exchanged views with them because we need expertise and experience in such matters. [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-'Ala', there are many points in the agreement, particularly on tourism, agriculture, industry, energy, insurance, and so forth. In you opinion and without delving into the details of these points, what was the most prominent Palestinian accomplishment among these sectors? [Quray'] I can say all these sectors. However, if I speak or someone addresses me on the basis of complete 100 percent independence, I will tell him no. I do not want to exaggerate or downplay the importance of what happened. What happened is something important. It is a seed, as I have said, to build a Palestinian entity, a Palestinian authority, an independent Palestinian state, but it is not complete. Had this been independence, I would not have negotiated anything with the Israelis. But I negotiated because it is a transitional phase. In all the mentioned sectors, we took the main seeds that prepare for the establishment of the independent institution. Industry is now our decision and the standards we decide will be the ones which will govern the industrial process. We are the ones who license industry and run its products. Accordingly, there is an independent Palestinian economic decision in the process of developing the industrial sector. The same applies to agriculture. There was a totally closed market in favor of the Israeli products. Only Israel had access to the Palestinian market without allowing the Palestinian products to enter the Israeli market. This new agreement opens the Israeli market for the first time to Palestinian agricultural products. The market has become open to both sides. Experience proves that Palestinian agricultural products are competitive. The simple Palestinian peasant managed to prove his very high competitive efficiency and capability in terms of quality and price. Now the Israeli market is open for him and competition is also open for him. I have great confidence that this Palestinian farmer will triumph in the process of competition. What we should not ignore, and what all our brothers the economists and others should know, is that they must exactly know the suffering and problems of all people, peasants, farmers, or workers before passing judgment. [Tarabayh] What about tourism in the transitional phase? [Quray'] A tourism authority has also been established. It enjoys all jurisdictions enjoyed by any ministry or tourism institution in any independent state. It is true that the jurisdiction of this tourism authority will come gradually, as stated in the Declaration of Principles. It will begin in Gaza and Jericho and then extend to the rest of the West Bank. This authority will be in charge of licensing the tourism institutions and guides and defining the historical, cultural, and religious sites. It can send its tourist buses to Israel or abroad and receive buses from the opposite direction. It can strike contracts with the tourism delegations. [Tarabayh] Have tourism relations with Israel been defined? [Quray'] They have not yet taken detailed form, but in general there is an exchange of tourists between us. The tourist who comes to them can come to areas of the Palestinian authority and vice versa. [Tarabayh] What about the tourism development projects in Gaza and the Gaza beaches, for example? [Quray'] This is a Palestinian decision by the Palestinian authority. Israel has not played any role in this and such cases have not even been discussed. Issues of joint work have not been discussed whether in the tourism or other sectors. We are in the stage of charting the framework laws, regulations, and bases of the Palestinian economic work and its organization. [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-al-'Ala', when we interviewed you a month ago, the issue of the Palestinian manpower was one of the strongest issues on the agenda. In particular, there were statements by Israeli officials calling for replacing the Palestinian workers by foreign workers, particularly Asian workers. What was decided on this issue? [Quray'] In fact, they wanted, and this is no longer a secret, to exploit this issue as a blackmail card. They use it from time to time. I do not mean during the negotiations, but in general. I mean when an operation is carried out, there will be collective and comprehensive punishment, and 70,000 or 100,000 workers are blocked. This is a collective punishment. It was used. Even at the negotiations, there was an attempt to use the workers issue as a blackmail card. We have refused to submit to this blackmail. Concerning the workers paper, we were interested in the following issues: First, there must be ordinary and normal movement of workers. At the beginning, we sought for this to be a free movement. They said we control the size of this manpower. We said that we also control its size. So, the process has become a mutual one. I mean that if they have the right to determine this from time to time, we also should have the right to decide on this from time to time. This is one issue. Another issue is that we were very concerned that since we seek to organize future labor relations, then all workers' rights must be the responsibility of the Palestinian authority, and that we should establish the necessary funds of social security and insurance to guarantee the workers' rights. This was met with positive response. The basic and important issue, which took a large part of the discussion and dialogue, is that we were very concerned about the fact that since this agreement regulates future relations, then it must not be unfair to or undermine acquired rights. Consequently, in this agreement, we have stressed that it regulates future relations, but it does not close the file on any issue related to the acquired rights of workers. On the contrary, it opens this file at the appropriate time. It has also confirmed that there are acquired rights. [Tarabayh] This means that it guarantees the rights of the Palestinian manpower in Israel as they were before autonomy. Brother Abu-al-'Ala', finally, there is a question posing itself: Is there any contradiction between your economic agreement with Israel and that of the economic agreement with Jordan? [Quray'] In order to be accurate, I would like to say that our main relationship is with the Arabs in general, and with Jordan and Egypt in particular. This is our natural relationship, which can be relationship of cooperation, brotherhood, unity, solidarity, integration. This is the relationship which has a strategic depth. Our relationship with Israel can be a relationship of cooperation or relationship which may or may not involve joint interests. However, with the Arab side, this relationship must be based on brotherhood, unity, and integration, etc. The nature of the interim period does not give the Palestinian side one hundred percent freedom to organize this relationship as we really want it to be. Our brothers in Jordan and Egypt understand this very accurately. This is why we say that they have contributed to forming the results of these negotiations. [Tarabayh] For example, what about banking relations with Jordan? [Quray'] The truth is that our relations go beyond this. This issue has its own philosophy in order to be able to cross from the interim period into a situation whose features we draw, and whose results are not imposed on us. This relationship with Jordan includes everything. It includes money, economy, trade, borders, customs, security, etc. This is especially true, taking into consideration that half of the Palestinians, or less, live in Jordan, as well as the nature of the fraternal, historical, and social relations. This issue cannot be evaded or ignored. In the matter of the banks, there is no doubt there will be a relationship. We have now taken from the Israelis the Palestinian monetary authority -- banks, licensing, and so on. We must be liberal and indulgent with our brothers in Jordan, more than anything else in the interest of building Palestinian institutions, availing ourselves of Jordanian expertise, and organizing the operation, performance, and monitoring of the banks during the interim stage, or for a duration to be agreed upon. The agreement reached with Jordan addressed these points and the commercial and economic links, in addition to the banking system and the movement of money. [Tarabayh] My last question, brother Abu-al-'Ala'. What is your reaction to a remark made by Israel's Finance Minister Avraham Shohat following the signing of the agreement. He said the agreement should make it possible for the Palestinian and Israeli people to start and share a new life. [Quray'] Let me put it like this: The agreement shifts the Palestinians from a state of dependency to one of a free decision whether to extend or withhold cooperation. We should also be able to determine the shape of that cooperation. As I have said at the beginning, we were in a state of total dependency where the Palestinians had no say. Now, they have a say; there is a transition period that calls for some measure of cooperation on a number of issues. We have now moved from a state of dependency where the Palestinians had no say to a certain form of cooperation necessitated by the nature of the transition period. The Palestinians will make their own decisions. [Tarabayh] Thank you Abu-al-'Ala', Mr. Ahmad Quray', the PLO's Economic Department chief. One last word about the self-rule agreement, expected to be signed next Wednesday [4 May] in Cairo? [Quray'] I think that, barring unforeseen, last-minute snags, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will be signed in Cairo and then the Declaration of Principles agreement launched on the ground. When that happens, I think the agreement itself will be seen in a better light, and, at the same time, it will advance Palestinian interests. If the agreement is not put into practice it will be seen in a bad light and set back Palestinian interests. We, therefore, should, from the beginning, be keen to render the agreement a success. [Tarabayh] Thank you, brother Abu-al-'Ala'. [Quray'] Thank you.
