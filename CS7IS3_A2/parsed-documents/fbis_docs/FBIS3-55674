Juri Pihl, the director general of the Defense Police Department, added that Estonia still needed "to keep an eye on such people." He said this was necessary despite the fact that the country's authorities knew of nothing Rozhok or his fellow Russian Liberal Democratic Party supporters had done against Estonia's national interests. Rozhok a few days earlier told the press a branch of Zhirinovsky's party existed in Estonia. Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama has called the party's alleged activity in Estonia illegal, because the branch organization has not been formally registered with the country's authorities. Kama said the activity of the Zhirinosky group in Estonia should be investigated by the defense police. Also President Lennart Meri in a speech recently said the country's security police had to pay attention to the activity of "some foreign political parties in Estonia." Rozhok, a resident of the northeastern town of Narva, claims his telephone is being tapped, but says he has had no direct contacts with Estonian defense police officials so far.
