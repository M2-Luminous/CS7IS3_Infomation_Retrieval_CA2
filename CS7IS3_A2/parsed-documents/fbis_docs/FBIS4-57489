The fatherland today calls for an awakening in all diverted and manipulated consciences, invites them to save our ancestors' legacy. Yes, the legacy is a heavy one; nevertheless, we must find the strength to bear it together. On this 18 May 1994, I am saying to you, here, the same thing I said in Arcahaie 44 years ago on behalf of the Senate of the Republic. Let us again take this day to pass to one another the torch of unity. Let us forget our resentments, hatreds, and quarrels, sources of deep bruises for the nation, so as to examine our motto: In Unity Lies Strength. On this 18 May 1994 here we are, again, at a watershed in our history, when the unity of this people is as urgent a need as it was on the day of our independence, so that we can compel recognition as a nation. My dear fellow citizens: Already nearly 200 years ago, rallied behind the flag, on behalf of peace and the universal rights of citizens, we fought the decisive battle for freedom, thereby responding to the cries of despair and sufferings of millions of men and women remaining in the enemy's chains. Let us unite. The symbol of a rallying and of solidarity among the population, our bi-colored flag still highlights the proud epic of our ancestors. I want this anniversary to be used to reconcile Haitians among themselves, as brothers from the same nation. The anguished fatherland today has the right to solemnly demand the help of its children. It does not wish to believe that its own sons could exacerbate even further the wounds of its distress. [As an] achievement of our people's pride, although our flag is rent asunder, let us recover the shreds, so that we can again hoist our bi-colored flag before the world. Let us together protect its honor. In Unity Lies Strength. Hail Haiti! Thank you.
