[Begin Eugene recording] ...is that all those sections were enclosed in a big accounting department. Well, there are a number of irregularities that they [not further identified] will be unable to discover because the accountant was both the person in charge of spending the money and the bursar. I must tell you that a partial audit led us to realize that from May to December there were at least four persons -- including two who have died and two others who were dismissed -- for whom paychecks continued to be written. We are just now setting things in order. We do not intend to harm anybody. We do not intend to dismiss anybody but we are setting things in order, even if it does mean that in the near future we will (?have to) convert some employees, by putting them in the right place.
