In the course of cordial and open talks the president of Serbia and the Italian foreign minister exchanged views on questions of interest for the further successful development of bilateral relations and cooperation, as well as those of significance for the resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, and peace and security in the region, reads a statement issued by President Milosevic's office. Foreign Minister Martino expressed the readiness and desire of the Italian Government to become involved in activities aimed at overcoming the crisis in the region. Italy is interested in a stable development of cooperation and good-neighborly relations with the FRY, with particular emphasis on the interest both countries have in strengthening economic links. It is a fact that the economic sanctions against the FRY delayed realization of many joint projects, which has harmed not only the economies of Serbia and the FRY, but also of a number of other countries with which Serbia and the FRY are linked and interdependent on, to a high degree. Economic sanctions are an obstacle imposed on free exchange of goods, circulation of people and ideas, their free exchange and communication, and for this reason they have to be lifted as soon as possible as unreasonable and discriminatory measures that affect the interests of several countries, the statement notes. The peace process and activities aimed at ending the war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed in particular. It was stated that the international community undoubtedly has the responsibility and an obligation to use its influence in a determined manner with the aim of having the Muslim side end armed provocations and threats, and to finally give up aspirations to achieve its goals by war. In the interest of peace the international community has high responsibility for presenting an overall plan which would not be based on an one-sided approach and favoring the interests of one side in the conflict at the expense of the other, but on the principles of equality, equal protection of their vital interests and an unbiased treatment. In keeping with this, Serbia believes that the principle of equality -- which has to be respected -- also implies the lifting of the economic sanctions. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also attended the talks.
