We are waiting for a telephone call from one of our correspondents. Is he on the telephone? Is he ready? Here is Juan Carlos Santoyo, who is the ACIR group correspondent in San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas. We are going to put him on the air. Are we on the air? We are listening to your report, as it seems to be very important. [Santoyo] That's right, Mr. Calderon. After days of waiting, today we can see a breakthrough in communications between the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] and Manuel Camacho Solis, special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. A few minutes ago, Camacho Solis hosted a news...[pauses] He is now holding a news conference. He is reporting that the first formal, official contact was established with EZLN leaders. He received a communication directly from Deputy Commander Marcos. Mr. Calderon, I am going to play an excerpt of that news conference during which this major announcement was made. It constitutes another step toward peace and reconciliation in this state. [Calderon] You are going to broadcast an excerpt of the news conference. [Begin recording] [Camacho] I will be very brief [four- second break in reception] I want to tell you that I have already received an official message from the EZLN signed by Deputy Commander Marcos. I am going to Mexico City to brief the president, other members of the government, and those who should be informed of the communique. We will have a formal reply for the EZLN tomorrow at 1100 [1700 GMT]. Things are on the right track. The decision to initiate a cease-fire and -- above all -- the decision to request the Permanent Committee of the National Congress to convoke a extraordinary period of sessions so the executive can submit a general amnesty bill are yielding results. The path of harmony and conciliation is the right path, as the facts are proving. [end recording] [Santoyo] Mr. Calderon, this is very important information because this is the first contact between the EZLN and the commissioner for peace and reconciliation. Basically, we were told the points to be negotiated are those contained in the first communique the EZLN issued on 6 January. Those points include the demand for the definitive withdrawal of Mexican Army troops from the zone and the withdrawal of many troops to their garrisons. The cease-fire was also mentioned. They also demanded a process of true reconstruction in Chiapas. As you heard, the commissioner for peace and reconciliation will have an answer tomorrow at 1100. [Calderon] What time did Mr. Camacho give the news conference in San Cristobal de las Casas? [Santoyo] At exactly 1135 [1735 GMT]. We left for a while to broadcast this first good news.
