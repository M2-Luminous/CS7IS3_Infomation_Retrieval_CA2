[Menem] I do not know what image of myself or my government may exist in Spain, but I believe that Argentina has become a center of attraction internationally. It is one of the countries with the highest growth rates in the world, in third place after China and Thailand, and, with respect to the Western world, one of the most developed of the past few years. Investments are still coming in, and there is a very good level of wages. The highest wages in the Americas (if we leave out the United States) are paid in the Argentine Republic. Poverty has fallen spectacularly, to such an extent that from 30 percent structural poverty in 1989 we are now at 12 percent. And marginal poverty, which is hardship, has fallen from 10 percent in 1989, when I took office, to 2 percent at present. Stability persists, and inflation, if we measure it from January of last year to January 1994, does not exceed 6.5 percent. According to the budget forecasts, inflation will not exceed 4.5 percent this year. There is peace; there is calm. I do not know what image people in Spain may have of Argentina and my government, and whether this is due to the dishonesty of some section of my country's news media, which may have influenced Spain, but the impression which we have is that Argentina's image in the world is excellent. Personal Image [Olmo] Do you believe that there is some anti-Menemist lobby in Spain which obstructs Spanish-Argentine relations? [Menem] I have no knowledge of this, but it could be so. If we are speaking of anti-Menemism, we would have to speak of anti-Argenitinism. This government represents Argentina, is the government elected by the people, and I can see no reason why this kind of situation should exist. It may exist, but this does not harm in the slightest the image of Argentina or its government -- one of the most progressive in the world. [passage omitted] [Olmo] Is there subversion in Argentina? Could another Chiapas happen here? [Menem] There is no subversion in Argentina. Some kind of tinge of subversion has occurred -- the case of Santiago del Estero -- but measures have been adopted and this is under investigation. But there is no subversion in the Argentine Republic; it does not exist, and it is absolutely impossible for what happened in Chiapas to happen here. The Mexican Government itself has acknowledged the extreme poverty in which those communities in Chiapas are living, but, moreover, there is an ethnic problem and a religious problem there; something that is not the case in Argentina. There is no possibility of subversion here. What happened in Santiago del Estero was caused by some kind of infiltration, and this explains the remarks of Daniel Ortega -- the Sandinist leader -- in Cuba a few days ago, in which he justified armed struggle and gave Chiapas and Santiago del Estero as examples. What happened in Santiago del Estero was facilitated by the terrible political administration. The province's leaders were not paying wages, or those of the highest ranking officials were increased unduly, leaving those of the other public employees very low. But the situation has now been completely restored to normal, and if you look at a scale of the wages earned by Argentine teachers, you will be able to ascertain that those of Santiago del Estero are now the highest in the country. [Olmo] Why is nothing as yet known of the alleged activists who caused the incidents in Santiago del Estero? [Menem] This is being investigated, and Daniel Ortega's statements exempt me from making any comment. If Daniel Ortega gives Santiago del Estero as an example, it is because there were people there who were brought in by these elements; death traffickers, because subversion is death trafficking. What they cannot achieve within the framework of democracy they are trying to impose by force. You cannot justify armed struggle like that for no particular reason. Clearly, there were people of this kind, infiltrated into the uprising, in Chiapas, too. Conflict with Chile [Olmo] Chilean flags have been burned in Argentina and Argentine flags in Chile. The cause is the territorial dispute over Laguna del Desierto. Will this tension between the two countries ever cease? [Menem] This matter of the Chilean flags burned in Argentina was a result of some trade union leaders' irrationality and uncouthness, but in any event those same leaders later expressed their regret at what happened with an apology to the Chilean people. We deem this matter closed. We regard the burning of the Argentine flags as an act of retaliation for what happened here. The burning of neither flag is justified in any way. We have resolved 22 out of the 24 border problems which we had with Chile through our doing -- President Aylwin's and my own. The border problem of Laguna del Desierto is under international arbitration, and we are quite confident that the court's ruling will favor Argentina's aim that matters should remain as they have stood since the 1902 treaty. It is Argentine territory, occupied by Argentinians, and recognized as such by Chile until 1958, when it adopted another stance. [passage omitted]
