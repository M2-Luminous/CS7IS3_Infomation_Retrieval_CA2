[Oleksy] As the press is sure to know, the president said in public that he would never again set foot in the Sejm. So I asked him for an audience on the eve of his move to his new residence, and our conversation actually took place in the new premises at the Namiestnikowski Palace. It lasted for an hour and a half, was most interesting and useful, and ended with a modest supper. However, I will not criticize the president's catering because I have heard that Lech Walesa is trying very hard to lose weight. [Lesniak] Never mind the food. Could we discuss the more important aspects of your discussion? [Oleksy] Among other things, we talked about the latest conflict between the Sejm and the president, the question of the candidate to the office of deputy prime minister, the recently approved state budget (as we know, the legislative process is not complete until sealed by the president's signature), the excitement in the police force generated by the Poznan affair (and by other things, too), the armed forces' role in the state security system, and the preparation of the president's legislative initiatives. The conversation would not have been complete without some gossip, but all details of that will remain with the interlocutors.... [Lesniak] Did the president like the budget? [Oleksy] Neither the president nor I is pleased with this year's budget.... [Lesniak] So why did you vote for it, along with the rest of the coalition? [Oleksy] Before I explain that point, let met assure you that I know perfectly well that old age and disability pensions are so low as to fall before subsistence levels, that the health service is deeply in the red, that education and science are underinvested, and that the police and the military are in drastic need of funds. Nor am I too blind to notice the high prices of, say, medicinal drugs, or services in the public sector. I know how much it costs to educate our children, and I know the social effects of unemployment, the curtailment of unemployment benefit, and reductions in the extent of social services available to the needy. I know the vast sizes of the sums needed by enterprises to break the vicious circle of debt liabilities and climbing out of the recession trough. Of course, when viewed from such a perspective, this year's budget cannot even hope to solve all of these problems because it is simply not in its power to do so, and we cannot hope for miracles. In that context, I am unhappy with the budget, just as the president is unhappy. However, this very same, much maligned budget is a good step in the direction of positive changes aimed at a a policy that will be oriented more toward social concerns. It brings with it a chance of galvanizing economic prospects and gives rise to the effective promotion of exports. [Lesniak] Nevertheless, voters, including the left-oriented electorate, demonstrate their considerable disappointment with the budget.... [Oleksy] Individuals are not obliged to think in terms of state interests, history, or macroscale policies. Indeed, it is difficult to talk about any noticeable improvement in the situation of particular families. But--so help me--it is really most unfair to tear the government to pieces after it has been in office for only four months! Let me point out to all those eager fault-finders that we still guarantee the upgrading of old age and disability pensions and wages in the public sector. Will even that upgrading be enough to satisfy those interested? Of course not! And let me put it to you bluntly: A lot of water will have to pass under the bridge before we come to enjoy universal prosperity and adequate social welfare in Poland. [Lesniak] But there were so many promises made during the election campaign.... [Oleksy] It is true that I often hear people say: "You promised, but there is no improvement." However, these grudges are not directed specifically at any concrete target. They are not followed by the second necessary element of the argument--the identification of an agency that would meet these public expectations more quickly and more efficiently. In any case, we are talking of Utopian visions here. It is certain that not all people in Poland will find their circumstances improving, and that is why the coalition must first and foremost protect the weakest. I am convinced that the majority of Poles do not expect to live the dolce vita from tomorrow onward; that they understand the restricting nature of the curb bit that is necessary if the country is to be led to development. [Lesniak] So what are Solidarity's demands? [Oleksy] I find the strikes imposed by Solidarity incomprehensible; furthermore, they do severe damage to the major branches of the economy as they impair the already weak tissue of economic life. Union activists call for a revision of the legally and democratically approved budget, unheard-of behavior in all civilized countries, but they fail to point out where the money is to be found, which section we should take it away from in order to give it to someone else. Nevertheless, I believe that the will to talk will prevail over the desire for political confrontation. The government, which had not concentrated much on the budget before, is now getting its second wind and setting briskly to work. Many program blueprints are already complete--for example, for combating unemployment, reforming the social insurance system, and extending wider protection to the weaker members of the public, who are particularly at risk from unbridled market forces. [Lesniak] We hear rumors that family benefits will be taken away from people.... [Oleksy] They will not be taken away; they will be rationalized. Within the family benefit scheme, 20 trillion zlotys [Z] [per month] go to 10 million families. In global terms, this is a large sum of money, but, at the individual family level, it works out to a mere Z167,000 per child per month. In better-off families, such a sum makes no practical difference in the monthly budget. So perhaps it would be better to raise the benefit to Z500,000 or Z600,000 per child, but then allocate it to only the most needy--for example, to the 3 million large families? The budget outgoings would remain the same, but the social gain would be greater. The more affluent will probably never even notice the loss of Z167,000, while the poorer families will receive more significant amounts of money with which to boost the family budget. Even so, I can already hear protesters shouting about unequal rights, just as I expect to hear them if and when we decide to change the real estate tax. It would be calculated on the basis of the value of the property rather than on its area, as is done now. At present, we pay the same tax on a palace as on a dilapidated slum. [Lesniak] What danger areas should we fear most? [Oleksy] First of all, the two major financial traps: structural--that is, lasting--balance-of-payments deficit (at present, imports outweigh exports to the tune of $2 billion), and uncontrollable growth of domestic debt. In 1989, this amounted to Z2.5 trillion; today it stands at Z83 trillion, which is exactly the amount of this year's budget deficit. There are many reasons for this state of affairs, and I do not intend to point a finger at culprits because some reasons would appear to be objective. However, I do try to point out to people that Pawlak's government has very little room for maneuver, as does the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party. [Lesniak] Let us now return to the first question, concerning your visit to the Namiestnikowski Palace. What were your impressions of the place in terms of so-called esthetic values? [Oleksy] To tell you the truth, I do not like the president's new residence. I do not envy him. I would not want to either live or work there.... [Lesniak] Thank you for talking with us.
