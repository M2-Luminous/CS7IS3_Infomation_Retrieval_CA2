Australian negotiators are arguing that increased demand in other markets for their iron ore should have an effect on prices, while Japanese buyers say that a continued downturn in sales in 1994 will result in further "substantial" price cuts, the source said. "We see that for 1994 the iron ore market is at worst evenly balanced" between supply and demand, an industry source said. "The Japanese believe that the market is soft. They're allowing their own difficult circumstances to color that perception," he said. Contending with continued financial difficulties, the Japanese steel mills still set the prices, buying some 50 million metric tons of iron ore from Australia each year. Last year they won a 10 percent drop in prices. But Australian negotiators believe that China's place in the market must now be considered. The Australians believe that China will take up the iron ore that the Japanese do not want, leading them to believe that there is no room for a price decrease. China is expected to increase its annual purchase of iron ore from 28 million tons last year to approximately 34 million tons in 1994. Australian negotiators believe that the tight supply-demand balance in the rest of the world could even justify a slight increase in prices. Meanwhile, they are interpreting their Japanese counterparts' description of a "substantial" cut to mean a 10 percent drop. Australian negotiators are prepared to factor in Japan's economic difficulties but are refusing to consider any modification while Japan insists on "substantial" cuts, the source said. "So, the way forward would be for us to form a common view of the market," the source said. Negotiations will resume at the end of the month.
