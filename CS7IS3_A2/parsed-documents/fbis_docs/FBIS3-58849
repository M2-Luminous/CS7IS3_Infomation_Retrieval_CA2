This is the result of an opinion poll conducted by a Mannheim-based research group for the ZDF television network's "Political Barometer." If elections were held now, the CDU/CSU would gain 36 percent of the votes --this is 1 percent less than last December. The SPD still holds at 39 percent and the Free Democratic Party of Germany at 6 percent, while the Greens/Alliance 90 are supported by 10 percent, the Republikaner by 4 percent, and the Party of Democratic Socialism by 3 percent of the voters. Scharping, the SPD candidate for chancellor, has the approval of 52 percent of the voters, while Chancellor Kohl's (CDU) rate of approval is at 34 percent. The research group conducting the poll considers the main reason for this trend to be a shift in competence regarding economic issues. Thus, 39 percent of those polled are confident that the SPD could solve the problems in eastern Germany -- this is 7 percent more than six months ago, while only 24 percent consider the government able to do so -- 4 percent down on last July. Only 30 percent think the present government is able to solve the economic problems in the west (minus 6 percent); 41 percent consider the SPD competent (plus 8 percent).
