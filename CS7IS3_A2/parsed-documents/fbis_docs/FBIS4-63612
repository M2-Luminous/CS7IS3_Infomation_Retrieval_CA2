Speaking on Russian television on Monday, Zhirinovskiy said Russia's Choice and the Yabloko Bloc received money from foreign organisations, claiming that he had obtained this information from a report of the Central Electoral Commission. Zhirinovskiy also denied allegations by political analyst Nikolay Svanidze that he had allegedly paid the members of his party faction in the State Duma 500 U.S. dollars each to support the federal budget. "None of the members of our faction has ever received any payment and never will," Zhirinovskiy said. Svanidze did not provide any proof. Zhirinovskiy said his Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is "the most honest" party and members of its faction in the State Duma "the cheapest" deputies, because they cost the state less than any other party in the election campaign. Representatives of Russia's Choice and the Yabloko Bloc were not immediately available to make explanations.
