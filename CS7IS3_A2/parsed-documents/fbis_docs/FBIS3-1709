Nguyen Xuan Phong, acting director of American affairs in the Foreign Ministry of Vietnam and head of the Vietnamese delegation, told reporters that the U.S. Government should make a comprehensive account of former South Vietnam Government properties which were frozen by the U.S. after 1975. The U.S. delegation is headed by James Hall of the East Asia and Pacific Affairs Bureau of the U.S. State Department. The Vietnamese Government estimates the worth of the frozen properties of former South Vietnam at around 250 million U.S. dollars. The U.S. attorney general has received 192 requests from U.S. companies and individuals asking the government to seek compensation of around 230 million dollars from Vietnam. The two sides will also work out a detailed schedule for setting up liaison offices in each other's capital, as agreed upon following the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against Vietnam in early February.
