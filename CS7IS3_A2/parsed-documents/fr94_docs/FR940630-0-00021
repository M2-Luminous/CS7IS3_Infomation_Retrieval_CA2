FR940630-0-00021 FR940630-0-00008 Background on Subsidy for Nondwelling Uses On September 6, 1991, the Department published a proposed rule that would have established new conditions under which a PHA or an IHA could have included vacant units in its computation of eligibility for operating subsidy. The comment period for this proposed rule was reopened on June 22, 1992 (57 FR 27716). Ultimately, as a result of congressional action, the proposed rule was not pursued to a final rule. See, Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved October 29, 1991; 106 Stat. 757), and section 114(b) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992; 106 Stat. 3691). A number of the provisions contained in the proposed rule were opposed by commenters. However, the aspect of the proposed rule that would permit the payment of operating subsidy, under certain conditions, for units approved for nondwelling use for economic self-sufficiency and anti-drug activities was not controversial. The comments received on this aspect generally supported the proposed rule, but urged the Department to adopt an even more generous treatment of nondwelling space in the calculation of operating subsidy eligibility. However, in this final rule the Department is adopting only the provisions that appeared in the proposed rule, and only to the extent that those provisions reflect the existing practice. The Department is clarifying in §§905.720(b)(2) and 990.198(b)(2) that an IHA or PHA need demonstrate only that non-utility operating costs are not available from other funding. This conforms to existing practice. Currently, the Department is permitting PHAs and IHAs to continue receiving operating subsidy for units that are no longer available for occupancy because they have been removed from the rent roll and approved for economic self-sufficiency and anti-drug activities. Under Notice PIH 90&hyph;39 (PHA) (issued August 24, 1990), a PHA or an IHA may request a waiver to allow consideration of such units in its calculation of operating subsidy eligibility. Therefore, the effect of the revisions to §§905.720 and 990.108(b) in this final rule is not to change current treatment of these units in the calculation of operating subsidy eligibility, but merely to reduce the administrative burdens of all parties involved in the waiver process. This Rule The existing regulation on shared utility rate savings provides an incentive to HAs to implement utilities conservation programs, particularly rate-savings programs like wellhead purchase, when calculating eligibility for operating subsidy under the Performance Funding System, but limits the effect of that incentive to one year. This revision to the regulation does not change the mechanism for granting the incentive, but extends the authorization for the shared savings arrangement up to an additional six years. HUD will continue to require that the HA be able to demonstrate in each annual budget that there are real rate reduction savings in each of the years for which the extended incentive applies. In addition, the revisions in this rule will eliminate the need to seek a waiver to permit the payment of operating subsidy for certain units approved for nondwelling use for economic self-sufficiency and anti-drug activities. To achieve the regulatory goals discussed above, this rule amends 24 CFR 905.715(b)(2), 905.720(b), 905.730(c), 990.107(b)(2), 990.108(b), and 990.110(c)(1)(i). Other Matters Justification for Final Rule The Department has determined that notice and public comment are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest before making this rule effective because it is an extension of an ongoing policy which rewards a HA for its action to secure a reduction in utility rates. Information Collection Requirements The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520).
