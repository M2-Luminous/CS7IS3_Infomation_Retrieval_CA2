That classical statement also applies to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy even before he has reached the zenith of his political career. Why has he, more than any other politician in the second half of the 20th century, come under such heavy fire from the international media? De Gaulle was right: "The Germans are poor bastards. Their backbone has been broken." A great part of our population has lost the ability to recognize German interests as a result of systematic indoctrination. The reeducation conducted by the victors of World War II and their helpers has wiped out the capacity for logical political thought in many Germans. Of course, it has always been a peculiar trait of the German mind to show exceptional understanding for the interests of others while disregarding one's own. That any other nation should display similar inclinations is scarcely conceivable. The Role of the West At the end of World War II, the Western powers believed that "the German question" had been solved. Churchill's ideas about the establishment of a northern German state and a southern German state including Bavaria and Austria were not given a chance at all. The dismemberment of the country into four zones of occupation and a fifth Polish occupation zone seemed to be our fate. The Cold War prompted Washington to force through the establishment of two zones initially and then three zones despite considerable resistance from Paris. Even Saarland, which was considered war booty, escaped France's grasp under the minor reunification. In the treaty on Germany, the three Western victors -- in the case of Britain and France, the price of "victory" was the loss of their empires -- undertook to support German unity with a light heart. U.S. policy proceeded from the assumption that the unification of western and central Germany would in any case never come about. Only a few far-sighted people such as the U.S. ambassador in Bonn, General Walters, foresaw that the GDR and Federal Republic would be united and even welcomed that. For Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterrand, reunification was the worse possible evil. The two of them did all they could within their weak power to prevent the unification of western and central Germany, and did so in vain. Great Britain and France had exhausted their roles as great powers. Nevertheless, Mitterrand and Thatcher -- those "true friends" of the Federal Republic -- were able to force through the sanctioning of the Oder Neisse Line -- in other words, the crimes against humanity of genocide and mass expulsion that occurred in a quarter of Germany -- as part of the negotiating package at the time. The Fettering of the German Giant Today, the FRG is by far the greatest power in Central and West Europe. All French and British political skills are directed toward -- to use Thatcher's language -- "chaining down Gulliver." This calculation assumes that the number one factor to the east of Germany, that is, Russia, will go back to a policy of opposition with regard to Bonn or Berlin, or will at least go along with game of "fettering the German giant" (Thatcher). However, if Moscow were to respect German interests in Central Europe and adopt a favorable or even friendly stance toward Germany, then Paris' and London's game of intrigue, designed to establish something of a large protectorate in the heart of Europe, would be doomed to fail. Political friendship between peoples and states can by all means be cultivated with a view to being long-lasting or even "eternal." This kind of partnership endures all the more if one does not interfere in the domestic affairs of one's partner and in general concentrates on achieving a balance in those areas where there are joint interests. Relations between Russia and Kazakhstan will never be Berlin's business and neither do social and other circumstances in Russia concern us. Europe's monarchs, especially those of Great Britain, Germany, and Russia, were related in many ways, including marriage. They nevertheless slid into World War I, which became an inferno for all. On the other hand, when, at the end of the Seven Years' War, which Prussia seemed to have lost, Catherine II's Russia went over to supporting Prussia, Frederick the Great did not call on his savior to abolish serfdom in the greatest empire in the world. Let us consider another case: Imperial Foreign Minister Rathenau could certainly not have been suspected of being favorably disposed toward the Soviet Union when in 1922 he, along with the imperial chancellor at the time, Rath, made Rapallo possible, which meant that Germany no longer had its back against the wall. Russia's Key Role Germany had the good fortune of being represented in St. Petersburg by particularly competent diplomats at key periods, namely, by Bismarck under the Czars, Schulenburg under Stalin, and Kroll under Khruschev. The establishment of the 1871 German Empire was only possible because the tsar was favorably disposed toward Bismarck and Germany and maintained benevolent neutrality. Europe could still have been a French colony today if Russia had not liberated us from Napoleon's yoke of terror. Murderous World War II seemed to make any kind of sensible association between Germany and Russia impossible. However, present-day historical research confirms the views of the pioneering Prof. Diwald, who maintained that Stalin's policies were directed toward a single Germany and those of the Western powers toward its division. The rejection of Stalin's note on Germany in 1952 by Adenauer, who refused any kind of closer consideration of the issue let alone negotiations, prevented the unification of western and central Germany a decade after World War II in every possible way. The big question was when would the Soviet Union or Russia be led by politicians whose policies would see German unity as being compatible with Moscow's interests. The security service chief Beria, who was despicable in every other respect, is supposed to have pursued such ideas before he was killed. Malenkov was considered to have been an advocate of a pro-German policy, but he left the inner circles of power. With Gorbachev, the course of history began to shift in the Bismarckian sense and Kohl made use that in 1990, at the end of which Gorbachev had to step down. The fact that today, as at one time in the past, Russian policy -- and this practically applies to all parties -- involves defending Serbia's interests, whereas German policy, now as in the past, is geared toward Slovenia and Croatia does not have to be a misfortune if it results in possible and necessary compromises. No side has the right to dominate the other or even to tell it what to do. In the Duma, among all the Russian parties, including the communists, the postwar prejudices against Germany are being eroded. When Zhirinovskiy, the leader of what is by far the strongest Russian party, propagates a solution to the East Prussia question that favors Germany, he is paving the way to a return to old German-Russian friendship, which was a blessing for our two nations for hundreds of years. Bonn politicians invoke Lithuanian, Polish, and French "interests in East Prussia." In doing so, they call to mind the unfortunate "all Germany" Minister Wilms, who, shortly before reunification, demanded that the GDR should only be united with the Federal Republic when, in addition to the four victorious powers, all our neighbors without exception express their agreement. Zhirinovskiy's plan for Germany, which has been put down in writing -- including the famous lines that were drawn on the map belonging to the diplomat Rolf Gauffin, who was himself an ambassador in Moscow at one time -- envisages a completely peaceful revision of the Oder Neisse Line achieved through negotiations. Eastern Pomerania, West and East Prussia, and Silesia should be returned to Germany, while Poland would receive a corridor to the Baltic between Danzig and Koenigsberg as well as a large area around Lemberg, which lies outside its borders today. The Revision of Oder Neisse Line The German eastern territories have really been no blessing for Warsaw. Zhirinovskiy's plan for Germany is a new version of the old, traditional pro-German policy in Moscow or St. Petersburg. It must be recognized as a fact that generally arguments between Russian politicians are accompanied by violent exchanges of words that tend to get out of control, exchanges that are more reminiscent of clashes with sabers than fencing with foils, and by the same token it must also be recognized that what is "cultivated" on all sides in Bonn is a political jargon that is completely incomprehensible to the people. In keeping with Lenin's words that "trust is good, but control is better," no sensible person is going to entertain illusions that paradise will be established in Europe in the near future. A quick look at Sarajevo shows how serious the situation is. This makes the constant reductions in the size and weaponry of the Bundeswehr, especially the splitting up of the Bundeswehr and placing it under foreign command, all the more incomprehensible. We do need a strong Army under German command, but we will no longer tolerate the presence of foreign troops in Germany. NATO's sole task increasingly appears to be that of depriving Germany of its rights. There might be circles in the "Western honorable society" who want to make a bogey man or monster out of Zhirinovskiy, for example to give a boost to the defense industry, to create a new potential enemy, and bring about a return to the Cold War, which will see an even deeper gulf separating use from our old friend Russia. There can scarcely be another explanation for such a degree of rabble- rousing propaganda and condemnation, one that is based on stupefying the masses, for which Stalinism is supposed to be the same thing as communism, which is in turn the same thing as Russia. However, German interests require categorically that a serious effort be repeatedly made in the East and the West to make it clear to politicians that the fundamental interests of our people are completely compatible with their own interests.
