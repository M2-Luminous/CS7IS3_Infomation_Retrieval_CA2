Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', the liaison with the Palestinians, sought to check reports that Uri Magidish's assassins had been inducted into the Palestinian police. He was told that Fatah Hawks had been concentrated in a classification camp, and that those who are found to be qualified to be policemen would be inducted only after Israel approves it. Meanwhile, it has been learned that the policeman who banned Brig. Gen. Doron Almog from traveling freely on roads in the Gaza Strip has been brought to trial and sent to jail. IDF [Israel Defense Forces] sources this morning expressed satisfaction about the way Palestinian police roadblocks checking Palestinians at the border crossings with Israel have been working.
