FBIS4-57431 "drlat097_i_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Nicaragua President Supports Former Venezuelan President Perez President Supports Former Venezuelan President Perez PA1905035294 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2113 GMT 18 May 94 PA1905035294 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Managua, 18 May (NOTIMEX) -- An official source has reported that Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro today contacted former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez to express her solidarity with him. A Presidency document states "Chamorro contacted Perez this morning to express her solidarity with and fondness for him." The Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice issued today in Caracas an arrest warrant for the former president as part of his trial for allegedly embezzling $17 million between 1989 and 1992. The Presidency communique recalled a message by Perez in which he said he "never" embezzled the secret $17 million fund, part of which reportedly was transferred to the current Nicaraguan Government to "reinforce democracy." Perez was impeached on 20 May 1993 when the Venezuelan court found sufficient evidence to try him for allegedly committing embezzlement. Chamorro recently deemed the allegation that Perez financially supported her government "false," but she acknowledged the efforts of the former president to "defuse the spiral of warlike tension in Central America."
