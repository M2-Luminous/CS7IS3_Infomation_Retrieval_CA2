Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chairman of the Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks, has stated that the Palestinian delegation was forced to postpone the talks to make room for the political efforts to eliminate the obstacles. In a statement to MENA today, Sha'th commended the role that President Mubarak is playing to eliminate the obstacles and boost the peace effort. He remarked that Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa's visit to Israel and his talks with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres were within the context of Egyptian efforts to eliminate the obstacles. He explained that Musa carried to Israel a Palestinian paper outlining the Palestinian vision of how to resolve outstanding issues. He hoped Israel would respond positively in this connection. Sha'th added that Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat would return to Cairo tomorrow to meet President Mubarak and 'Amr Musa and discuss the Israeli reply, which Musa brought back with him.
