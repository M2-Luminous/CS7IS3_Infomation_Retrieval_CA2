The State Is Not in a Position To Provide Anything Else For Us"] [Text] A parliamentary discussion of the outcome of the monetary reform, and in essence--of the catastrophic socioeconomic situation existing in Armenia, which is being held this week, leaves a painful impression. It appears that all sides are doing what they are supposed to do: the deputies criticize, the government defends itself, the president tries to lay the emphases he needs, but the feeling of being at an impasse is growing stronger. The issue of the government's resignation is not even being raised because everyone understands that this is the easiest way out, but not by far one that solves the problem. Only on rare, very rare occasions is something constructive proposed in individual presentations--a majority of speakers do not go beyond noting the current crisis. Perhaps this is the most depressing of all. To be sure, our government is still not short on optimism. Just as before, it has no intention of acknowledging its mistakes. At any rate, Minister of the Economy Armen Yegiazaryan stated that all the actions of the cabinet have been correct on the whole. He was also the one to rebuke the deputies for failing to appreciate how critical a situation is in which it is necessary to make decisions literally within two to three days. However, the minister is clearly not willing to talk about who brought the situation to this level of absurdity. In his opinion, now is not the time to respond to the question of who is to blame: We will sort that out later. The government views a granting of additional powers to it for a period of six months as a way out of this situation. A number of draft decisions aimed at stabilizing the dram have been submitted to the parliament. In particular, they envision criminal liability for trading in foreign exchange, for refusing to sell goods for drams, and for selling goods at prices higher than those envisioned by the state, the subordination of the activities of the Central Bank to the government, etc. Besides, A. Yegiazaryan assured us that there is a program of actions that will bring about stabilization in the sphere of monetary circulation. The minister did not wish to dwell on what kind of program that is: "We know what needs to be done, and we will do it." The deputies quite reasonably answered that during the entire year the parliament has given the "go-ahead" to all the government's initiatives, and it is clear to everyone what the outcome has been. Can a government that has brought the country to the brink of an abyss be trusted? In his brilliant lecture on Monday, Prime Minister G. Bagratyan confidently diagnosed events: There is hyperinflation. No, the deputies objected, this is an obvious collapse. The ministers said that they were doing everything possible. The deputies hurled rebukes at them: No, you are professionally incompetent. And so on ad infinitum. Frankly, despite the sharply critical arrows, this entire exchange at times smacked of an undisguised farce in which everyone tries to pretend that they are acting seriously, but clearly perceive themselves that they are doing something very different from what they should be doing. Incidentally, this has been the case not only with the latest discussion. Whenever a debate on the socioeconomic situation is underway, it acquires a truly farcical character. The poorly disguised cynicism of some and the perception of their own helplessness on the part of others cannot evoke anything but laughter through tears. After all, when the president himself says, virtually with pride, that he does provide bread for the people, no commentary is required. This suggests just one conclusion: that these people deserve nothing but bread--they deserve neither heat nor light nor other foodstuffs, in a word, nothing of what has long been a given for the rest of the world at the end of the 20th century. If they live, it means that it is possible to live that way--these are also the words of the president, who admitted almost a month ago that it could not get any worse. But it has, has it not? If we digress from all these sad reflections and try to understand what is behind the week-long parliamentary debate, approximately the following will emerge. It is clear that the issue of responsibility remains the global one: The search for yet another scapegoat is on. Until recently, the government (before Bagratyan) was quite suitable for this role, whereas this time the president has apparently decided to rescue the government. Why turn on "our own men" when the "panel of three" who made decisions with regard to the monetary reform can be saddled with everything? (It is interesting that, according to confidential information, only one vote stood in the way of "sentencing" the current cabinet at one of the latest meetings of the board of the Armenian National Movement). It was for a reason that the deputies persistently tried to learn whether there had been differences between the state commission and the government. The members of the "panel of three" answered this question quite evasively, whereas A. Yegiazaryan in essence gave a clear-cut answer: The government has nothing to do with the monetary reform. A fine how do you do! The state commission is to blame for everything, and the government is not involved. Who created the "panel of three?" The parliament. So, hold the panel accountable. Do you recall that a representative of the parliament, Tigran Sarkisyan, was precisely the one to make the most vigorous presentations during the days of the monetary reform and immediately thereafter? He sort of assumed the role of leader. So, this deputy took virtually no part in the debate that was held. Here is one more argument in favor of the suggestion that the government is trying to distance itself from the monetary reform in every way possible: Why is the issue of subordinating the Central Bank to the Council of Ministers being raised right now rather than before the introduction of the national currency? If, as Minister of Finance L. Barkhudaryan assures us, the government was ready to take this step, why did it not assume control over the process, agreeing instead to establish the state commission? So that it would be possible to blame it for everything later? After all, judging by the presentations of the members of the government, a sharp loss of the value of the dram and, as a consequence, a price stalemate had been predetermined ahead of time. As it turns out, all credit for Armenia has been frozen since November. Not a single international financial organization, not a single country which has been approached for help undertook to ensure the stabilization fund of the Armenian national currency. It turns out, as Kh. Arutyunyan observed, that the government ensured merely the technical aspect of the endeavor--the exchange of currency within a record short period of time which, incidentally, greatly shattered the nerves of the already worn-down population. It is hard to disagree with Kh. Arutyunyan on something else, too: the situation is socially explosive, and emergency measures are needed which originate precisely with the president. Meanwhile, the government coolly states that there is hyperinflation, and demands additional powers in order to stabilize the situation in six months(!) There is a wise Armenian saying about this: Either the donkey or his master will die by then. I am far from thinking that the prime minister and his team alone are to blame for everything. Of course, their blame, as well as that of the "panel of three," for the specific present-day situation is indisputable. However, who is to blame for the executive authorities being given carte-blanche during at least the last two years? Who has ensured the virtually complete lack of control over the operation of the government? Who has dealt absolutely all the cards to the president, while at the same time not daring to openly hold anybody accountable? During the more than three years of its existence the Armenian parliament has reduced itself to the level of the most helpless and powerless structure which allows anything at all to be done to it. It was no accident that Deputy S. Zolyan said directly that the parliament presently performs the functions of merely the fourth branch of power, the press, because it is allowed to say all it wants, but nobody pays any attention to it. However, the crisis of absolutely all branches of power is apparent. It appears that everybody has a clear notion as far as the parliament and the government are concerned (to say nothing about judicial power). However, will the president succeed in coming out wearing white gloves this time, too? To be sure, the stains are quite easy to see, but there is no dearth of experience in getting them out.
