The first is the persistent reminder that it was Slobodan Milosevic who initiated the drafting of this program, although Avramovic only loses thereby -- if he is successful in doing what he set out to do, he will have to share the glory with someone, and if he fails, he will be only yet another in the line of the discarded and forgotten. The other thing he knew he had to be mindful of (along with trifles such as the hard line against criticism, especially coming from the independent media, and the mentioning of Milan Panic only as a "bizarre detail in Yugoslav history") is the rejection of any similarity with the reform dating from the times of Ante Markovic. To that end he even offered the uninformed public the assertion that Markovic's program, unlike the present one, did not even aim to cover the public deficit. Anyone with a good memory will recall, however, that that program was centered on the fiscal sphere. For those who do not remember, it is sufficient to reflect on the fact that the Yugoslavia of that time, which was indeed larger, had built up almost $11 billion in foreign exchange reserves, so that it did not have to be so concerned about a budget deficit running to a few hundred million dollars, while the entire present project is actually based on $300 million. Bringing Foreign Exchange Out Into the Open It is perhaps not logical to discuss right at the outset the political connotations of what is clearly an economic program whose initial results cannot be denied. The "foreign exchange specialists" in the street market even have such a high opinion of the superdinar that they are demanding no less than 10 German marks [DM] for 7 dinars. The Bureau of Statistics has published figures that the monthly level of inflation has dropped from a figure in the millions to 880 percent, although this was rather clumsy advertising concocted to support the program. Hyperinflation is literally cut short overnight, in the economic discipline there is no particular difference between one thousand percent and a million percent, so they should have waited a while before publishing the first results. The most recent information from the banks indicates that in the first two weeks of the program's implementation the economy and individuals have sold no less than DM70 million, although, given the immense shortage of both old and new dinars, the high taxes and current bills for electricity, other utilities, telephone and similar costs--there is reason to be skeptical about what that figure means. The program for reconstruction of the monetary system, however, after the heady joy at the dinar in one's pocket being worth something after all, indeed even in shops that now have more goods, might well end in a hangover of realizing that life was better when people were running from store to store with a handful of bad checks. The calculation is fairly obvious. The economic policy proposed for this year envisages an average net paycheck of $30, which comes to about DM50 (new dinars), a distinction being made, it is true, between what are called the effectively employed and those on mandatory leave, but even the former would not earn more than some DM60 (dinars). Pensions would of course be about 15 percent lower. Anyone who in recent days has received the bills we mentioned for electricity, water, or telephone, anyone who has had to travel either by rail, bus, or air, will quickly note that an average earning of that amount does not guarantee even a daily loaf of bread and liter of milk. Although they have been extricated somewhat more honestly than previously, the very last household reserves of foreign exchange will have to "come out into the open" on behalf of mere survival. Everyone will finally have to take seriously the reason why a socialist leader at one time estimated that individuals were still holding about DM2 billion. In order to take them away. It is much the same with the economy. Just as the public is being served its favorite autocratic hot-and-cold policy (large price increases followed by loudly trumpeted partial reductions), so economic policymakers, although this is the job of the legislative branch, not theirs, are playing with taxes and fees on public and private firms. Coming after DM10,000, DM1,000 seems like an outright gift, and every drop of 1 percent in the tax rate seems like a gift from heaven. Given the circumstances that have prevailed up to now, every serious enterprise "took refuge" in foreign exchange, but now it is being force to sell that foreign exchange, since without dinars it cannot do business and meet a payroll. There is no economist who could have anything against introduction of money that carries a real value or against real market prices for everything. This is truly the only basis on which on which a successful economy can be built. Nevertheless, the world has never recorded an example of a ruined economy combined with sound money, social peace maintained by not laying anyone off, and an anti-inflation program "which makes things better the very first day." Avramovic's current program is good in that it will show everyone the degree to which the economy has been destroyed and what the standard of living of the population has been reduced to. In essence it legalizes everything that has been happening in the recent past, along with a noticeably hypocritical concern for so-called "old" foreign exchange savings depositors and naive support of the opposition in the formation of some kind of committees of inquiry to study the business operation of the private quasibanks. An Unprecedented Combination People have been robbed repeatedly -- this program makes them clearly aware of that. And in a postscript it says that they are even in debt to the state and for that reason will have to sell what little foreign exchange they have left. Avramovic's cutting of the Gordian knot at the same time legalizes the right of all those who in the time of the Wild West amassed great wealth, either as private bankers, war profiteers or political bigwigs. The period of Balkan-style primitive accumulation of capital seems to be over. The time has come for them (the bigwigs) to assume even formal authority thanks to a solid and stable domestic currency, and for most of the population to finally realize the extent of their own pauperization and the place assigned them. The public, deceived so many times, but always ready to accept fairy tales, myths, conspiracy theories, and similar stories without reservation, is already putting stock in the reasons why this program must succeed, similar to the hope it invested last year when the prophecy was that everything would change beginning in September. Namely, there is no reason to doubt that production will grow, and that the social product this year, just as in the projection of economic policy, will really increase by 5 percent. According to that story, which is not without a certain amount of rational analysis, the sanctions have to be removed soon, because the government and those close to it, who have been trading in petroleum and everything else under the sun, have already derived enough benefit for themselves from the blockade. And now, supposedly, they are in good humor and will be doing everything for removal of the sanctions. Or, more simply, they have amassed all they want, and now they will presumably give us something. However, whereas real estate is cheaper than it has been since 1957, according to a TV ad of one of the real estate firms, and prices on the art objects market have literally been cut in half, stock should not be put in this theory. There are still pianos to be bought.
