The editorials note the little progress made in the inter-Korean working delegates' contact for the exchange of special envoys, and the possible cancellation of the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Policy Toward the North Should Be Reviewed." The editorial begins, "It is undeniable that there have been two positions, dovish and hawkish, over the ways to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. This was the case in the ROK as well as in the United States. Both the ROK and the U.S. Governments have so far maintained the dovish position exploring a solution through dialogue and diplomatic efforts. We admit that this dovish line has attained a degree of success." The editorial then notes, "However, the doves overlooked an important fact. It resulted from their distorted view that dealing with the issue in a hawkish manner was like not hesitating to wage a war. They should have admitted earlier that the hawkish position is aimed at the same objective, namely, a peaceful settlement. To preserve peace, we must make clear our firm position of resolutely dealing with any threat of war. This is all the more so especially when we deal with North Korea." The editorial notes, "The ROK even took a negative position as to the plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK on the grounds that it could hurt the dialogue atmosphere, thus suffering an estrangement in ROK-U.S. relations. Now it is time to make a change," and concludes, "It seems that we have no more carrot to give. It is up to North Korea to make a choice." The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "It Is Time To Reestablish Policy Toward the North." The editorial notes, "The time has reached a point where we can no longer tolerate the North Korean attitude of breaking promises, its delaying and avoiding tactics. We should now reconfirm clear principles and reestablish our position. In case North Korea rejects full nuclear inspection and the envoy exchange, we should make clear our position as to the consideration of resumption of the Team Spirit joint military exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles, and sanctions on North Korea. We should also consider the suspension of inter-Korean economic cooperation, including the ongoing unofficial inter-Korean trade." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "The Nuclear Inspection of North Korean Facilities and the Government's Measures." The editorial says, "The government should maintain a firm policy and continue to persuade North Korea since the situation is expected to worsen if the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council. North Korea, on its part, should now review its strategy of negotiation with the United States and South Korea. Irrespective of North Korea's basic strategy, the North Korean attitude is narrowing the gap for negotiation of the dialogue advocates in South Korea and the United States and is encouraging the voice of those who oppose dialogue."
