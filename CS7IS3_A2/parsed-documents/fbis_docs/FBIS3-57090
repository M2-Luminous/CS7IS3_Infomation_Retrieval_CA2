The Duma said the statement contained "arbitrary and subjective assessments of the current situation in agriculture". By proposing the statement the Agrarian Party, evidently, wanted to support its leader and Deputy Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha before the president and the prime minister agree on the new composition of the government. The president and the premier stumbled over the candidacy of Fedorov who said he might remain in the government only in case Zaveryukha is dismissed. Zaveryukha is responsible for agricultural policy in the government and supports the interests of collective and state farms. Fedorov became his arch rival after refusing to provide subsidies to state-run agriculture. At the same time the Duma adopted a statement which recommended the government to consider in five days the problem of financing agriculture in 1994 in order to increase production and stabilise its development in conditions of a market economy.
