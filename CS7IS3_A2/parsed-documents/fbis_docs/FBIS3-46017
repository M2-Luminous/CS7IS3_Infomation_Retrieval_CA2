At a news conference, Chernomyrdin said the government will only make certain changes in the tactics of reforms, which mean a switch from purely monetarist methods pursued by Yegor Gaydar in managing the economy. However, the cabinet chief pointed out, his government will concentrate on boosting production by any means. "The period of market romanticism is over now, but we will not permit its substitution by an obsession with production," the prime minister said. He rejected rumors about the changes of the strategic course of the economic reform currently underway in the country, noting, "I state with all responsibility that this is not so." Yeltsin's program towards a deep transformation of Russian society "was, is and will be carried through," Chernomyrdin said. But, he added, "We plan to correct the methods of reform." It means a switch from purely monetarist policies to other measures tested in many European countries, he explained. These measures envisage the creation of true competition on the Russian market and in the economy between Russia and foreign producers. This signals "a big opening of the Russian economy to the world economy," the prime minister added. At the news conference, Chernomyrdin also announced the line up of his new government, saying that deputy prime ministers Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Anatoliy Chubays and Yuriy Yarov will retain their current posts. He also announced that Oleg Soskovets will remain as first deputy. Under an order signed by President Boris Yeltsin in January, the number of deputy prime ministers will be cut from nine to four or five. In the new government, Aleksandr Shokhin becomes economics minister, Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, while Sergey Shakhray will head the ministry of nationalities and regional policy. Boris Fedorov was offered the post of the finance minister, but "he has not yet responded," Chernomyrdin told reporters.
