It has also put on the front page the debate over whether it is advisable for the United States to continue following the schemes of the Cold War or to modify its views and values and adopt a more realistic policy in a different world. Can any intelligent person in the United States continue arguing that Cuba presents or represents a threat to the national security of the world's greatest military power? If one were to make an objective analysis one would see that none of the conditions, claimed to have existed by nine U.S. Administrations in order to apply, maintain, and even strengthen the blockade against our country, currently exist. As a matter of fact, the events that they used in the past were not modified to please or to acquiesce to a policy of pressure but as a result of factors that exclusively involve Cuba and the countries with whom it maintained the determined commitments which Washington considered dangerous for its security, demanding their cancellation. Our presence in Africa, and the presence in Cuba of some units from the former Soviet Union were not ended because our country was acquiescing to U.S. pressures, but because of sovereign decisions between the parties involved. Maybe it was the unwavering position that Cuba has maintained and will maintain, or the sharp defense of the national sovereignty and our right to self determination that provoked anger among the leading members of the U.S. Administrations. At one time there was a more appropriate climate for such an exacerbated position. Today, it has been said that the Cold War is over. The Soviet Union no longer exists. There is not one Cuban soldier in Angola, a sovereign decision between those involved. Today, the most fierce sectors of the counterrevolution in Florida are losing their influence very rapidly. An important sector of the Cuban emigres wants dialogue; it does not accept the blockade. They claim to have other values and interests. A more rational attitude is gaining ground among intellectuals, entrepreneurs, and many U.S. politicians, who do not want to hear anything about a Cold War, but would prefer to hear of trade, mutual interests, trips, and tourism. The fact that such important events coincide is not casual, but neither is it premeditated. While the bill is presented to Congress to normalize trade relations with Cuba -- in other words, end the blockade and the Torricelli Law -- the U.S.-Cuba Friendship Caravan is among us after successfully completing their mission of peace and solidarity. I do not believe the Rangel bill will be passed by Congress. But, it is a sign of a changing view that gains strength in the United States and that will end up isolating those with nostalgia for the Cold War and the big stick policy.
