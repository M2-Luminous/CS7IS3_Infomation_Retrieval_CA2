FBIS4-13665 "drnes078_l_94002" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Evacuation Applies to West Bank, Gaza Evacuation Applies to West Bank, Gaza TA2204054394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0405 GMT 22 Apr 94 TA2204054394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that his remarks on the evacuation of settlements on the Golan Heights in exchange for peace also expressed his position in general with regard to Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The prime minister spoke after leaving a convention of the Shinuy [Democratic Movement for Change] movement, in which he also noted that the reports he received from Bucharest and Cairo indicate progress in the negotiations with the Palestinians. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports: [Begin recording] [Nir] The prime minister said that the reports he received yesterday from Foreign Minister Peres in Bucharest and Major General Amnon Shahaq in Cairo indicate progress. He does not know whether concluding the negotiations will take one, two, or five weeks; however, he said, we are moving closer to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Rabin said his position with regard to the evacuation of settlements on the Golan Heights in exchange for peace also reflects his position in general with regard to Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Rabin asserted that his statements are unconnected to the negotiations with Syria; however, when referring to the Golan Heights, Rabin used the term Syrian soil. [Rabin] I was asked a question on the issue of evacuating settlements. I replied that we would not move settlements out of security considerations -- not in the Gaza Strip, not in Judaea and Samaria, and not on the Golan Heights. For peace, however, we will be prepared to evacuate settlements. There is a precedent for this: We evacuated all the settlements from the Sinai Peninsula and we tore down Yamit. I believe that these actions were justified at the time, and there is no reason not to do the same today. At the beginning of my remarks, I reiterated that our main struggle in the negotiations with Syria is how to avoid repeating the same price we paid for peace with Egypt -- in other words, to avoid having to implement a full withdrawal from every square inch of Syrian soil we conquered and having to uproot every vestige of Israeli presence in the territory conquered from Syria. [Nir] Rabin was asked whether there was any connection between the timing of his announcement and the negotiations with Syria. [Rabin] If you read interviews with me that were conducted in the past, you will see that I said that although I would not evacuate settlements for security, I would evacuate them in exchange for peace. Yesterday, I replied to a question on the issue of settlement evacuation which a Golan Heights settler happened to ask. My reply reflected my general position with regard to the Gaza Strip, Judaea and Samaria, and the Golan Heights. [Nir] Rabin was speaking upon leaving a convention of Shinuy veterans marking the movement's 20th anniversary. [end recording]
