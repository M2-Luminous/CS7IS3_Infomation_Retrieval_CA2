Some 2,000 to 3,000 people, many in uniform, were waiting to greet the rightwing Liberal Democratic Party leader, who is making a tour of parts of former Yugoslavia, including Serb-controlled regions of Croatia and Bosnia, an AFP correspondent said. He was officially welcomed by the self-proclaimed president of the Serb Republic of Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, Biljana Plavsic, from the collegial presidency and Aleksa Buha, a member of the government. Karadzic introduced Zhirinovskiy to a Russian volunteer fighting on the Tuzla front in northeast Bosnia. "The Russians have already arrived. They are coming on their own, it is a sign of Russia's goodwill," Zhirinovskiy said. Zhirinovskiy was later scheduled to visit Vukovar in the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in Croatia to meet the newly-elected self-styled president Milan Martic. Zhirinovskiy warned on arrival in Belgrade on Sunday that airstrikes against the Serbs would be considered an attack by the west on Russia itself. Attacks by NATO warplanes or UN troops on Serb positions anywhere in Bosnia or other areas of the former Yugoslavia "would be tantamount to a declaration of war on Russia," he said. "It's better that Europe not learn what retaliatory measurs we could take," he told a press conference. He also called for UN troops to be pulled out of Bosnia-Herzegovina and "let the Serbs settle the matter themselves." Zhirinovskiy arrived here from Serbia after traveling through Hungary following a stormy tour of Slovenia, during which he was invited to leave by the government for causing a public disturbance and suggesting the independent republic should be reincorporated into rump Yugoslavia.
