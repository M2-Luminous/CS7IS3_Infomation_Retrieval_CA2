He said: The facilities provided to Azerbaijan for the importing of Iranian products, their suitable prices and quality are among the factors that have enabled Iranian products to attract greater attention and have greater commercial competitiveness in this region. Tofik Allavardiyev, the press committee official of Lenkoran, elaborated: The cities of Lenkoran and Astara have become wholesale centers for Iranian commodities in Azerbaijan. He added: The merchants of the republics of Dagestan and Chechenya are among the permanent customers of Iranian products, particularly of preserves and plastic materials. An Iranian trader in Lenkoran said: Since Lenkoran is considered a bridge for the transportation of Iranian goods to various parts of the Caucasus, most of our businessmen display a special interest in operating here. He added that the Iranian products most in demand include apples, dairy products, potatoes, tomato paste, dill pickles, chocolates, machine-made carpets, and low-price garments. Allavardiyev said: As soon as the Iranian products arrive, long queues of store owners and retailers form outside the import companies. One of the merchants resident in Lenkoran, Ali Teymuriyev, said: Our proximity to the Islamic Republic of Iran has been of immense assistance in eliminating the bottlenecks resulting from privatization in the southern regions in Azerbaijan. He added: Most of the traders in this region have--with their prompt payments--been able to elicit the attention of the Iranian businessmen for the purchase of these goods for resale in markets in other parts of Azerbaijan and the Caucasus.
