The Council examines issues affecting the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs, as well as the Medicare program and impacts on the Medicaid program, which were created under the Act. In addition, the Secretary has asked the Council specifically to address the following: •Social Security financing issues, including developing recommendations for improving the long-range financial status of the OASDI programs; and •General program issues such as the relative equity and adequacy of Social Security benefits for persons at various income levels, in various family situations, and various age cohorts, taking into account such factors as the increased labor force participation of women, lower marriage rates, increased likelihood of divorce, and higher poverty rates of aged women. In addressing these topics, the Secretary suggested that the Council may wish to analyze the relative roles of the public and private sectors in providing retirement income, how policies in both sectors affect retirement decisions and the economic status of the elderly, and how the disability insurance program provisions and the availability of health insurance and health care costs affect such matters.
