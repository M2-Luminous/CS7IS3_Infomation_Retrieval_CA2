After giving Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani a written message from the Kenyan president, the Kenyan attorney general described the outcome of his meetings with our country's judicial officials as very fruitful. Thanking Iran for its efforts in the fight against narcotics and for observing human rights standards, he called for more cooperation and consultation regarding the sharing of Iran's invaluable experience with his country. Thanking Iran for its foreign policy on establishing and expanding ties with the Third World, especially African countries, he described as very important and effective the role of our country's officials in global developments. He said: Since the victory of the Islamic revolution, as a big regional and Islamic power, Iran has played an active role in defending the rights of the innocent and the deprived throughout the world. He called for the expansion of mutual ties in all fields. According to a Central News Unit report, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed regret that monopolistic countries pursue their hegemonistic policy in the world by resorting to holy concepts. He said: The cruelty and harshness of those powers are known throughout history, and there is strong evidence of their disregard for human rights. They try to accuse developing countries and countries seeking independence of human rights violations. He said: Using their capabilities, since they possess rich natural and human resources, Third World countries could, through cooperation--directly and without middlemen--help each other in solving their problems. Expressing concern about the bitter events in Africa, particularly the events in Somalia, Rwanda, Angola, and Mozambique, the president called for more effort by the Organization of African Unity to end the crisis in that region. He expressed the hope that relations between Iran and Kenya would be expanded in all fields.
