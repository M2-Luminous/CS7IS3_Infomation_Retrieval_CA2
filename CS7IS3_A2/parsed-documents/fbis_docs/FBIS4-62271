That figure is cited in a memorandum drawn up by the State Duma Committee on the Budget, Taxation, Banks, and Finances. The annual payments that Russia was committed to make under the schedule for servicing debt and repaying principal in 1992-93 were in excess of 20 billion dollars. However, thanks to successful negotiations with creditors Russia was able to limit itself last year to paying out only 2.2 billion dollars. During the current year the Russian Government intends to pay a further 4.7 billion dollars. Last year Russia obtained from foreign governments credits totalling 4.4 billion dollars. The biggest creditor was Germany, which provided 2.4 billion dollars. The top three creditors also included France (providing 680 million dollars) and the United States (providing 671 million dollars). Our eastern neighbor, Japan, provided only 140 million dollars in credit, but nevertheless, it outstripped Canada, Turkey, and the Netherlands. In 1994 the government is expecting to obtain credits totalling 2.8 billion dollars. Germany will keep its lead in this sphere. It will be followed by Italy, the United States, and Japan, which is proposing to increase the amount of its credit by 150 percent. Almost half of the foreign credits last year went to agriculture and the food industry, in the main for grain purchases, while the rest went to industry, transport, communications, municipal services, environmental protection, the medical industry, and the purchase of medical supplies. In 1994 it is planned to direct the credits in the main to industry and agriculture. A total of 650 million dollars will be earmarked for the medical industry and the purchase of medical supplies. In comparison with last year it is planned to reduce 13- fold the outlay of credits for the purchase of grain--to 100 million dollars. At the same time, Russia has continued providing foreign states with credit. In particular, credits have been issued over the past two years to India, Cuba, Algeria, and Pakistan totalling 1.8 billion dollars.
