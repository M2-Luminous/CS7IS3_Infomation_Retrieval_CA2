FBIS4-33881 "drlat113_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-113 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 Peru State of Emergency Extended in 3 Amazonian Areas State of Emergency Extended in 3 Amazonian Areas PA1106183494 Paris AFP in Spanish 1735 GMT 11 Jun 94 PA1106183494 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 11 Jun (AFP) -- The Peruvian Government extended the state of emergency for 60 days beginning today in several provinces of three Amazonian departments because "narcoterrorist actions continue" there, it was officially reported today. Meanwhile, the police reported that on the evening of 10 June two policemen and a private agent who were guarding stores -- the former two in the capital city district of El Agustino and the third in San Miguel -- were overpowered by presumed Shining Path commando units, who seized their weapons. The attackers made death threats against the three attack victims and threw leaflets referring to the "armed struggle" and expressing opposition to the government. This special measure, which is contained in a supreme decree published by the EL PERUANO official gazette, affects the provinces of the jungle departments of Huanuco, San Martin, and Loreto. The provision implies the suspension of constitutional guarantees in the areas mentioned and also means that the Armed Forces will continue to guarantee public order. Official figures indicate that more than 60 percent of national territory falls under this regime and that the constitutional guarantees of nearly 50 percent of the Peruvian population (22,128,466 inhabitants) have been restricted since the start of the "fratricidal war" in 1980 in Ayacucho, in the southeastern Andean region, which has claimed more than 27,000 lives.
