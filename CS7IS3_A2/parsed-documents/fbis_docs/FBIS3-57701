Ryabchikova report on news conference by Yuriy Meshkov, candidate for Crimean president, with unidentified reporters in Simferopol on 18 January: "`Meshkov Is Okay,' Said Journalists After News Conference"] [Excerpts] Yesterday in Simferopol, a news conference was held by Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov, a candidate for president of the Crimea, in the Afghanistan War Veterans Club. In his introductory remarks, Yu. A. Meshkov read a statement: "Based on the preliminary results of the 16 January elections, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all Crimean voters who have confided in me and have thus demonstrated their solid civic position. "Your choice permits me to say that the people of the Crimea -- who have rejected the old nomenclature laws -- favor democratic changes, a close union with Russia and other CIS states, and a better life in general. Over the last few years, we have been fighting together for all these values. "I would like to reassure all citizens of the Crimea that the victory of a representative of the political coalition `Russia' will not sharpen our relations with Ukraine, while, at the same time, our relations with Russia will receive new stimulus. "I am addressing you, my esteemed citizens of the Crimea, with gratitude and hope that you will support me in the future. Please, vote again on 30 January and reaffirm your choice. I am sure that you and I will be able to change our lives for the better." Yu. Meshkov then answered a lot of question from journalists. [Reporter] Do you believe that Kiev can prevent the run-off election on 30 January? [Meshkov] I have strong confidence in President Kravchuk, who excludes such violent methods in policy. You know his viewpoint on the presidential elections in the Crimea -- these elections are legal. I believe that President Kravchuk will keep his word. [Reporter] Will you dismiss former officials? No, said Yuriy Aleksandrovich, a lot of them are experts in their fields. It is easier to destroy than to build. Therefore, I will not take their party membership into consideration. Only one criterion will be a factor, and that is professionalism. [Reporter] What do you think about astrologists? [Meshkov] I view them with humor. One of my colleagues noticed that Meshkov did not correspond to his image of a war hawk. So, what about the image? Yuriy Aleksandrovich answered that the image of being a militarist and a separatist has nothing to do with him because it was invented by his opponents.
