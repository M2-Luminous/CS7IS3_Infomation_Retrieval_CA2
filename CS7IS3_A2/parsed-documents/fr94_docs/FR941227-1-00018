FR941227-1-00018 FR941227-1-00005 In addition, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. ), it is hereby certified that the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. The collection of information in these proposed amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is contained in revised Items 5 and 17 of the form. Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is required to be submitted by associated persons of financial institutions that are government securities brokers and dealers, in accordance with §§400.4 and 449.3. The collection of information is intended to give the financial institutions and the appropriate regulatory authorities of the financial institutions a more complete and meaningful description of the disciplinary history of the associated person. The rule applies only to associated persons of financial institutions that are not exempt from filing notice as government securities brokers and dealers. Although the Department is proposing to add a new paragraph to an existing question and modify several other questions on Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, and cannot be certain as to the exact impact on associated persons completing the form, it does believe that the changes will not have more than a de minimis effect on the amount of time necessary to complete the form. The Department's most recent Paperwork Reduction Act Filing with respect to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 shows an annual estimate of 800 respondents filing once per year, with a burden of two hours per respondent. No modification is projected to the reporting burden. The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) requires that collections of information prescribed in proposed rules be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval. Since these proposed amendments result in no increase in burden hours to complete Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 and more importantly do not represent any program change, the submission described in the Paperwork Reduction Act is inapplicable. List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 449 Banks, Banking, Brokers, Government securities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
