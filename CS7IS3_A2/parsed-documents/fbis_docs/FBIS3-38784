Testifying to the 29th Criminal Bench of Berlin Regional Court, Sharitah, who was hidden from the view of journalists and the public by a curtain, admitted that on 25 August 1983 he gave explosives stored at the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin to 46-year-old terrorist Johannes Weinrich only a few hours before the attack on the French cultural center on Kurfuerstendamm. Sharitah, who was third secretary of the Syrian Embassy at the time and in charge of security, claims he learned of the purpose for which the terrorist needed the explosives only after the attack. The witness confirmed that the ambassador had assigned him to look after Johannes Weinrich and other terrorists. The ambassador had acted on instructions from the Syrian Foreign Ministry. At the start of his testimony the diplomat, who recently gave himself up to the German authorities, said he hopes the case will not become a trial of his country. Syria had nothing to do with the attack on the Maison de France. The defendant, 51-year-old former Stasi [GDR Ministry for State Security] Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, is charged with having been an accessory to murder and to the explosives attack on the Maison de France. He is accused of having arranged for 25 kilos of explosives, which the terrorists had temporarily stored at the Syrian Embassy before the attack, to be handed over to Weinrich. One person was killed and 23 were injured, some seriously, in the bomb attack.
