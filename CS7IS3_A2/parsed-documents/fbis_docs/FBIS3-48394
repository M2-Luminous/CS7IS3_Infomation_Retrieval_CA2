The ministers decided to readjust the government's long-term atomic energy policy in an effort to push the country into the level of advanced nations as soon as possible, the officials said. At the same time, the government will preprare for possible mutual nuclear inspection with North Korea by setting up a body, tentatively named "The Atomic Energy Control Center," the ministers agreed. The center is to be established soon under the Science and Technology Ministry. The meeting, presided over by Deputy Prime Minister and NUB Minister Yi Yong-tok, also decided to make efforts to find a breakthrough through exchange of special envoys with Pyongyang and make active efforts to reach within this year "the reconciliation and cooperation stage," the first stage of the government's three-stage unification formula, by improving the inter-Korean relations. The second stage is "the Korean Commonwealth stage," while the third is "the unified Korea stage." The government reaffirmed its position that for a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, Pyongyang has to return fully to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection and agree in principle to mutual nuclear inspection with the South. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Yi told the 14 ministers who attended the meeting to consult at any time with the NUB before making their policies related to unification in order to maintain a consistent government policy on North Korea.
