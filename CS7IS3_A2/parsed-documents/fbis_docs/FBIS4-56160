The military analysts concluded that if a second round of voting were held in the elections, Lula's probable adversary would be former Governor Orestes Quercia from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], and not Fernando Henrique Cardoso. According to the military analysts, Cardoso has a chance to win in the first round only in the state of Minas Gerais, where he has the support of Governor Helio Garcia. The report was delivered to President Itamar Franco by a military minister.
