FR941230-0-00099 FR941230-0-00019 A. Changes to Regulation S&hyph;T Regulation S&hyph;T, which controls the preparation and submission of electronic filings to the Commission, is amended as described below. • Rule 12(b) of Regulation S&hyph;T. Regulation S&hyph;T is amended to codify that electronic filers are permitted to submit filings on diskette and magnetic tape to the Commission's Operations Center in Alexandria, Virginia. Filers who file on diskette and magnetic tape may prefer to send them directly to the Operations Center to expedite acceptance processing of their submissions, since diskettes and tapes sent to the Commission's headquarters must be forwarded to the Operations Center for processing. • New Rule 13(d) of Regulation S&hyph;T. Exchange Act Rule 14a&hyph;6(b) provides that definitive proxy statements may be ``filed with, or mailed for filing to, the Commission not later than the date such material is first sent or given to any security holder.'' 30 Similar provisions are found in other Commission rules. 31 Although electronic filers could mail diskettes or magnetic tapes, those choosing to file by direct transmission do not currently have this option. Instead, they must file before or on the date the paper counterpart is mailed to investors; such filing date must be a business day of the Commission. Paper filers (or those using diskettes or magnetic tape) have more flexibility, because not only can they satisfy their filing obligations by putting copies in the mail to the Commission at the time of distribution (thus allowing the actual filing to occur after the distribution), they also can satisfy their filing obligation by mailing on Saturday or Sunday, an option not available to direct transmission filers. To place electronic filers on the same footing with paper filers with respect to these filing requirements, the Commission proposed that a new provision be added to Regulation S&hyph;T allowing electronic filers to file their definitive proxy materials (or other documents, as applicable) before or on the date the paper distribution is made, or if the distribution does not occur on a business day of the Commission, as soon as practicable on the next business day. The change has been adopted as proposed. 30 17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;6(b). 31 See 17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;6(c) (relating to personal soliciting materials); 17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;11(c) (relating to information delivered to investors prior to sending a required proxy statement in an election contest); 17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;12(b) (relating to delivery of soliciting materials prior to sending a required proxy statement in circumstances other than election contests); 17 CFR 240.14c&hyph;5(b) (relating to definitive information statements); and 17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(b)(2)(ii) (relating to employee benefit plan information to be furnished to investors prior to a vote on changes to the plan). • Rule 101(a)(1)(i) of Regulation S&hyph;T. The Regulation S&hyph;T list of mandated electronic submissions has been revised to specifically include prospectuses filed under the Securities Act. 32 32 This makes it clear that prospectus filings pursuant to Securities Act Rules 424 [17 CFR 230.424] and 497 [17 CFR 230.497] are to be filed electronically. For investment company filings, Rule 101(a)(1)(i) includes statements of additional information and, where required to be filed with the Commission, prospectuses submitted under Securities Act Rule 482 [17 CFR 230.482]. See amendments to paragraphs (a) and (e) of Rule 902 of Regulation S&hyph;T, which codify a limited exception to the electronic filing requirements for Securities Act Rule 497 filings. • Rule 101(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S&hyph;T. The Regulation S&hyph;T list of mandated electronic submissions has been revised to specifically exclude Form 13F 33 from the list of mandated electronic filings, consistent with other rule provisions and codifying current staff interpretations. 34 33 17 CFR 249.325. 34 See Rule 903(a)(3) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.903(a)(3)]. See also Section V of Release No. IC&hyph;19284. • New Rule 101(b)(3) of Regulation S&hyph;T. As proposed, all employee benefit plans will be permitted to file their entire annual report on Form 11&hyph;K 35 in paper or in electronic format. 36 Prior to this amendment, Regulation S&hyph;T required Forms 11&hyph;K to be filed electronically, 37 but registrants were allowed to file any financial statements and schedules prepared in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') 38 in paper under cover of Form SE. 39 Four commenters responded to the Commission's solicitation of views on the treatment of Forms 11&hyph;K. All supported relief from electronic presentation for at least a portion of the financial information required in these reports. Two indicated that electronic filing should be completely optional. Another supported optional electronic filing at least for annual reports filed by ERISA plans. The final commenter believed that Forms 11&hyph;K should continue to be filed electronically, with the paper submission under cover of Form SE being restricted. Because of the unique nature and purpose of reports on Form 11&hyph;K, together with the staff's experience in implementing the Form 11&hyph;K requirements involving Form SE, the rules are being adopted as proposed. 35 17 CFR 249.311. 36 Of course, the same would be true for employee benefit plan annual reports filed as amendments to Forms 10&hyph;K [17 CFR 249.310] or 10&hyph;KSB [17 CFR 249.310b], as permitted by Exchange Act Rule 15d&hyph;21 [17 CFR 240.15d&hyph;21]. This would not be the case for an amendment to Forms 10&hyph;K or 10&hyph;KSB filed for any other reason. 37 Rule 101(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.101(a)(1)(iii)]. 38 Pub. L. No 93&hyph;406 (codified at 29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. ). 39 17 CFR 232.311(c) and General Instruction E of Form 11&hyph;K. Form SE is found at 17 CFR 239.64, 249.444, 259.603, 269.8, and 274.403. •New Rules 101(b)(4) and (5) of Regulation S&hyph;T. The following filings will be explicitly included among those allowed to be submitted in electronic format, consistent with other rule provisions and current staff interpretations:
