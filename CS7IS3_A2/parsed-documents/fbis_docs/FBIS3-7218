It served as a revolutionary base during the periods of resistance. Thus, during the war, Tay Ninh was an area where the enemy frequently launched attacks and sweeps. The material base and infrastructure, which were weak to begin with, suffered great damage. After the south was completely liberated, Tay Ninh had to cope with the border war started by the Khmer Rouge. Tay Ninh really started rebuilding only at the beginning of the 1980s. Tay Ninh's border with Cambodia runs for 240 km. Recently along the border, there have frequently been cases of smuggling, encroachments on the land, armed robberies, and disturbances. Many overseas Vietnamese living in Cambodia have been terrorized by the Khmer Rouge and have had to take refuge here, which has made the situation even more tense and complex. There are many religious groups in Tay Ninh Province, and this is where the Vatican, or "capital" of the Cao Dai religion is located. The followers of the Cao Dai religion make up more than 30 percent of the province's population. The counterrevolutionaries and bad elements frequently make use of the Cao Dai religion, disguise themselves as religious followers, and plot to destroy the revolutionary regime. This situation and these special characteristics mean that we must regularly solidify and build the party and revolutionary forces, maintain political security, order, and social safety, and stabilize and develop the economy and society. After the seventh party congress and the fifth congress of the provincial party organization, Tay Ninh made many positive changes, but there are still a number of shortcomings and weaknesses. The most striking thing is that some cadres and party members are wavering with respect to their ideological position, their confidence and combat will power has declined, their quality has declined, their way of life has become degenerate, they have become remote from the masses, and they violate party discipline and the laws of the state. From 1989 to November 1992, a total of 1,304 party members committed disciplinary violations. Among these were committee chairmen and vice chairmen and sector heads in the province, members of district Communist Party of Vietnam standing committees, and members of party committees directly subordinate to the province. Although the apparatus has been solidified somewhat, it is still not strong enough, particularly at the base, village, and subward echelons and in the economic units. The staff committees of the party committee echelons are generally weak. The district echelon is both weak and unstable. As of September 1992, 11.59 percent of the party bases in the province were weak. In the border villages, 15.78 percent of the party bases were weak, and 10.4 percent of the hamlets did not have any party members on the spot. Only 7.3 percent of the party members came from religious families. Cadres are not selected, trained, assigned, or used rationally. A number of sectors lack key cadres and cadres with technical capabilities. As of September 1992, 18.99 percent of the key cadres at the primary, district, and city levels had only a level-I cultural standard; 86 percent of the cadres who lead and manage sectors in the province, districts, and cities had not attended advanced schools or college. For many reasons, many cadres at the primary level lack enthusiasm and are not at ease in their work. Because of the lack of work regulations or because people do not follow the regulations, in many places the relationship between the party committee echelons and the people's councils and between the party committees and the authorities and mass organizations are "skewed" and they "overlap each other." At the same time, a number of spheres lack party leadership. After the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CPV Central Committee was issued, we made an effort to continue renovating and reorganizing the party and overcome the shortcoming and weaknesses. We organized things to implement the resolution of the third plenum and viewed this as an important step in establishing order in order to implement the party's resolutions. After accepting the resolution at the central echelon, the standing committee of the provincial CPV committee organized things to study and thoroughly understand the resolution and immediately formulated an action program. After that, we organized meetings for the key cadres from the provincial to the primary echelons to help them thoroughly understand the resolution of the central echelon and the action program of the province. Based on that, the district, city, and primary-level party committees formulated their own action programs. The striking points in understanding the resolutions and formulating action programs this time are: Implementing the party resolutions has been tied to carrying out the political tasks and solving the pressing economic and social problems of the localities. We view economic development as the central task. Party construction is a key task, and security and national defense work is an important and regular task. The decisive element is organization-cadre work. The party committee echelons are giving much attention to formulating action programs. The provincial guidance committee has directly contributed ideas to the action programs of the districts, and party committees directly subordinate to the province and bases have been chosen to serve as test points. In providing guidance, the standing committee of the provincial party committee has given much attention to ensuring that cadres outside the party and the masses thoroughly understand the resolution. As of March 1993, the resolution had been disseminated to 135,268 people (approximately 16 percent of the population). In order to provide close and timely guidance, the provincial CPV committee has established a committee to guide disseminating the resolutions. This committee consists of a number of members of the standing committee of the provincial CPV committee, and it is chaired by the deputy secretary of the standing committee. We have also established work teams consisting of talented cadres from the party committees in order to directly help, guide, and monitor the target districts and bases. In the districts and cities, the party committees directly subordinate to the province are carrying on similar activities. As for military party committees, we have not established guidance committees. Instead, the standing committee of the provincial military party committee is providing direct guidance. Besides this, the provincial CPV committee and the party committee echelons directly subordinate to the province have assigned party committee members at each echelon the task of monitoring and guiding a particular base. Today, at 127 of the 425 party bases, provincial or district party committee members are monitoring and guiding the implementation of the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CPV Central Committee. As for selecting guidance points, the province has selected one border district (Ben Cau District), one inner district (Hao Thanh District, where 98 percent of the people are followers of the Cao Dai faith), one border village, one inner village, a party chapter of the provincial people's organ of control, a party chapter of the Sugar Cane Corporation, and a party organization in the Tax Department. The party organizations directly subordinate to the province have also selected 31 bases to serve as test points. After carrying out the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CPV Central Committee for more than a year, although there are still many limitations, we have achieved a number of results: The majority of party members, cadres outside the party, and masses see the urgent requirements and have grasped the basic contents of renovating and reorganizing the party. Most party members and people agree with the decrees of the central echelon and regard renovating and reorganizing the party as a particularly important and urgent task that is decisive for building and defending the country and that is decisive with respect to the fate of the party. With this understanding, the party members and masses have actively participated in the work of the party. The sense of responsibility of most party members has been elevated, and their party concepts have been improved. This is a major and fundamental achievement that has long-term significance. Without this great response and participation, the party committee echelons would not be able to achieve good results in building the party. Because of having integrated plans and good organization, many places have solved various problems and made new changes. The party committee echelons have grasped the real state of affairs of the cadres and party members and the strengths and weaknesses of each party base. Thus, when engaging in self-criticism and criticism in accord with Directive 14-CT/TW of the Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee, they have dealt promptly with a number of party committee echelon members and party members who had long been committing violations. They have assigned tasks to party members who had not assigned tasks previously. There is a closeness between retired party members and party members now holding positions, and they are coordinating things, which is helping to strengthen the party bases. The changes in understanding have led to changes in action. Many people have confidence in the party and want to join. During the first six months of 1992, the province recruited 191 party members, and during the first six months of 1993 it recruited 234 party members. A number of "white hamlets" have been eliminated, and primary-level administration and primary-level organizations have been solidified somewhat. The party bases have begun to be solidified and reorganized (29 bases have been disbanded, and 22 new bases have been established). All of the bases have action programs. These action programs have been thoroughly reviewed by higher echelons, and the masses have contributed ideas to them. Because of this, they are both practical and suitable, and this has improved the quality of the activities of the party bases. More than 93 percent of the various-echelon party committees have completed making reviews and begun making good changes on many fronts. Almost all of the party committees directly subordinate to the province have expanded on the decisions of the Politburo and Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee and the guidelines of the Organization Department of the provincial CPV committee on the functions, tasks, and work regulations of the various types of party bases and on the requirements and contents in examining strong party bases. The party committee echelons have given special attention to transforming cadre work, from renovating viewpoints on evaluating and training cadres to renovating the procedures and policies on compensating cadres. Based on examining and evaluating the cadres, the party committee echelons have formulated plans to train nearby cadres. The standing committee of the provincial CPV committee has guided those in charge of the blocks, committees, sectors, districts, cities, and party committees directly subordinate to the province in grasping the real situation and evaluating the key cadres who hold position, cadres in line, and cadres with aspirations in order to examine the entire system and formulate plans to fundamentally rearrange and reorganize things. Never before has Tay Ninh Province had such theoretical, political, and technical training campaigns. Besides sending cadres to train at schools and to attend classes at the central echelon and at the zone, the province is also opening advanced on-the-job theoretical and political classes. The provincial party school has opened seven middle-level theoretical and political classes in the province and in the districts. Among these is one for scientific and technical cadres who are not party members. Besides this, many cadres have been sent to attend regular and on-the-job technical and professional classes at colleges and on-the-job training centers. Although the budget is still limited, the province has decided to temporarily provide allowances to primary-level cadres based on a fixed number. Specifically, the maximum number for each village and subward is 33, including: party block, 4; organizations, 10 (youth union: 2; Veterans Association: 1; Red Cross: 1); people's council, 1; people's committee, 3; and technical sectors, 15. Each hamlet has also been allotted two for the party chapter secretary and the head of the hamlet management board. The allowance system is being carried out in a unified manner: The village and subward secretaries and chairmen receive an allowance equal to the salary of the deputy bureau chief at the district level. Those of the party chapter secretaries and heads of the hamlet management boards are equal to the salary of village sector heads. In addition to the general stipulations, the border villages and key villages have been given a number of additional allowances. Although they do not match the labor of the primary-level cadres, these initial allowances have increased the enthusiasm of these people, given them peace of mind, and involved them deeply in the movements. Because of the results achieved in party renovation and reorganization, Tay Ninh has had positive economic and social changes. As compared with previous years, since 1992, on many fronts Tay Ninh has made clear progress, and the rate of economic growth has been good. As compared with 1991, the 1992 gross social product increased 8.7 percent, the national income increased 10 percent, and the value of agricultural yields increased 10.5 percent. Paddy yields reached 295,000 tons, the highest ever, averaging 309 kg of paddy per person per year. During the first 6 months of 1993, agricultural production increased in terms of both area and yields. As compared with the same time last year, the crop growing area has increased 4 percent. In this, the rice area has increased 7 percent, the manioc area has increased 11 percent, and the peanut area has increased 3 percent. The cultural and social spheres have made clear progress, too. Based on satisfactorily implementing the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CPV Central Committee, the province has implemented the resolutions of the fourth and fifth plenums of the CPV Central Committee, guided the sectors and echelons in formulating work programs, solved the urgent social problems, and improved the quality of the activities of the village literary blocks. What is worth noting is that the program to eliminate poverty has achieved good results and had a practical effect. The echelons, sectors, mass organizations, and people have responded to the movements, and many assets (of the state, social organizations, and people) have been mobilized. Most of the poor households now have capital to carry on production and engage in commercial and service activities. These households are being stabilized, and their standard of living is gradually rising. The number of poor households in the province has clearly declined. Today, the assets of this program have reached 50 billion dong. A total of 23,215 households have been given loans and provided jobs in production, business, and service occupations. The number of households that lack food is declining daily. Although this is a complex area where the enemy continues to implement plots to destroy the revolution, because the echelons and sectors in Tay Ninh have concentrated on providing leadership and guidance and invested much in security and national defense work, political security, order, and social safety here has been maintained. There have not been any major disturbances recently, and the evil plots of the destructive groups have been discovered and blocked in time. During the past period, social evils have declined greatly. The initial results achieved by Tay Ninh in building the party prove that: Renovating and reorganizing the party must also be tied to stabilizing and developing the economy and society and maintaining security and national defense. Solidifying the primary-level party organizations and improving the quality of the party members must go hand in hand with solving the pressing problems in the localities and at the bases. In order to have a suitable plan of action, an all-around survey must be conducted from the party bases. The people must be allowed to contribute ideas to and discuss the action programs so that they can implement the programs along with the party. This will help create a close relationship between the party and the people. Cadre work is always the key element in party renovation and reorganization. We must understand the cadres and party members, know the strengths and weaknesses of each person, formulate plans for recruiting, training, assigning, and using people, and have suitable compensation procedures and policies in order to create the conditions and mobilize people to satisfy the new needs of the revolution. At present, Tay Ninh still has many difficulties, but the results that we have achieved in the past period have generated momentum for the next steps on the path of carrying on renovation.
