The National Tax Administration has found out in its year-long tax inspection that ICI Korea Co. of the United Kingdom and six to seven other foreign firms doing business in Korea has dodged large amounts of tax. "The taxes dodged by ICI Korea, BASF Korea and Hoechst Korea are especially large, running to the 10- to 20-billion-won level each," a government official said on Sunday. Both BASF and Hoechst are German firms. The tax inspection was launched in February last year into 25 major foreign firms. The official said the tax office will soon wind up the probe and formally notify them of the amount of penalty taxes to be collected. The foreign firms involved react furiously against the tax office's move, lodging protests with the government and threatening, in some instances, to withdraw from Korea unless the penalty taxes are withdrawn. British Minister of State Alastair Goodlad called on Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong during his recent visit to Seoul asking him to see to it that the penalty taxes on ICI Korea be reassessed downward. Germany and the Netherlands have filed letters of protests to the Foreign Ministry and tax administration against the penalty taxes on their firms in Korea. Besides, the head of the European Chamber of Commerce (ECC) in Korea visited the Foreign Ministry to express protest. He has gone so far as to flash a petition to the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) headquarters at last year end against the penalty taxes, a source said. He suggested in the petition that South Korea has been imposing undue taxes on foreign firms and should therefore be kept from joining the OECD, the source said. An ICI Korea official complained, "foreign trading firms are supposed to pay tax only on commission fees they received on foreign commodities imported. But, the Korean tax office is trying to assess tax on the whole sales of imported goods." He said his firm would have no choice but to seriously consider pulling out of Korea if the huge penalty tax is actually assessed. South Korean officials say the foreign firms involved have expressly dodged taxes in breach of the law of the land and also international practices. "Since these firms are fixed business concerns under the tax law which directly marketed imported goods locally, they should naturally pay taxes on their whole sales," a tax administration official said. He said that in light of tax laws both at home and abroad, there is no problem at all in the collection of penalty tax retroactive to five years before. "It is proper for the tax administration to collect the penalty taxes. This is a customary practice done in foreign countries as well," a Foreign Ministry official said.
