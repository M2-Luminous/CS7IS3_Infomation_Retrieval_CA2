In a press conference, Chong who concurrently controls the board as its minister said the duties of the remaining six rank-1 officials will be readjusted after the reduction. "As other offices are expected to ask for increases in their authorized manpower when they formulate their 1995 budgets in May, it would be difficult to turn their requests down unless the EPB scales down its organization first," Chong said. He added that he would effect a reorganization of his board on the condition that his board's senior officials endorse it. "But, I will wind up the matter sooner or later without dragging it on through April," Chong said. The deputy premier also said that the major goal of this year's economic operation is to bring about economic energization in stability. "We will display our determination to ensure stability by pegging price rise down within 6 percent this year," he said.
