FR940516-2-00072 FR940516-2-00049 A.15␣Plans for Publication and Statistical Tabulation RTI will prepare a databook presenting outcome variables cross-tabulated by independent variables. A final results report will provide summary tables and/or graphics that present main findings and text that interprets and gives highlights of the main findings. Section B: Statistical Methods of Data Collection B.1␣Sampling Method and Respondent Universe B.1.1␣Target Population and Respondent Universe The target population, the desired inference population, comprises all public housing residents in the 48 coterminous States. The respondent universe or study population, defined as the portion of the target population actually being sampled from, is essentially the public housing residents in the 48 States that have listed telephone numbers. Because of undercoverage of this list source compared to the target population, that is, residents with no listed telephone and some that are not covered by the HUD address file (the 951 data base), special attention is being given to the sample allocation and to the construction of analysis weights to improve interferences relating to the target population. The basic source of sample residents will be the HUD 951 data base, which is basically an address file. The approximately 300,000 addresses on this file represent 68 percent of the 1.3 million public housing units in the United States. Those not represented are the result of nonreporting, data errors, and indefinite addresses (rural addresses, etc.) provided to HUD in response to the periodic mailout to all of the Public Housing Authorities. The circa 300,000 records identify on the average about three housing units each because of a single address and file record representing a multi-family unit in many cases. The respondent universe will be developed by matching these addresses to telephone listings. B.1.2␣Sampling Method The sample public housing resident will be selected in several phases beginning with a proportional stratified sample of approximately 25,000 addresses obtained from the 300,000 records on the 951 data base (proportional to the target population counts in 32 strata). The strata to be used at each phase are the cross of 4 Census Regions, 4 sizes of Housing Authority, and by housing for elderly versus other. The telephone numbers obtained from the addresses selected for matching will be subsampled, again using random stratified sampling with proportional allocation. The result will be a nearly self-weighting sample with respect to the target population. Approximately 2500 telephone numbers will be selected for fielding, possibly in two waves to facilitate early testing of analysis and weighting software and with expectation of obtaining 1500 interviews required for the study. Finally, any eligible individual (a resident of the household who is 18 years of age or older) will become the sample respondent. The sample of 1500 is expected to yield sampling errors ranging from about 2 to 4 percentage points for the required domain estimates when the estimates are near 50 percent (the domains will be approximately 15 percent or more of the total). B.2␣Procedures To Deal With Nonresponse Two categories of nonresponse are important in this survey: first, the undercoverage of the sampling frame and, second, the potential nonparticipation of those residents contacted. With regard to the potential for nonparticipation, we are making allowance for nonworking numbers, other types of loss, and approximately a 20 to 25 percent nonresponse by fielding 2500 numbers to obtain the required 1500 interviews. To deal with potential for nonresponse and undercoverage biases, we are also developing analysis weights that align the final sample with known control totals (with regard to the design strata defined above). Finally, other control totals will be compared to weighted frequencies (based on the initial analysis weights). Additional weight adjustments using iterative proportional fitting will be used as needed to agree with other important control totals (for example, age, race, metro/nonmetro). B.3␣Pretesting RTI staff conducted pretesting of the questionnaire during the second week of the contract. The testing included four cognitive interviews and eight telephone interviews with residents of public housing facilities in Durham, North Carolina. The four in-depth cognitive interviews lasted approximately 45 minutes each, including introductory and concluding comments. Respondents were paid $20 for participating in the interview. During each interview, the respondents listened to the survey questions and responded to each as appropriate. We used concurrent probing during the interview to obtain insight into how respondents were interpreting question wording and choosing the best response option. In addition, we asked respondents to comment on what we felt were the most sensitive items (for example, the gun ownership and income questions) in order to determine the likelihood that respondents would provide valid responses. We also conducted 8 telephone interviews to determine if there were any additional changes to the questionnaire that were needed due to the mode of administration. All respondents were paid $10 for completing the interview. These calls averaged about 25 minutes each. Three of these interviews were conducted by project survey specialists and methodologists. The remaining interviews were conducted by RTI Telephone Survey Unit (TSU) supervisors, and were monitored by one of the project survey specialists. After each of these interviews, the interviewer completed a debriefing form with the respondent and then answered a similar set of items gauging his or her perception of how well the questionnaire worked. Based on these pretest interviews, we prepared a series of recommendations which were faxed to HUD and used as the basis of a series of discussions of potential revisions. The revisions which were agreed upon were included in the final version of the questionnaire, which is included in Section B5.
