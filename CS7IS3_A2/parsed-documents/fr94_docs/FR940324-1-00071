FR940324-1-00071 FR940324-1-00021 In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere with state, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements are imposed on lenders by the regulations. These requirements, however, would not have a significant impact because they would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary federal supervision. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Sections 682.209, 682.210, and 682.211 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) These regulations affect lenders that participate in the FFEL Program. The Department needs and uses the information to properly carry out its responsibility to administer certain aspects of the HEA. Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information by approximately 7,500 lending institutions participating in the FFEL Program is expected to increase by a total of 49,000 hours. The collection and reporting of the information in ยง682.209(a) is expected to occur two million times per year, with each occurrence requiring lender processing time of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 20,000 hours. The collection and reporting of the information in ยง682.210(s)(6) is expected to occur 1.4 million times per year, with each occurrence requiring lender processing time of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 14,000 hours. The collection and reporting of the information in ยง682.211 (i) and (j) is expected to occur 1.5 million times per year, with each occurrence requiring lender processing time of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 15,000 hours. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Invitation To Comment Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations.
