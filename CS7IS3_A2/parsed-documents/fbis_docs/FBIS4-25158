The Fourth Plenary Session will make a decision on the issue of macroregulation and control of socialist market economy; and the issue of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and agriculture will also be the main topics at this plenary session. It is said that the other day, the central authorities pooled personnel from relevant departments and formed a group which shall be responsible for writing the plenary session's documents and, in accordance with the relevant decisions made by the top-level CPC authorities and on the basis of full procurement, analysis, investigation, and study of the various situations at home, will draw on the relevant experience of other countries and draft reports for the session. It was revealed that the CPC top echelon believes that to practice socialist market economy, it is necessary to study the issue of implementing macroregulation and control in the context of a market economy. In exercising macroregulation and control, an overall framework should be produced and fundamental measures recommended, just like the decision made at the Third Plenary Session. The CPC top echelon also thinks that the macroregulation and control exercised in the context of market economy should concentrate on the use of economic levers and legal means. Administrative means are necessary under certain circumstances, but as far as the overall macroregulation and control are concerned, it should not be used as a chief mode of regulation and control. The authoritative sources said that the theme of the Fourth Plenary Session recommended by the CPC top echelon has positive and immediate significance and considerations. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed a structural frame for the socialist market economic system. What the Fourth Plenary Session will seek to solve are new issues concerning management under this new structure. Recently, several standing committee members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee went to various places around the country to conduct investigation and research. For instance, General Secretary Jiang Zemin went to Shanghai, Premier Li Peng to Jiangsu and Shanghai, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to a number of provinces and municipalities. All of them went on those inspection tours with the same goal in mind, to obtain first-hand material.
