FR940620-2-00085 FR940620-2-00052 Federal Railroad Administration Southern Pacific Lines; (BS&hyph;AP&hyph;NO. 3289); Public Hearing The Southern Pacific Lines seeks approval of the proposed discontinuance and removal of the automatic block signal system, on the single main track, between Ashland, milepost C&hyph;429 and Glendale, milepost C&hyph;510, Oregon, on the Siskiyou District, Pacific Region, a distance of approximately 81 miles. This proceeding is identified as FRA Block Signal Application Number 3289. The FRA has issued a public notice seeking comments of interested parties and is conducting a field investigation in this matter. After examining the carrier's proposal, letters of protest, and available facts, the FRA has determined that a public hearing is necessary before a final decision is made on this proposal. Accordingly, a public hearing is hereby set for 10 a.m. on Thursday, July 28, 1994, in room 221 of the Federal Building and U.S. Court House, located at 211 East 7th Street, Eugene, Oregon. Interested parties are invited to present oral statements at the hearing. The hearing will be an informal one and will be conducted in accordance with Rule 25 of the FRA Rules of Practice (49 CFR Part 211.25), by a representative designated by the FRA. The hearing will be a nonadversary proceeding and, therefore, there will be no cross-examination of persons presenting statements. The FRA representative will make an opening statement outlining the scope of the hearing. After all initial statements have been completed, those persons wishing to make brief rebuttal statements will be given the opportunity to do so in the same order in which they made their initial statements. Additional procedures, if necessary for the conduct of the hearing, will be announced at the hearing. Issued in Washington, DC on June 15, 1994. Phil Olekszyk, Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety Compliance and Program Implementation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14939 Filed 6&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;P
