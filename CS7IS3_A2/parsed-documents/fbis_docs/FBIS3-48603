Samraong is destroyed! Samraong District, which is the seat of Oddar Meanchey Province, was attacked and destroyed by the people on the night of 24 January. Samraong District, which is the seat of Oddar Meanchey Province, which is the hotbed of corruption of the Vietnamese communist puppet ringleaders and Nhoek Bunchhai's group, was attacked and destroyed by 2,000 people. Samraong, the provincial seat of Oddar Meanchey, which is the frontline command post of the Vietnamese communist puppet army and field headquarters of Ke Kumyan, Pol Saroeun, Prum Samen, Long Sopheap, Eng Sopheap, Nhoek Bunchhai and a number of other generals with second-hand stars on their shoulders, was attacked and smashed by 2,000 people in and around Samraong on the night of 24 January. As a result of this people's attack, General Long Sopheap, commander of the 4th Military Region in Siem Reap; Gen. Prum Samen, representative of Vietnamese communist puppets' General Staff; Gen. Nhoek Bunchhai, who got his stars as a favor from the Americans; Eng Sopheap, Army commander and governor of Oddar Meanchey Province; and all other Vietnamese communist puppet ringleaders fled in disarray. Many were wounded. This is a punishment that the general public meted out to the evil puppet ringleaders serving the Vietnamese communists and the alliance. This is a great event, clearly proving that the people will not allow the evil Vietnamese communist puppet ringleaders to continue serving the Vietnamese communists in waging war to kill our nation and people.
