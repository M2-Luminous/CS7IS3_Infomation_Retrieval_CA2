[Juppe] Good evening. [Fauvet-Mycia] [passage omitted] We start with Bosnia and the first question from Sylvie Pierre-Brossolette of L'EXPRESS. [Pierre-Brossolette] Following the failure of the Geneva talks, you are proposing a complete review of the whole Bosnian issue. Is this a diplomatic way of saying that nothing more can be done, or do you really hope to get anything out of your current international contacts? [Juppe] Whatever the temptation, we cannot say that nothing more can be done. If I proposed a review of the issue, it is because the time has come to ask some fundamental questions. We have taken many initiatives since last April. France is behind the adoption of the UN resolution on sanctions; we can see its impact today. France also launched the idea of the security zones, which was adopted but not implemented. We, that is German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and myself are behind the plan which brought about the European Union initiative. All this has failed, and we must have the courage to say so. In Geneva in the last 48 hours, the various parties went back on the agreement in principle which they gave in November or December. As far as the NATO summit initiative launched on 10 and 11 January is concerned, it included two concrete operations: one to reopen the airport in Tuzla, the other to organize the relief of the Canadian contingent in Srebrenica. These operations are still bogged down in endless talks. This cannot go on like that. Should we leave? This is the question some are asking today, particularly in the foreign countries which are providing troops. What would be the consequences of a pullout? Have they been clearly assessed? [They are] the humanitarian catastrophe which would undoubtedly ensue, and the risk of a general conflagration in the region. Those who believe that a pull-out is unavoidable and who create the conditions for a pullout should weigh their responsibility in such a contingency. If a pull-out of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is ruled out, how can we get out of the diplomatic deadlock in which we are trapped today? Perhaps all the great powers, and not only the 12 countries of the European Union, should get more deeply involved in telling the three warring factions: That's enough now. [Questioner] Is that what you are now asking your partners to do? [Juppe] This is what I am assessing; this is what I said yesterday. With all our partners, I am now considering, if you allow me to say so, how we could bounce back. As you know, the American secretary of state will be in Paris over the weekend; I will meet him on Monday, I believe. I have contacts with my German and British colleagues too. In short, we must look for a way out of the deadlock in which the warring parties have trapped themselves. Things must be clearly said. At the start of the conflict, it was rightly said that the Serbs were the aggressors. They were the aggressors. The Croats too have a great deal to feel guilty about. However, today, all observers monitoring developments on the ground, and that includes the UNPROFOR staff which drafted telling reports, agree that the Bosnian army, the army of the Bosnian Muslims, has more equipment and more men and now considers that it can achieve its goals through war and not through negotiations. This must be said in order to apportion responsibilities to the various parties and to move forward. [Questioner] At a time when others are on the verge of giving up, do you believe that France will be able to remain the only one to say that something must be done? [Juppe] We cannot grow tired and as far as I am concerned, whatever the difficulties, I shall not grow tired. You are right to point out that when one considers what is happening on the international stage, France is probably the country that has done the most. First, thanks to its soldiers on the ground; they are playing a wonderful role. Then, through the financing, with its partners within the European Union, of the largest share of the humanitarian aid. And finally, through the multiplicity of its diplomatic initiatives, which I recalled earlier. [Questioner] Are you already considering that you might have to explain that soldiers in the area might have to pull out next spring or next winter? [Juppe] Earlier in this program I tried to outline the consequences of such a pullout, so before rushing into this easy solution which might be welcomed by some of our partners, we must think carefully and, I repeat, weigh all the consequences and look for other solutions. The other solution, which I believe is the only one which would prevent a disaster today, is a diplomatic initiative by all those who can influence the three warring factions. You can see today that some of these factions feel encouraged by the absence of our great international partners, encouraged to continue fighting. It must be put to them clearly that there is no solution in this direction. [Questioner] How do you explain the fact that General Cot has been recalled by the United Nations? Valery Giscard d'Estaing told the [National Assembly] Foreign Affairs Select Committee yesterday that General de Gaulle would have never accepted such a decision. How do you react to these remarks? [Juppe] I am a Gaullist, but I do not believe I am entitled to speak on behalf of General de Gaulle. [Questioner] What about the recall of Gen. Cot? Do you understand this? [Juppe] Listen, we were told that this was taking place in the framework of a rotation within the UN system. Having said that, I will remind you of something obvious, something simple which is not a criticism of anyone, namely, the supreme authority commanding Gen. Cot in the framework of UNPROFOR is the UN secretary general. [Questioner] Don't you believe that, at times, there are double standards and that the UN is sometimes harder on some French or European generals than it is on American generals, in Somalia for instance? [Juppe] Perhaps. [Questioner] Therefore we cannot understand the reactions and the arguments provoked by this recall. [Juppe] I did not condemn any reaction, I simply refuse to take part in any argument. Having said that, I will naturally mention this to the UN secretary general when we next meet. There is probably a problem. I believe this is the fourth general to have been thus expended, if I may use this word, by the UN in the former Yugoslavia. This means that this system must contain a certain number of -- how can I put it? -- a certain number of dysfunctions. [Questioner] Do you intend to visit the area and are these visits to the area useful? [Juppe] You know I am not very keen on media diplomacy, and in some of these visits, promotion through the media is often at the forefront. I might go there if it is useful, if it enables me to understand better, to have a constructive and positive meeting with the authorities in Sarajevo. [Questioner] Is this planned; have you got a date? [Juppe] I am considering the issue, but I have not decided on a date yet. [Fauvet-Mycia] Mr. Juppe, we have three short questions concerning foreign affairs. First, Algeria: Are you optimistic following the recent goodwill gestures made by the Algerian Government in favor of the Islamists? Do you expect more gestures? [Juppe] I am not optimistic as far as Algeria is concerned and I note that the situation is still deteriorating; there is, in particular, growing violence. I hear some people asking: What is France doing? I would like to point out that we do not hold the solution to all problems. First of all the Algerians themselves have to solve this conflict, which is looking more and more like a civil war. What we did first was to take the necessary security measures to prevent too many threats against our nationals. Unfortunately, these measures are not fully effective. We also encouraged the Algerian authorities to make some moves, since conservatism, the status quo, brings failure. They made some moves in the economic sphere. Unfortunately, the political climate is such that this economic reform, which will probably be included in the agreement which the Algerian Government reaches with the IMF, will certainly be extremely difficult to implement. The various ways for a meaningful dialogue must be explored. [Fauvet-Mycia] Let us go further east, to Saudi Arabia. You have just been there with Edouard Balladur. It was an obvious failure, you did not sign any contracts. What happened? Everyone is puzzled. Why go there if you do not bring back anything? What was the mistake? Was it because the Quai d'Orsay was not involved in the negotiations? [Juppe] We do not have such ambition. I have visited Saudi Arabia before, several ministers have visited it. It is absolutely necessary to have a close relationship with this country, which plays an important political and economic role. The prime minister rightly visited this country and, in particular, you will see that three large contracts will materialize in the coming days. [Fauvet-Mycia] Concerning which areas? [Juppe] You will know when they are announced. I am always very prudent where contracts are concerned. You must have two partners agreeing before you can announce anything. [Fauvet-Mycia] With regard to Franco-Chinese relations, Michel Rocard spoke of disgrace for France. I assume you will tell me that this is somehow disproportionate, but were all the necessary steps taken? Was the Quai d'Orsay left on the sidelines in this instance, too? [Juppe] Listen, one cannot just say anything -- I am naturally referring to Mr. Rocard. One of my very first goals when I became foreign minister was to re-establish normal relations with China. Every step came from our side. I have the list of the meetings which I chaired myself, or which the prime minister chaired at my request, in order to achieve this result. This is a diplomatic success which I am claiming as one of the achievements of French diplomacy and, once more, Mr. Rocard -- who has no clear idea whatsoever on foreign policy -- has lost the opportunity to remain silent. He may be obsessed with arms sales to Taiwan, that is his problem, but to choose between Taiwan and a country numbering 1.3 billion people, a country which is one of the world's leading powers, a country achieving an annual growth rate of 13.5 percent, to choose as he does is either shortsighted or evidence of a political negativism -- which by the way is Mr. Rocard's trademark. You will note that he has become Mr. Nyet -- he says no to everything; this is a kind of stubborness in the opposition which, it seems, is a sign of the future candidacy in the presidentioal elections. This has nothing to do with diplomacy. I repeat that I am deeply satisfied with what has been achieved, and the Quai d'Orsay played its full role in this, as might have been expected.
