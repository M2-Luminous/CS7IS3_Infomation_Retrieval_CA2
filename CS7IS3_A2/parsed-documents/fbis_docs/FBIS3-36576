The reason for this is their disagreement with Boris Yeltsin's edict transferring "Vympel" from the former Russian Federation Security Ministry to the jurisdiction of the Internal Affairs Ministry. "Vympel" is the well-known special subunit which was previously intended for combat operations and counterterrorist operations, including those carried out abroad. It was intended that "Vympel" would take part, along with "Alfa," in the October events and the taking of the White House, but the majority of officers in the special subunit refused to participate in the storming and on 4 October sat in buses near the U.S. Embassy. A highly placed source in the Federal Counterintelligence Service, who asked not to be named because "Vympel" had left them in the fall of 1993, reported nevertheless that the special subunit had effectively collapsed. According to him, on the eve of the October events "Vympel" was transferred to the command of the Russian Federation Main Protection Directorate, and then followed the president's edict transferring it to the Internal Affairs Ministry system. However, according to the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen," men in uniform cannot be transferred to another department without their agreement. The source stressed that, according to his information, the officers of the special subunit had come to serve not directly in "Vympel" but in the state security service, which for them was fundamental. He confirmed that the overwhelming majority of "Vympel" officers and NCO's, not wishing to serve under Hero of Russia Viktor Yerin [the internal affairs minister], had applied for discharge. According to the law, this can be regarded as discharge in connection with personnel organizational changes, which brings with it the retention of pensions and all benefits. However, in the source's opinion, terrorism has existed and will continue to exist notwithstanding the wishes of the country's authorities, and it is fundamentally impossible to rely on "Alfa" alone to combat terrorism; therefore the question of creating new counterterrorist groups will arise in the very near future. According to the source, money or benefits is not the main issue for the former state security officers. He cited by way of example the reaction of the Lefortovo detention center's guards to its transfer to the Internal Affairs Ministry system. According to the source, the overwhelming majority of Lefortovo guards also intend to submit severance notices.
