Indeed, it looks as if Spain, like Italy, is going to leave the EMBL. Netherlands representatives within the European Molecular Biology Organization [EMBO] fear that this domino effect will affect basic research, because even the German, French, and British are complaining. Unlike in the Netherlands, in most countries the contribution to the EMBL is drawn from the local research budget. Together, these contributions constitute an annual budget of approximately 70 million guilders. However, since the pressure from the current economic recession in Europe causes compulsive economizing, many countries want to see a greater return on their considerable investments. The funds are managed by the European Molecular Biology Conference [EMBC] and the EMBL Council, which comprises representatives from the various countries involved. The representatives for the Netherlands are Professor Dr. Peter van der Vliet (Physiological Chemistry, Utrecht University) and Marga Vintges M.Sc. (Science Policy, Education and Science Ministry). Van der Vliet is not enthusiastic about the increasing hesitation on the part of the various member states. "I find their attitude rather short-sighted. In most countries, the emphasis is shifting to short-term, application-oriented research, but important new results are achieved on the basis of long-term, basic research, such as that carried out at the EMBL. Normally, the best researchers are needed for basic research, and they cannot be selected on the basis of political decisions. No Money Available The EMBL has been dogged by financial shortages for some time now. Frustration at the limited budget available for new projects was the reason why in April of last year, Swedish Professor Dr. Lennart Philipson, the man behind the eminence of the EMBL, unexpectedly resigned. At his instigation, the Council regularly agreed to take on new projects, but a number of countries refused to make enough money available to carry them out. Consequently, the projects had to be cancelled. Philipson's successor, Greek Professor Dr. Fotis Kafatos, is expected to be more successful, notably because he has better contacts with the European Union [EU] officials who have a great deal of money to distribute. The attractiveness of the EMBO, the governing organization, is also under threat, for it is facing growing competition from similar programs initiated by the EU and by individual European countries. In many cases, these programs offer more favorable conditions. For instance, unlike the EMBO, the European Union offers allowances for chemicals, and higher salaries. Quality Is the Watchword The EMBO was set up in 1969, when one of its primary objectives was to become the face of basic research on molecular biology in Europe. It was also supposed to counterbalance U.S. organizations in the same area. Primarily thanks to political and diplomatic support from Switzerland, the organization quickly received contributions from many countries, including the Netherlands. Quality is the watchword for all activities undertaken at the EMBO. With its 32.2 citations per publication, the EMBL in Heidelberg ranks among the top five laboratories scoring the highest impact figures in the world. The "EMBO JOURNAL" is one of the most influential scientific journals. Its impact figure of 12.4 means that of all journals in the molecular biology sector it must bow only to CELL (which has an impact figure of 30.2). In addition, EMBO scholarships are recognized as a mark of quality. Hence its researchers are welcomed with open arms in most laboratories. Furthermore, the research groups which are allied to the organization, but accommodated in the European Synchotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble and the Hamburg Synchotron Laboratory, enjoy international recognition. The many small workshops and laboratory courses that are organized thanks to the financial support of the EMBO, satisfy a great need, and contribute greatly to the good contacts maintained between European researchers.
