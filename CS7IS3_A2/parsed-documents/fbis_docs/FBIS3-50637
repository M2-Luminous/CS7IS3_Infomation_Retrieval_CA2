Peasants can be seen carrying their belongings on this stretch of road, but there is no presence of rebels or the regular Army--whose presence is demanded by residents--as in the preceding days. Residents of Elzay, a community of 300 Tzeltal Indians, who advanced on the route said that the guerrillas were entrenched in the community of Tolbeja, approximately eight km from Oxchuc. Peasant Sebastian Lopez said that all the Elzay residents were leaving that community, because the members of the EZLN [Zapatista National Liberation Army] "considered us their enemies, because we were not with them." The Indians who are fleeing are forced to walk, because public transportation service has been suspended as a result of the insecurity of traveling on the road in addition to the many barricades placed along the way. In the communities leading from Altamirano, residents say they only have enough food for a few days, and in the places where there is telephone service the lines have been cut. "Here, there is no authority, and the military has not come to set things straight after the EZLN members left," an Oxchuc resident explained. "We do not have water, electricity, or food, and we are asking for the Army's help," said Gloria Clemente, 30, a resident of Altamirano, a town that was abandoned this morning by rebel forces.
