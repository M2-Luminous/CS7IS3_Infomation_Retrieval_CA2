Iran's chief prosecutor, Ayatollah Abolfazl Musavi Tabrizi, said authorities had arrested Mojahedin members "sent from Iraq with the aim of carrying out sabotage activities." A Mojahedin spokesman "described these lies as part of the regime's stage-managed ploys to attribute the massacre of the worshippers of Imam Reza's Shrine to the Mojahedin," according to a statement faxed to AFP in Nicosia. A bomb explosion in the northeastern city of Mashhad Monday [20 June] left 25 people dead and 70 wounded, Iran's interior ministry said. Tabrizi did not say how many were arrested or if they were linked to the bombing. The Iranian authorities have repeatedly blamed the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization for cross-border attacks and bombing incidents inside the country, including Monday's explosion. The rebel group has strongly denied any involvement in the bombing.
