"We at TVPolonia are all taking the fact that we could not start relays in the United States as a personal failure. It is not because of the lack of goodwill from the Polish side; we failed because our American partner could not bear the burden," Wasiuta explained. An agreement with him was signed last year during the chairmanship of Janusz Zaorski of what was then state radio and television. The board of the Polish Television Company will have to decide whether to continue this initiative. Wasiuta added that the issue now is "whether we should be looking for a partner by means of a Wall Street marketing bureau for between $5,000 and $15,000 a month and sign an agreement within three months, or whether we should apply the same method, that is, to get in touch with a Pole who does not give any guarantees but has goodwill." He said that TVPolonia management's option is to employ a professional company, which would look for a partner and check if "he has the money and power to sell the television." The acceptance of that option depends, however, on the board of the Polish Television Company. In Wasiuta's opinion the relay of the program itself to America poses no problem. The issue is whether Polish Americans want to tune in to TVPolonia. "Production is a third of the success that depends upon the ability to sell the product," he said.
