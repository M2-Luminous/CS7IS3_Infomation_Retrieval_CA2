At the beginning of this year, when we look ahead, we have every reason to believe that great successes in reform will definitely be achieved in the new year. As everyone knows, the theme of reform in the 1980's was to smash the old system, which was a project of "demolishing the old house," whereas the major task of reform in the future is to set up a new system, which is a project of "constructing a building." In a sense, the latter is even more difficult than the former because reform today has begun to shift from a shallow level to a deep level and from achieving successes in single areas to making overall progress. Reform at a deep level determines that we have to undertake arduous tasks. So, in 1994, what kind of reform tasks are we going to face? According to officials of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, following a long period of repeated deliberations, studies, and estimates, in the new year reform will be deepened and breakthroughs will be made in many fields, including taxation; finance; investment; the foreign trade system; social security; the housing system; the civil service system; the wage system of executive organs, institutions, and units; and price reform. There are two foci in these numerous reforms: Efforts will be made to transform the state-owned enterprise operating mechanism and to make innovations in the enterprise system and, at the same time, to speed up reforms in the taxation, finance, planning, and investment systems and to make important strides forward in establishing a macroscopic regulation system in line with the requirements of the market economy. To fulfill these arduous tasks in reform, we must ultimately achieve three goals: 1) We must establish a modern enterprise system which meets the requirements of the market economy and in which the property rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise management are separated, and scientific management is established; 2) With emphasis on developing the market of factors of production, we must develop a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market system; 3) We must study and establish a positive and effective system of state macroscopic regulation and policies as well as a whole set of national economic statistical indexes and laws and regulations so as to maintain a basic equilibrium of total supply and demand, to help optimize the economic structure, and to lead to sustained and healthy development of the national economy. Experts generally hold that to fulfill these tasks and achieve the set reform goals, we must uphold the reform strategy of making overall progress in a coordinated manner. We must not only carry out a comprehensive design of reform from a coordinated angle but also consider the arrangement of each and every reform measure from a comprehensive angle. The reform in 1994, which touches a wide range of areas, is a complicated and formidable systematic project. Reform which is carried out in a wide scope at a deep level involves the readjustment of the pattern of power and interests on all sides. Hence, to fulfill these tasks, we must on the one hand be fully confident of victory, but on the other hand we must be psychologically prepared for difficulties which may arise, insist on scientific design, work prudently, sum up the situation promptly, and avoid making big mistakes. The conditions are favorable. First, our party constantly clarifies the orientation and objectives of reform and perfects theories of reform, thus creating a favorable political environment; second, 15 years of reform and opening up have enabled millions of people to more consciously take part in this great practice, thus creating a more favorable social environment and public opinion. In addition, as the people's living standard is being improved day by day and they are in hot pursuit of new systems and things, all these factors also strengthen their perseverance in reform, thus creating a better environment of psychological acceptance. We have nowhere to retreat. The establishment of a socialist market economic system is a pioneering undertaking unprecedented in human history, and we are required to accomplish this great cause with unprecedented courage. We are full of hope in the new year and toward the future.
