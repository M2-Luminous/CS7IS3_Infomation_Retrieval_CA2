Brazauskas declared this to the Russian service of Lithuanian national radio, which he visited on Thursday together with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius. Brazauskas underlined that this political move should not be viewed as an intention "to change or to toughen relations with Russia and other states." In his words, leaders of all European countries should have reached an agreement on creation of "a single security umbrella." Slezevicius added that "Lithuania's orientation towards the West does not represent any innovation in our foreign policy" and integration into the European security system, such as NATO, "would be a premise for stabilizing the situation in the region, and this is important both for Lithuania and all neighboring states."
