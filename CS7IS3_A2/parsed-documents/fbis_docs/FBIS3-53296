This is the unchanged position of the Israeli entity's officials. What we find peculiar is that this demand is made on the eve of the U.S.-Syrian summit and at a time of preparations for further negotiations, particularly on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. Deputy Sadqi warned Lebanese officials against falling into the traps set up by the Israeli enemy, and he called on them to stand firmly by our legitimate and just rights. He called on Lebanese officials not only to insist on Israel's withdrawal from all Lebanese territories but also to hand back all the Lebanese land and water resources that it has usurped. He pointed out that Israel has confiscated 13 farms constituting all the agricultural land of Shib'a.
