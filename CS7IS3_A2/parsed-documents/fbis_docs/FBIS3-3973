Since then, Lei Feng, as a glorious paragon of the younger generation, and the Lei Feng spirit, as an invaluable component of our nation's spiritual wealth, have had a profound influence on the healthy growth of successive generations of a new type of socialist-minded people. Although 31 eventful years have passed, the banner of the Lei Feng spirit, as dazzlingly brilliant as ever, still encourages and inspires us to bravely forge ahead on the road of socialist modernization. Comrade Lei Feng was an outstanding representative of a new generation of people who grew up under the nurturing influence of our party, Army, and people. He was an advanced model who has had the most extensive, enduring, and profound influence in the socialist period. In the vast land of China, Lei Feng's name is known to all people, including women and children, and his ordinary but great deeds have always been widely read and emulated by the people. From Ouyang Hai to Wang Jie and Liu Yingjun and from Su Ning and Zhu Boru to Xu Honggang, people have drawn tremendous spiritual strength from Lei Feng; from thousands upon thousands of learn-from-Lei Feng groups -- which are active inside and outside the military barracks -- to the "Young Volunteers' Action," which are springing up in large numbers throughout the country, they all represent the development and expansion of the Lei Feng spirit. Over the past several decades, Lei Feng's name has been closely linked with the image of the People's Army and the advanced strata of society, and the Lei Feng spirit has frequently been accompanied by the spiritual outlook of striving for progress and by social justice and intuitive knowledge. When a worrisome phenomenon emerged in general practices in society, people sighed with feeling, "Uncle Lei Feng has disappeared," to emphatically show their profound longing and call for the Lei Feng spirit. When the social outlook showed signs of healthy improvement, the people cheered, "Uncle Lei Feng has returned," to fully express their heartfelt pleasure and praise at the rise of the Lei Feng spirit. A host of vivid facts proves that the Lei Feng spirit has come into being and has developed because the people, society, and the age require it. Another reason for the great vitality of the Lei Feng spirit is that it has heartily embodied the political consciousness, lofty moral character, and lifetime goals that all communists and revolutionary fighters should have. They are: Always listen to the party, unswervingly follow the party, and be loyal to the socialist cause; with the "nail spirit" of assiduously studying revolutionary theories, strive to master Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought; persist in wholeheartedly serving the people and devote our limited lifetimes to the unlimited cause of serving the people; conscientiously maintain hard struggle, a high standard of work, and a low standard of living; love whatever jobs we are given, try to be proficient in whatever we do, and strive to perform meritorious deeds and train ourselves in our work posts, and so on. Shining with the radiance of socialist and communist thought, the Lei Feng spirit is the fusion of the spirit of the times and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation; it is the concrete embodiment of a revolutionary outlook on life and of revolutionary values. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Whoever wants to be a true communist should learn from Comrade Lei Feng's moral character and style." If our officers and men want to become revolutionary servicemen with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of discipline, they should conscientiously learn from the Lei Feng spirit. If our Army wants to stand in the front ranks of society in building socialist spiritual civilization, it should vigorously promote the Lei Feng spirit. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, earthshaking great changes have taken place in our country. The situation today is indeed vastly different from what it was when Lei Feng was alive. However, the Lei Feng spirit is not outdated. While engaging in our modernization drive, we have more great needs for advanced ideas to arouse our will to fight. This is because Lei Feng spirit is completely in tune with the principal melody of the times being promoted. Promoting Lei Feng spirit is not only needed in building socialist spiritual civilization but also provides a powerful spiritual motivating force for building socialist material civilization. The modernization drive requires Lei Feng spirit which, in turn, also boosts the modernization drive. Only by vigorously promoting Lei Feng spirit can we firmly act according to the party Central Committee's plans and requirements; cultivate an environment of public opinion which is favorable to reform; correctly approach the adjustment of interests; consciously work under the overall situation; resist and oppose the corrosion of money worship, pleasure-seeking, ultra-individualism, and other decadent ideas; correctly handle the relationships between state, collective, and individual interests; ensure the healthy and orderly development of the socialist market economy; and observe market economic principles, promote socialist styles, and attain the goal of common prosperity by exerting ourselves, getting rich through hard work, aiding the poor, and waging struggle in unity. Therefore, the more we develop the socialist market economy, the more we should promote the Lei Feng spirit. Lei Feng's deeds are both ordinary and great and the Lei Feng spirit is both plain and lofty. Consequently, it is of universal significance and it reflects the higher requirements for building socialist spiritual civilization. The strategic principle for the new period laid down by the military commission requires us to conscientiously study and master knowledge in modern science and culture, especially in high and new science. If we have the Lei Feng spirit, not only will it provide us with a powerful spiritual motivating force to scale heights in science, culture, and technology, but it will also ensure that we apply what we have learned in serving the people and the motherland, exerting our utmost strength for Army modernization and contributing to the magnificent edifice of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Far from rejecting it, we need the Lei Feng spirit even more while mastering modern scientific knowledge and culture. While striving to raise the scientific and cultural levels of officers and men and speeding up the process of attaining the magnificent objective of building a revolutionary, modern, and regular army, we should hold still higher the banner of the Lei Feng spirit. All the leading collectives of the three generations, i.e., the party Central Committees with Comrades Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin as the core, have vigorously advocated the Lei Feng spirit and have personally written inscriptions for the learn-from-Lei Feng activities. This is an important reason why the activities have been so extensive and long-lasting as never before. As Lei Feng came from the People's Army, his comrades-in-arms should all the more take him as a paragon forever, turn the Lei Feng spirit into an enduring action, and constantly raise the learn-from-Lei Feng activities and the building of spiritual civilization in the Army to a new level. The Lei Feng spirit shines forever!
