Gaviria had an hour-long talk with Mas Canosa, and, according to the delegation of Cuban exiles, they discussed the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba, which anti-Castro groups have strongly criticized. According to Mas Canosa's retinue, they also analyzed the future of relations between Cuba and the United States in the wake of Gaviria's election to the post of OAS secretary general on 27 March. Two weeks ago, Huber Matos, head of the Independent and Democratic Cuba [Independent and Democratic Cuba--CID] movement visited Colombia to request suspension of the oil sale to Castro's government, but he did not meet with Gaviria, because, he said, he was not expecting to be received by "Castro's pals." Matos, one of the commanders of the triumphant 1959 revolution, which Castro now heads, said the oil sale means the rupture of the economic embargo the United States imposed on Cuba 30 years ago. Colombia announced it will supply approximately 20,000 barrels of crude a day to Cuba starting in July, under the condition Cuba guarantees the operation with the corresponding letters of credit. Castro opponents oppose the transaction, however, and threaten to boycott Colombian products in the United States.
