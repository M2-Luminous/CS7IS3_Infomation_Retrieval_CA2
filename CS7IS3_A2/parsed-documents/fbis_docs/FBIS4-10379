He said: "I do not think it was the right time for Colombia and Cuba to reestablish relations. I maintain that position, because when President Castro visited Colombia, all ?he reporters of Colombia and the world asked him if he condemned the armed struggle, and a condemnation of the Colombian guerrillas never came out of his lips." Pastrana also said Colombia should seek the means to join NAFTA, because it would increase foreign investments and help the country compete in international markets.
