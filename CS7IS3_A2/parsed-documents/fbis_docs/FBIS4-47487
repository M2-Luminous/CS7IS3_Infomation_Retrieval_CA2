D. Mukhamedyarov, doctor of technical sciences; UDC 621.383.8] [Abstract] The properties and advantages of optoelectronic instruments with a symmetric input are reviewed, including the author's initial work along these lines. However, the emphasis here is explanation of the theoretical and practical basis for the algebraic-geometric synthesis of the structure of two- and three-channel optoelectronic systems with a symmetric input involving the two geometric operations of shifting and rotation of the input transducers and six algebraic operations in the electronic channel. This makes it possible to obtain new synergetic functional capabilities -- the combining of system elements and components resulting in a considerably greater effect than with their simple addition, thereby achieving a considerably higher quality level. This ensures obtaining a linear zone of the output function with a prestipulated accuracy; control of steepness (response) and range of the output function from tenths of a unit to several thousands; invariance to the strength of the input signals; reduction of the errors associated with nonidentity of the channels by a factor of ten. Accordingly, the accuracy of three-channel systems is an order of magnitude greater than for two-channel systems. The practical introduction of this method in the designing and fabrication of various specialized instruments will make it possible to reduce their size and weight by a factor of 3-8, considerably enhance their useful life and reliability.
