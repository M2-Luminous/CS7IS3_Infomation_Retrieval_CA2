Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb noted that, to fulfill the request, Belarusian specialists may even have to go abroad. They will have to examine issues concerning the training of personnel and holding consultations on possible financial and technical assistance. The "Partnership for Peace" initiative, the state leader believes, includes aspects that are both admissible and not entirely admissible to the Republic. The participation of Belarusian servicemen in peacekeeping missions aimed at preventing conflicts on territories of other states was described by Mechyslaw Ivanavich as one of the inadmissible aspects. If a decision is made to join the initiative, the document may be signed as early as this year, Mechyslaw Hryb stated.
