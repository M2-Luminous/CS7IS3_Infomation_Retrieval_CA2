Unlike the former minister, who asked that everything he ever wrote be forgotten--although Cardoso claims he never said it and several others claim they heard him say it--Ricupero takes pride in his literary production. Whereas Cardoso throws his books on the bonfire, the ambassador distributes his works, even those not yet unpublished, and pleads with the newspapers to discuss ideas, concepts, and projects instead of trivial intrigues. Ricupero complains: "They have already tried to plant news items about me." Despite having to administer the most delicate phase of the program--the building of a new currency, which is when the plan actually begins, according to Delfim Netto--Ricupero still finds time to devote himself to the study of parallel issues having to do with the future of the Brazilian economy. Some of his favorite topics are the rigidity of the labor market, the straitjacket that the state is in because of mandated expenditures, trade relations between underdeveloped countries and the First World, and, lastly, social security reform. There are similarities, however, between Ricupero and Cardoso. Since Ricupero took over from Cardoso at the beginning of the month, both men have continued--or would like to continue--to be what they were before. Even as minister of finance, Ricupero has not stopped his classes ("it's therapy"), his masses at the Sao Bento Monastery, or his daily duties. Even as a senator, Cardoso sees himself in the role of minister of finance, with an eye on the success of the stabilization plan and the succession. "Everyone knows that the plan is mine," he said shortly after stepping down as minister. Seen from another angle, there are no differences between the two at all. Both are expected to vote for the same candidate in the presidential elections in October and November. New Ideas Are Always Welcome One of Minister Ricupero's bedside books is that by economist Jose Pastore of the University of Sao Paulo, who compares social security taxes in Brazil with those in the rest of the world. For every cruzeiro that a businessman pays a worker, 81 centavos have to be sent to the government for programs concerned with assistance, insurance, guarantee funds, retirement, and so on. According to Pastore, Brazil "is a country with high social security taxes and low wages." Ricupero supports deregulation of the labor market as a means of stimulating employment. "The results of that rigidity are an informal economy and under-the-counter dealings," he says. Pastore says that for the businessman, it is more advantageous to convert social security taxes into wages than to keep them as fixed costs payable to the government. The director of the Interunion Department for Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese), Sergio Mendonca, does not trust deregulation. "No one can guarantee that social security taxes would be transferred to the worker," he says. But Mendonca admits that the state services received by the public in exchange for those taxes is of extremely poor quality and subject to corruption. In his book, Pastore shows that social security taxes are higher in Brazil than in any European country. The only one that comes close is France. Reputation as `Lunatic' Does Not Worry Him Minister of Finance Rubens Ricupero will soon publish one of his latest books in Chile. Completed in March, it deals with the international system of trade. The title talks about "disagreements resulting from unrequited love," with the author criticizing the fact that trade in the underdeveloped world has been liberalized with no corresponding move by the rich countries. Ricupero attacks "the righteous indignation of the preachers of free trade, who reserve their holy anger for industrial subsidies while ignoring agricultural subsidies." Ricupero also attacks the less transparent obstacles that have been replacing tariff barriers. They constitute so-called nontariff protectionism, in which quotas or obstacles of an ecological nature--such as the "green stamp"--and so on are adopted. But the minister does not limit his remarks to a Manichaean and Third-Worldist opposition between North and South. According to him, confrontation over liberalization has occurred many times between the United States and the European Community or, occasionally, Japan and other developed nations. Since Brazil's trade is diversified, Ricupero supports a general opening up of foreign markets. The ambassador also cultivates the reputation as a "lunatic" which he has among some ministers, especially military ministers, because of his habit of expatiating on loftier subjects. But he describes himself as pragmatic and as a follower of the ethic of responsibility proposed by Max Weber, which says that the results of one's acts are more important than one's intentions. For that reason, Ricupero has been intransigent--as he himself admits--on the issue of the minimum wage. Considering all the ideas that Ricupero delves into, Camoes might have written: "such a big project for such a short life." Ricupero has less than nine months ahead of him in the Ministry of Finance. One Complaint: the State's Straitjacket During his visit to Congress on Wednesday, Ambassador Ricupero complained about the straitjacketing of the state. "I am a minister of finance with control over 7 percent of the budget; the rest is the prisoner of mandated expenditures." Ricupero has been influenced by his friend, Deputy Jose Serra (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Sao Paulo), who in Congress is one of the main opponents of compulsory transfers. Transfers to states and municipalities rose from 11.8 percent of the Union's revenues in 1983 to 18.8 percent 10 years later. In 1992, nearly half of the social security budget was committed in the form of mandated expenditures. The 1988 Constitution also requires that 18 percent of total tax collections be spent on education. In the labors of Hercules involved in the economic plan, one of the most difficult problems was the blockage of funds, which instead of going to mayors and governors, had to be transferred to the Emergency Social Fund. Serra uses the argument that mandated expenditures prevent the government from being flexible enough to alter priorities in spending, the result being a harmful effect on the tax system. "The Union tends to increase taxes typical of monetary policy, which are not transferred to the states and municipalities, in order to increase its revenues," the deputy says. Serra also says that one mandated expenditure leads to another because each sector is trying to defend itself. The Ministry of Health is demanding that 30 percent of the social security revenues be given to it. The government's goal under the Unified Health System (SUS) is to transfer income and expenditure related to hospital care to the state and municipal governments.
