But even following Boris Nikolayevich's speech, I believe, the main questions of the country's development and its emergence from the crisis remain pertinent. Urgent, decisive, and unerring actions in order first of all to slow down and then to halt the decline in production are needed. A powerful drive mechanism is needed. Incentives to labor are needed. Can the state today create the conditions for the most productive labor of each employee? Of course it can! But the following conditions, in my view, are needed for this. The first and main condition is a fair evaluation of the labor of each employee. The utopian socialism of Lenin and Stalin collapsed because Soviet man's vested interest in the results of labor was incredibly low. Labor was essentially compulsory and differed little from camp labor. It has remained such today also, for that matter. Why work hard if this does not bring about a rise in the living standard? The individual's detachment from the profits he produces makes him indifferent to the very process of labor. And, on the other hand, a link with profits from joint labor engenders a desire to work with maximum input. This is easily achieved with the outfit's lease of the instruments of production or their transfer to joint ownership. It is very important in this case to fairly distribute the instruments of production shares. It is simple and efficient to divide them up according to length of service and pay over the past three or four years. When we retire, no one objects to this procedure then. Why not use it for the distribution of property? A second version is possible also: the property remains state-owned, but is leased to the outfit for a symbolic fee. In a closed stock company collective property cannot be sold. There is for this reason just one way of living better--working hard and in high-quality fashion. But everyone should be confident that no one can appropriate the results of his labor and should for this know his percentage of the enterprise's monthly profits which it has been decided to transfer to the wage fund. Only the producers' vested interest in making a profit can raise productivity and labor quality. The basis of market price regulation is competition. But what kind of competition can there be in a monopoly state-run economy other than competition between enterprises to raise prices? Whoever raises the most, as at an auction! I am speaking about indisputable, rudimentary matters, about the thousand-fold tried-and-tested experience of economic development. But we, as always, have our own way. So the market train is idling beneath the magnificent arches of a station called Government Monopoly. A unique situation has taken shape with us today. The executive has practically abandoned not only our property but also ourselves to the whim of the waves. Consequently, we need to persuade or compel the administrative-bureaucratic machinery to give back, finally, our property directly to the producers and citizens of Russia. We are all the legitimate, direct heirs of our fathers, grandfathers, and great grandfathers. Consequently, we are the owners of this property. There is no need to redeem it: Any plant recoups costs in several years. The years have passed, the plants have been redeemed. And who is to pay? For what? According to what law? After all, the state, represented by its bureaucratic machinery, cannot regard these means of production as its own private property. But it is being grabbed by those who are stronger and more impudent. In order to change the slave mentality we need to afford the individual the opportunity to dispose of the fruits of his labor. Hand the plants, factories, institutes, and agricultural enterprises over to the people who want to work independently, are not afraid of risk, and believe in their own powers. They would work at full stretch and invent and apply the latest technology. They would work not eight but, if need be, 10 hours. They would cut back on their leave. It would not occur to them to stop production on holidays, and they would not think up new days off for themselves, as is the case now. What kind of people is it does, having made a hash of the economy, does not work for half a year just about?! Today the government's statistical office shamefully does not report to us on how things stand with regard to productivity. But we know, in any case, that it has fallen sharply. And whatever reason our economists and political scientists give to explain this, one thing is clear: People no longer wish to plow for others, they wish to plow for themselves. So give them this opportunity! Second condition. Having tackled the first, most important task, we will realize that this is insufficient. For the worker, even one owning property, can easily immediately be fleeced by taxes, being deprived of the opportunity to make a profit. We know how to suffocate with taxes, we have mastered this art well. It is difficult now to enumerate our taxes, they are more than 15, it seems. The result is that we punish good work! Heck, we should have Genghis Khan, after all, his "yasak" [tribute] was only one-tenth, only 10 percent! His bureaucrat-brother, on the other hand, 70 percent! He does not understand, this sharp mind, that he is simply undermining the tax base itself, that he is cutting the branch on which he is sitting. That ultimately he will have nothing to collect from anyone. It is essential that our authorities recognize that it is rich enterprises, rich works, and rich people who should be the basis of the country's budget. Let them replenish it with one tax--income tax--and social charges. Previously Russia lived with one tax--a poll tax--and that sufficed. The country's budget should be filled up also by customs duty, a land tax, a property tax, and a tax on the sale of raw material (under strict control, of course) since we are a country that is very rich in terms of material reserves. But collecting profits from moribund enterprises, factories, agricultural enterprises is the same as taking bread away from a participant in the Leningrad blockade. Dying enterprises are a separate problem. They are on the point of declaring themselves bankrupt, and thousands upon thousands of workers and employees will be unemployed. We will have to pay them enormous sums from our money. But would it not be better today to exempt them from profits taxes and afford an opportunity for the rescue of the enterprises and rectification of their economic position? Having become the proprietors, the work force should switch to a new type of remuneration of labor. We have over decades become used to obtaining remuneration for labor in the form of a certain ration. This does not work. The remuneration of the labor of each should be part of the income of the enterprise over a particular stretch of time, and at the end of the year, part of the profits used to pay dividends. Fairness in remuneration and economic glasnost are the basis of the high productivity, good conduct, and creative initiative of each member of the work force. The third condition of success is the maximum encouragement of investments in production. A most important question of the efficient functioning of the economy is the creation of new technology and its purchase overseas. The government must contribute to this to the maximum. Customs duty on new technology should, therefore, be made purely symbolic. Enormous investments are required for reequipping the plants and factories. According to the most modest estimates, 25 percent of all industrial enterprises should be modernized. And this would cost a minimum of R1.5 quadrillion. The national budget, on the other hand, constitutes R120-130 trillion. Understandably, the state cannot cope with such a task with its forces. But it can create the conditions for large-scale investments of its own and overseas entrepreneurs. Every year native entrepreneurs take $20-25 billion out of Russia. This money is going to develop the economies of Western countries, since investing it in production here is unprofitable (and unsafe: It is impossible to predict changes in the economic and political situation). The entrepreneur needs dependability and stability. So he is taking his capital abroad. So the conclusion suggests itself: Modernization of the existing enterprises and the construction of new ones will only be a reality when it is more profitable for the investors to do this on our territory than in other countries. Investors should be the most esteemed people. They are truly the saviors of the fatherland from ultimate economic and moral collapse. I would recall that even in such economically developed countries as the United States any investor is wholly exempted from a tax on profits for three years, the local authorities help him obtain cheap credit, and he encounters a "green light" literally at every step. The president and parliament are called upon to urgently pass a law on investments. This law must make the position of investors with us more favorable than in other countries. It is essential to exempt new enterprises from a tax on profits for five years, assist in the purchase of land, and guarantee the supply of energy, water, and other elements of the infrastructure. Were we to create conditions whereby exporting dollars overseas would be an unprofitable business and they came to be invested in the development of industry in Russia, 500,000 jobs could be organized for this sum annually. And were we to add to this the investments of states and entrepreneurs from overseas, this could ward off the impending unemployment, and in politics, nationalism developing into fascism, for which a slump in production is the most nutrient medium. The fourth condition of success is connected with the price of raw material. We are doggedly proclaiming our aspiration to move toward free world prices for raw material, without seeing, however, how dangerous this is for the development of our economy. Successful production is possible only where the price of raw material accords with the level of technology and the state infrastructure (roads, power engineering, transport, communications). So free world prices of raw material could simply strangle us. Our producer, still weak, could not create products which could compete in terms of price with the products of more developed countries. This is why it is necessary first to create an infrastructure similar to the world infrastructure and only then to gradually release the prices of raw material. A tremendous stream of raw material is crossing our borders today, not the export product of our plants and factories. The borders should be closed to unchecked exports of raw material, and it is necessary for a transitional period to establish prices that afford an opportunity for making the products of our plants competitive. Currently, for example, the cost of the VAZ-21099 automobiles on the domestic market is $10,000, but overseas they sell for $3,500. It is not hard to understand that the plant costs of raw material (ore, metal, energy) are being covered from the pockets of our citizen. It should, however, be made clear that there is also raw material whose exportation would be profitable to us in all respects. Thus there are on the Kola peninsula incalculable deposits of the dumping of apatite-cephalin production, with which our industry will never cope and which, moreover, are very harmful environmentally. Exports of these "tailings" or their development would be of great interest to many foreign companies. So total prohibition is needless here. But, in any event, it is essential prior to the achievement of normal market relations to monopolize exports of raw material exports in the hands of a specialized state committee under the strict control of the State Duma. Fifth and final condition. The country cannot function normally without development of the infrastructure. This means transport arteries, power engineering, the banking system, communications. Substantial capital investments are needed here. No budget resources of ours would be sufficient for this. Consequently, investments in the infrastructure of the resources of private individuals, enterprises, and foreign entrepreneurs are needed. This applies primarily to means of communication, without which a market economy is impossible. The absence of a market infrastructure is severely impeding the transition of the economy of barracks socialism to a market economy. The monopolization by the state, the bureaucratic machinery, in fact, of the entire infrastructure leads to the dictatorship of the official prices of energy, land, and transport. And for this reason not one self-respecting businessman will take the risk of production in our country. Mixed types of ownership in communications, transport, power engineering, and other sectors could ensure stable and competitive prices. Free labor would afford an opportunity for breathing new life into agricultural production also. The countryside could obtain from the prosperous townsperson more money for agricultural produce. And this would make it possible to purchase equipment, fertilizer, and lubricants. But until such time as the mass prosperous townsperson appears, there will, of course, have to be substantial government financial infusions also. All that has been said above could, perhaps, be summed up in just a few words. For a prosperous, decent life each of us must want to work hard. The results of our labor are our main private property. No one has the right to take away our profits without our consent. But instruments, machine tools, and premises are necessary for work. They would belong to us or be the property of the collective or partnership. Raw material should be cheap enough. It has, after all, been produced by nature, it is our common resource. Only in this case can we bring our producer onto the world market. Generally, together with all, for the good of all. A simple and precise formula. Why should it not be employed in our country?
