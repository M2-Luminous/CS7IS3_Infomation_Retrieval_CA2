The 34 OAS member states have described its results as positive and quite significant, especially in the area of human rights. OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares characterized the approval of an inter-American convention to prevent, punish, and eradicate the use of violence against women -- which was already signed by five countries, Brazil included -- and of an inter-American convention on the forcible disappearance of people, namely political activists, as "extremely significant for the future of the continent." [passage omitted] In addition to the above two conventions, Baena Soares also mentioned the adoption of a resolution proposing greater cooperation for hemispheric security and limiting the proliferation of instruments of war, a proposal to create an inter-American defense board, and another proposal containing measures to improve the inter-American program to preserve the environment. Baena Soares said: "I could not have asked for better and more significant results at the Belem meeting." He added: "The decisions made here are proof that the OAS is increasingly becoming a forum in which all countries in the hemisphere can discuss political and economic issues and other types of issues as well."
