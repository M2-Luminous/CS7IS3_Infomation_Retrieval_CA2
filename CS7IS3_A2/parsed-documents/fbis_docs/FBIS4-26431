Local officials said that efforts to popularize the language began a decade ago when the central government stressed the importance of preserving and developing national minorities' cultures, during an ethnic work conference. Xigaze, the second biggest city in Tibet, is typical of the language teaching in the whole region. At that time, the city was badly in need of Tibetan language teachers, and the local government employed people from the public, including some lamas from the monasteries. Cendo, who is now 53 years old and used to be an ordinary lama in the well-known Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, has become a senior lecturer in the highest teaching institute around the entire Xigaze area -- the Xigaze Teachers' School. The college is responsible for training teachers for local primary schools, especially Tibetan language teachers. "Compared with other courses, Tibetan language teaching is being given more weight," said Cewang Doje, the college's head. Seven of the teachers in its Tibetan teaching group are Tibetan language graduates from Tibet University. Since 1981, all the Tibetan teachers with the group have been gathering once a week in order to raise their teaching abilities. Every semester, the group selects several teachers to give public classes for other teachers' appraisal. More than 90 percent of the graduates from this teachers' college have been found to be capable of teaching the Tibetan language in the first to sixth grade in primary schools, and some can be selected to teach at secondary schools. More and more young people in Tibet are now willing to do their best to revitalize their own native language. Zhamdui, after senior high school, had been enlisted in the Tibetan Language Department of Tibet University and has been in the teachers' school for five years after his graduation. "Tibetan is our native language, so we must master it well so as to hold on to and develop our fine cultural traditions," the young man said.
