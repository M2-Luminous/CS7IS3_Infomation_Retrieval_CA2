When it comes to paying taxes, Zhejiang's individual and private businesses ranked first in the nation by delivering 2.23 billion yuan in taxes to the state in 1993, up 39.5 percent from the previous year. Private economy has become Zhejiang's important economic growth sector. Not only Zhejiang saw a rapid increase in the number of individual and private businessmen last year, it also witnessed the constant improvement of the quality of those who are involved in the private economic sector. In 1993, there were 1,238,000 registered individual businessmen employing 1,972,000 people, representing an increase of 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, over the previous year and making 1993 the year of fastest growth in term of the number of individual businessmen and the number of people they employed since the beginning of the 1990's. The number of private enterprises rose to 19,400 and the number of people they employed to 255,000, marking an increase of 68 percent and 67 percent, respectively, over the previous year. And the trend in the composition of those engaged in the individual and private economy tended to become younger, more educated, and more professional. Many of the individual businessmen were former street vendors. They then turned to retail business, to running companies and factories, to large-scale production, and to production of upscale products. By the end of last year, individual businessmen's registered capital in the province stood at 8.67 bilion yuan. There are 641 private enterprises with a registered capital over 1 million yuan, 566 of them registered last year. The number of enterprises with an annual output value of over 1 million yuan and over 10 million yuan was 877 and 77, respectively. The annual output value of an enterprise in Tiantai and another one in Linhai topped 100 million yuan. Now the business scope of individual and private economy has expanded to all sectors that are permitted under the state policy. Transcendng regions, trades, and ownership system, many individual and private enterprises are adopting diverse management, combined management, and intensive management through share acquisition, merger, contracting, and leasing. At present, the province has five enterprise groups whose members are mainly from private enterprises. In 1993, 639 individual and private enterprises exported 500 million yuan worth of goods, up two-fold over the previous year. Private enterprises attracted $110 million in foreign funds and formed 170 joint-venture enterprises with foreign businessmen. Nine private enterprises in the province also set up plants in other provinces.
