TANJUG, in a recent article, tried to distort facts by saying the Serbs were being threatened with bombs and missiles by what it called the "progressive world public which reacted so strongly in defence of Rushdie", only because they do not fit into the vision contained in the "Islamic declaration" of Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic. Bosnian Serbs face NATO air strikes if they do not withdraw their artillery from around Sarajevo which they have been pounding for 22 months now. Bosnian President Izetbegovic was imprisoned following an infamous trial of Bosnian Muslims by the former Yugoslav communist regime, because of his work, the "Islamic declaration". In a letter to TANJUG's editor-in-chief, the Iranian Embassy said the author of the text had in a very surprising manner distinctly related the decree, later confirmed and supported by the organization of the Islamic countries, to the situation in Bosnia. "The author's accusation of `Iranian fundamentalism' is improper and does not help him in the description of the current situation in Bosnia and political action taken in this respect," the letter said. The embassy looked forward to correction of the article and expected TANJUG to publish rational and fact-based comments, the letter concluded.
