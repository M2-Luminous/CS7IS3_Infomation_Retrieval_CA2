This was reiterated today by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "Our position has remained the same as before: We are for the conference, which should tackle this problem," the high-ranking Russian diplomat said. "It should be considered multilaterally, since the dialogue on the bilateral level has failed." The Moscow initiative, which was confirmed by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin at his recent talks with President of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-sam, envisions the convening of an international conference on security and nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula, with the participation of South and North Korea, Russia, the United States, China, and Japan, as well as the United Nations and the IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency). "We believe that this is the way out of the situation," said Aleksandr Panov.
