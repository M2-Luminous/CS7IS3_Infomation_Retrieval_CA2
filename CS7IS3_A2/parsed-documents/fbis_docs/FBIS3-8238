[Jansa] No. I said that, at the time, Slovenia helped the two assaulted states, not by the permission to transfer weapons through our territory, but rather by providing them with some of the weapons expropriated from the Yugoslav People's Army. That assistance ended long before our country was recognized by the United Nations. [Marjanovic] Slovenia, as one of the former Yugoslav republics, is still subject to the arms embargo. [Jansa] The entity on which the embargo was imposed -- the former Yugoslavia -- no longer exists, and therefore the embargo should not apply to us. There has been no embargo imposed on Slovenia as an independent country. Nevertheless, it has been applied in practice. [Marjanovic] Does it prevent your entry into the Partnership for Peace project? [Jansa] We were told that it will not be a hindrance. Precisely, our joining the "Partnership" is a feasible way of leaving the entity on which the embargo was imposed. [Marjanovic] Nonetheless, Slovene politics have not assumed a consistent stand regarding that project. [Jansa] According to public opinion surveys, most of the citizens agree with our joining the "Partnership." That is in harmony with the government and most deputies in the parliament. After all, the parliament adopted a special resolution last year stating that the Slovenia's objective is full membership in the North Atlantic Alliance. There are forces here, however, that oppose it. They do not have a majority, nevertheless they play an important role on the political scale: They are, above all, some of the liberal democrats, currently the strongest Slovene party, and the entire party of the former communists. Even these people understand, however, that a direct opposition runs contrary to public inclinations, and therefore they have been using all kinds of intrigues and frauds to block actual cooperation with the Alliance. Because of one such intrigue, for instance, the cooperation with the U.S. National Guard, which is of a great importance to our army, has been jeopardized. These are the same people who, as early as spring 1991, tried to prevent the formation of the Slovene Army and render Slovene independence impossible. Today, they disagree with spending on the establishment of a defense system that would be comparable with the European one. Therefore, none of our units has a communication system compatible with the Western standards. At the same time, the "Partnership" assumes precisely compatible equipment so that one of the principal intentions could be realized -- joint military exercises. Business as Usual [Marjanovic] What exactly is the objective of the Slovene communists? [Jansa] The problem is that Slovenia has not passed through such a change as the Czech Republic, for instance. The top echelons of the past regime remained virtually unchanged in Slovenia and continue to operate from the same positions they held then. Hence, they are people who have, for 40 or 50 years, been spreading fear about a West that thirsts for our blood, and today, it is, for them, just a simple extension of business as usual. For them, the North Atlantic alliance has always been a tool of imperialism. Their goal is to keep Slovenia outside the European and world integration, because they have not yet abandoned the idea of joining Slovenia -- or at least cooperating -- with those countries in which socialism has survived, be it in the territory of the former Yugoslavia or on a wider scale. [Marjanovic] Does it mean that a substantial number of Slovene politicians endorse the idea of the revival of Yugoslavia? [Jansa] Yes. It is not based on political ideas, however, but rather on purely economic interests and, last but not least, also on family relations. [Marjanovic] What about President Kucan? [Jansa] To a great degree, the president symbolizes this situation: Until recently, he was -- the last -- chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovenia. It is characteristic of the situation that, at one of its last plenums (before the party changed its name), their Central Committee condemned the "politics of U.S. imperialism." Although they speak differently today, the thinking of those people has simply not changed. We Do Not Control Our Own Airspace [Marjanovic] Can Slovenia today shop the world markets for arms? [Jansa] So far, we have not assigned any money for such purchases. Whether anyone would sell us something depends on how he views our country, either as an independent country or as a republic of the former Yugoslavia. From the legal point of view, the countries that recognized us should no longer apply the embargo to us. Nevertheless, it is not just the sale of arms. The world as a whole still refers to the term of "former Yugoslavia," be it in matters regarding the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] or other world undertakings. As soon as that term disappears, the resolution on the embargo will no longer be valid. [Marjanovic] So, until then, foreign aircraft can fly over Slovenia at an altitude of 6,000 meters and the Slovene anti- aircraft defenses will not act --because of a lack of technical equipment? [Jansa] It would register them in some regions, but would not be able to take any action against them. In other places, they would not even be registered. We do not even control our air space as a whole today, how could we think of defending it? [Marjanovic] Upon the recent announcement of the NATO ultimatum regarding the withdrawal of heavy equipment from the proximity of Sarajevo, you said that the alliance did not adopt any security provisions for the surrounding countries. Do you believe that the danger still exists of dragging Slovenia into the Balkan war? [Jansa] At the moment, such a danger is not likely. It would be different if the conflict again approached our border. Regarding the ultimatum, one cannot but note that it did not think of the possible consequences. If threatened, the Serbian forces could act completely irrationally and endanger the neighboring countries. [Marjanovic] You do not consider the Slovene-Croatian border dispute dangerous? [Jansa] This does not concern such great problems that it could become the reason for a military conflict. Muslims Are No Longer Naive [Marjanovic] What would be the consequences of imposing economic sanctions against Croatia? Do you believe that such a step would be reflected in an even closer cooperation between the Croatian and Serbian forces in Bosnia? [Jansa] Yes, in the event of anti-Croat sanctions, one could also contemplate the Serbs and the Croats coming closer together. The pressure on Muslims would be only enhanced. The key issue of Serbo-Croatian relationship would nevertheless remain unsolved -- the conquered territory in Croatia. [Marjanovic] How long, do you believe, can the war continue? [Jansa] Neither of the so-called warring sides has such supremacy that it could achieve an absolute military victory. Not even the greater cooperation you mentioned, between the Serbs and the Croats, could definitely defeat the Muslims in a short time span. After all, they have also consolidated themselves, and -- especially -- they are no longer naive. It was precisely their naivete that resulted in such a large number of Muslim casualties. They no longer say that they do not know where the grenades are coming from. If the world continues to let the war lie fallow, it can all go on for a very long time. The peace potentials necessary for the war to end by itself simply do not exist here. If it all goes on, then, the danger of its spreading to our territory remains. Measures to prevent this were taken in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. The deployment of symbolic U.S. units there means a lot for the situation. In the case of Kosovo, however, the world assumed that the region is an administrative part of Serbia. [Marjanovic] Hence, it will not object to conceivable ethnic purges? [Jansa] They have taken place there for the past 15 years, and the world had no objections.
