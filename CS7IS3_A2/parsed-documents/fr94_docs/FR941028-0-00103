FR941028-0-00103 FR941028-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Hearings and Appeals 43 CFR Part 4 RIN 1094&hyph;AA42 Department Hearings and Appeals Procedures; Special Rules Applicable to Surface Coal Mining Hearings and Appeals AGENCY: Office of Hearings and Appeals, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The final rulemaking amends regulations of the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) applicable to surface coal mining hearings and appeals by adding procedural rules for administrative review of a decision by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) to suspend or rescind permits that should not have been issued, and a decision by OSM in response to (a) a challenge, by an applicant or other person shown in the Applicant Violator System, to a finding that he or she is in an ownership or control link to any person or (b) a challenge, by an applicant or other person shown in the Applicant Violator System in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a federal violation notice, to the status of the violation in the notice. The final rulemaking provides for a hearing before an administrative law judge and for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial decision by the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA). In addition, existing 43 CFR 4.1105(a)(2) is amended to include a reference to the rules added by this rulemaking. EFFECTIVE DATE: These final regulations are effective on November 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Will A. Irwin, Administrative Judge, Interior Board of Land Appeals, Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of the Interior, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (Telephone 703&hyph;235&hyph;3750). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OHA's proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 6, 1991 (56 FR 45806&hyph;11). Proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 set forth new OHA procedures for reviewing OSM decisions to suspend or rescind permits OSM finds were improvidently issued under 30 CFR 773.20. Proposed 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 set forth new OHA procedures for reviewing OSM decisions finding that a person is in an ownership or control link to a person currently in violation of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) or other applicable law. In addition, OHA proposed to amend the existing rule that establishes OSM's burden of proof in individual civil penalty proceedings, 43 CFR 3.1307(a). Proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 and 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 are based on section 510(c) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1260(c) (1988). This section requires an applicant for a surface coal mining and reclamation permit to file with the permit application a schedule listing all notices of violations of SMCRA and any law, rule, or regulation of the United States, or of any department or agency in the United States pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred by the applicant in connection with any surface coal mining operation during the three-year period prior to the date of application. Where the schedule or other information indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant is currently in violation of the Act or other air or water environmental protection laws, the permit shall not be issued until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or agency which has jurisdiction over such violation. In order to implement section 510(c), OSM has promulgated a rule defining the words ``owned or controlled'' in that section, as well as ``owns or controls.'' 30 CFR 773.5. It has adopted a rule requiring that an application for a permit include information about each person who owns or controls the applicant, within the meaning of §773.5, and about any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or any person who owns or controls the applicant. 30 CFR 778.13(c), (d). It has adopted a regulation concerning review of applications for permits that provides: ``[b]ased on available information *␣*␣*, the regulatory authority shall not issue the permit if any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant is currently in violation of the Act or any other law, rule or regulation referred to in this paragraph.'' 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). This is the so-called ``permit block,'' referring to the language in section 510(c) that states ``the permit shall not be issued until the applicant submits proof'' that a violation of a surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected. OSM has also established the Applicant/Violator System (AVS), a computerized system to store data regarding violations and ownership and control links to those violations.
