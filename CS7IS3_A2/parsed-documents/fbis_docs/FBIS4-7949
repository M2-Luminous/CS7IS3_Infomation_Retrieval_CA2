What were the chief aims of this visit? [Noev] I was accompanied on the U.S. trip by Krasimira Boneva, chief of the Information and Cultural Relations Department, and by Captain First Rank Tsvyatko Donchev, head of the Defense Ministry Press Service, and the visit was financed by the U.S. Information Agency. Our U.S. visit had two main aspects: to become acquainted with the practices used at the U.S. Department of Defense in the field of information and public relations, and also to have meetings with U.S. Defense Department officials. [passage omitted] In the course of our discussions it was reaffirmed that the relations between the United States and Bulgaria in the military field are in complete conformity with the development of bilateral relations as a whole. I would even say that they are continuously improving and entering a qualitatively new stage. [passage omitted] [Vuchev] During your meetings, was sufficient attention paid to the situation in our region and Europe? [Noev] Naturally, we did cover these topics quite comprehensively. We confirmed that our practical positions coincided on all main issues. Of course, there were some nuances, such as in connection with the UN resolution on adding a military contingent from the Republic of Turkey to the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. In essence, this resolution was adopted during and following my meetings. However, even before it was made and especially after it was made public, we ensured that the U.S. side clearly understood that Bulgaria is far from enthusiastic about this decision. In fact, it has turned out that for the second time (the first was Resolution 730 on the sanctions], when an issue of strategic importance for the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was being decided, not only was Bulgaria's view not taken into account, but a decision was passed that conflicted with our fundamental interests. I wish to make it clear that we have nothing against any state taking part and appreciate the UN's difficulties in obtaining troops for Bosnia. However, at the same time we stressed that there is no change in our position of opposing the participation of the armed forces of states in the region, or of states that display an active interest in joining this specific operation. During the roundtable meeting at the National Defense University it was mentioned that the main characteristics of the Bulgarian contribution to the international efforts to find a solution to the Yugoslav crisis are the clarity, principled nature, and predictability of our conduct. We consider that our participation, as a permanent value in the complex equation of a future peace settlement, should considerably assist the efforts to solve the equation. However, when such a policy leads to disregard for Bulgaria's interests, we should evidently draw the appropriate conclusions. [passage omitted]
