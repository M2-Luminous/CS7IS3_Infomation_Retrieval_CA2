Subpart H_Evaluation Requirements §2516.800 What are the purposes of an evaluation? Every evaluation effort should serve to improve program quality, examine benefits of service, or fulfill legislative requirements. §2516.810 What types of evaluations are grantees and subgrantees required to perform?

Programs are required to: (a) Continuously assess management effectiveness, the quality of services provided, and the satisfaction of both participants and service recipients.

The Corporation encourages programs to use internal evaluation methods, such as community advisory councils, participant advisory councils, peer reviews, quality control inspections, and service recipient and participant surveys. (b) Track progress toward pre-established objectives. Objectives must be established by programs and approved by the Corporation. Programs must submit to the Corporation (or the Corporation grantee as applicable) periodic performance reports. (c) Collect and submit to the Corporation (through the Corporation grantee as applicable) the following data: (1) The total number of participants in each program and basic demographic characteristics of the participants including sex, age, economic background, education level, ethnic group, disability classification, and geographic region.

(c) Other criteria as determined and published by the Corporation. §2516.850 What will the Corporation do to evaluate the overall success of the service-learning program? (a) The Corporation will conduct independent evaluations. These evaluations will consider the opinions of participants and members of the communities where services are delivered. If appropriate, these evaluations will compare participants with individuals who have not participated in service-learning programs. These evaluations will_ (1) Study the extent to which service-learning programs as a whole affect the involved communities; (2) Determine the extent to which service-learning programs as a whole increase academic learning of participants, enhance civic education, and foster continued community involvement; and (3) Determine the effectiveness of different program models. (b) The Corporation will also determine by June 30, 1995, whether outcomes of service-learning programs are defined and measured appropriately, and the implications of the results from such a study for authorized funding levels. §2516.860 Will information on individual participants be kept confidential? (a) Yes. The Corporation will maintain the confidentiality of information regarding individual participants that is acquired for the purpose of the evaluations described in §2516.840.
