Afghan and Pakistani sources have stated that Golboddin Hekmatyar, interim prime minister and leader of the Hezb-e Eslami, has requested an invitation to visit Tehran. The Uzbek leader, 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, who has been prominent as a strong man in the tripartite alliance including himself, Hekmatyar, and the Shiite leader 'Ali Mazari, will also visit the Iranian capital. A conference in Tehran including the Uzbek, Shiite, and Pashtun commanders may lead to the formation of a new allied government that will attempt to force the removal of Rabbani and his unseen administration. Hekmatyar, who has rejected a fasting month (Ramadan) ceasefire, contacted the Iranian foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar Velayati, by telephone yesterday demanding that Iran take on a greater role in ending the conflict in Afghanistan. Dostam and Hekmatyar hope to mobilize Iranian, Uzbek, and Russian support to counter the increasing pressure from Pakistan, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the United Nations. Rabbani has not yet been able to obtain support for his plan to host a conference of well-known personalities, tribal leaders and religious leaders to select a new government. In the last few days, he has faced mounting pressure, especially from Pakistan, to agree to resign as soon as a peace conference is convened. Dostam and Hekmatyar counter the Rabbani plan with a demand to conduct public elections under the auspices of the United Nations within three months after the ceasefire. Their condition [for this] remains the resignation of Rabbani.
