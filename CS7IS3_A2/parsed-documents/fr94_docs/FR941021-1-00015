FR941021-1-00015 FR941021-1-00003 ยง247.9 Presentment warranties. (a) Presenting banks and indorsers of the FedSelect check are deemed to guarantee that all prior indorsements are genuine, whether or not an express guaranty is placed on the FedSelect check. When the first indorsement has been made by one other than the payee personally, the presenting bank and the indorsers are deemed to guarantee, in addition to other warranties, that the person who so indorsed had unqualified capacity and authority to indorse the check on behalf of the payee. (b) A presenting bank makes the warranties required of a sender under Subpart A of 12 CFR part 210 (Regulation J). This section does not limit any warranty by a presenter or other party arising under State law. Neither the Department, an agency nor a Reserve Bank is barred from recovering on a breach of warranty solely because: (1) The negligence of the Department, an agency or of a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had contributed to a fraudulent indorsement or material alteration; (2) The Department, an agency or a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had failed to discover promptly an unauthorized signature or alteration; (3) An imposter had fraudulently caused the issuance of a FedSelect check in the name of any existing payee or fictitious payee; or (4) An employee of the Department, an agency or a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had caused the fraudulent issuance of a FedSelect check in the name of any existing payee or fictitious payee. (c) In the event of a breach of warranty, the payor Reserve Bank may either return the item to the presenting bank or send to the presenting bank notice of the breach. If, upon receipt of the returned check or notice of the breach, the presenting bank does not make prompt restitution, the Department, an agency or the payor Reserve Bank may begin appropriate collection procedures.
