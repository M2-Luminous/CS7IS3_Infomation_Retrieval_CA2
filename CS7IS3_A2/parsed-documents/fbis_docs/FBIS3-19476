"We should spell with the liberal alphabet in the Bundestag election, in order to demonstrate independence," Lueder said in an interview with the BERLINER MORGENPOST (Wednesday [16 March] edition). Accordingly, the FDP is to vote for its candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher -- who is said to have no chances -- in the first two ballots, but for Rau in the last ballot. In this way, the FDP would also accept that the SPD is today the strongest party and that only one SPD presidency (Gustav Heinemann) in the FRG's era is "unhealthy" for the SPD, Lueder said. North Rhine-Westphalian FDP Chairman Juergen Moellemann had also advocated support for Rau. So far, the FDP leadership in Bonn has refused to commit itself.
