An open letter to the Clinton administration declares that the U.S. court's ruling ordering the Ilchin Company to suspend the production of synthetic diamonds and abolish its production facilities, as well as implementing super Section 301, is an economic aggression act against small and weak countries in an effort to ease the economic crisis of the United States, which the Pusan Alliance for Democracy and National Reunification decided to struggle against.
