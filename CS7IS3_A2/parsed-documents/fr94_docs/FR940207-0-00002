FR940207-0-00002 FR940207-0-00001 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Parts 1, 21, 30, 32, and 50 RIN: 3150&hyph;AE92 Minor Clarifying Amendments AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule corrects a number of minor typographical errors in NRC's regulations. These amendments are necessary to inform the public of the administrative changes to the NRC regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Meyer, Chief, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 492&hyph;7211. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The amendments presented in this final rule are necessary to correct a number of minor typographical errors in the NRC's regulations. Because these amendments deal solely with agency practice and procedure, the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Act Procedure do not apply under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day delay in the effective date because the amendments are of a minor and administrative nature. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorial exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule contains no information collection requirements and therefore is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule, and therefore, that a backfit analysis is not required for this final rule, because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).
