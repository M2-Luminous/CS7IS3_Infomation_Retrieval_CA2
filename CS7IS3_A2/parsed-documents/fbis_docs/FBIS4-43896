The brutality of the Loughinisland massacre -- which claimed the life of an 87-year-old man watching the World Cup on television -- will not be quickly forgotten. Yet the Taoiseach's [Irish Prime Minister] words were no less symbolic of the problems that face the province than the pall-bearers' march. In the interview, Mr Reynolds demanded a cross-border authority in return for rescinding Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Irish constitution which assert the Republics historic claim to the North. He and his deputy, Dick Spring, have always made clear that the constitution would be changed only in the context of a broader settlement. Yesterday the Taoiseach came closer to spelling out the conditions which the South would try to exact from the British Government and the Unionist community. He expected "institutional links between North and South" which -- crucially -- would have "executive powers." Though still vague, this demand moves far beyond the existing structures of Anglo-lrish diplomacy and cross- border co-operation. It would involve major amendment of the 1920 Government of Ireland Act. This proposed bargain should be rejected by British ministers. Articles 2 and 3, which were recently declared a "constitutional imperative" by the Irish Supreme Court, are an outrageous anachronism rather than a legitimate bargaining chip. For Ireland to claim territorial rights over part of another European Union member state also makes a mockery of its high-minded aspirations as a European nation. There can be no question of a deal in which Eamon de Valera's articles were dropped in return for the partial transfer of executive power in the North to Dublin. Joint authority, in any case, is the least satisfactory of the various constitutional options open to Ulster. Its superficial attractions are obvious, particularly to a generation of politicians and diplomats who have grown used to the institutions set up by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to the meetings of the British-lrish Inter-Parliamentary Body. Under a system of joint authority, the Republic would not have to shoulder the entire cost of the province but would assume a veto over all key decisions in the North. The British Government would be able to claim that it had responded to nationalist demands for self-determination without abandoning the Unionist community. In practice, such a system would stand little chance of succeeding. The blurring of sovereignty would create more problems than it solved. The Unionist parties would be very unlikely to participate in any administrative structures which gave Dublin "executive power." Though the constitutional nationalist parties would welcome joint authority, the IRA would regard it as only a staging-post on the way to reunification. For the same reason, Loyalist violence would probably increase. Run by fractious committees, the province might soon become ungovernable. The deal set out by Mr Reynolds yesterday epitomises the delusions of Anglo-lrish diplomacy in the past nine years. In the wake of the weekend s murders, it should be clear that constitutional horse-trading between London and Dublin is no solution to the suffering of Ulster. Imaginative security measures and swift devolutionary reform would contribute far more than the spent rhetoric of the Downing Street declaration. Six months on, the refusal of the two governments to recognise the need for a change of strategy is no longer excusable.
