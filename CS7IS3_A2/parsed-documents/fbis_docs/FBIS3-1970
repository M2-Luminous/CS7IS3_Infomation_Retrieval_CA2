The majority of the taxis operating in the zone at the border with Hong Kong halted services in what was believed to be the first major strike by taxi drivers in China, residents, contacted by telephone, said. The taxi drivers, though disorganised with no apparent leaders, were protesting against the issuing of 2,000 licences to operators of new taxis in the Shenzhen. There were about 6,500 taxis in the zone run by more than 80 taxi companies, with over 10,000 drivers. There was a "visible" increase in the number of armed police officers patrolling the streets, travellers returning from the zone said.
