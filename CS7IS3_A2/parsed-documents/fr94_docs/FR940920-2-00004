FR940920-2-00004 FR940920-2-00003 [Docket Number 940841&hyph;4241] Investment Plans Survey AGENCY: Bureau of the Census, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of termination and consideration. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of the Census is proposing to replace the quarterly Plant and Equipment (P&E) Survey with a new semiannual Investment Plans Survey (IPS). Capital investments by businesses are a key indicator of U.S. economic performance. This change would improve the quality of intrayear data on U.S. business investment and provide comparability between intrayear investment surveys and the more detailed Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES). The P&E Survey was terminated after second quarter 1994 P&E results were released on September 8, 1994. Results for the first phase of the new IPS would be released in February 1995 and would include preliminary estimates of total 1994 expenditures for structures and equipment and planned 1995 spending for selected industry categories. Results for the second phase would be released in September 1995 and would include revised estimates of planned 1995 spending. The IPS results for future years would be released on this semiannual schedule. The IPS methods and content have been coordinated with those of the ACES and results from this new indicator survey will be fully consistent with results from the ACES. However, because the scope and detail of the new IPS are different from the present P&E Survey, IPS results will not be directly comparable to previously released P&E Survey data. DATES: Comments concerning this proposal should be submitted in writing by October 20, 1994 to receive consideration. ADDRESSES: Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles Funk, Agriculture and Financial Statistics Division, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233, on (301) 763&hyph;7180. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed survey was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget on July 18, 1994 for approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96&hyph;511, as amended. This was announced in the Federal Register on July 21, 1994. Copies of the material submitted are made available on request to the Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233. Authority: Title 13 United States Code, Sections 131 and 182. Dated: September 14, 1994. Harry A. Scarr, Acting Director, Bureau of the Census.
