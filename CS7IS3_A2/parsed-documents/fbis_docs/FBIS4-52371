He recalled that during his trip to Loikaw and Bawlake, SLORC Secretary-1 Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt had invited the armed organizations in the jungle to give up the policy of armed struggle and return to the legal fold to work with the government in regional development. He said after realizing the genuine goodwill of the government, the KNPLF has now returned to the legal fold after holding many rounds of talks based on mutual friendship, respect, and trust. He said there is now a ray of hope for peace emerging in the Kayah State. He said national reconciliation is an indispensable task for building a peaceful, modern, and developed Union of Myanmar. [passage omitted] Continuing, he said although the current situation in the country is heading toward stability and progress, it should be noted that the country could come under threat any time due to internal traitors and foreign neocolonialists. He said people in the Kayah State must be happy to see the KNPLF returning to the legal fold with the intention of cooperating with the Defense Services in unity for the progress of the country. He said the entire nation and people should take pride in and welcome the event. He said the people are hoping that the entire Union would become peaceful and developed if the remaining armed organizations in the jungle make similar efforts like the KNPLF with mutual understanding. He said all of us should take note of the people's aspirations. [passage omitted] In conclusion, he urged the KNPLF to work hand in hand with the local people under the leadership of the government in implementing regional development projects. Next, U Tun Kyaw, leader of the KNPLF, handed over the list of members, weapons, and ammunition to Col. Maung Kyi, chairman of the Kayah State Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of the Regional Command. Speaking at the ceremony, KNPLF leader U Tun Kyaw said that the KPLF gives great importance to the unity and development of the national people residing in the Kayah State, and stated its desire to remain in the Union through weal and woe and live in unity, with mutual respect and assistance among national races. He said his organization welcomed the SLORC gesture of warmly receiving the armed organizations returning to the legal fold. He noted that our country is a beautiful country which is very rich in natural resources. Developments that should have taken place, however, did not happen because of the civil war which had been waged for over 40 years. He said the time would soon come to develop our country into a just and a genuinely democratic country with a new outlook and thought. He said the time has now come to establish a Union with a full family spirit. He said the KNPLF, in accordance with the wishes of the people, had responded to the government's invitation by returning to the legal fold and giving up its policy of armed struggle. The KNPLF shall work hand in hand with the Defense Services in safeguarding national sovereignty and independence. He said the KNPLF shall give priority to the interests of the people and development and progress of the Kayah State. He called on the remaining armed organizations to urgently contribute to the government peace policy, which had been openly declared to the world, and to work jointly for development and progress of the nation.
