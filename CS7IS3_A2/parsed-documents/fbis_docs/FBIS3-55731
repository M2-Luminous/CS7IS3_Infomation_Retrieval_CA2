It is the document "On the Construction of a Complex of Buildings for the Parliament Center -- Official Residence of the Federal Assembly." We wrote in the last issue of the newspaper about the proposed construction of a new administrative complex for parliament in Moscow. The initiative for building it came from the president's administration, and according to Pavel Borodin, the president's administrator of affairs, as quoted by INTERFAX, it is proposed to earmark about half a billion dollars for the purpose. However, the report was denied almost immediately by government First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar. He stated that no such decision is in preparation, or at least he is not aware of it. Nonetheless, apparently at the very same time as Yegor Timurovich was refuting the report, Viktor Stepanovich was signing the first decree of the year. According to this decree, it is planned to carry out work on the erection of a complex of buildings for the new Parliament Center in 1994-1995. The government of Moscow is instructed, in conjunction with the president's administration of affairs, to identify a plot for the construction of the complex in the central section of Moscow within a month. A competition is announced among Russian and foreign firms for the best design. It is planned to commission the new Parliament Center in the first half of 1995. The figure of half a billion dollars does not appear in the decree. Nonetheless, the sum total of expenditure on an imposing new construction project is expected to be equally vast. The Ministry of the Economy is instructed to allocate the necessary quotas of state capital investments, including hard currency resources. Yet meanwhile Gaydar, who runs that ministry, knows nothing about the preparation of the decree. He simply was not informed. Boris Fedorov, the other vice premier and minister of finance, only learned of the decree "from the newspapers" on 10 January. Prior to that, he too had stated that no government decision exists as far as he knows -- "at any event, I have signed nothing and authorized nothing." After the decree's existence became known not only to the country's ordinary taxpayers, who were not expecting their money to be used in quite this way, but also to the vice premiers, IZVESTIYA's correspondent asked the finance minister some questions. According to the minister, he really had not been in the know. No session of the government or the government presidium had been convened on this subject. As for Boris Fedorov's personal opinion, he thinks: We cannot at the present day permit ourselves a construction project of $500 million or thereabouts. Such a sum is simply not available in reality, or even in the plans. Furthermore the finance minister does not consider the government's removal to the White House to be justified. Maybe the construction will be financed out of the funds of the president's administration of affairs? Not likely. The president's administration of affairs does have what is known as a separate line in the budget, but it seems that no such sums are envisaged there. The new construction project will be a heavy burden on the country's already unenviable budget. Is it really necessary today? Especially since there does not appear to have been any special pressure from the newly fledged deputies along the lines of "build us a new house immediately." Obviously we are not so rich as to allow ourselves to buy things on the cheap. But nor are we so poor as to create new administrative palaces in the shortest possible time "for show." I admit we were waiting with considerable interest to see how the government would begin the new year and what, in the changed situation, would be its first step. So now we know.
