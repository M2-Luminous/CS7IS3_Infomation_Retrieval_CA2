The creation of Indian Airlines Ltd and Air India Ltd has been hanging in the air since May 1992, when the appropriate Bill was introduced in Parliament, but not pursued. Now the deed is done by Ordinance, bypassing Parliament, an entirely avoidable and thoroughly objectionable procedure. The Government needs to be reminded that the Ordinance-making power is reserved for special circumstances and must be used with care. No reasons have been given but it is quite clear that the urgency is only to collect some big money, and quickly, to make up for the massive fiscal deficit the Government has run up this year. If a proper debate had been allowed in the passage of the Bill through Parliament, not only would adverse inferences not been drawn but it would have blundered the opposition to the Ordinance, now building up. It would also have helped the Government to make up its mind on how to go about the privatization and what to do with the proceeds. The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry wants the Government to set up a Ministry for Privatization to ensure a well-structured policy on selection, degree and time frame for the privatization plan. It is a mistake to assume that a proper plan can only be made by a separate Ministry; a stronger objection is that a Ministry once created tends to be permanent and continues long after its need has passed. But the problem clearly has to be tackled. No homework has been done, details of the pricing policy are not known, and the mechanism for the sale of equity unclear. The last time round the disinvestment of public sector equity got mired in unsavoury allegations featuring the Allahabad Bank and a set of brokers. The entire business was severely criticized by the Public Accounts Committee. A strategy of openness would be advisable now, especially when the goings on in the financial sector are so murky. Essentially, privatization should result in efficient management; it is not intended to be used to fund the continued profligacy of an unrepentant Government. The National Renewal Fund, which privatization was supposed to support, has gone awry, while workers have had to accept retrenchment or continue to remain in service without pay. There are another 47 public sector units under the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, which face a bleak future because nobody quite knows the gameplan. The only thing that is clear is that there is dash for cash before February 28. With vision so myopic, the repeal of this Act may not mean any meaningful change in the maharaja-style attitudes of the two airlines. Unless the nation is vigilant, the exercise may only provide the wherewithal to sustain the maharaja-style bureaucracy, while the airliners continue to land in pools of deep red ink.
