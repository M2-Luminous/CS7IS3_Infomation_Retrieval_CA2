FR941031-0-00020 FR941031-0-00008 D. The development of adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the CAA; E. The development of adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors, or at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA; and F. The development of procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State of Alabama Department of Environmental Management has indicated the Chief of the Non-Industrial Section in the Engineering Branch of the Air Division will be designated the coordinator of the Technical and Environmental Assistance Group (TEAG). The coordinator will direct and coordinate the activities of a group of at least six individuals with experience in permitting, source sampling, dispersion modeling, and public information. ADEM will support the TEAG with additional personnel as warranted. The TEAG will establish a clearinghouse of relevant technical and regulatory literature to disseminate to the small business community. It will provide information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources to operators and owners through interaction and cooperation with the Alabama Development Office (ADO), the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA), Alabama Small Business Development Consortium, Safe-State, the Waste Reduction and Technology Transfer (WRATT) program, trade associations, and other appropriate groups. The TEAG will provide information concerning pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention programs. This shall include providing information about alternative technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that reduce air pollution. The TEAG will support the activities of the Ombudsman and answer questions from that office, other state and local agencies, trade associations, and other appropriate groups concerning air permit requirements and applicability in a timely and efficient manner. Public notices will be posted in the State's four largest newspapers of proposed and/or final rules, regulations or standards issued under the CAA. Personnel from the TEAG will speak at forums and/or meetings concerning applicable proposed or final rules, regulations or standards issued under the CAA. The TEAG will serve as the secretariat to the Ombudsman and the Compliance Advisory Panel in the development and dissemination of reports, advisory opinions and other information. The TEAG will inform small businesses of the procedures for the Department to consider requests for a variance from a rule, work practice, standard or compliance date. The WRATT will be included in the Assistance Group where multi-media pollution prevention opportunity information is requested. Public service announcements, seminars and workshops will be developed and utilized. The TEAG will use EPA services such as the Control Technology Center (CTC) and the Emission Measurement Technical Information Center (EMTIC). Compliance Assistance to small businesses will be provided to aid them to identify applicable requirements and procedures to obtain permits in a timely fashion. The TEAG has developed and continues to work on responsive techniques, outreach techniques and information packets. This will cover topics such as pollution prevention, accidental release prevention and detection, source rights and obligations, and how to obtain approval for modification of work practices, compliance methods or schedules of compliance. The Department will perform on-site audits at the request of small businesses to evaluate work practices, compliance monitoring procedures and recordkeeping procedures. Such audits may be performed by Department personnel or by the WRATT program at no cost to the small businesses. 2. Ombudsman Section 507(a)(3) of the CAA requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. Alabama has appointed a Small Business Ombudsman and established the office of Alabama Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses as they come under the regulation of the CAA and the oversight of the Small Business Technical and Environmental Assistance Group. The Ombudsman reports directly to the Director of the Department of Environmental Management. The Alabama Ombusman operates a toll-free hotline to provide free confidential help to small businesses on specific source problems and grievances. The Ombudsman is authorized to communicate directly with the Governor's Office, the Director of ADEM, the Chief of the Air Division, other state agencies and other government officials. The Ombudsman may propose legislation or administrative action through ADEM or the Compliance Advisory Panel. 3. Compliance Advisory Panel Section 507(e) of the CAA requires the state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. Alabama established a seven member CAP with a membership consistent with the aforementioned CAA requirements. The makeup of the CAP is prescribed as required by the CAA and administrative support will be provided by the Department to fulfill all the responsibilities under the CAA. The duties of the CAP include: rendering advisory opinions regarding the effectiveness of the Small Business Technical and Environmental Assistance Group; reviewing information for small business stationary air pollution sources to assure such information is understandable by the layperson; and to make periodic reports to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the Equal Access to Justice Act.
