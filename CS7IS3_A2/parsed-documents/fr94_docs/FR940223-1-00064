FR940223-1-00064 FR940223-1-00012 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 41 CFR Part 101&hyph;26 RIN 3090&hyph;AF09 Removing Federal Supply Service Schedule Ordering Instructions AGENCY: Federal Supply Service, GSA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document invites written comments on a proposed amendment to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) that removes Federal Supply Service (FSS) schedule ordering instructions. FSS schedule ordering instructions will be restated in the form of non-regulatory principles. GSA's Federal Supply Service will issue and maintain these non-regulatory principles in the Federal Supply Service Program Guide. This document is issued simultaneously with another notice that similarly affects multiple award schedule ordering instructions contained in the Federal Information Resources Management Regulations (FIRMR). When combined, these actions will result in uniform set of principles that empower Federal agencies to make ``best value'' buying decisions in a de-monopolized environment. These proposed changes are consistent with the Report of the National Performance Review (NPR), and are part of GSA's larger plans to create a Government that works better and costs less. DATES: Comments are due in writing on or before April 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Nicholas Economou, FSS Acquisition Management Center (FCO), Crystal Mall Building # 4, room 716, Washington, DC 20406. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Economou, FSS Acquisition Management Center (703&hyph;305&hyph;6936). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background FPMR subpart 101&hyph;26.4 primarily contains FSS schedule ordering instructions. Over time, these instructions have become obsolete. Hence, it is no longer necessary to retain these instructions in the FPMR. Removing these instructions from FPMR subpart 101&hyph;26.4 will carry out the principles of the NPR Report by unburdening all Federal agencies from unnecessary regulations. A small amount of the information previously contained in subpart 101&hyph;26.4 will be retained and relocated in the FPMR: Text permitting the procurement of printing of Standard Form 149 by GSA; text permitting certain fixed-price contractors and lower tier subcontractors to purchase security equipment from GSA sources; and text explaining why GSA supply distribution facilities make multiple award schedule purchases. B. Executive Order 12866 This rule was submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ., because it only eliminates FSS schedule ordering instructions that are obsolete and no longer necessary, and introduces no new procurement policies or procedures. D. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501).
