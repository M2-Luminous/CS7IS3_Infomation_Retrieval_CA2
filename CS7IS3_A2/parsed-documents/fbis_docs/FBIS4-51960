NODONG SINMUN today brands his mishmash as an intolerable insult to and a mockery of the patriotic spirit of the forerunners. The news analyst says: For his treacherous crimes, the traitor Kim Yong-sam has long since been disqualified from visiting the Hyonchung shrine or talking about Yi Sun-sin's patriotism and self-sacrificing spirit. The crimes committed by the traitor against the people, the country and the nation over the last one year or more since his inauguration are beyond description and are indelible any time. Although he talked about some forthcoming "changes" what he will bring about is nothing but national disaster such as deepening of dependence on the United States and Japan and nuclear scourge. Patriotism and treachery are incompatible. Although Kim Yong-sam tries to lull the growing complaints of the South Korean people against the "civilian" rule with the mask of "patriotism" it is a mistake. The South Korean people will never pardon the Kim Yong-sam clique which is engaged in treacheries while indiscreetly insulting the patriotic spirit of the forerunners.
