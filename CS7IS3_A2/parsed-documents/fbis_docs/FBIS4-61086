Therefore the first question I would like to raise with you, Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR], concerns the nature of May Day. [Shmakov] We do not want to "surrender" this holiday to anyone. It is our trade union holiday. Earlier it was called the Day of International Solidarity of Working People, today it is dubbed "the day of spring and labor," which is not altogether correct. You may use the word "international" or you may diplomatically refrain from doing so -- inner solidarity and appreciation of the common problems which beset people today, particularly people in Russia, are what is important. These problems are the payment of wages on time, the retention of jobs, and, in general terms, the stabilization of the economy -- simply so that your own plant can provide a livelihood -- jobs and a pay packet which enables people to live a decent life. Each region will mark the holiday in its own way, we do not have a "mandatory program," each region itself determines how to celebrate. In St. Petersburg, for example, a ceremonial session of trade union activists will be held. Moscow and many other cities are planning to hold rallies and processions. In the capital an application has been lodged and accepted: There will be demonstrations and rallies. People will asssemble at Triumfalnaya Square at 0830, the procession will start moving off along Tverskaya Street at 0915, and there will be a 30-minute rally outside the History Museum on Manezh Square at 1000. A campaign to collect signatures in support of urgent trade union demands has been organized in Moscow in the runup to May Day. The main demands are the payment of wage arrears, job guarantees, the pursuit of a proper employment policy, and measures to prevent unemployment. Therefore these demands will either be submitted to Duma representatives directly from the platform or the rally will send a delegation to the president, the Federation Council, and the government. [Baranov] Will this be the "working people's spring offensive"? [Shmakov] "Spring offensive" is a good term, one taken from Western practice. Over there it is the time for concluding collective contracts. We do not set ourselves the goal of conducting seasonal work in defense of working people's rights. Different condition prevail here. Our efforts this spring have been aimed at concluding a general agreement. The negotiations were tough, but an agreement was nevertheless signed 8 April. The main point now is to ensure that it is implemented. But if it is not, we will have to set a date for the offensive. And, although the General Agreement-1994 was signed only recently, we have set ourselves the task of signing a similar Contract-1995 at the end of this year. That will be the offensive: Our fiscal year runs from 1 January through 31 December, and, ideally, the General Agreement, sector agreements, and collective contracts would be ready by its start. [Baranov] A tradition has developed of late whereby the country's budget is passed with a year's delay. Is the trade unions' activity tied in with the activity of the budgetary commissions of the upper chamber of parliament and the State Duma? [Shmakov] It should be. But there is no such practice today. The principle, however, should be as follows: The General Agreement constitutes a precondition of drawing up the state budget. Once you have an agreement, the government and employers assume material undertakings, and this must inevitably be reflected in the budget. Otherwise you have the absurd situation of an agreement with no resources to implement it. [Baranov] What prevented such consultations being carried out on time this year? [Shmakov] Discussion of the budget has only just gotten under way, and we were unable to delay signing the agreement. And it is also time to accustom the government to the actual idea of signing general agreements. [Baranov] Does FITUR have political preferences? [Shmakov] Trade unions cannot withdraw from politics altogether -- politics permeates all our activity, but FITUR cannot have political goals today. The trade unions rally people on other grounds, first and foremost social and labor grounds. But we are not indifferent to the policy a particular government pursues, it is not all the same to us who wins the elections. But today we have no strong leaning toward a party. There is no party at present which is completely in tune with the trade unions' tasks. But we do support those parties and movements whose programs contain ideas similar to our own. And we have not taken off the agenda the idea of either setting up a party, like the Labor Party, geared toward trade unions or enjoying closer cooperation with an existing party which is ready to align itself with the trade unions. [Baranov] Do the trade unions regard the Labor Party's plan as a "nonstarter?" [Shmakov] I would not put it that way. It is on the back rather than the front burner. [Baranov] Will the trade unions continue to transform or is the restructuring process over, and can results be expected? [Shmakov] Experience suggests that transformation is necessary. The time of holding congresses is now under way in trade unions, and the prevailing feeling is that every trade union within FITUR should be more centrally organized. Overdemocratization of trade union life has not been beneficial. If we are to wage a proper struggle, rather than just go through the motions, centralization and control are needed. [Baranov] There are now strict access and exit arrangements in the FITUR building. Is this the start of a strict internal policy? [Shmakov] This is an imperative of life. We should at least control the situation in our own house. Commercial structures have moved into the building, they have their own "headaches," ordinary thefts occur, which did not before. This has nothing to do with the workers' movement. [Baranov] But how in general can the workers' movement develop in conditions of crisis? Strikes do not intimidate employers.... [Shmakov] Strikes suit employers down to the ground. If people do not report for work, that is another reason for not paying out wages. Therefore the modern workers' movement and trade unions first and foremost can only be sufficiently effective when organized. I will not exaggerate. There will be no very great accomplishments at the present stage, but certain successes can be seen perfectly well. Our task today is to direct the movement toward tackling economic problems. If the wage of a worker in the forestry, textile, or machine building industry is not paid, the root of the evil is the same, but there are a host of ways of tackling it. But we advocate resolving conflicts through negotiation. And implementation of accords already signed is the number one problem. We have learned how to draw up competent documents and learned how to reach agreement around the negotiating table. But we still have not learned how to implement what has been signed. That is indeed a very big common problem....
