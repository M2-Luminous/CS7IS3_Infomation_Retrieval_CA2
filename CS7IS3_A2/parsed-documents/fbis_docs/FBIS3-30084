According to reports, on 21 February, the U.S. imperialists flew an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane, stationed in a base in Okinawa, Japan, over the skies of Pochon, Yanggu, Kansong, and other areas of South Korea and conducted aerial photographing and electronic reconnaissance over the strategic depth and inland areas [chollyakchok chongsimjidaewa naeryukchidae] on the northern half of the Republic. That night, puppet Army ground units based in Ha-ri and Wondang-ri of Yonchon County fired approximately 50 rounds of flare bombs into the skies, conducted a war exercise for northward aggression, and indulged in war frenzies. Also, puppet Army large-caliber artillery units and armed bandits which had been deployed in Nosang-ri in Paju County; Chungsa-ri in Yonchon County; and Chorwon-up in Chorwon County of South Korea incited a war atmosphere, firing hundreds of bullets and shells in the areas adjacent to the DMZ. Also that day, the armed helicopters and transport helicopters of the puppet armed forces, which were deployed to the skies over Chongwon-ri in Paju County and Majon-ri of Yonchon County, frantically conducted an exercise to support and transport ground attack units. These war commotions by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets are very ominous [simsangchi annun] movements that can take place only on the eve of war. They also clearly show how frantically the bastards are maneuvering to provoke a new war. As everybody knows, all fellow countrymen in the North and South and abroad who pursue to achieve reunification in the nineties declared this year to be a year of great national unity and are making every effort to ease tension on the Korean peninsula and achieve national unity. Peace-loving people from all strata of life in the world earnestly hope that tension will be eased and that a new phase will open for the fatherland's reunification this year. However, the South Korean puppets' policy of doing something about someone else by using military forces has not changed. Rather, they turn a blind eye to the fellow countrymen's earnest desire for peace and reunification, babble about someone else's armed provocations, and more frantically maneuver for arms buildup and northward invasion. As a matter of fact, it is the South Korean puppets who attempt armed provocations on the Korean peninsula. Talking about preparations for actual warfare or preparations for quick reaction, they hold confabs to prepare the regular armed forces for combats and prepare the paramilitary forces for combat mobilization. They also accelerate the maneuvers to increase war budgets and bring Patriot missiles into South Korea, and plan to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise or any other large-scale military exercises. As a matter of fact, even though it calls itself a civilian regime, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique pursues confrontation and war more persistently than the previous military dictatorial regimes. The war exercise commotions which the South Korean puppets are successively kicking up in the DMZ and in its vicinity are a deliberate provocation maneuver to further aggravate tension on the Korean peninsula and, thus, ignite a fuse to war. They are also a vicious challenge to the fellow countrymen's aspirations for peace and peaceful reunification and an unforgivable antinational, antireunification crime. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is kicking up war commotions to pursue other purposes, as well. The Kim Yong-sam ring is denounced and condemned and in deep crisis, because of its antinational, treacherous opening of the rice markets; the dirty-water scandal, which erupted early this year; a large-scale fraudulence case, and a series of gang robberies. The daily growing resistance and anger of the people, along with the struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification, are further driving the traitorous Kim Yong-sam group to a predicament. Therefore, the puppets are kicking up war commotions daily to suppress the people's growing struggle and resolve an aggravating crisis facing its rule. This is proven by the fact that by mobilizing the puppet armed forces in downtown Seoul, the Kim Yong-sam ring conducted an exercise involving the movement of armored personnel carriers and military vehicles of various other sorts, paraded troops [tobo haengjin], and fired blank shots at random. However, the puppets' dirty plot to find an exit in beefing up their war maneuvers against their fellow countrymen and their fascist rule will never work. The youth and students and people from all other walks of life in South Korea are vigorously waging an antiwar struggle against the reckless maneuvers by the civilian warmongers to provoke a new war. The war maneuvers by the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique which challenge the people's aspirations and earnest desire will arouse great anger from the people and hasten their destruction.
