[passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Peter Tomecek, another member of the Alternative of Political Realism has left your group. How do you see the future of this Alternative? [Kovac] [passage omitted] I think that all of us who formed the Alternative know that there is a need to clean up this society, and I think they will maintain their position [on this issue]. We will be short one person, but that does not matter. [Correspondent] You said that you were preparing a new political party. You have been having talks with various parliamentary parties. There has been some information from the lobbies that your views are close to that of Mr. Cernak [leader of the National Democratic Faction in the Slovak National Party]. Can you tell us more about the orientation of this new political entity, or, in other words, with whom would you be willing to cooperate? [Kovac] The main reason for considering the creation of a new political party is the existence of a large group of citizens in Slovakia who are dissatisfied with all of the existing political parties. According to our analysis of public opinion, the main reason for this dissatisfaction is the inability of political forces to reach a sensible agreement. The political party we have in mind is a party that should be a new beginning, or a guarantee that a sensible political agreement is reached between Slovak political forces. That is what Slovakia needs more than anything at the present time. [Correspondent] When will we hear more about it? [Kovac] Maybe by the end of next week. [end recording]
