He pointed out that the foreign debt continues to be a heavy burden for the Central American nations. The leader seemed less optimistic about the region's economic recovery during the last few years than his other 20 Ibero-American colleagues. Reina said that it was still impossible to speak of the expansion of economic recovery. The Honduran president said "we must recognize that poverty has increased in the region." This is the first Ibero-American leaders' meeting he has attended, as the group has already gathered in the previous three consecutive years: in Guadalajara (Mexico), Madrid (Spain), and Salvador de Bahia (Brazil). He added that "we must work toward an Ibero-American community with organizations that have the power to decide." He stressed that regional economic integration must not be the only priority, as the process must also include other important social issues. Reina demanded "equal treatment" from the international financial institutions for Central America, whose leaders he encouraged to unite and to negotiate trade and commercial agreements with the rest of the continent as a bloc.
