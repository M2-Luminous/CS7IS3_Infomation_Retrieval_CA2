The move will ensure the smooth flow of capital to key state projects and provide the central government with a powerful vehicle to rein in excessive investment in fixed assets, said Yao Zhenyan, president of the new bank. According to Yao, the new bank, basically a merger of the six investment corporations under the State Planning Commission, will handle low-interest loans for important infrastructure construction projects and basic industries which have been bottlenecks in China's economic expansion in recent years. It is also expected to channel funds for the technical renovation of backbone state enterprises. The bank already has 345 large and medium-sized projects to support, which include the initial preparations for the giant Three- Gorges Dam, construction of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway and several big power stations, said Yao, former vice-minister of the State Planning Commission. The funding will come from the national treasury, which has promised to inject a total of 50 billion yuan over the next four years as part of the bank's capital assets. However, the working capital will come mainly from bonds issued to financial institutions which have been instructed by the People's Bank of China, the Central Bank, to purchase SDB bonds at a certain proportion of their new deposits. This year, Yao said, the bank will issue some 65 billion yuan- worth of bonds. The first issue of 28.5 billion yuan-worth will be made during April and May. The national treasury will grant the bank 1.3 billion yuan this year as discount on funded indebtedness. "It is likely that the SDB will sell bonds to Chinese individuals and float bonds, though not this year," said Yao. But the new bank president stressed the importance of investment efficiency. "As it is a state bank," said Yao, "we must ensure the return of principal, although we are not aiming at profits." At present, the right to choose target projects will stay with the State Planning Commission, "but we have a great say in deciding the timing of capital lending after feasibility studies of the projects," said Yao. He added that the SDB has a special working group comprised of senior SDB officials and experts to see that credits flow to the projects most in need of capital. The SDB will gradually set up branch offices in regions with a relatively high number of key projects, and establish overseas agencies if necessary. According to the 61-year-old president, SDB has set about reviewing all the projects taken over by the bank this year. "We will try to see that the projects get 40 percent of the funding required this year," said Yao. Sources at the central bank say the formation of the other two policy-based banks, designed to support imports and exports and agriculture, respectively, is under way.
