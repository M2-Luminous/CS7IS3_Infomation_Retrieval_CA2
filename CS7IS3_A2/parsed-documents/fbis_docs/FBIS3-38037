The U.S. President's spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said on Wednesday [23 February] that the former leader of the CIA counterintelligence department targeting the Soviet Union, Aldrich H. Ames and his wife evoked suspicions some ten months ago and were closely watched by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigations until the American Administration took the case to court charging the two with espionage. The exact date of the arrival of the American delegation is not yet known. It is likely that the CIA officials will wait for Russian external intelligence service chief Yevgeniy Primakov to return home from Prague. It is not ruled out that in view of the ballyhoo in the United States around the Ames affair, his former colleagues may ask for a prompt assignment with the leaders of the Russian intelligence service. The press service of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow declined to comment at ITAR-TASS request on the forthcoming visit of CIA officials to Moscow.
