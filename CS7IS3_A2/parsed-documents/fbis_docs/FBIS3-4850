Churin Laksanawisit, vice minister of commerce, told reporters at a Thai products fair here that there are a number of domestic quality inspections of rice before it is exported and inspected in Japan. The vice minister said Bangkok recognizes the importance of value and quality. Japan recently began importing rice on an emergency basis to cover shortfalls caused by harvest shortages last year due to an unusually cool summer. The rice imports have been met with opposition by Japanese farmers and consumer groups, along with reports that some of the rice coming into Japan has been discolored by mold. As for the flavor of Thai rice, Laksanawisit began by noting that the method of preparing the rice in Japan and Thailand is different but added that if Japanese consumers get used to the way of cooking Thai rice they would find it delicious.
