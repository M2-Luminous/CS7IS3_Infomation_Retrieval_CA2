FBIS4-15293 "drsov068__a94016" FBIS-SOV-94-068-A Daily Report 8 April 1994 ANNEX Russia International Affairs Chernomyrdin, Klaus Discuss Chernomyrdin, Klaus Discuss AU0504123494 Prague CTK in English 1015 GMT 5 Apr 949--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0504123494 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Moscow, April 5 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a Czech-Russian agreement on the support and protection of investments in Moscow today. At the same time, they agreed that by the end of May their finance ministries would prepare the final agreement on the timetable for the liquidation of Russian debts to the Czech Republic and the methods to be used. Representatives of the Czech Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Trade signed an inter-government protocol on mutual supplies of goods this year, in the premiers' presence. Chernomyrdin, who earlier spent three and a half hours with Klaus at their unofficial "introductory meeting," said after today's talks that Russia was "very interested" in Czech economic reform. He said the Czech Republic had proceeded in its reform "further than all other East European countries." "This is not just our opinion but a general one. Russia has much to learn from the Czech experience," Chernomyrdin said. He described today's talks as "good and positive." Relations between Russia and the Czech Republic would now be formed on a new basis," he added. "I believe that we have essentially managed to define the main feature of the process regarding the Russian debt. The two countries' finance ministries have to prepare a definitive document by the end of May in which the dates and the methods of its solution will be defined," Klaus said. Russia who has assumed responsibility for the former Soviet Union's debts, owes the Czech Republic a total of three billion U.S. dollars, to which may be added claims worth almost $400 million which Czech partners have towards Russian firms. According to a high-ranking Czech diplomat, Moscow, unlike in the past, today accepted all Russian debts towards the Czech Republic. Part of them will apparently be repaid on the principles of the Paris Club, the rest by deliveries of goods and through Czech participation in Russian privatization. For the first time talks on debts have got moving and have proceeded from the level of general talks to the level of solving specific problems, the diplomat said. He said the fact that Russia has recently come to an approximately similar agreement with Hungary was encouraging. Russian supplies of raw energy materials were also the subject of discussion, the diplomat said. The Russians expressed the desire to conclude a long-term agreement on oil supply with the Czech Republic. Klaus accepted the offer, adding that the question will for the time being be dealt with by experts from the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Russian Ministry of Fuels and Energy. According to a protocol on trade exchange signed today, this year Russia will deliver to the Czech Republic seven million tonnes of oil and 6.9 billion square meters of natural gas at world prices.
