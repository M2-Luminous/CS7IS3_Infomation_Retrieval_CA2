Major General Dani Rothschild, the coordinator of activities in the territories, made this statement this morning during a visit to the Allenby Bridge. Rothschild's deputy Arye Ramot clarified, however, that several more weeks are necessary for to complete the technical arrangements for the joint work with the Palestinian representatives at the border terminals. Among other things involved is the installation of sophisticated electronic equipment to examine travelers' luggage. This work will be completed in mid-July. Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el notes that today, Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar visited the Allenby Bridge, which will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Israel Airports Authority in approximately four months. Qeysar announced that his ministry will invest approximately 30 million shekels in the Allenby and Rafah terminals in order to make them more modern and efficient. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 20 June carries a report by Avi Lifshitz on Qeysar's visit to the Allenby Bridge, adding that "Minister Qeysar said Jordan wants Israel to allow its planes to fly across Israeli airspace to Europe. Minister Qeysar said that as soon as such an official request arrives, Israel will give it favorable consideration and will probably accept it."]
