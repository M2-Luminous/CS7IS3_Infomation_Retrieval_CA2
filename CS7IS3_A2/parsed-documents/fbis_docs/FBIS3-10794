FBIS3-10794 "drlat049_l_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 Bolivia Peasants: Government Wants All Plantations Eradicated PY1103230494 La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 27 Feb 94 p 7 PY1103230494 La Paz PRESENCIA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Article by Delfin Arias Vargas] [Text] Even though Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said on 26 February that the so-called "Option Zero" -- which envisages the total eradication of surplus coca plantations -- is only a proposal and that its implementation depends on the international community providing the necessary economic aid, peasant leaders assert that it is already under way. Soliz stated: "`Option Zero' is just a proposal. We must study it. This will take some time. No definite decision has been taken. It is a proposal by certain echelons of the government that we must assess. We must see what funds are available to implement it in the Chapare region." In the view of several peasant leaders who spoke to this daily on the evening of 26 February, the violent action yesterday by FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force] personnel in Chapare proves that the "proposal" to eradicate surplus plantations is already underway. Minister of Government German Quiroga denied such an outrage. Soliz stated that until the proposal is made official, the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia cautiously awaits an outcome while monitoring further developments in the problem with coca growers. He said: "They are waiting to make a more thorough assessment and to see how much money can be collected for this project. This must be supported by nations and international organizations with which we have friendly ties and which can give us the necessary funding." This cautious U.S. stance was maintained by George A. Auflick, the DEA chief in Bolivia who, during a brief encounter with the press yesterday, declined to comment. Soliz denied that opposition by the peasants to eradication will lead to clashes with Coca Eradication Directorate (Direco) officials who -- supported by FELCN troops -- have already eradicated some surplus plantations. The tense atmosphere in Chapare robs Soliz's optimistic words of any credibility. "The peasants are well aware that we are acting within the law. Moreover, the volume of plantations eradicated so far is negligible," he stated, emphasizing that the eradication of "a few hectares of illegal plantations" was done near where maceration pits had been discovered by the FELCN and that were used exclusively for the production of cocaine paste. Given the desire to fully eradicate surplus plantations, the five coca growers federations from Chapare demand what they call "Option One" -- the expulsion of all DEA agents. During a interview with PRESENCIA last week, Soliz conceded that the proposal should be given careful consideration although he stated he did not know the reasons for this demand. He said: "We cannot decide yet on something that we still do not know about ("Option One"), but we will certainly assess the role the DEA is playing in our country." He added: "We must see how it can be beneficial for the country and how not. I believe we must investigate and seriously analyze what is right for us and what should be definitely discarded because it does not suit us." On 14 February, coca growers from Chapare alleged that FELCN personnel, in coordination with DEA agents and Direco officials, compulsorily eradicated coca plantations. This action is considered by peasants as the start of the total eradication of their plantations under the so-called "Option Zero." Even though this was denied by Soliz, he acknowledged that "there is concern in Chapare over what has been done (the eradication of illegal coca plantations) in keeping with the law." This assessment sharply contrasts with that of coca growers, who noted that "they will not allow their plantations to be eradicated." During a rally of coca growers last 18 February, Felix Santos, a peasants' leader, expressed this feeling by openly challenging the country's drug enforcement agencies. He stated: "If enforcement agencies kick us, we will club them; if they destroy our plantations, we will cut off their hands." In light of the determination of the government, the peasants are demanding that "Option One" be implemented. Their leaders explained that this option entails the expulsion of all DEA agents, which could be analyzed by the government although there is a very remote possibility of this happening because U.S. economic aid to our country foresees the eradication of plantations. Let us hope this does not bring serious consequences in its wake.
