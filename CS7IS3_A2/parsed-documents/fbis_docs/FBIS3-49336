Fasung; place and date not given: "He Is Trying To Be Himself"--reprinted from Issue No. 1 of the weekly PLUS 7 DNI] [Text] "According to the most recent public opinion polls, you have become the most trustworthy Slovak politician. To what do you attribute this trust?" asks E. Fasung in an interview with President Michal Kovac in PLUS 7 DNI [Plus Seven Days] No. 1. [Kovac] Already, while being sworn in, I declared my intention to be the president of all citizens. In my conduct, I want to fully live up to these words. I believe that a steadily growing number of citizens of the Slovak Republic realizes the sincerity of this effort of mine. I am trying to be myself, independent of parties and the government. [Fasung] Efforts have recently appeared that were aimed at your scandalization. Do you think this was a reaction to the fact that you also uphold ideas other than those held by the ruling movement? [Kovac] The scandalization of politicians is nothing new on our domestic political scene. Unfortunately, it testifies to the low standard of political culture that has struck roots here. It is important that we learn to deal with problems in a businesslike way, that we learn to rise above personal disputes or different political views, and that we learn to see even in a political opponent a partner who has the same interest in resolving the complicated situation in which Slovakia finds itself. The present government emerged from the results of free and democratic elections and acquired a regular mandate for a four-year electoral term. In the event that the National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies arrives at the opinion that it is not functional, they have the constitutional right to pass a vote of no-confidence in it. In that case, following an agreement with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and consultations with other parties, I would appoint as prime minister a different personality, and ask it to form a new government. However, I cannot imagine this to be a government, in which the HZDS, which won the parliamentary elections, would not be represented. I am convinced that Slovakia needs a broad coalition government formed around the HZDS. Another possibility is to shorten the electoral term and call early elections, from which a new parliament and a new government would emerge, which, however, would have to be formed with the assistance of several parties. I consider it premature to speak about a specific person that I would ask to form a new government. [Fasung] What is your relationship with Mr. Meciar? Do you also meet privately, or only in the course of your work? [Kovac] My relations with the prime minister could be described as working relations.
