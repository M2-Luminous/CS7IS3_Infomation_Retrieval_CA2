Speaking after a 5-hour meeting with a delegation of church leaders and members of the National Peace Committee, King Zwelithini called on his subjects to stop killing each other. He said he was aware that Zulus belong to different political parties, however, as Christians they should be able to settle their differences in a peaceful manner. After the talks, Archbishop Desmond Tutu expressed the hope that the Zulus would heed their king's call. Peace Committee Chairman John Hall said South Africa would be relying heavily on peace structures in the months ahead. He said it might be necessary to meet with political leaders again to reaffirm their commitment to the peace accord.
