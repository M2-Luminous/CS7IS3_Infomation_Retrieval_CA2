We thank you, your government, and the British people for the humanitarian aid you have extended to the Kurdish people in Iraq. Your envoy, Lord Jeffrey Archer, has read the text of the message you sent to us in the Kurdistan Parliament. The measures taken by your government for the survival of the Kurdish people and to ease their suffering have been extremely helpful. [words indistinct] the safe havens and Britain's participation in the [word indistinct] alert force and your constant pressure on the Iraqi Government to implement the UN resolutions, particularly Resolution 688, not to mention your support for democracy worldwide. I would like to ask Your Excellency, in cooperation with the member states of the alliance, to try to exclude the Kurdistan region from the international economic embargo imposed by the UN against Iraq to improve the difficult economic conditions of our people. The Iraqi Government has imposed a tight siege on the Kurdistan region and is selling us fuel at exorbitant prices in hard currency. A few months ago it cut off the electricity supply to the Dahuk Governorate. In addition, the abrogation of the 25-dinar Iraqi banknote has caused grave economic damage to the Kurdistan region. The living conditions are getting worse every day. Let me repeat my request for you to show a historic stance to lift the economic embargo on Kurdistan and to continue sending aid to eliminate the fear, repression, and poverty and maintain peace and amity. I hope you will be able to visit Kurdistan soon. Best regards. Signed, Kusret Rasul Ali, Kurdistan prime minister 6 January 1994
