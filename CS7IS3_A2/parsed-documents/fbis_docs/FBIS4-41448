"We came to an understanding on this question, and in principal there were no objections either from the president or from the State Duma chairman," he said. "Two years is a very short time for deputies to `get into' normal legislative work," was how Vladimir Shumeyko explained his position. For his part, State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin in fact denied Vladimir Shumeyko's statement that the State Duma chairman had agreed with his proposal. In an interview with "Details" he said that the extension of the powers "should still be put to the people." "I think the Russian electorate thinks differently, and perhaps one ought to move toward re-election next year," he said. In his opinion, "considering the people's bitter experience, people of a quite different direction could be elected." "It is possible to extend powers in a stable situation when the policy of those who carried it out has been fully justified," believes Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of Russia's communists. "In the present situation, when the policy has become completely bankrupt, when the socio-economic situation reminds one more and more of genocide and catastrophe, and when the spiritual disintegration of society has reached an unprecedented level, the question of changing course and changing those who are in charge has not only ripened but has overripened," he told a correspondent with the "Details" program.
