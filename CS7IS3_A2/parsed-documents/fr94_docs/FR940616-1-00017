FR940616-1-00017 FR940616-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 285 [Docket No. 940538&hyph;4138; I.D. 100893B] RIN 0648&hyph;AF74 Atlantic Tuna Fisheries AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS proposes modifications to NOAA Form 370, Fisheries Certificate of Origin (FCO), to allow that form to also serve as a Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document (BSD), and proposes amendments to the regulations governing the Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries to require: An appropriately completed, approved BSD as a condition for import, export, or re-export of fresh or frozen bluefin tuna into or from the United States; a Federal permit for all dealers that export Pacific bluefin tuna; preparation and submission of a biweekly report on exports of Pacific bluefin tuna by permitted dealers; and affixation of an identification tag to fresh or individually frozen Pacific bluefin tuna sold for export. The amendments would enable the United States to assist the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in accounting for all bluefin tuna entering into commerce or international trade and would bring the United States into compliance with the 1992 recommendation of ICCAT and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA). DATES: Comments are invited and must be received by July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed revisions to NOAA Form 370 and on the proposed rule should be sent to, and copies of supporting documents, including an Environmental Assessment and Regulatory Impact Review, are available from, Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management (F/CM), NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. NOAA Form 370, as proposed to be revised, bluefin tuna dealer permit application, biweekly bluefin tuna dealer report, and tuna identification tags may be obtained from NMFS, Northeast Region, Fisheries Management Division, 1 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930&hyph;2298, or NMFS, Southwest Region, Fisheries Management Division, 501 W. Ocean Blvd. Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802-4213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard B. Stone, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347; Kevin B. Foster, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9260; or Patricia J. Donley, 310&hyph;980&hyph;4033. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Atlantic tuna fisheries are managed under regulations at 50 CFR part 285 issued under the authority of ATCA. ATCA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to implement regulations as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations of ICCAT. The authority to implement ICCAT recommendations has been delegated from the Secretary to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA). Purpose Parties to the Eighth Special Meeting of ICCAT held in Madrid, Spain, on November 8&hyph;12, 1992, adopted a recommendation to implement a statistical documentation program to collect more complete information on the catch of, and trade in, Atlantic bluefin tuna. That recommendation, which this proposed rule would implement, requires Contracting Parties to implement a statistical documentation program whereby any bluefin tuna imported into the territory of a Contracting Party or at the first entry into a regional economic organization must be accompanied by an appropriately completed BSD. The ICCAT recommendation is based on the need to improve the reliability of statistical information on worldwide harvests of bluefin tuna, particularly western Atlantic bluefin tuna, which is an overexploited stock. Without statistical documentation and differentiation with respect to ocean area of catch, ICCAT cannot determine the total harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna. While the primary market for bluefin tuna is Japan, which is a member country of ICCAT, the origin of all bluefin tuna on the international market cannot be ascertained without documentation of the flag state of harvesting vessels and ocean areas of catch. Some vessels that harvest bluefin tuna are registered to nations not affiliated with ICCAT and are not subject to ICCAT quota constraints; some of these nations have difficulty in obtaining information on the catches of vessels under their flag and therefore do not report catches to ICCAT. The documentation requirement would facilitate accounting for all fresh or frozen shipments of bluefin tuna into Japan and other ICCAT countries, by both member and non-member ICCAT countries. This information would be used by ICCAT for Atlantic bluefin tuna stock assessments, to develop management policies, and to help determine compliance with its conservation program for Atlantic bluefin tuna. In addition to the proposed BSD requirement, NMFS proposes to require a Federal permit for each dealer who exports Pacific bluefin tuna. NMFS also proposes to require these dealers to complete a biweekly report on bluefin tuna exports and to affix a tag on all fresh or individually frozen Pacific bluefin tuna sold for export. When combined with the existing permitting and reporting requirements for Atlantic bluefin tuna dealers, this would give NMFS the ability to track all bluefin tuna shipments imported into, exported, or re-exported from the United States. NMFS has determined that these additional requirements would bring the United States into compliance with the 1992 ICCAT recommendation that all bluefin tuna (Atlantic and Pacific) imported into ICCAT countries be required to be accompanied by a BSD. ICCAT has determined that inclusion of Pacific bluefin is necessary due to the similarity of appearance of the two subspecies. Without Pacific bluefin tuna dealer permits, bi-weekly reports and tags for exports, the United States could not assure compliance with the documentation requirement for Pacific bluefin. Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document The proposed rule would require a completed, approved BSD as a condition for the import, export, or re-export of all bluefin tuna shipments into or from the United States. The BSD would be required to accompany each fresh or frozen shipment along with other shipping documentation ordinarily required for international trade. Consistent with the ICCAT recommendation and subsequent agreements with Japan and Canada, the BSD would be required for all bluefin tuna beginning June 1, 1994. The BSD would be required for all fresh or frozen bluefin tuna products that are exported from or imported into the United States and identified by Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) numbers for fresh or chilled bluefin tuna, excluding fillets and other fish meat_0302.39.00.20; and frozen bluefin tuna, excluding fillets_0303.49.00.20. Contents of Document NMFS proposes to modify the FCO (NOAA Form 370) so that it can also serve as the BSD. Interested persons may obtain copies of the proposed combined form from NMFS (see ADDRESSES ). In order to be considered appropriately completed, the approved BSD accompanying each shipment would have to provide all of the required information indicated in the proposed regulatory text for §285.202 and be certified by the exporter, importer, and government official, as applicable. Validation The completed, approved BSD would have to be validated by a responsible government official of the country whose flag vessel harvested the tuna regardless of where the bluefin tuna is first landed, unless the AA waives the validation requirement for that country because the AA finds, based on information from ICCAT, that: (1)␣All fresh or individually frozen bluefin tuna available for sale from that country are tagged, or included in an ICCAT-accepted logbook or ICCAT-accepted information retrieval system; (2) all information relating to the tag, the ICCAT-accepted logbook, or the ICCAT-accepted information retrieval system is compiled by the government of that country and includes the name of the country issuing the document, the name of the exporter and the importer, the name of the harvesting vessel and the area of harvest, the gear utilized, the type of product and total weight, and the point of export; and (3) the compiled information is provided in a timely fashion to ICCAT. Validation requirements would be waived for all but bulk-frozen shipments upon publication in the Federal Register of a finding and waiver by the AA. Dolphin-Safe Tuna Designation Under the Marine Mammal Protection and International Dolphin Conservation Acts and their implementing regulations, only dolphin-safe tuna may be purchased, sold, transported, or shipped in the United States after June 1, 1994 (16 U.S.C. 1417). All shipments of tuna and tuna products, except fresh tuna, from all countries must be accompanied by an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370). As proposed to be revised, NOAA Form 370 would serve as an FCO/BSD and appropriately completing the form would satisfy both FCO requirements and, if bluefin tuna, BSD requirements. All fresh tuna and other fresh fish products are presumed to be captured by dolphin-safe methods and do not require an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370) for lawful importation to the United States. In addition, imports of certain fish and fish products other than tuna, except fresh fish, as specified at 50 CFR 216.24(e), from countries having registered vessels that use large-scale driftnets (no countries so designated at this time) must be accompanied by an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370). Although an FCO is not required for fresh tuna or any other fresh fish products, under the proposed rule an appropriately completed BSD (NOAA Form 370 as proposed to be revised) would be required for all bluefin tuna, fresh or frozen, that enters or exits the United States. Exhibit 1 below summarizes when a completed FCO or BSD, that is, an appropriately completed NOAA Form 370, as proposed to be revised, is required. Exhibit 1._ Requirements for the Proposed Revised NOAA Form 370 1Product form 1Bluefin tuna 1Other tunas 1Certain other fish Fresh Imports_BSD; Exports_BSD Not applicable Not applicable. Frozen Imports_BSD/FCO; Exports_BSD Imports_FCO Imports from countries using large-scale driftnets_FCO. Canned No HTS code for canned bluefin; requirements for other tunas apply Imports_FCO Imports from countries using large-scale driftnets_FCO. Any non-fresh form labeled ``Dolphin-Safe'' Exports_FCO Exports_FCO Not applicable. Responsible Parties For the purposes of the exporter's certification, the exporter would be considered the person or company that first exported the shipment from the country where the fish is first landed. For the purposes of the importer's certification, intermediate country importer(s) would be the person(s) or company(ies) that transship(s) the product through an intermediate country(ies). An intermediate country would be a country from which bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products that were previously imported (i.e., not harvested or landed) by that country are exported to the United States. An intermediate country for the purposes of these proposed 50 CFR part 285 regulations is distinct from an intermediary nation as defined in section 3 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 216. Shipments of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products through a nation on a through bill of lading, or in any other manner that does not enter the products into that country's customs territory as an import, would not make that country an intermediate country under this definition. For the purposes of the importer's certification, the final destination importer would be the person or company that is the recipient of the product at its final destination (i.e., country of consumption). Pacific Bluefin Tuna Dealer Requirements Permit Requirements Dealers purchasing or receiving Pacific bluefin tuna for export would be required to possess a valid bluefin tuna dealer permit and comply with all applicable reporting requirements. Tagging Requirements The proposed rule would require that identification tags be placed on all bluefin tuna, except bulk-frozen bluefin, landed by U.S. vessels and exported from the United States, regardless of ocean area of catch. Similar to the NMFS Northeast Region program for dealers purchasing Atlantic bluefin tuna, the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director) would issue numbered tags to each person receiving a dealer's permit for exporting Pacific bluefin tuna. Such tags would not be transferable. A dealer or agent would be required to affix a tag to each fresh or individually frozen Pacific bluefin tuna purchased, or received, for export, except bulk-frozen Pacific bluefin tuna, immediately upon its offloading from a vessel. The tag would be required to be affixed between the fifth dorsal finlet and the keel. Individual Pacific bluefin tuna carcasses that are landed in bulk-frozen form would not be required to be tagged for export. A tagging requirement for individual fish frozen in bulk would be difficult to implement and enforce, and would require a drastic change in current handling practice. However, exported bulk-frozen shipments would be accompanied by a completed BSD. A tag affixed to any Pacific bluefin tuna would have to remain on the tuna until the tuna is cut into portions, which NMFS understands may occur on occasion. If the tuna or tuna parts subsequently are packaged for transport for domestic commercial use or for export, the tag number would be required to be written legibly and indelibly on the outside of any package or container. Tag numbers would be required to be recorded on any document accompanying shipment of bluefin tuna for U.S. commercial use or export. Reporting Requirements Pacific bluefin tuna dealers would be exempted from the requirement at 50 CFR 285.29(a) to record and report bluefin tuna landings via the Daily Dealer Report Card. However, they would be required to submit biweekly reports on exports of bluefin tuna to the Regional Director. The report would have to be postmarked and mailed within 10 days after the end of each 2-week reporting period in which Pacific bluefin tuna were exported. The biweekly reporting periods would be defined as the first day to the fourteenth day of each month and the fifteenth day to the last day of the month. Each report would have to specify accurately and completely for each tuna or each shipment of bulk-frozen tuna exported: Date of landing or import; any tag number (if so tagged); and weight in pounds (specify if round or dressed). Dealers would be required to allow an authorized officer, or any employee of NMFS designated by the Regional Director for this purpose, to inspect and copy any records of transfers, purchases, or receipts of Pacific bluefin tuna. Finally, the dealer would be required to maintain a copy of each biweekly report for a period of 6 months from the date on which it was submitted to the Regional Director. Ports of Entry To facilitate enforcement, the AA may, in the future, designate ports of entry. If ports of entry are designated, all bluefin tuna shipments entering the United States would be restricted to the designated ports of entry, which would be published in the Federal Register . Enforcement Any fresh or frozen bluefin tuna product identified by the HTS item numbers referred to previously that is unaccompanied by a completed, approved BSD would be considered unlawful for importation into the United States. If the AA has designated ports of entry for shipments of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products, any shipment arriving at non-designated ports of entry would be considered unlawful and the importer would be subject to penalties under ATCA. When a bluefin tuna is presented for entry into the customs territory of the United States and is found to be without a completed, approved BSD, U.S. Customs would suspend entry authorization, notify the importer of record of the documentation deficiency, notify NMFS enforcement agents of the deficiency, and offer the importer of record the opportunity to cure the defect. If the importer of record cannot cure the defect within 8 hours (justified by perishable nature of product), the importer could withdraw the product from U.S. Customs territory (i.e., re-export within 24 hours under Customs supervision); place the product into a bonded warehouse; post a bond to release the product; or abandon the product (Customs takes custody), whereupon the product would be disposed of under Customs laws and regulations, as long as that disposition does not result in its introduction into the United States. In the event the importer can cure the defect within 8 hours, the fish would be released for importation and no penalties would be incurred under ATCA. If, within 10 days of fish being placed into a bonded warehouse, the Regional Director notifies the District Director of Customs that complete, approved documentation for that fish has been received, the fish would be allowed to be entered into the United States; otherwise, it would be disposed of as allowed under Customs laws and regulations. If, within 10 days of fish being released under bond, the Regional Director does not receive complete, approved documentation for that fish, the importer or consignee would be notified to redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the District Director of Customs those fish that were released under bond. In the event that any such fish is not redelivered within 3 days following the notification, without impairment in value, liquidated damages would be assessed in the full amount of the bond given. The importer would remain liable for any expenses incurred in the storage and/or disposal of bluefin tuna refused admission under these regulations. In addition, if the fish is refused entry into the United States or if the importer abandons the product, the importer would be subject to the civil and criminal penalties and the forfeiture provisions provided for under ATCA. Scenarios The following are five examples of use of the BSD under the proposed rule in which shipments of bluefin tuna are imported into and/or exported from the United States: 1. Exports from a country for which the AA has not waived validation requirements: A BSD from a country for which the AA has not waived validation requirements would have to be validated by a responsible government official for that country. The export, exporter certification, and description of shipment (excluding the country-issued tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the exporter. The exporter then would submit the original of the BSD for validation by the designated government official. A copy would be submitted to the domestic fisheries agency and the original BSD would accompany the shipment into the United States. If the U.S. importer re-exports the fish, the import section (naming the United States as the intermediate country) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD, with the importer's entries and certification, would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of re-export. If the U.S. importer sells the fish for consumption in the domestic market, the import section (naming a United States state and city as the final point of import) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's entries and certification would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of import. 2. Exports from a country for which the AA has waived validation requirements: If the AA has waived validation requirements for a country, a BSD, except for bulk-frozen shipments, would not have to be validated by a government official of that country. The export, exporter's certification, and description of shipment (excluding the country-issued tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the exporter. A copy would be submitted to the domestic fisheries agency and the original BSD would accompany the shipment into the United States. If the U.S. importer re-exports the fish, the import section (naming the United States as the intermediate country) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's entries and certification would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of re-export. If the U.S. importer sells the fish for consumption in the domestic market, the import section (naming a United States state and city as the final point of import) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's entries and certification would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of import. 3. Export of U.S.-caught bluefin tuna: Since the United States has a tagging requirement for individually exported Atlantic bluefin tuna, and this proposed rule would implement such a tagging requirement for Pacific bluefin tuna exported from the United States, the BSD would not have to be validated by a government official (except for bulk-frozen shipments, which would not be tagged and would be accompanied by a validated BSD). The export, exporter certification, and description of shipment (including the country-coded tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the exporter. The original BSD with the exporter's entries and certification would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of export. 4. Import of bulk-frozen shipments to the United States: For a bulk-frozen import, the export, exporter's certification, and description of shipment (excluding the country-issued tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the foreign exporter. The exporter would then submit the BSD to a responsible government official of the country of the flag vessel harvesting the tuna for validation, even if validation requirements have been otherwise waived for that country. The exporter would then submit and/or retain copies of the document as required by the regulations of the country, and the original document would accompany the shipment into the United States. If the U.S. importer re-exports the fish, the import section (naming the United States as the intermediate country) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's entries and certification would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of re-export. If the U.S. importer sells the fish for consumption in the domestic market, the import section (naming a U.S. state and city as the final point of import) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's entries and certification would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of import. 5. Export of bulk-frozen shipments from the United States: For a bulk-frozen export, the export, exporter's certification, and description of shipment (excluding the country-issued tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the U.S. exporter. The exporter would submit the original to the designated NMFS official for validation, then submit a copy of the completed document to NMFS (see ADDRESSES ) within 24 hours of the time of export. The original completed document would accompany the shipment to any intermediate countries, if applicable, and to the country of final destination. Classification This proposed rule is published under the authority of the ATCA, 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq . The AA has preliminarily determined that this proposed rule is necessary to implement the recommendation of ICCAT and is necessary for management of the bluefin tuna fisheries. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the estimated annual cost to all respondents in the aggregate would be less than $56,000. Approximately 230 bluefin dealers would be affected. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. This proposed rule contains new and revised collection-of-information requirements subject to review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. It modifies and renews requirements that were approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control numbers 0648&hyph;0040, 0648&hyph;0204 and 0648&hyph;0239. The public reporting burden for completing an application for a Federal permit for dealers that export or re-export Pacific bluefin tuna is estimated at 0.08 hours (5 minutes) per response. The public reporting burden for these dealers for collection-of-information on dealer reports is estimated at 0.20 hours (12 minutes) per response for the biweekly dealer reports and affixing tags, and 0.33 hours (20 minutes) per response for all bluefin tuna dealers for completing a BSD. These estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspects of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS (see ADDRESSES ) and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (0648&hyph;0040), Washington, D.C. 20503.

(c) Must retain at his/her place of business a copy of each biweekly report for a period of 6 months from the date on which it was submitted to the Regional Director. §285.152 Tags. (a) Issuance of tags . The Regional Director will issue numbered tags to each person receiving a dealer's permit under §285.150. (b) Transfer of tags . Tags issued under this section are not transferable. (c) Affixing tags . A dealer or agent must affix a tag to each fresh or individually frozen Pacific bluefin tuna purchased or received for export, except bulk-frozen Pacific bluefin tuna purchased or received for export, prior to its packaging for export. The tag must be affixed between the fifth dorsal finlet and the keel. (d) Removal of tags . A tag affixed to any Pacific bluefin tuna under §285.152(c) or under §285.201(a)(5)(ii) must remain on the tuna until the tuna is cut into portions. If the tuna or tuna parts subsequently are packaged for transport for domestic commercial use or for export, the tag number must be written legibly and indelibly on the outside of any package or container. Tag numbers must be recorded on any document accompanying shipment of bluefin tuna for commercial use or export. §285.153 Prohibitions. It is unlawful for any person or vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to: (a) Purchase or receive Pacific bluefin tuna for export without a valid dealer permit issued under §285.100. (b) Fail to affix an individually numbered bluefin tuna identification tag as specified in §285.152. (c) Remove any tag affixed to a Pacific bluefin tuna under §285.152(c) or under §285.201(a)(5)(ii), before removal is allowed under §285.152(d), or fail to write the tag number on the shipping package or container as specified in §285.152(d).

Subpart G_Bluefin Tuna Statistical Documentation §285.200 Species subject to statistical documentation requirements. Imports into the United States and exports or re-exports from the United States of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products identified by the following item numbers from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule are subject to the documentation requirements of §285.201: (a) Fresh or chilled bluefin tuna, excluding fillets and other fish meat, No. 0302.39.00.20. (b) Frozen bluefin tuna, excluding fillets, No.␣0303.49.00.20. §285.201 Documentation requirements. (a) Bluefin imports. (1) Dealers importing bluefin tuna into the United States beginning June 1, 1994, must obtain from the shipment of tuna upon its receipt a completed approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document with the information and exporter's certification specified in §285.202(a)(1) through (7). Such information must be validated as specified in §285.202(a)(8) by a responsible government official of the country whose flag vessel caught the tuna (regardless of where the fish are first landed), unless the Assistant Administrator has waived validation requirements for the country pursuant to §285.203 and such shipment is not frozen in bulk but is comprised of fresh or individually frozen bluefin tuna. (2) Bluefin tuna imported into the United States from a country requiring a tag on all such tuna available for sale must be accompanied by the appropriate tag issued by that country, and said tag must remain on any tuna until it reaches its final point of import. If the point of final import is the United States, the tag must remain on the tuna until it is cut into portions. If the tuna portions are subsequently packaged for domestic commercial use or export, the tag number and the issuing country must be written legibly and indelibly on the outside of the package. (3) Dealers selling bluefin tuna that was previously imported into the United States for domestic commercial use in the United States must provide on the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document the correct information and importer's certification specified in §285.202(a)(4) and (9). The original of the completed Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document must be submitted to the Regional Director within 24 hours of the time the tuna was imported into the United States. (b) Bluefin exports. (1) Dealers exporting bluefin tuna that was harvested by U.S. vessels and first landed in the United States must provide on the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document the correct information and exporter certification specified in §285.202(a)(1) through (7). If such tuna is frozen in bulk (not individually tagged pursuant to §285.152), such information must be validated as specified in §285.202(a)(8) by an official of the U.S. Government authorized to validate Bluefin Tuna Statistical Documents.

The original of the completed Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document must accompany the shipment of tuna to its export destination. A copy of the completed Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document must be submitted to the Regional Director within 24 hours of the time of export. (2) U.S. dealers re-exporting bluefin tuna that was previously imported into the United States must provide on the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document the correct information and intermediate importer's certification specified in §285.202(a)(9). The original of the completed Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document must accompany the shipment of bluefin tuna to its re-export destination. A copy of the completed Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document must be submitted to the Regional Director within 24 hours of the time the tuna was re-exported from the United States. (c) Dealers must retain at their place of business a copy of each Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document required to be submitted to the Regional Director pursuant to this section for a period of 6 months from the date on which it was submitted to the Regional Director. §285.202 Contents of documentation.

(b) An approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document (NOAA Form 370) may be obtained from the Regional Director to accompany exports of bluefin tuna from the United States. Bluefin tuna dealers in countries that do not provide an approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document to exporters may obtain an approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document (NOAA Form 370) from the Regional Director to accompany exports to the United States. (c) A country exporting bluefin tuna to the United States may use the approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document (NOAA Form 370) obtainable from the Regional Director or its own document, if that country submits a copy to the Assistant Administrator and the Assistant Administrator determines that the document meets the information requirements of this section. In such case, the Assistant Administrator will publish a finding to that effect and an approval of the document in the Federal Register . Effective upon the date of publication of such finding in the Federal Register , shipments of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products offered for importation from said country may be accompanied by either that country's approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document or by the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document provided to the exporter by the Regional Director. §285.203 Waiver of validation requirements. (a) The approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document accompanying any import of bluefin tuna that is not frozen in bulk from any country, whether or not that country is a member of ICCAT, is not required to be validated by a government official from that country if the Assistant Administrator waives the validation requirement for that country. Such a waiver does not apply to shipments of tuna frozen in bulk. (b) The Assistant Administrator shall publish such finding and waiver in the Federal Register upon finding that: (1) All fresh or individually frozen bluefin tuna available for sale from a country are tagged, or included in an ICCAT-accepted logbook or ICCAT-accepted information retrieval system; (2) All information relating to the tag, the ICCAT-accepted logbook, or the ICCAT-accepted information retrieval system is compiled by the government of that country and includes the name of the country issuing the document, the name of the exporter and the importer, the name of the harvesting vessel and the area of harvest, the gear utilized, the type of product and total weight, and the point of export; and (3) The compiled information is provided in a timely fashion to ICCAT. §285.204 Enforcement. (a) Bluefin tuna refused entry . If a shipment containing bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products is denied entry under the provisions of §285.200, the District Director of Customs shall refuse to release the fish for entry into the United States and shall issue a notice of such refusal to the importer or consignee, and to NMFS Enforcement. (b) Disposition of bluefin tuna not accompanied by required documentation . (1) Bluefin tuna that is offered for importation without the required Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document must be either: (i) Exported under Customs supervision within 24 hours; (ii) Released under bond as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section; (iii) Placed in a bonded warehouse; or (iv) Disposed of under Customs laws and regulations, as long as that disposition does not result in its introduction into the United States. (2) The importer remains liable for any expenses incurred in the storage and/or disposal of bluefin tuna refused admission under these regulations. If, within 24 hours of fish being placed in a bonded warehouse, the Regional Director notifies the District Director of Customs that approved documentation for that fish has been received, the fish will be allowed to be entered into the United States; otherwise it will be disposed of as set out in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. (c) Release under bond . (1) Bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products not accompanied or covered by the required documentation or certification when offered for entry may be entered into the United States if the importer or consignee gives a bond on Customs Form 7551, 7553, or 7595 for the production of the required documentation or certification. The bond shall be in the amount required under 19 CFR 25.4(a). (2) Within 24 hours after such Customs entry, or such additional period as the District Director of Customs may allow for good cause shown, the importer or consignee shall deliver an original or copy, as required, of the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document to the Regional Director, who will notify the District Director of Customs that the fish is covered by an approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document. If such notification is not delivered to the District Director of Customs for the port of entry of such fish within 24 hours of the time of Customs entry or such additional period as may have been allowed by the District Director of Customs for good cause shown, the importer or consignee shall, by a specified date, redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the District Director of Customs those fish that were released in accordance with this paragraph (c). (3) In the event that any such fish is not redelivered without impairment in value by the date specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, liquidated damages shall be assessed in the full amount of bond given on Form 7551. When the transaction has been charged against a bond given on Form 7553 or 7595, liquidated damages shall be assessed in the amount that would have been demanded under this paragraph (c)(3) under a bond given on Form 7551. (4) Fish released for entry into the United States through use of the bonding procedure provided in this paragraph (c) shall be subject to the civil and criminal penalties and the forfeiture provisions provided for under the Act if the required Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document is not delivered to the Regional Director within 24 hours of the time of Customs entry, or such additional period as may have been allowed by the District Director of Customs for good cause shown. (5) Fish refused entry into the United States shall also be subject to the civil and criminal penalties and the forfeiture provisions provided for under the Act. §285.205 Ports of entry. The Assistant Administrator shall monitor the importation of bluefin tuna into the United States. If the Assistant Administrator determines that the diversity of handling practices at certain ports at which bluefin tuna is being imported into the United States allow for circumvention of the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document requirement, he/she may designate, after consultation with the U.S. Customs Service, those ports at which Pacific or Atlantic bluefin tuna may be imported into the United States. The Assistant Administrator shall announce in the Federal Register the names of ports so designated. §285.206 Prohibitions. It is unlawful for any person to do any of the following: (a) Import or attempt to import any bluefin tuna into the United States without an accompanying approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document correctly completed with the appropriate certification.
