Thomson] [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] National Chairman Dr Frank Mdlalose on Thursday called on African National Congress President Nelson Mandela to distance himself from what he called inflammatory remarks by former president of the ANC Youth League, Peter Mokaba. An IFP statement said Mr Mokaba had called IFP president Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi a "coward" and a "criminal" in remarks on radio on Thursday morning. Dr Mdlalose said: "These statements are an outrage. They are inflammatory and defamatory and are clearly designed to scupper tomorrow's (Friday's) summit meeting between ourselves, the ANC and the government. We call on Mr Mandela to distance himself and his movement from these highly offensive remarks uttered by Mr Mokaba. He can demonstrate a commitment to peace and success in tomorrow's talks by formally withdrawing the remarks".
