In the course of this hearing, among other things, Janos Deak declared that the leadership of the Hungarian Army should consider the situation in Bosnia and prepare for any possible consequences. [Deak] If NATO intervention takes place in Bosnia, we will have to prepare to deal with a possible influx of refugees. It is also possible that allied combat aircraft might get damaged in the course of their action and will be unable to return to their base in Aviano in Italy, and it could happen that they land in Hungary. I am not thinking of the development of an armed incident along our southern border; this is in the interest of neither the Croats nor the Serbs, so there is no such danger. However, in the event of intervention, anything can happen and we must prepare for this. [Zsoldos] From a military point of view, in your opinion, is intervention in Bosnia inevitable? [Deak] Several versions are possible. It is possible that there will be no need for intervention, because the sides involved in the conflict fulfill the UN demands. If they only partially fulfill the demands, the armed conflict could still be called off. However, there is a chance of military intervention too. [Zsoldos] If such intervention takes place, what measures should be taken along our southern border? [Deak] In such a case, it is the task of the border police to "handle" the expected influx of refugees. The army should increase its radio surveillance so as to have a clear picture of the situation. [Zsoldos] Have you worked out any special crisis management plan? [Deak] No. The Hungarian Army would act in accordance with crisis management plan adopted by the late prime minister and the president of the republic two years ago.
