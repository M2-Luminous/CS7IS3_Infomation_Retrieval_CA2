This council will also seek to isolate radical PT members. Invitations are now being extended to those who will serve on the council, which will start meeting already this month. It will be incumbent upon the council to evaluate -- from the standpoint of society, not of party members -- the advertising and political content of Lula's speeches. Serving on this council will be people who are linked to the political history of each region. Its members do not have to be members of the party. In practice, the council will assume powers that are currently exercised by some radical members of the PT executive board, such as state Deputy Rui Falcao of Sao Paulo State. Falcao, Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh, and Gilberto Carvalho will join the PT leadership that will run the daily campaign. They will thus not have time to undertake any form of political analysis. Falcao is one of the leading adversaries of the PT bloc in Congress, which consists primarily of moderate members. Falcao is frontally opposed to PT participation in the constitutional revision process, and has become known for his political intransigence. Arruda Sampaio said: "I cannot understand why the PT expelled the Socialist Convergence faction from its cadres, because Rui Falcao alone is far more Shiite than the entire faction." Like Workers Cause, another radical Trotskyite faction, Socialist Convergence has been proscribed within the PT. The idea of creating a council of notables stemmed from the acknowledgement of the errors committed in the 1989 presidential campaign -- when Lula was defeated by Fernando Collor -- and from the fear that the "Shiites" may manage to control the PT campaign for the 3 October election. In 1989, the PT campaign managers had serious problems with regional party boards which were trying to influence the election and the use of free electoral advertising.
