But we are profoundly uneasy about how China's Western critics have been drawn into what one human rights group described as "a cynical trade in political prisoners". Both sides -- not just China -- are treating prisoners of conscience as mere tokens, commodities suitable to be bartered for tariff reductions, export quotas, satellites, or arms proliferation deals. Xiao Bin's only crime was to tell a U.S. television reporter what he had heard about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing. His mistake was to speak in front of a camera. For this he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The other two freed dissidents had also been convicted of "counter-revolutionary crime". Ding Junze, a philosophy instructor in Shanxi had been sentenced to 12 years for the crime of "inciting anti-government activities." Liao Yiwu, a Sichuan poet, was sentenced to four years for "antigovernment activities." This, apparently, was the making of an art video which expressed sympathy for the victims of the 1989 massacre. Under China's legal code counter-revolution is defined as "all acts...committed with the goal of overthrowing the political power of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system." It embraces "acts" of speech deemed to be "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement." The existence of this so-called "law" is the sole basis for Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin's fraudulent claim that China has no political prisoners. Wu's preposterous statement last Thursday that the functioning of China's judiciary "is something that the Chinese government cannot interfere in" was a bald application of the "Big Lie" techniques first perfected by Stalin and his apologists. We are expected to believe that the trials of political dissidents in China remotely resemble due process, and that they are not carried out strictly according to the instructions of party leaders. Wu's smug defence of China's suppression of dissent as "legal" and therefore unrelated to human rights is bad enough. Equally cynical, however, are the circumstances surrounding the release of Xiao, Ding and Liao, just one day after the release of the U.S. State Department report on human rights. We are poised for another round of cynical manipulation as the annual charade of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status negotiations meander to a conclusion on June 4, exactly five years after the Tiananmen uprising. What began as a sincere impulse to help the victims of political oppression in China has been degraded to the lowest form of political theater. Yesterday's reported release is only the first act in this year's MFN circus. China will play its part by releasing a few more political prisoners, agreeing to prison visits by the International Red Cross, and making reassuring noises about arms proliferation and helping to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The Clinton administration will deliberate meaningfully before finally pronouncing these concessions "significant, overall", and therefore sufficient to justify extending China's MFN status one more time. Congress, after a series of gestures to demonstrate the purity of its commitment to human rights, will agree -- with reservations -- that China does deserve to keep MFN after all. What are rational people to make of this? The starting point should be to state unambiguously that it is inexcusable for there to be political prisoners in China and everywhere else. It is even less acceptable for them to be treated inhumanely. There are certain universal standards of acceptable behavior which the international community has a responsibility to try to uphold. China, as a member of this community, cannot expect to be immune from pressure on this front. The question is how can pressure be best applied? Most useful of all may be simply to communicate to Beijing, as clearly and as often as possible, what are seen as minimum standards of decency for a civilized society, and to identify where we believe China does not measure up. Trade policy and sanctions have so far proved a blunt and not very effective tool for protecting or developing these freedoms in China, or anywhere else. However satisfying the rhetoric sounds, the use of real sanctions, like revoking MFN, may strengthen the reactionary and repressive elements in the Chinese leadership. But what we dislike most of all is the trivialization of human rights in China into an excuse for empty rhetoric and political posturing by U.S. politicians, none of whom will ever have to live with the consequences of their actions.
