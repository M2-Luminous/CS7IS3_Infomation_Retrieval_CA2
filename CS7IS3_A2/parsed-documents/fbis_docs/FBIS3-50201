In his regular radio program "Talks From Lany," he said all the discussions about the return of property to the Jewish communities were sometimes "humiliating." He added he was convinced that the nearest parliament session would pass a reasonable law providing for the rectification of the wrongs done to "our Jewish fellow-citizens." The issue of restitutions concerns churches, Jewish communities and most lately also the gentry. [passage omitted]
