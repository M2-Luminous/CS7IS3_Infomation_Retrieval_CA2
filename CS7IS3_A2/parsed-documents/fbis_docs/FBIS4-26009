Following the Foreign Ministry's announcement of Li's official visit to Austria, Germany and Romania from June 29 to July 12, the premier met with the ambassadors of the three countries this afternoon. Li said that China enjoys sound relations with the three countries and China's friendly cooperation with them is expanding constantly. "A long-term, stable and comprehensive cooperation between China and the three countries is not only in line with their own interests, but beneficial to world peace and development as well," he said. Hoping the coming visit would further push forward Chinese friendship and cooperation with the three countries, Li said he expects to exchange views on a broad range of major world issues with the leaders of these countries. The Chinese premier said that trade and economic ties take a major position in China's relations with the three countries, and China attaches much importance to developing this relationship, Li said, and this can be well demonstrated by the fact that a large group of entrepreneurs from major Chinese enterprises will be with him during the trip and will discuss trade and economic cooperation with their partners there. Romanian Ambassador Romulus-Ioan Budura said Li's scheduled visit to Romania is of major significance and he will be accorded the most courteous reception. The visit will exert a positive influence on Romania-China relations and the regional situation as well, the ambassador said. Austrian Ambassador Dietrich Bukowski said that the Austria visit, the first one made by a Chinese premier, will bring bilateral relations to their highest point since the two countries established diplomatic ties 23 years ago. He expects the visit to speed up the development of bilateral relations, especially trade and economic ties. German Ambassador Armin Freitag said that he believes Li's visit to Germany will play an important role in furthering trade and economic cooperation, increasing political dialogue and promoting cultural exchanges between the two countries. He said that Germany expects much to result from Li's upcoming visit and wishes it a great success.
