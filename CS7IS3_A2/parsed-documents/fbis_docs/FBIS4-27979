Kakizawa, who plans to leave for South Korea and China on Saturday to consult with his counterparts on the issue, said at a news conference, "it is Japan's policy to solve the issue peacefully and I will speak so that North Korea accepts inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and returns completely to the agency." The foreign minister said he will ask China to try to persuade North Korea to accept inspections and he will also urge Beijing to cooperate with the joint action of the international community. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata vowed Monday night that Japan would make every effort within the limits of its constitution to cooperate in the event the UN Security Council imposes sanctions on North Korea over its alleged nuclear arms development program. Hata made the remarks at an emergency meeting which was convened following weekend consultations among Japan, the United States and South Korea in Washington to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the three nations called on the United Nations to take prompt action against Pyongyang, including the consideration of sanctions.
