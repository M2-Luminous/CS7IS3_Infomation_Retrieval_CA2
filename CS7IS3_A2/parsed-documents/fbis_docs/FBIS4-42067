As of January 1995, she is to become a commissioner at the European Union [EU] in Brussels. Seventeen new commissioners will start working there. The previous German representatives, Martin Bangemann (Free Democratic Party) and Peter Schmidhuber (Christian Social Union), will be replaced. The Christian Democratic Union and the SPD may appoint one commissioner each. The SPD deputies in the European Parliament, which must approve the appointment, want a candidate with European experience. Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Bundestag deputy and vice chairwoman of the party with the nickname "Red Heidi," fulfills the conditions. The SPD leadership wants to send the former Young Socialists chief to Brussels. She was in the European Parliament from 1979 to 1987 and she knows the EU inside out. The desired candidate is emphatically restrained: "I have not yet been asked. The decision will be made by Rudolf Scharping alone." In Bonn, she would have liked to become minister of European affairs. However, if Rudolf Scharping wins the elections, he wants to reduce the government; Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul would then be left with the post of state secretary. As EU commissioner, she can achieve more, and the salary is not bad either: about 28,000 marks per month. Finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier and Kiel's European Affairs Minister Gerd Walter do not stand a chance of being appointed.
