MP Aloyzas Sakalas, chairman of both the party and the faction, told reporters Tuesday that the social democrats will ask other political forces to back their initiative because six members of the LSDP in the parliament will be unable to start the process alone. Sakalas said the parliament will consider their demand only if it is supported by at least 27 lawmakers. In a statement released last weekend, the social democrats mainly criticize the government's refusal to set a more favorable exchange proportion for people's savings during the introduction of national currency, as well as to draw a distinct line between legally and illegally acquired money. The LSDP said the Cabinet does not observe the government program that was approved by the parliament, has not worked out a program for industry reconstruction and failed to draft an investment program.
