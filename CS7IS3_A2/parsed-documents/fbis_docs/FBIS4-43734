During the formation of Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet, however, it was the Interior Ministry and the Institutional Reforms Ministry that were bitterly contested, whereas no one's feathers were ruffled when Antonio Martino was nominated for the post of foreign minister--someone who until that moment had been presented not as a shrewd politician but as the economic expert of Forza Italia. The fact is that during the entire election campaign--and until one week before the announcement of the new cabinet--Martino was reputed to be Berlusconi's economist and a disciple of Milton Friedman, who provided the inspiration for the economic policy initially of Augusto Pinochet and subsequently of Ronald Reagan. Martino's statements had dealt exclusively with taxes and financial strategies. He made only one incursion into foreign policy (and that was not until the first week in April) to brand as "stupid" Furio Colombo's contention that the presence of neofascists in the cabinet would cause great concern in countries friendly to Italy. This miscalculation by the future foreign minister was no less serious than the one he made regarding tax rates--a mistake that threatened to damage the credibility of Berlusconi's campaign. Someone more familiar with the world of diplomacy would not have shrugged off the comments that for several months had been appearing in the most influential organs of the foreign press, and would have understood the warning issued by Beniamino Andreatta--Martino's predecessor at the Foreign Ministry--when the electoral pact with Gianfranco Fini was impending. "Any more or less technical agreement with the National Alliance," Andreatta said, "will be interpreted by the press and governments throughout the world as an extremely ominous indication of a 180-degree reversal in Italian foreign policy." Martino, however, chose to continue believing that these were self-serving warnings and superficial judgments that resulted from unhealthy fraternization with the foreign correspondents in Rome. There are two versions as to why Martino was rerouted away from the Treasury Ministry (the cabinet post to which he seemed predestined) to the Foreign Ministry--a move that was announced only one week before installation of the cabinet. The first (and most malicious) version alleges that Berlusconi's decision was based on the fear that Martino's ultra-free market views--if implemented without any gradualism--could cause uncontrollable damage. Franco Modigliani found this argument convincing and commented: "Yes, it is better that Martino be confined to the Foreign Ministry." A second (and kindlier) version holds that the prime minister suddenly remembered that Martino was the son of a foreign minister: his father Gaetano had served in that capacity from 1954 to 1957, as a representative of the Liberal Party. Moreover, the fact that Antonio Martino has an American wife, Carol, and speaks perfect English without any Sicilian accent probably convinced Berlusconi that no one could direct Forza Italia's diplomacy better than he. Be that as it may, Martino quickly assumed his new role. When asked the reason for the transfer, he replied: "I am not embarrassed to say that Berlusconi values me and is aware of the need to strengthen our foreign policy." He painted a self-portrait in which he defined himself as a liberal in his politics, a free marketer in his economics, and a libertarian in his private life. Then--moving from paradox to paradox--he added five more definitions: conservative, radical, reactionary, revolutionary, and progressive. He announced that his first trip will be to the United States, and the second to Israel, "to explain that it is not true that the fascists have returned to power in Rome." He acknowledged, however, that his explanation would be more persuasive if no one from the MSI [Italian Social Movement] had been included in the cabinet. "A foreign diplomat even told me so," he says. Lastly, he announced a policy which--when implemented--will immediately bring about a crisis in relations with Slovenia and Croatia. First, Slovenia cannot enter the European Community unless it dismantles its frontier with Croatia. Second, before entering the Community, Slovenia and Croatia must return the property of the exiles. Third, Italy must be accorded a form of protectorate over Istria. A certain slogan [preceding word in English]--often used by Martino--that contains the word "country" or "state" has taken on greater significance, because these words are now often replaced by the word "power." The world press, too, is also wondering at this point about the orientation that the new occupant at Palazzo Farnesina intends to impart to Italian diplomacy. In Brussels, the unease caused by the inclusion of neofascists in the government has been heightened by the demand for more influence as a nation as opposed to a willingness to do more to accelerate the process of European unity. The fear is that adoption by Italy of the positions taken by Great Britain could lead to a deceleration of that process. Two influential press organs express this view. "Mr. Martino," THE ECONOMIST writes, "is the closest thing to a Euroskeptic that you will find in Italy. His ideas with respect to the free market, his suspicions regarding the bureaucracy in Brussels, and his opposition to the methods used to establish a monetary union, could for the first time place Italy on the British side in the European debate." And LE MONDE adds: "His reputation is that of an ultra-free marketeer who is critical of the concept of a single currency and, in general, is mistrustful of the Europe-building effort." Read My Essay Instead of to Washington, therefore, Martino's first trip was to Brussels, on the same day that Berlusconi asked for the confidence of the Senate. In the Eurocapital, rather than seeking to dispel these fears, Martino did some things that had the immediate effect of intensifying them. He gave complimentary copies of a 1992 essay of his--an essay very critical of the Maastricht Treaty and the single European currency--to the Italian ambassadors accredited to the countries of the Community, almost as if to prompt them concerning the new orientation. His most cordial meeting was with British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd. "We determined that there is a lot of room for Anglo-Italian cooperation within the Community organization," Hurd announced. This was matched by the coolness of Jacques Delors. "Experience has taught me," he said, "to judge on the basis of deeds, not words." In Washington--his second stopping place--Foreign Minister Martino introduced himself with a calling card that sounded blasphemous to anyone who believes strongly in the market but also in the rules. "Sometimes the written rules are less effective than the unwritten ones," he declared, adding: "In the USA the antitrust regulations, by hindering the mechanisms of competition, often produce results the opposite of those intended." Then, under the banner of self-aggrandizement, he requested a seat on the UN Security Council and a post in the "contact group" that is monitoring the Bosnian crisis. He received a courteous refusal of his requests. It was his good fortune that the Americans are more pragmatic than the Europeans--and also less interested in the plan to achieve strong political unity in Europe. Several days later Bill Clinton in effect opened a line of credit for Berlusconi with the words, "Let's give him a chance." The third stopping place was Paris, on the day the controversy with French President Francois Mitterrand was raging. A foreign minister who is aware that he must rebuild the image of his country would take the trouble to activate all the diplomatic channels with a view to setting up a schedule of direct meetings with his European counterparts. Martino did not do this even with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, and in a gesture of retaliation also did not attend the dinner given by Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace. The most serious crisis, however, is the one involving the Slovenes and Croats. Martino reaffirmed the veto of Slovenia's candidacy for membership in the European Community until such time as bilateral problems are resolved. And because retaliation calls for retaliation, his counterpart in Ljubljana, Lojze Peterle, replied: "If Italy wishes to reopen disputes inherited from communism, we will be entitled to reopen disputes inherited from fascism." Even sterner was the reaction of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who said: "We are confronted by an Italian imperialism and irredentism that are attempting to link up with the Serbian aspirations." In the course of his peregrinations Antonio Martino attempts unsuccessfully to calm his interlocutors by saying that in the new government "there are five cabinet ministers from the National Alliance, which is different from the MSI, which in turn is not the Fascist Party." Every day reports arrive in foreign capitals that appear designed precisely to refute his statement. One day it was the appointment of Mirko Tremaglia, who fought in the service of the Republic of Salo, as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. Another day it was the Berlusconi interview in which the prime minister rehabilitated Mussolini in first-rate fashion. Still another day it was a bill endorsed by Fini that would extend to the combatants of the Salo Republic a status similar to that accorded the Italian Army. Germany and France are accordingly keeping their distance. Norway has refused to meet with neofascist ministers. Belgian Vice Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo refused to shake hands with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe Tatarella. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreu announced that all that has been done is still not enough. Perhaps, with the passage of time, this pressure will ease. There remains a mistrust, however, of a foreign policy orientation that apears to be a strange mixture of improvisation, mini-de Gaullism Italian style, and nationalistic chauvinism. Piero Fassino, in charge of foreign affairs for the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], met with Martino both before and after Martino's appointment and judges him to be "a gracious and pleasant person" but views the foreign policy that Martino is carrying out as "a factor for destabilization." "For him," Fassino declares, "the problem is to create a single European market, and the rest--political unity--is a hindrance. In relations with Slovenia, therefore, he is conditioned by the MSI people and by some sectors of Forza Italia." Beniamino Andreatta, now the chairman of the PPI [Italian Popular Party] deputies, avoids making personal judgments of his successor in the Foreign Ministry but says of the Forza Italia people, "They are carrying out a nationalistic campaign, because they are obsessed with the desire to show their muscles."
