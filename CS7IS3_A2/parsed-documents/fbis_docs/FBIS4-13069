A week after the 'Afula suicide operation, as a result of which seven Israelis were killed and 50 others wounded, a Palestinian fedayee belong to Hamas carried out another suicide operation in Hadera, north of Hebron. As a result, six Israelis were killed and 30 others wounded, some seriously. The recent operation came while Israel was celebrating the anniversary of its establishment at the expense of the Palestinian people and their territory. It also coincided with the date set for the completion of the Israeli forces' withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area in accordance with the Oslo agreement stipulations. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is responsible for every drop of Palestinian or Israeli blood. Because the policies he has pursued, whether in running the negotiation process or in suppressing the intifadah inside the occupied territories, have encouraged extremism and subsequent violent operations, especially from the Israeli side. At the negotiating table Rabin used the method of procrastination and evasion, thus voiding the peace process of any substance and putting the PLO in a very embarrassing situation. With regard to repression, more than 160 Palestinians have been martyred by Israeli troops' bullets since the signing of the Oslo agreement. However, Rabin could have rescued the bilateral negotiations from their impasse when he assumed power, just before the eighth round. But he did not. He wanted them to revolve in the same vicious circle and with the same negotiating team for a further four rounds. When the PLO opened the secret Oslo channel and reached an agreement stipulating withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, the mentality of a fanatic Zionist general dominated that of a politician. And Rabin did his utmost as a former general to prevent the implementation of the agreement through impossible demands and by drowning the Taba and Cairo negotiations in minor details that inspire no assurance or trust. Any fedayeen operation in the occupied territories can only be seen in the framework of the Palestinian Arab people's right to resist in order to get rid of the occupation. It is a legitimate right which all the other peoples have exercised, including the French people during the Nazi occupation and the U.S. people during their revolution against the British occupation under the leadership of George Washington. As long as the Israeli occupation continues, and as long as the Rabin government continues to encourage settlement building the occupied territories and to use rocket launchers to shell the homes of intifadah activists, the resistance and fedayeen operations will continue, regardless of the human and economic losses suffered by the people of the occupied territories. The Palestinians -- moderates or extremists -- have had enough as a result of the Israeli repressive policies seeking both the land and conducting a constant starvation process for them. The moderates have been frustrated since the Rabin government's refusal to comply with the first date for its forces' withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 September. And the extremists had no option but to step up the fedayeen operations in retaliation to the settlers' provocations, which did not begin with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and will not end with the murder of a woman, three months pregnant, in Ramallah the days before yesterday evening. The United States, sponsor of the peace process, shoulders a major part of the responsibility for the deterioration of conditions to this point. Because it has always preferred to overlook the Israeli murder operations against the Palestinians, refusing to provide international protection for the people of the occupied territories when the issue was referred to the United Nations and its Security Council. The only solution to get out of this cycle of violence lies in ending the occupation and removing the settlements. As for trying to deal with conditions in the occupied territories as a security issue, not as an issue of a people deprived of their legitimate right to self-determination, it will lead to nothing except the escalation of resistance inside Palestine and further instability in the region.
