He said that the drop in oil prices was meant as measure to deal a severe blow to the Islamic republic. "The global arrogance, by creating the grounds for the drop in oil prices tried to hurt the Islamic Iran but did not succeed," he said, "today we produce the necessary raw material for our factories and foreign specialists (formerly in Iran) have been replaced with our own specialists." He added that today Iranian universities were meeting the needs of the univeristy students and that in the field of telecommunications Iran was depending more and more on the indigenous human and technical resources. He said that Iran was reaching the stage of self-sufficiency in the area of providing foodstuffs. "The farmers, the ranchers, the poultrymen and the fishermen of the Islamic Iran have all been able to meet the nutritional needs of the people to a great extent," he said. Elsewhere in his speech Rafsanjani discussed the legacy of Imam Khomeyni, saying that the legacy of imam served as a blueprint for the success of the revolution in Iran. "The nation of Iran is determined to follow the path of our late imam and will do so with ever-increasing resoluteness," he said.
