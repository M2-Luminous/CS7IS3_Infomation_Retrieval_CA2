The appointment was passed with 170 of 180 DLP votes in favor. The National Assembly session adjourned immediately after the prime minister's appointment was approved. Therefore, the 167th ad hoc National Assembly session was also automatically closed. [passage omitted] The session began at 1833 with only the DLP lawmakers present. After the session began, Speaker Yi Man-sop said that he could not let the government administration vacuum continue and that, in his neutral position, his conscience forced him to proceed with the voting on the bill on approving the appointment of the prime minister. Speaker Yi then announced that the voting began. At that time, some opposition party lawmakers who were in the assembly hall yelled at Speaker Yi asking for permission to ask questions but the voting continued. [passage omitted] The session was scheduled to begin at 1400 today but the ruling and opposition parties agreed to postpone the session four times to seek a compromise regarding the appointment of the prime minister and the National Assembly's [Sangmudae] investigation. Speaker Yi Man-sop notified the Democratic Party at 1730 that if the Democratic Party did not let him know whether to accept the speaker's mediation proposal by 1800, he would unilaterally begin the session in virtue of his rights as the speaker. The session was delayed for another 20 minutes because the Democratic Party asked for more time but it did not respond to Speaker Yi's mediation proposal. Speaker Yi entered the hall and announced the beginning of the session at 1820. [end recording] [passage omitted]
