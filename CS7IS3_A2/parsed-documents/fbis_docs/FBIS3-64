Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-25MAR94-JAPAN-CHI-US JAPAN-CHINA-U.S. Hosokawa Visit to China Yields Mixed Results SUMMARY Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's recent visit to China appears to have yielded few concrete results, either on the economic or political and security fronts. Beijing evidently did little to address issues of key concern to Tokyo, resisting Tokyo's call for a more active Chinese role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and for clarification of China's military spending. Beijing, however, appears to have reaped a propaganda bonus for use in its dispute with Washington, as Hosokawa, in keeping with past Japanese policy, sof t-pedaled the issue of China's human rights record. In addition, Beijing used the visit to signal Washington that it has other alternatives if China's most-favored nation trading status is revoked. END SUMMARY Hosokawa used the his 19-21 March visit to China, his first trip to the country since taking office last summer, to highlight the burgeoning economic ties between Tokyo and Beijing. In a 20 March news conference in Beijing, Hosokawa described the growth of trade and investment between the two countries as a "very desirable development" and stated that he and his Chinese counterparts had agreed to "continue to exert efforts to further develop our economic relations." He also noted that, as previously announced, Japan would extend a fourth yen-based loan to China (NHK Television, 20 March). Beyond the rhetoric, however, no significant new developments in bilateral relations appear to have come out of the visit. The most substantial accomplishment during the trip on the economic front, judging from media reporting, was the signing on 20 March of an agreement designed to promote cooperation between the two countries in the prevention and control of environmental pollution (Xinhua, 20 March). According to the 21 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Hosokawa and Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also discussed Japanese investment in China's auto industry--an area where the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has been pushing Japanese investment for some time in an effort to compete with U.S. and European ventures in China. Disagreement on Approach to DPRK On several issues of high concern to Tokyo, however, Hosokawa appears to have made little headway. One such issue was a reported Japanese request for China to use its influence with the DPRK to pressure Pyongyang to submit to full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). An article in the 21 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, sourced to unnamed Japanese government officials, claimed that securing China's cooperation on this issue was the main purpose of Hosokawa's trip. The paper and a 20 March Kyodo report portrayed Hosokawa as taking a tough stance on this issue, telling Li Peng and Jiang Zemin that the DPRK was using "delaying tactics," and as warning that "the international community's patience is running out and attempts to resolve this nuclear issue through dialogue may end in failure." Kyodo also said that Hosokawa expressed to Premier Li Peng "grave concern" about Pyongyang's recent stance on inspections, warning that the possibility that the UN Security Council would take up the issue was "rising," and asking the Chinese to convey the international community's increasing impatience to North Korea. Chinese leaders who met with Hosokawa, however, appear to have done little more than reiterate China's long-standing position on the issue--that the problem should be resolved through negotiations. A 20 March Xinhua report on Hosokawa's meeting with Li Peng that day quoted Li as saying that the issue "should be solved through dialogues and negotiations." According to a 20 March Kyodo report, unnamed Japanese officials familiar with what was discussed at the meeting reported that Li also stated that it was necessary to offer North Korea "what it needs" in return for agreeing to inspections. The report did not indicate what, if anything, Li said North Korea needed, although this would presumably include economic aid. Concern Over Chinese Military Spending Tokyo also appears to have made little headway in clarifying another issue that reportedly worries the Japanese Government- -Beijing's recent increase in military spending. During his 20 March Beijing news conference, Hosokawa stated that he had urged Chinese leaders to "make efforts to increase the openness of China's military programs"--a step he said would "assure a sense of security and increase the international community's trust in China." Hosokawa added that he told his Chinese counterparts that Japan would have to take the level of China's military spending into account when considering future official development assistance (ODA) loans to China (NHK Television, 20 March). Li Peng, however, appears to have responded to Hosokawa's comments with Beijing's standard defense of China's military budget, telling Hosokawa at their talks on the 20th that China's military budget was among the "lowest" in the world and assuring him that the recently-announced increase in military spending is aimed primarily at "offsetting inflation." He went on to dismiss Japanese concerns, saying that "any worry abroad" over the recently announced increase in military spending is "groundless" (Xinhua, 20 March). Footdragging on Security Council Membership Tokyo also appears to have gained no Chinese commitment to support Japan's efforts to attain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. According to a 21 March Asahi Shimbun report, Li told Hosokawa during their meeting on 20 March that, while China supported the concept of reforming the Security Council "at an appropriate time," the issue would have to be given "careful consideration" because "it will affect the interests of various countries." Soft-pedaling Human Rights While Tokyo failed to secure Chinese support on issues of concern to Japan, Beijing appears to have gained some ammunition to use against Washington in its dispute with the United States over China's human rights policy. Despite reports that he had promised Secretary of State Christopher that he would raise human rights during his talks with the Chinese leadership, Hosokawa, in fact, appears to have taken an extremely low-key approach on the issue, alluding to human rights in only vague and ambiguous terms. According to a 19 March Kyodo report, Hosokawa, in a speech at Li's welcoming banquet for him on 19 March, stated that "each nation should make efforts on human rights problems" in line with the declaration adopted at the June 1993 international conference on human rights in Vienna. Judging from both Chinese and Japanese media reporting, however, in private comments to Li during the banquet, Hosokawa appears to have undercut any impact these comments may have had. According to a 20 March Xinhua report, at a press conference that day PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jiamin told reporters that during dinner Li briefed Hosokawa on Secretary of State Christopher's recent visit to China, and Hosokawa commented that "it is somewhat unwise to impose Western concepts of democracy on other countries." Wu reportedly added that Hosokawa told Li that he "fully understands [China's] viewpoint and position on human rights." According to a 21 March Kyodo report, in comments to reporters on his flight home from China, Prime Minister Hosokawa confirmed that he made these remarks. To soften the effect of his comments on Washington, the prime minister reportedly denied that he intended them as a criticism of U.S. policy toward China. Hosokawa also played down the human rights issue during his news conference in Beijing on 20 March. In his opening statement, broadcast on NHK Television on 20 March, Hosokawa referred to human rights only in passing, saying that he had had "a candid exchange of views" on the topic, among several others, with the Chinese leadership. When questioned about what he had said to the Chinese on the human rights issue, he stated ambiguously that during the welcoming banquet he had told Li that "each nation should make its own efforts to deal with the issue of human rights, which has universal value." Hosokawa refused to comment on differences between the United States and China on the issue or on China's recent detention of dissidents. Japan's Low Key Track Record on Human Rights While Hosokawa may have sof t pedalled human rights in part because he did not want to disrupt his trip or detract from his message on North Korea by raising a controversial issue, his position is consistent with Japan's past stance on human rights in China and other countries in East Asia. Both the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and past governments headed by the Liberal Democratic Party have tended to focus on economic relations with China rather than human rights. To support their position, they have maintained that promoting China's economic development and keeping the country engaged in the international community will promote development of human rights in China more effectively than isolating Beijing over the issue. For example, in an article in the October 1993 issue of the Foreign Ministry's journal, Gaiko Forum, Japanese Ambassador to the PRC Michihiko Kunihiro stated that although the Japanese Government would ask Beijing to take "corrective measures" if a specific incident involving human rights occurred in China, Tokyo believed that "with the development of a market economy in the PRC, the consciousness of its citizens about human rights will be elevated automatically and it will become impossible for the PRC to disregard international opinions as the country becomes more involved in the international community." The ambassador added that such a process would be, in his view, "more effective than to hastily try to change [China's] opinion by force." Beijing's Pointed Message to Washington At the same time China appears to have used Hosokawa's trip to China to signal Washington that Beijing has other economic options should the United States decide to revoke China's MFN status. In his meeting with Hosokawa on 20 March, for example, Li underscored the "tremendous potential for further growth of bilateral economic cooperation, pointedly noting that the economies of the two countries are "mutually complementary" and that China's priorities for development are in "energy, transportation, and telecommunications, in which Japan is strong." During Secretary Christopher's visit just days earlier, Li, in identical terms, had held out the possibility of giving U.S. companies preference in developing these areas. A signed Xinhua commentary on 21 March similarly described the great possibilities for expanding Sino-Japanese economic relations. Hailing the rapid development of relations, the commentary noted the "wide scope" for further development of cooperation in transportation, energy and communications. "It can be foreseen," the commentary stated, "that as Japan's technology and capital continue to increasingly integrate with China's market and resources on a wider scale, it will definitely become a reality in the near future for the annual volume of trade between the two countries to reach $390 billion." Such a figure would be much larger than the current volume of Sino-U.S. trade. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji had delivered a similar message about the potential for the expansion of Sino-Japanese relations during his 23 February-4 March visit to Japan. In an interview in Fukuoka summarized by Xinhua on 2 March, Zhu pointed out that trade between China and Japan reached a record high of $39 billion in 1993, making Japan "China's largest trading partner" and China "Japan's second largest trading partner." Zhu added that, although this figure was record-breaking, "when we consider the potential of Sino-Japanese bilateral cooperation, it is a very small figure." A 4 March article about Zhu's trip in the Chinese Communist Party's organ, Renmin Ribao, stated that Zhu also frequently pointed out during his trip that Sino-Japanese trade had the potential to increase by ten times over its current level. Outlook Prime Minister Hosokawa's weakening domestic political position made it imperative that he appear to handle his visit to China successfully. Because of this, even had he been inclined to raise the human rights issue, he would probably have been unwilling to take a forceful position that would have offended his Chinese hosts and marred his trip. China will likely certainly use Hosokawa's reported private comments to Li Peng in pressing its case against Washington's criticism of Beijing's human rights record. On other fronts, Japan's growing concern about the DPRK's nuclear program and the security environment in North Asia will almost certainly mean that Tokyo will continue to press China in other forums to intervene with the DPRK and to clarify the nature of Chinese military spending.
