The unloading of 48 launching pads, 192 Patriot missiles and 84 stinger missiles has begun. Their frontline deployment will reportedly be completed by the 29th of this month. The second batch of Patriot missiles will shortly arrive to be deployed by the same date, the report says. The shipment of Patriot to South Korea by the United States and the South Korean puppet clique is a very dangerous development leading the military situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. This is a vivid indication that the rash scheme of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique to overpower our Republic militarily has already entered a practical stage. Our people and the Asian people are deeply concerned over the reckless military action of the U.S. and the South Korean puppet clique. The U.S. authorities claim that the Patriot is ``a defensive weapon.'' But it is a nonsense. In the Korean peninsula which is not large, it can also be used as an attack weapon capable of striking any spot. It is known to everyone that the target of its strike can be freely altered by the warhead it is tipped with. The shipment of the new-type Patriot to South Korea by the United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is an open new war provocation act to pose a military threat to the DPRK and deal a preemptive strike at it. The fact proves that the United States, from the very beginning, did not have the intention to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation but has used the problem as an expedient to overpower our Republic, motivated by its outdated hostile policy to stifle it. In trying to subdue us with the help of outside forces by bringing in without hesitation even the Patriot, a mass destruction weapon, the South Korean puppet clique stands naked once again revealing its ugly color to the world as a never-to-be-condoned flunkeyist traitor and warmaniac. It is a foolish dream for the United States and the South Korean puppet clique to try to overpower us with strength. It is the unshakable will of our people to answer strength with strength. The United States and the South Korean puppet clique must not act rashly but promptly stop the deployment of the new-type missiles in South Korea, clearly seeing the unshakable will of our people.
