The prime minister said the people might wrongly conclude that the government was trying to suppress an Islamic movement if it acted because they did not realise that Al-Arqam's teachings had become deviant. Commenting on the Islamic centre's disclosure that Al-Arqam was training its own militant force, Dr. Mahathir said action needed to be taken to check the spread of its influence. We have to act effectively and, to be effective, we need the people's support, he told reporters after opening the World Islamic Civilisation Festival '94 here. Towards this end, the most important thing was to make the people aware that Al-Arqam had deviated from ths true teachings of Islam, he said.
