[Sha'th] We have a clear position, namely, that the peace process should end all acts of violence by both parties. All PLO factions have committed themselves to this issue. However, the problems, violence, and crimes committed by the Israeli settlers-- and we have not forgotten the Hebron massacre and, afterward, the massacre committed by the Israeli Army itself in Gaza--all this creates an atmosphere that escalates violence on both sides. In the 'Afula operation, not only Israeli civilians were killed, but Palestinians on the same bus were also killed or wounded. Consequently, we announced our denunciation and severe regret at this operation. We, however, linked it to what happened in Hebron and Gaza, and we insist on the fact that the way out of this continued escalation is commitment to the dates, signing the peace agreement, and creation of a new situation that will prevent the settlers' violence and, consequently, ban the violence carried out by all parties. [Al-Shubashi] But, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, it seems that the Tel Aviv leaders have realized the matter, or understood the message. What about the negotiations? In the negotiations with the Israelis, have you touched on the recent developments? [Sha'th] No. The Israelis decided to leave the negotiations on Wednesday, based on a notification sent in advance to us. We, however, did our best to deter them from doing so. We told them: How can the agreement be ready for signature on 13 April, now that you are leaving the negotiations for three and one-half days out of the remaining five days? This makes it impossible to sign the agreement on 13 April. We can only view this as procrastination. The Israeli delegation insisted on leaving the negotiations. This decision was made prior to the 'Afula operation. [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Can we avoid linking this recent Israeli behavior -- namely, not to expedite the withdrawal or fulfilling the pledges stipulated by the Declaration of Principles -- on the one hand and the state of despair prevailing among the Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory on the other? Furthermore, wouldn't this situation create concern over attempts to curb the role of the PLO? [Sha'th] In fact, the feeling of anger that prevails in the Palestinian arena is caused by Israeli practices carried out by settlers. It has become clear that the crimes and massacres by settlers have never been hidden from the Israeli Army. The inquiry has gradually revealed collusion and disregard in terms of controlling the settlers themselves. We also found that the Israeli Army itself follows double standards. The violence practiced against the Palestinian people by the Israeli Army is not less than the crimes perpetrated by settlers. All this, in addition to the procrastination in reaching an agreement on the date set in the agreement we signed in Washington, create a state of anger and complaints in the ranks of our people. Moving ahead toward assuming power, achieving Israeli withdrawal, the arrival of the Palestinian force and authority, and changing the situation on the ground will create a state of satisfaction among our Palestinian people. This was clear in Gaza. When Israeli withdrawal began and the groups of deportees returned there was a clear and remarkable change among the Palestinian masses in Gaza. This is natural. Without this, the anger, complaints, violence, and counter-violence will continue in our occupied territory. [AL-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil, what is the way to get out of this vicious circle represented by Rabin's hesitation, the situation in the occupied territory, the frustration of the Palestinian people, and the eroding credibility of the PLO and the Palestinian leadership represented by President 'Arafat? How will the PLO overcome the situation so it will not reach an impasse? [Sha'th] The peace, which we began in Madrid, and, then, the signing of the accord in Washington, must be implemented on the ground to gain support from the Palestinian and Israeli masses. We have been trying to end the talks at the set time. It is no secret to say that we have worked day and night over the past two weeks, particularly following the signing of the Hebron agreement, to accomplish the mission on the set date. We have prepared detailed plans for the entry of the Palestinian police and for Israeli withdrawal, and groups of deportees have returned home. There is no doubt that we want the lists of deportees and prisoners to include all the sons of our people with all their factions. However, those who returned this time were not only from the historical political leaders, but also from the heroic leaders of the intifadah who have returned to lead the daily activities in the Palestinian street to receive the Palestinian police and authority and to change the situation on the ground. Therefore, we tried to break this deadlock through intensive work on the level of the talks and on the level of the Palestinian police so that we enter on the fixed date. I do not see any other way to break the deadlock except this one. We need Arab and international support to achieve this. In other words, the solution lies in accomplishing the preparatory steps and entering the homeland as soon as possible. [Al-Shubashi] What is your assessment of Peres' saying that Israeli withdrawal would be accomplished at the end of April? [Sha'th] The problem is that we can longer see any respect for any set date. If the matter is clear and the agreement this time is firm we will have another opinion. We have enough flexibility to accept dates that are very close to 13 [April] if such dates are decided for purely practical reasons. However, we no longer trust these dates. We want these dates to be respected in order to accept any new steps for the future. The coming date now is 13 April, so we, as well as Minister Peres, should support any necessary effort to reach this date. During the telephone call which Minister Peres held with [Egyptian] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, I spoke personally with him at his request and at the request of brother Minister 'Amr Musa. Peres tried to respond to our call for intensifying the talks and agreed on sending the Israeli delegation today, Friday, [8 April], for at least one day so as not to waste time. The delegation will come again on Sunday. A few hours after this agreement, the office of Prime Minister Rabin denied this matter and claimed that he knows nothing about it and that the Israeli delegation cannot go to Egypt on Friday. I believe that many things should be accomplished before restoring the credibility of Israeli dates on which they agreed with us. [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Dr. Nabil Sha'th. [Sha'th] Thank you.
