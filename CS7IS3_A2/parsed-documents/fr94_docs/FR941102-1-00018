FR941102-1-00018 FR941102-1-00005 Notice of Inquiry Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, William L. Massey, and Donald F. Santa, Jr. October 26, 1994. I. Introduction The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is initiating this proceeding to solicit comments from interested persons on issues related to alternative power pooling institutions. 1 1 Section 202(a) of the FPA reflects Congress' desire to promote and encourage the voluntary interconnection and coordination of utility facilities. While the Department of Energy now has primary responsibility for Section 202(a) of the Federal Power Act, see 42 U.S.C. 7151, 7172, all voluntary coordination and interconnection agreements involving public utilities must be filed with the Commission. The Commission, therefore, continues to play a pivotal role in this area. In addition, section 205(a) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) authorizes the Commission to exempt electric utilities, in whole or in part, from state law, rule or regulation which prohibits or prevents voluntary coordination. Under PURPA section 205(b)(2), the Commission also may recommend to electric utilities that they enter into negotiations concerning pooling arrangements. Since the inception of power pools, fundamental changes have occurred in the electric utility industry. Most significant are the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) 2 and the emerging development of a competitive bulk power market. The Commission has recently announced in a series of orders its policy of promoting competitive bulk power markets, and has emphasized the critical role of comparable transmission access in meeting that goal. 2 Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776 (1992). Given the ongoing changes in the competitive environment of the electric utility industry_in particular, the potential for substantially increased access to transmission_we must consider whether we are appropriately balancing our dual objectives of promoting coordination and competition. Indeed, industry participants in many regions are responding to competitive changes by exploring the possibility of changes in, or alternatives to, traditional power pools. The Commission believes that the new alternative power pooling institutions have great potential. In particular, they may be of assistance in facilitating the resolution of some difficult federal-state jurisdictional issues and in developing mechanisms for resolving or minimizing stranded cost issues. We therefore want to explore them in detail. We are particularly interested in determining whether alternative power pooling institutions may have special transmission pricing needs. 3 3 Concurrently, the Commission is issuing a policy statement on transmission pricing in Docket No. ER93&hyph;19&hyph;000. See Inquiry Concerning the Commission's Pricing Policy for Transmission Services Provided by Public Utilities Under the FPA, Policy Statement, FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ XXX (1994). We also wish to re-examine the role of more traditional power pools in an era of increased competition. For these reasons, we are initiating a notice of inquiry on alternative power pooling institutions. This notice has three parts. First, we relate our understanding of an innovative power pooling concept proposed by two utilities in Southern California in response to the California Public Utilities Commission's (California Commission) inquiry into retail access (the ``Blue Book Proposal''). 4 We also note our interest in any other alternative pooling institutions that are being explored today. Second, we briefly describe power pools as they have evolved to date in order to provide a comparison of traditional power pools with emerging, innovative proposals. Third, we ask interested parties to respond to specific questions, as well as to provide us with any other comments they may have, on alternative power pooling institutions and existing power pools. 4 Proposed Policies Governing Restructuring of California's Electric Services Industry and Reforming Regulation, 151 PUR4th 73 (California Public Utilities Commission 1994). We note that a major focus of this notice of inquiry is on power pooling to accomplish short-term transactions, rather than long-term regional planning, which we addressed in our Policy Statement on Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs). 5 While power pools do some transmission planning, it is not necessarily of a regional or long-term nature. In contrast, as envisioned in our policy statement on RTGs, RTGs may be better able to focus on long-term and regional transmission planning. In this sense, RTGs and poolcos, at a minimum, would be complementary, rather than competing, institutions. Indeed, the same institution could perform both functions. For example, some RTGs may decide to develop mechanisms to accommodate short-term transactions within the RTG. The Commission is interested in exploring whether RTGs would be appropriate institutions to accommodate power pooling. 5 Policy Statement Regarding Regional Transmission Groups, 58 FR 41626 (Aug. 5, 1993), III FERC Stats. & Regs., Regulations Preambles ¶30,976 (1993). II. Alternative Power Pooling Institutions Increased competition in the electric utility industry may signal the need for alternative power pooling arrangements. We are interested in considering new arrangements that could better capture the benefits of competition in bulk power markets without unnecessarily sacrificing coordination benefits. Serious discussion is occurring in California at the present time concerning an alternative power pooling arrangement. A. The Poolco Concept Two utilities (San Diego Gas & Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company) have each proposed creating a regional pooling company, or ``poolco,'' in response to the California Commission's Blue Book Proposal. Both proposals discuss some form of restructuring, either vertical disintegration or the relinquishment of transmission control. Divestiture has not been proposed. However, the utilities may intend to create subsidiary companies for each function that would remain affiliated.
