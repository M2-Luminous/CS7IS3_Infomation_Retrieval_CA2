Just hours after the Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said he believed there could still be a positive response by the provisionals to the Downing Street declaration, the man who leads the political wing of the IRA said he was prepared to go "the extra mile." An end to the violence was now his personal and political priority and he added: "I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign." Earlier at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting in Dublin Sir Patrick said there was still a chance of peace. He said: "We believe we may yet see a positive response from the provisionals. There are rational grounds for hope because it is so much the will of, and the demand of the people of this island." Although Mr Adams did not renounce the use of IRA violence -- the White House has sought that assurance before the State Department allows him in to America to attend a major conference in New York on Tuesday [1 February] -- the tone of his remarks tonight were the most conciliatory since Mr Major and the Republic's premier Mr Albert Reynolds signed the historic peace initiative six weeks ago. Mr Adams said: "I want to see an end to all violence and an end to this conflict. I do not advocate violence. It is my personal and political priority to see an end of the IRA and an end to other organisations involved in armed actions. "This means an end to the British Army presence and the disbandment of the IRA. It means an end to Loyalist death squads. In other words a demilitarisation of the situation. "I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign. "I have said on a number of occasions my willingness to go to the IRA with a proposition when such a proposition is forthcoming from the peace process." Pressure on Sinn Fein mounted today when the U.S. government effectively refused party president Adams his visa. A statement in Washington said the White House would only consider his application if he publicly renounced violence and threw his support behind the Downing Street declaration. At the same time, the first of four Sinn Fein "peace commission" hearings to gauge reaction to the London-Dublin statement within the republican movement was being held in Londonderry. Sir Patrick -- speaking after a meeting in Dublin of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference -- also appeared to offer greater scope than before for clarification for the republicans of the December 15 document signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart Albert Reynolds. Sir Patrick claimed that a letter sent by Mr Adams to Mr Major amounted to a request for negotiation rather than clarification. He emphasised: "We will continue to make clear what the document does and does not do. We continue to make speeches that do just that. "I do not believe there is anything between the two governments on this and I certainly don't wish to see anybody under any genuine misapprehension as to what the declaration says. "What I am not prepared to do is to negotiate. I am not prepared to unravel something that has taken as long as this has to put together, and which is very clear and comprehensive." The conference meeting, initially set to end early this afternoon, went on for more than six hours. In a joint statement afterwards, Sir Patrick and joint chairman Dick Spring, Ireland's deputy premier and foreign minister, condemned recent violence in Ulster and said a range of issues had been reviewed. Sir Patrick relayed British disappointment at the Irish government's recent decision to scrap a 20-year-old ban on broadcasting interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and other groups with paramilitary links. A similar ban continues to operate in the UK. Mr Adams said he was now actively engaged in developing an unarmed strategy. The Sinn Fein president added: "It should be encouraged, not discouraged. Indeed, despite all the difficulties, Sinn Fein has now moved to a position where our main function as a political party is to build a peace process." He said the development of that process, which included the Downing Street declaration, was a response to his party's peace strategy and the initiative undertaken between him and SDLP leader John Hume. Sinn Fein, he said, was committed to a peace settlement. He added: "I am concerned, I am indeed anxious to be persuaded that the Downing Street declaration can provide a basis for us. And even if this is not the case, even if there is a gap between what is required and what is on offer then we should all move to bridge that gap. I am persuaded to go the extra mile." Apart from the Downing Street declaration, Mr Adams tonight clearly had America on his mind when he spoke. The White House is seeking a form of words which would enable President Clinton to issue a waiver of a long-term visa ban imposed by the immigration authorities because of the Sinn Fein president's alleged involvement in violence. Mr Adams has been invited to address a conference in New York on Northern Ireland next Tuesday. It is being organised by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy. Senators Edward Kennedy and Christopher Dodd are among those campaigning for a lifting of the ban, but the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Tom Foley, one of the most powerful Irish Americans in Washington, is apparently opposed to it and there is pressure from the British as well to resist any moves to allow the Sinn Fein president in. The leaders of the four main constitutional parties have been invited but it is understood the two Unionist leaders, Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, have declined.
