[Akashi] For me, this was an opportunity to discuss all essential questions, promote peace, and reduce tensions in the region for which I am responsible. It was a good, business-like discussion on numerous concrete issues. [Unidentified correspondent] Could you be more specific, please? [Akashi] Yes. We discussed the development of the situation in Sarajevo. We also discussed the issue of Srebrenica and Tuzla. We discussed ways to improve the humanitarian aid in Bosnia-Herzegovina and also the normalization of relations between Serbia and Croatia. Therefore, the talks touched upon numerous issues. [Unidentified correspondent] Was Milosevic in favor of Sarajevo's demilitarization? [Akashi] Yes, he truly hopes for progress on the issue of UN administration of Sarajevo and the town's demilitarization, even before the peace agreement is reached. [Unidentified correspondent] I have a question for Michael Rose. Do you hold any new information about the explosion in Sarajevo? [Rose] Which one are you referring to? [Unidentified correspondent] The bomb that fell on Saturday, it is impossible to say where it came from. However, some people already accuse the Serbs. [Rose] We base our assessments on technical analyses. [Unidentified correspondent] General, how would you comment on such a destructive effect of only one mortar bomb? [Rose] The destruction was great for one bomb alone. The reason that it occurred is that it landed on a market stall at waist height. For this reason, the effect was to devastating. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Akashi, what do you think is the future of the Geneva talks? [Akashi] President Milosevic assured me that the talks on 10 February will be held and that topics of interest will be discussed by the three sides. [Unidentified correspondent] How do you comment on possible air strikes against the positions of the Bosnian Serbs? [Akashi] I believe that the NATO Council will examine the question of air strikes in relation to the proposal by the UN secretary general. [Unidentified correspondent] What will your report to the UN Security Council contain regarding the present situation? [Akashi] I will inform the UN Security Council about the reports and findings that I have already sent to New York. My latest report, of yesterday, referred to an immediate and total cease-fire. We will continue with our efforts even though there have been no results so far as a cease-fire would be extremely useful to reduce tensions and prevent tragedies like the ones we have seen in Sarajevo in the last few days. [Unidentified correspondent] Are you worried that if strikes do take place this will escalate the entire matter? [Akashi] I believe that everybody is definitely worried about the consequences of any sort of air strikes. [Unidentified correspondent] Are you worried for UN troops in Bosnia now? [Akashi] We are worried about many things, yes. O.K.? Thank you very much. [end recording]
