FR941206-0-00119 FR941206-0-00017 Under this streamlined cost-of-service procedure for upgrading headend equipment, independent small systems and small systems owned by small MSOs may increase rates to recover the costs associated with new headend equipment that is used to add channels to CPSTs. In order to recover costs for headend equipment, qualified small systems will be required to certify to the Commission the level of costs they have actually incurred for adding headend equipment. The Commission also decided to limit the amount small systems may recover under this special allowance to prevent unreasonably sharp rate increases to small system subscribers. The amount a small system may recover for each channel added shall be limited to programming costs incurred plus the lesser of the actual cost of the headend equipment or $5,000, which is consistent with comments that the addition of a satellite channel can cost between $2,500 and $5,000. Headend costs that are to be recovered through increased rates must be depreciated over the useful life of the equipment. While the Commission has not prescribed depreciation rates, cable operators are required to follow reasonable depreciation practices. Depreciation and useful life of the equipment are to be submitted to the Commission with the cost certification. In addition, the rate of return the small system may earn on this investment may not exceed 11.25%. Small systems may apply this streamlined cost-of-service procedure for channels added after May 14, 1994, but may not use this methodology to increase rates to reflect channel additions until January 1, 1995. Moreover, small systems that increase rates as a result of any channel additions pursuant to either this methodology may add a maximum of seven channels to CPSTs over the next three years. This is equal to the number of channels that a system taking the maximum 20 cent per channel adjustment may add under the Operator's Cap. h. Systems with more than 100 channels. In the Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission noted that the Fourth Report and Order 59 FR 17943, 17955&hyph;17956 (April 15, 1994), established per channel adjustments for systems with total channels on regulated tiers of 100 channels or fewer. It did not establish per channel rates for systems that provide more than 100 channels. The Commission solicited comment on whether it should establish a method for adjusting capped rates in situations where there are more than 100 regulated channels and, if so, what that method should be. The Commission additionally asked whether the going forward methodology should be modified to provide greater or lesser compensation to operators for adjustments to capped rates when channels are added or deleted from BSTs and CPSTs, and whether this would better meet the goals of encouraging infrastructure development and growth of programming. The existing going forward regulations use a declining per channel adjustment as the number of channels on a system increase. In contrast, in this Report and Order the Commission has decided to allow (1) a flat per channel adjustment for the addition of new channels to CPSTs, subject to an Operator's Cap, and the License Fee Reserve, and (2) NPTs for which cable operators set the price. Because the revised regulations allow operators to set the price for an unlimited number of channels on NPTs, the Commission does not believe it is necessary to adopt any other rules that are based on a specific number of channels. Cable operators continuing to add channels under the current rules may receive a per channel incentive only for the first 100 channels on BSTs and CPSTs. i. Term of the revised channel addition rules . A. The new rule for adjusting rates when channels are added, deleted or substituted on CPSTs will be in place through December 31, 1997, and will be reviewed prior to the end of that period to determine if there is any reason to continue to provide incentives to increase the number of channels on any CPST. The new rule will expire on that date and will be replaced by the existing rule unless the new rule is reinstated by the Commission. The special streamlined cost-of-service procedure for headend equipment costs for small systems also will expire on December 31, 1997, unless it is reinstated by the Commission. D. Negative Option Billing 1. Background Section 3(f) of the 1992 Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 543(f), prohibits negative option billing, which occurs when a cable operator charges a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. A subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment may not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment. The Rate Order, 58 FR 29736, 29748 (May 21, 1993), provided that changes in the mix of programming in a tier, including additions or deletions of channels, will not be subject to the negative option billing provision unless they change the fundamental nature of the tier. The Commission believed that, on balance, the benefits to subscribers from giving operators the ability to diversify, improve or otherwise modify their offerings in a tier outweigh the slight reduction in subscriber choice that results from exempting such changes from the negative option billing prohibition.
