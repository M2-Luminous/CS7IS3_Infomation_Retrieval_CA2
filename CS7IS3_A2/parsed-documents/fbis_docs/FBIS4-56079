Gradacac and the surrounding area have been vibrating to the thunder of heavy shells exploding since 0530 this morning. The enemy launched this extremely powerful artillery attack from Gornje Krecane with three tanks, 82-mm and 120-mm mortars, recoilless guns, and all kinds of antiaircraft weapons. At the time of this report, over 500 shells have already landed on the defense lines in Novalici, (Osmanovici), and Vida. Over 50 have been directed at the town center. This situation reminds us of the time of July 1992. Gradacac is experiencing true hell. This is the worst morning of the war this year. At about 0800 the chetniks launched an infantry attack at the area of (Osmanovici), but it was successfully repelled. [words indistinct] Jasenica, and Rajska also came under a very heavy artillery, infantry, and armored attack early this morning. As we report, the situation on the front is deteriorating further and the attacks seem to be intensifying. The aggressor is firing howitzers at the town center. But despite everything the defense lines are firm and stable.
