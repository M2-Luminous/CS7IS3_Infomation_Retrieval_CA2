These statements were reported by news agencies and some world radios. Al-Bid said in that interview that if a plebiscite is held in the southern and eastern provinces, the majority will prefer returning to conditions that existed before 22 May 1990. This is secession. We regret this statement by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] secretary general. It casts doubt on the patriotism of citizens in the southern and eastern provinces and on their adherence to unity. We express our absolute rejection of this accusation, which we consider to be directed against all the Yemeni people. We consider this statement an accusation of the YSP itself because we firmly believe most YSP members adhere to, and will continue to adhere to, unity and democracy. The forces of defection and secession that have influence inside the YSP draw strength from foreign forces that target unity and democracy in Yemen. We believe this statement is not only a serious accusation directed against the the Yemeni people, particularly the majority of YSP members, but also a statement with very serious dimensions.
