Slavisa Sabljic has a report. [Sabljic] Abdic said that the idea of autonomy was supported by Muslims in the diaspora, but not by the diplomatic authorities in Sarajevo which, via their primitive sympathizers, have opted for the war and the bloody quenching of our army's struggle for its own province and autonomy. The ignominious action and the rebels' offensive that began on 10 June had been prepared for months, Abdic went on to say and stressed that the offensive's final aim was to strangulate the province and liquidate the province's leaders. However, Abdic said, it is impossible to strangulate the province, there can only arise an all-people's resistance front, which we will organize. Stressing the fabrications, media madness, and the lies that certain media spread to the international public, Abdic said at the end of his interview on Velkaton Radio that the REUTER agency blazed the trail in spreading lies about Muslim conflicts in the province. A REUTER team of journalists will soon arrive in Kladusa in order to, as Abdic put it, deny their own reports.
