When we add to that that groups of experts have already begun to work in Vienna and by 15 March were supposed to work out the remaining details as to the interpretation of the various articles, and delineate the borders of the cantons in the federation, one gets the impression that the public, the political parties, and professionals are quite surprised by the speed at which the United States, which authored the idea of this political breakthrough, has been leading the entire project toward its conclusion. One consequence of that confusion and the speed with which events have been taking place, and there is good reason to refer to them as fateful, and of the lack of complete information about essential details of such agreements, is that a vacuum has been formed in the Croatian Republic concerning the real scope of these intragovernmental and intergovernmental agreements. Various interpreters, depending on their past political position, have been expressing satisfaction at the indications of a Croatian-Muslim alliance, or on the other hand outright fear that the Croats, again in the kitchen of Western policy, just as in 1918, will be tricked into a forced alliance first with the Muslims and perhaps also with the Serbs. Is Croatian Foreign Minister Granic, who was the first to sign the Washington agreement, thereafter to call upon the Bosnian Serbs from Paris to join him (which horrified the public), an experienced diplomat who knows the consequences of what he does, or on the other hand is he a synonym of the policy suggested by the phrase "a goose in the fog"? That is why we need to see what has been signed. The Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina, according to the preliminary agreement, have entered the Federal Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign people. This is a normal state with a federal system (the federal units are cantons) and with a strong central power. All the essential powers come under the jurisdiction of that government, which will be in Sarajevo: foreign affairs, national defense (joint supreme command), economic policy, finance (a single currency), and energy. The central government and the cantons will join together in controlling human rights, health care, building roads and communications, citizenship, tourism, and, and this is very essential, immigration policy. The cantons will have jurisdiction over the police (which will have cantonal insignia), upbringing and education, culture, and housing policy. Housing policy is very important, because, for example, under this agreement the central government in Sarajevo cannot build several buildings in Neum without a permit from the canton government, nor can persons from other cantons acquire the right to move into Neum (or other places) without consent of the canton government. Those regulations are very essential because of the Croatian fear that under the cover of the federation there will be a change in the ethnic composition of the cantons, that is, that the Muslims, because of their greater numbers and faster population growth, will move into the Croatian cantons and thus alter the ethnic composition, and the consequence, according to Radovan Pavic, would be to turn the federation into Muslimania. According to chairman Zubak of the presidential council of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna (whose bodies will function in the transitional period until the agreement is implemented), there will be three cantons with a predominant Croatian majority: Herzegovina, the Sava Valley, and central Bosnia (where the Muslims will also have their canton). The central government, which, as we have seen, will have large powers, will be set up on a parity basis; the Croats will have at least one-third of the ministers in the government, and if the prime minister is a Muslim, his deputy is a Croat and vice versa. Fear of the Bottomless Hole The legislative body (parliament) would consist of two houses: the Chamber of Nationalities (the same number from each nationality) and the House of Representatives (on a proportional basis). The president of that federation would be a Muslim one year and a Croat the next, but the office of president would not have broad powers. That state, the federation, and this is part of the same arrangement, would enter into a confederal alliance with the Republic of Croatia. To what extent will the federation of Croats and Muslims, devastated by war, with an economy that differs utterly from the Croatian economy, rich only in timber and a poor kind of ore, be a burden on Croatia? Croatia, that is, has bad experience with the constant financing of the underdeveloped republics of Yugoslavia, which were usually a bottomless hole. So, will this be a repetition of history that would affect the economic stability of the Croatian state, or are other relations involved? The provisions of the confederal agreement, under which a customs and monetary union and defense agreement would be established between the two states, which "would not change their international identity or legal individuality by establishing the confederation," are the occasion for such fears. Lawyers say that they will always be two states, economists are more skeptical in this regard and say that a customs union and monetary union envisage a single market, that is, an entire space in which people will move and trade without restriction. If a customs union is established, then that means that on the border between Croatia and the federation there will be no customhouses, but only police control. And a monetary union does not mean that one currency will be in use on the territory of the confederation: Economists cite the example of the European Union, in which for the present each state has its own currency, although they have entered into a monetary union, and the ECU [European Currency Unit] is only an accounting unit. And then the military alliance, as stated in the confederal treaty, includes "coordination of defense policies and establishment of joint supreme commands in case of war or immediate danger of war for any party." To be realistic, that type of cooperation (military) could take effect immediately, because both sides are threatened by Serbian aggression. Does this mean that the Croatian Army should go to war in eastern Bosnia if the Muslims want to get back territory from which the Serbs have ethnically expelled them, or would the army of the federation (it is not clear as yet how it will be organized) or a part of it, the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, go to liberate Knin or Vukovar if Croatia invited it on the basis of the confederal treaty? Who Will Repay the Debts? The most unclear part of the treaty relates to economic cooperation. Although they will remain in formal terms two states with independent governments and legislation, the treaty also contains a provision that "Croatia and the federation will adopt internal regulations as soon as possible and conclude accords necessary to establish" a customs union and monetary union. Which nevertheless means that those internal regulations would not be altogether independent, but would have to be "reconciled." Would it not be a consequence of that reconciliation that Croatia would nevertheless be deprived of a part of its sovereignty, especially when we bear in mind that the entire "Washington arrangement" was nevertheless imposed on it? Will the federation repay its debts alone, or will this be done together with Croatia? Croatia furnished Yugoslavia, through tourism and an economy to some extent oriented toward export, 80 percent of the inflow of foreign exchange (which is why financial institutions in the world were against the separation of Croatia from Yugoslavia). Will this same procedure be repeated on behalf of the foreign exchange liquidity of the federation, which will have a hard time earning foreign exchange in view of the fact that its industry is old and mainly military in nature? economists wonder. Unless Croatia aids reconstruction and development of the federation, an economic gap will be created between the two states: This could result in a quite considerable emigration of Croats from the federation (following trends which existed even in the past), and the consequence of that in turn could be the disappearance of Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the demographers warn. This kind of Washington agreement is being interpreted as an American (but also Croatian) gift of Herceg-Bosna to the Muslims. Opponents of this kind of thinking point their finger at the powers of the canton governments, which have the right to regulate moves from one canton to another and to oversee housing policy. The ethnic composition of the population on that territory would mainly be altered from what it was in the former federation. They say that Croatia would get a new market for its products, that it would also get manpower which it lacks, and as the stronger and more highly developed it would impose its interests through the economic flows of the federation, not the other way about, even if the same currency is used over the entire space of the confederation. Promises and Guarantees Then they add the international aspect of the entire Washington package. Croatia, according to them, extricated itself from a very difficult situation at the last moment. It was threatened by sanctions, it was isolated from European financial and political associates. It had no true ally that would support it concerning recovery of the occupied territories. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina it could not come out the victor in an exhaustive war with the Muslims. Now the situation has changed altogether, they say, an intergovernmental alliance has been created against the main enemy--Milosevic and his satellites. The offers of membership in the European Union and NATO through the Partnership for Peace are the guarantee of success. Yes, they are told by opponents, but those are all promises, where are the guarantees that the Croatian-Muslim federation will embrace more than the present 30 percent of territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who says that the United States will not force Croatia in the same way to conclude a federation with Krajina, what if the Bosnian Serbs, who will make a confederation with Serbia, also decide to join the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina? Is that not Yugoslavia all over again? Those are not the only quandaries and murky areas associated with this federal-confederal tale. There are also analyses of the distribution of spheres of interest of the great powers associated with it. It remains to be seen how long and in what fashion this governmental marriage of Croats and Muslims will last and what the consequences will be. Still, one thing is certain. It was imposed by the United States, so that it has a flavor of punishment for both sides. The Muslims wanted their own state with an outlet to the Sava and to the sea. The Croats wanted Banovina, their own state in which after a long time they would live without an alliance with other nationalities. On this occasion, this was not made possible either for the Muslims, because of the danger of radical Islam, or for the Croats, presumably because of their historical habit of always having trouble with certain multinational communities, defending Christianity, or drawing someone into Europe. It does not sound very optimistic to speak of the confederation as a punishment. Once again, just as in 1918, the Americans have created a fog, for the moment it is unclear who will get the role of the "goose."
