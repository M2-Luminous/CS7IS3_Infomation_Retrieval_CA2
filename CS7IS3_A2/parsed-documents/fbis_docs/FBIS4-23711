The NPFL says it has identified this minister, who continues to (?propagate) lies and deception against the interests of the organization. The NPFL says this minister in question has been collaborating with ECOMOG [Economic Community of West Africa States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] to carry out a diabolical plan to arrest NPFL officials in Monrovia, exposed the minister involved [sentence as heard]. Although the minister was not openly identified, last week press reports in Monrovia quoted Internal Affairs Minister Samuel Dhokie opposing the calls by the leadership of the NPFL for the formation of a transitional army to defend the sovereignty of Liberia in the wake of threats by Nigeria-dominated alien army. Minister Dhokie said he is opposed to the idea of the formation of a national army until disarmament and internment are completed. Political observers are questioning the motive of Minister Dhokie in opposing the idea of a national army [words indistinct] for an organization he represents. The observers say Minister Dhokie must be clear on who he represents in the LNTG [Liberia National Transitional Government], as his pronouncements can only make anyone to believe that he is representing himself. Meanwhile, the leadership of the NPFL has expressed alarm and concern over the sweeping wave of arrests of Liberians in Monrovia by ECOMOG. The citizens are being subjected to forced labor by ECOMOG in Monrovia.
