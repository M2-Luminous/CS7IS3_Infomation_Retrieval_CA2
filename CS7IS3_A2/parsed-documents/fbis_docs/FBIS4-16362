Apparently the Deputies Will Not Be Allowed To Ratify Partnership for Peace"] [Text] The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry is going to propose to today's session of the CIS heads of state council to include in the final document a description of the NATO Partnership for Peace program as "a mechanism to create a collective security system in Europe." This was announced by Yuriy Ushakov, director of the Foreign Ministry's Department for European Cooperation, at yesterday's hearings in the State Duma on "The NATO Program and the Future of the CIS." He recalled that "whether Russia wants it or not," Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia have already signed the Partnership documents and their example is soon to be followed by Kazakhstan and Turkmenia [Turkmenistan]. According to the diplomat, "even if this is not quite the `partnership' Moscow would like to have, the Foreign Affairs Ministry sees only two ways out of this situation for Russia: Take offense, shut itself up, and thus find itself in isolation; or join the program and use its elbows vigorously to uphold Russia's interests" and so prevent NATO's expansion. Major General Pavel Zolotarev, who spoke at yesterday's hearings on behalf of the Russian Defense Ministry, fully supported such a position by the Foreign Affairs Ministry. "We will never be able to force NATO to dissolve itself anyway," he complained, calling on the house to work to achieve a status desirable for Russia "from within." CIS Council of Ministers Secretary Leonid Levashov expressed active disagreement with Russia's and the East European countries' signing the Partnership, stating that in that event "NATO allies will appear in Russia's rear." This opinion is also shared by a considerable part of State Duma deputies. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord has circulated demands on obligatory ratification by parliament of the deed of accession to the Partnership (with an obvious hint for a subsequent refusal by the lower chamber to do so), while the Agrarian Party faction even prepared a corresponding Draft Federal Law. Foreign Affairs Ministry department chief Yuriy Ushakov explained, however, that the signing of the Partnership is "not an agreement or a treaty but a declaration of intent," and therefore it does not call for special parliamentary approval.
