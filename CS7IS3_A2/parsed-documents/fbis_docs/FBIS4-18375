The poll was taken from Monday [14 March] to Wednesday this week. There are noticeable differences in the replies given before the agreement had been concluded (Monday and Tuesday) and after the EU agreement with Norway finally became a reality (Wednesday). The poll was conducted with 1,000 interviewees, 680 of whom were interviewed on Monday and Tuesday. Of these 680, or 51 percent, said no to Norwegian membership in the EU, 28 percent said yes, and 21 percent belong to the don't-know group. The picture is quite different with the 320 who were interviewed on Wednesday. There continues to be an undeniable majority for no -- 43 percent -- but 35 percent do say yes to Norwegian membership in the EU. It is interesting to note that among the voters who were asked after the EU negotiations had been concluded, there still is a large group of undecideds: 22 percent. The overall numbers are quite clear, though: Following recent months' polls where the no side has been dropping and the yes side advancing, the March opinion poll shows a different trend. The yes side dropped by 6 percent from February (from 37 to 31). The no side advanced by 1 percent (from 48 to 49). The dropouts from the yes side have joined the undecideds. In February 15 percent said they were not sure how they would vote in a referendum, in March 21 percent were not sure. The background data of the March poll show increased uncertainty among the voters, in spite of the intense focus the media has put on the EU negotiations in recent weeks. The explanation would appear to be that the EU thriller is confusing to the voters. A very interesting trend as the battle for the voters intensifies is that more and more voters are abandoning their surefire stands both on the no and the yes side of the issue. More people are choosing the options "probably no" and "probably yes." In February 24 percent said "definitely yes." Now 16 percent are saying this. On the no side 37 percent said "definitely no" one month ago. Now 34 percent are saying this. Taking a long-term view, we find that absolute certainty is on the decline: Ten percent fewer said "definitely no" in March than in November (44 vs. 34 percent).
