FR940224-1-00032 FR940224-1-00009 Instead of attempting to produce a constant supply of cold-start emissions, EPA is considering the possibility of requiring manufacturers to use engine-out emissions as a surrogate for cold-start emissions. Recognizing that an ineffective catalytic converter is the major (though not only) vehicle-related factor which differentiates the cold start, EPA has compared cold-start emissions and high-emitting vehicle emissions to engine-out emissions using available emission data. This analysis 7 showed that, in terms of both chemical composition and relative concentrations, engine-out organic emissions closely resemble cold-start and high-emitting vehicle emissions. In addition, a comparison of FTP composite emissions showed that engine-out and tailpipe organic emission species were nearly the same on a qualitative basis, although the engine-out emissions appeared at a greater overall concentration. Thus, bypassing the catalyst produced emissions representing a comprehensive aggregate of characteristic combustion products at enriched concentrations, including the species which are otherwise emitted only during the cold start. The enrichment of organic emissions is an important side benefit for the biological testing program because richer hydrocarbon streams will be available for toxicology testing for any given level of CO 2 and water vapor. (It should be noted, however, that CO levels are also raised, and may themselves become a limiting factor.) EPA requests comments on the use of engine-out emissions for the F/FA biological testing program and welcomes suggestions regarding this proposal or other alternative approaches. To be most useful, such comments should include supporting emission data. 7 See memorandum to the docket from Stephen Mayotte, entitled ``Engine-out versus Tailpipe Emissions in Light-duty Vehicles''. With the exception of exhaust after-treatment devices, EPA proposes that all normally required emission control equipment be present and fully operational on all test vehicles and heavy-duty engines used in the generation of engine-out emissions. This may require replacing catalytic converters and particulate traps with other devices capable of simulating the back pressure, residence time, and mixing characteristics usually provided by these devices. Another approach could be to install a blank catalyst (no catalytic wash coat) in the exhaust system where the production catalyst would normally be installed. EPA requests comments and suggestions on this or other suitable alternative methods that would ensure the appropriate operation of the exhaust system. B. Mileage Accumulation for the Testing of Atypical F/FAs In the NPRM, EPA proposed 25,000 miles as the minimum mileage which must be accumulated on the emission-generation vehicle before generating emissions for characterization and animal testing purposes. For fuels and fuel additives containing atypical elements, mileage accumulation was proposed to continue after 25,000 miles, if needed, until the emissions of the atypical element(s) reached steady state or until the vehicle or engine has been operated for 80 percent of its estimated useful life (e.g., 80,000 miles for light-duty vehicles). ``Steady state'' was defined in the proposal as the point at which the mass of the atypical elements emitted during the performance of one or more UDDS or engine dynamometer schedules is within 10 percent of the mass of the atypical elements that entered the combustion chamber during the driving cycles. Based in part on comments received from the regulated industry, EPA is now considering different mileage accumulation approaches. In the case of a fuel or fuel/additive mixture meeting baseline or non-baseline criteria, EPA believes that an accumulation of 4,000 miles on a light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck or 125 hours on a heavy-duty vehicle (fueled exclusively with the fuel or fuel/additive mixture to be tested), should be sufficient to stabilize emissions. The 4,000 mile/125 hour mileage accumulation requirements are consistent with the emission stabilization procedures used for emission-data vehicles in EPA's new vehicle certification program. 8 8 40 CFR 86.094&hyph;26, Mileage and service accumulation; emission requirements.
