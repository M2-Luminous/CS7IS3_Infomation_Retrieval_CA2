FBIS4-12091 "drnes065dd_94002" FBIS-NES-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Ghawshah on Negotiations, Police Force Ghawshah on Negotiations, Police Force NC0404120294 Cairo Voice of the Arabs in Arabic 0610 GMT 4 Apr 94 NC0404120294 Cairo Voice of the Arabs Arabic BFN [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, what new principles must the upcoming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations be based on after a full month of hiatus following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? How do the Palestinians envision the next talks? [Ghawshah] Undoubtedly, the negotiations will be based on the practical implementation of the Declaration of Principles. But we can say that the new talks must focus on accelerating the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho as a practical preparation for the full implementation of the Declaration of Principles. This will be the first step in the interim stage before subsequent steps are taken to reach the final stage. [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that the arrival of the first groups of Palestinian police in Gaza beginning on Tuesday is a real beginning to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement? [Ghawshah] The arrival of the first group of police is part of the latest agreement on the security measures following the Hebron massacre. We are supposed to begin these moves within days, on Thursday at the latest, for the entry of the first battalion of the Palestinian police force. We believe that this is the beginning of a tangible step that must be followed by others. We will discuss a timetable for the entry of the Palestinian police as soon as possible during the negotiations. [Al-Jundi] Do you think that the Palestinian police force, still in its initial stage, can protect the Palestinian people under the occupation, or must international forces impose themselves at this stage? [Ghawshah] The Palestinian police will face no problem except from one side, the armed settlers. This is a major responsibility that also rests on the shoulders of the Israeli police. International observers must be deployed in areas where Palestinian forces are not, such as Hebron. But for us, we believe the Palestinian police force, when its deployment is completed, can perform its duty and face all eventualities, including aggression by settlers, especially in Gaza and Jericho. [Al-Jundi] Has the relationship among the Palestinian force, the Israeli Army, and the Jewish settlers been decided? [Ghawshah] This is one of the points being discussed at the Cairo negotiations. [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, the Palestinians have asked that the Palestinian-Israeli talks be transferred to Cairo instead of Washington. This is because of the Egyptian diplomacy's clear activity in reconciling the two sides at the negotiating table, which is known as positive mediation. [Ghawshah] There is undoubtedly a big qualitative difference in the role and effort. Before anything else, Egypt is an Arab country. It has its clear position in supporting the rights of the Palestinian people, and it has a positive role in pushing the negotiations toward the practical implementation of the UN resolutions, including Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. In addition, Egypt knows the details and it is geographically close. This makes the Egyptian role effective. On the other hand, so far the United States has not been playing its full role. It has not been an active partner. U.S. officials have often said that they would leave the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators without intervention in their negotiations. But the fact was that the Americans were biased toward the Israelis. In short, we can say that the Egyptian role is outstanding. The efforts of Egyptian diplomacy were clear in both the negotiations and in supporting the struggle of the Palestinian people until they achieve their full rights, including their rights to repatriation, self-determination, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. [Al-Jundi] Thank you. [Ghawshah] You are welcome.
