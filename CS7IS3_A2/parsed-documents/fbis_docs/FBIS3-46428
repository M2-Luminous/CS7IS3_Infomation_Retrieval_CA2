Statistics from related departments show that this year the state will continue to inject a large amount of funds in key transport and telecommunications construction projects. The planned infrastructure construction budget for the Ministries of Railways, Communications, Posts and Telecommunications and Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) have all risen by a large margin, compared with the sum applied in 1993. While last year the Ministry of Railways made use of an infrastructure investment of 22.5 billion yuan, this year the state has ratified a huge sum of 41.7 billion yuan; and while the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications applied an investment of 40 billion yuan in fixed assets last year, this year the planned budget has risen abruptly to 53.6 billion yuan. Transport and Telecommunications have long been "bottlenecks" restricting China's economic development. With the constant and high-speed development of the country's economy in the past few years and the implementation of a market economy system, the problem has become increasingly serious. To remove the "bottlenecks", Chinese leaders have put infrastructure construction in these fields under special protection and drafted a series of preferential policies for project approval, supply of funds, personnel allocation and some other aspects. Among the state's 210 key capital construction or technological remolding projects for the period between 1993 and 2000, which must introduce technologies and equipment from overseas, 52 are distributed throughout the Ministries of Railways, Communications, Posts and Telecommunications and CAAC, nearly one fourth of the total. Last year construction on a large number of key projects in these fields was started, including more than a dozen long-distance optical telecommunications cables, 10 railway construction projects, and expansion or building of a large number of airports, high-grade highways and deep-water berths. The majority of these construction projects have entered the phase requiring the most extensive funding. Sources from the Ministry of Railways said that this year tracks will be laid on 2,100 km of new lines and more than 1,300 km of multiple-track lines, and over 190 km of railway lines will be electrified. Some 19.6 billion yuan will be put into seven key construction projects. One of them, the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, will be 80-90 percent complete by year's end. Last year the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications laid eight long-distance optical cables, and this year construction on four cables will be continued, and two will be remolded and nine newly constructed. This year's plan also includes nine million new telephone subscribers, an increase of 300,000 long-distance lines, 900,000 long-distance lines in program-controlled exchanges, and 12 million urban exchange lines. In addition, mobile telecommunications will also develop significantly. By the end of 1993 China had opened 1.07 million km of highways, of which 1,145 km are expressways. This year the Ministry of Communications plans to construct 18,000 km of highways, including 960 km of high-grade routes especially for automobiles. To meet the speedily increasing demand for passenger and cargo transport, CAAC will continue to expand or construct airports and other related facilities, while adopting measures to reinforce air safety. Last year CAAC received 71 new passenger planes of all kinds, and at the same time signed contracts on buying or leasing 104 planes, some to be delivered this year. To raise enough money for these projects, the communications departments have all announced that more foreign funds will be used. Materials show that since the mid-1980s, 23 Chinese provinces, cities and autonomous regions have used some 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in loans from international monetary organizations or foreign governments to construct 7,000 km of highways. The Ministry of Railways has used 3.68 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds, and it is predicted that this year over one billion U.S. dollars will be introduced. CAAC and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will also inject foreign funds into construction projects.
