The fire chief, Jose Pulido Calvillo, made this announcement. He reported that, as of this morning, the drugs still remained in that warehouse, because the strong butane gas odor prevented their transfer to the force's storage facility, even though the blaze was under control. The warehouse guard, identified as Jose Luis Sanchez, was seriously injured, sustaining burns when the fire began between midnight and 0100 today, at that warehouse located at No. 1168 East Second Street in the aforementioned settlement. Pulido Calvillo said that, when residents of the section reported the blaze, the firefighting personnel responded immediately to extinguish it. The tank truck in question, containing butane gas residue, exploded, causing the fire. He explained that another truck and a pickup were located nearby and, when both vehicles were searched, the packed marijuana was discovered. He added that the pickup truck is presumed to have been loaded with the drug for local distribution, with the rest intended for shipment to the United States. He said that the Federal and State Judicial Police were notified, as well as the agent at the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, Francisco Vargas Pelayo, who undertook the investigation of the case. The first-named agency and the social representative did not reveal the firm names on the tank trucks and the other vehicle, nor the names of the truck and warehouse owners, so as to avoid interfering with the investigation.
