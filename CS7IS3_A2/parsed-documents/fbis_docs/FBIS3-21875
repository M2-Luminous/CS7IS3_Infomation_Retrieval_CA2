The chief perpetrators of the gang were sentenced two weeks ago, and now the dealers lower down on the scale have been sentenced. The most severe sentence on Tuesday was handed down to Kim Christian Sjoblom, a 41-year-old Helsinki jeweler. He was sentenced to five years in prison for possession of over one-half kilo of heroin. Sjoblom had used some of the substance himself and had sold some. A certain amount of the substance was also confiscated from him. The others receiving sentences on Tuesday were primarily heroin users. Their sentences varied from four months in prison to over one year. According to the court, in 1992-93 Sjoblom trafficked narcotics that he obtained from an Espoo couple. This couple was considered to be the primary mover in the case, and they were sentenced two weeks ago. The man received nine years and his wife seven years in prison. According to the court, this gang trafficked a total of 1.7 kilos of heroin. Some of their drugs have been particularly strong and of good quality. According to Ritva Santavuori, the city prosecuting attorney, two persons have died because of overdoses from it.
