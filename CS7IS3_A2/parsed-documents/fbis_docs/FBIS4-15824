Thursday's cabinet session had discussed the draft laws submitted by the Centre faction and the Coalition Party-Rural Union factions. The factions recommended that the activities of the board of the state-owned company "Rahva Haal" be suspended and the agreement with the company "Hommikuleht" on the publication of the RAHVA HAAL be terminated. Saarna commented that the government does not support nor wish the approval of these draft laws in their present form. The forming of the ad hoc parliamentary commission will only be possible after a ruling coalition faction or Riigikogu [parliament] member should propose it, he explained.
