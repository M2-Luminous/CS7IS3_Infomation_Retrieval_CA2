FR940524-1-00020 FR940524-1-00007 Benefits After consideration of all the comments received, the Board believes that amendments to CAS 404, Capitalization of Tangible Assets, and CAS 409, Depreciation of Tangible Capital Assets, as set forth in this ANPRM will significantly improve and clarify the implementation of CAS and related procurement regulations in accounting for tangible capital assets after a merger or business combination. In particular, the Board believes that a clean-cut resolution of this issue, as proposed in the ANPRM, will clarify the ambiguities that currently exist in this area and thus should lead at least to some reduction in the present confrontational negotiations and litigation in this area. This point is of particular significance in the current economic and budgetary environment where further reductions in the defense budget can be expected to lead to further mergers and business combinations among defense contractors. The Board believes that potential benefits to the audit, negotiations, and general contract administration processes occurring from the added clarity and uniformity in the measurement of the cost of depreciation and cost of money subsequent to a business combination will be substantial and will greatly outweigh any added costs. Summary of Proposed Amendments A brief description of the proposed amendments follows: a. The current subsection 9904.404&hyph;50(d) is deleted and is replaced by an amended section that prescribes: (1) that for Federal Government contract costing purposes tangible capital assets after a business combination shall retain their net book value recognized prior to the business combination provided that the assets had previously generated costs that were chargeable to Federal Government contracts subject to CAS. (2) That the cost of tangible capital assets shall be restated after the business combination at a figure not to exceed the fair value at the date of the acquisition pursuant to a business combination where the assets prior to the business combination did not generate costs that were chargeable to Federal Government contracts subject to CAS. b. A new subparagraph 9904.409&hyph;50(j)(5), is added to current subsection 9904.409&hyph;50(j). The purpose of this new subparagraph is to make it clear that the CAS 409 provisions dealing with the recapture of gains and losses on disposition of tangible capital assets should not apply when assets are transferred subsequent to a business combination. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96&hyph;511, does not apply to this proposal, and any associated rulemaking, because this proposal would impose no paperwork burden on offerors, affected contractors and subcontractors, or members of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. D. Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act The economic impact of this proposal on contractors and subcontractors is expected to be minor. As a result, the Chairman has determined that this ANPRM will not result in the promulgation of a ``major rule'' under the provisions of Executive Order 12866, and that a regulatory impact analysis will not be required. Furthermore, this proposal will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities because small businesses are exempt from the application of the Cost Accounting Standards. Therefore, this proposed rule does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. E. Public Comments This ANPRM was developed taking into account the comments received to the issue raised in the Staff Discussion Paper made available for public comment on November 4, 1993. The comments have provided valuable input to the Board's rulemaking process. The comments received and the action taken by the Board are summarized in the paragraphs that follow: Comment: In response to a question on the relationship between CAS and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) most commenters agreed that the Board should utilize GAAP to the greatest practical extent, but nevertheless, the Board clearly has the authority to depart from GAAP when deemed necessary to meet the Board's objectives. Response: The Board is in agreement with the comment. Comment: In response to a question as to the level of aggregation of individual asset values that might be used as a basis for establishing ``fair values'' for tangible capital assets, a number of comments pointed out that the current definitions of ``asset accountability unit'' in 9904.404&hyph;30(a)(1) would be an adequate basis for determining the detail required. They also pointed out that asset groupings are already adequately covered in 9904.409&hyph;50(d) and in the relevant illustrations 9904.409&hyph;60(a) (2) and (3). Response: The Board is in agreement with this comment.
