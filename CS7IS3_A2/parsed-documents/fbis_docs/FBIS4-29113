FBIS4-29113 "dreas115__a94015" FBIS-EAS-94-115-A Daily Report 15 June 1994 ANNEX Japan Japan: Take 2 of 3--Article on Relations Between Ozawa, Japan: Take 2 of 3--Article on Relations Between Ozawa, Yamagishi OW1406134294 OW1406134294 BFN [Text] According to Yamagishi, when former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced his resignation on the night of 8 April, Uchida and Washio one after the next asked Yamagishi over the phone to have a meeting with Ozawa. Four days later, on 12 April, Ito met with Yamagishi in person and urged him to meet with Ozawa. Uchida says: "I often told Yamagishi that 'it is about time to meet with Ozawa.' Yamagishi must have had a feeling that 'it is that guy who canceled the meeting, though he is a mere stripling.'" About that time, the Ozawa side seemed to have a motive to arrange a meeting between the two men in order to prevent the move toward "a union between the LDP and the SDPJ, because it was thought that that union could be effected only through the mediation of Yamagishi, if it was to be effected at all. The circles close to Ozawa asked for Ito's cooperation by whispering: "We have positive evidence that Yamagishi is working for a union between the LDP and the SDPJ." Ito explains the situation: "Ozawa asked me to arrange a meeting with Yamagishi because he had something to explain. Ozawa wanted to know if he could obtain a promise that the tax problem could be solved within the year in policy discussion with the SDPJ." At the meeting of Yamagishi and Ito on 12 April, it was decided after all that "now is not the time for a meeting between Ozawa and Yamagishi." Three days later, on 15 April, Ito met with Yamagishi again, and after saying that "he will meet with Ozawa tomorrow," he had a meeting with Ozawa at All Nippon Airline's hotel in Tokyo on the following day, 16 April. The exact contents of the meeting are not known, but it seems that a discussion was held concerning the evaluation of the LDP's Michio Watanabe, the former deputy prime minister and foreign minister. Incidentally, Washio, another mediator, is said to be the leader of the next generation in Rengo as well as a strong rival of Yamagishi. Moreover, Washio has close ties to Ozawa and is a positive advocate of political alignment. Yamagishi is a born member of the SDPJ and has a deep feeling toward the SDPJ, while Washio's generation, which is twelve years younger than Yamagishi's, is gradually losing nostalgia for the SDPJ. The Japanese Federation of Iron and Steel Workers' Unions, of which Washio is chairman, conducted in the last year's general election "selective recommendation" in order to exclude SDPJ left- wing members from recommendation, and recommended, instead, five candidates from Shinseito. When Ozawa asked for additional assistance, Washio gave him a forward-looking answer: "I will ask some of our locals to give their cooperation to Shinseito's candidates." It is no wonder that Washio's and Ito's action as intermediaries for arranging a meeting between Yamagishi and Ozawa seemed to Yamagishi as Ozawa's intervention in Rengo. That is what Yamagishi means by "divide and rule." Yamagishi explains the reason for his refusal to meet with Ozawa: "I am conducting legitimate self-defense against a surprise attack aimed at inducing the breakup of the SDPJ and at luring some of the right-wing members of the party. Moreover, if the cheerleader of the SDPJ meets with Ozawa, that will incur distrust." However, he is very shrewd because he conveyed an unofficial message to the Ozawa side at the same time: "I am not saying that I will not meet with Ozawa." Yamagishi has not discarded "the Ozawa card," and Diet upper house member Sadao Hirano, a close aid to Ozawa, holds the view that the relationship between the two men is not thoroughly estranged. Hirano says: "The two men are fully aware of each other's political power. However, to think of the labor union is one thing, to think of Japan is another. When Ozawa had to make a decision under the restriction of time, that may have appeared too hasty to Yamagishi."
