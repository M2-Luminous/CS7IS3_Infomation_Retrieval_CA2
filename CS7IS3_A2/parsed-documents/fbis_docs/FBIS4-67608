[passage omitted] None of the information recently spread in the Czech media that the smallpox virus had been stored in the Czech Republic had been shown to be correct, Baudys said. However, he admitted that a small quantity of the variola minor virus had been stored. Variola minor causes an illness which is very close to smallpox (variola maior), but which can have an easier course. Baudys said that the spreading of such information, which was not based on the truth and yet concerned the credibility of the state or created the impression of high insecurity was not proper.
