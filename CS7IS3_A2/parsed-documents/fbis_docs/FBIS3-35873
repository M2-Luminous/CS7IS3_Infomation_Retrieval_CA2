Technically, Stanislav Shushkevich remained the head of the republic's highest legislative body until the outcome of the 26 January vote was made public. But in fact, he has long lost support of the legislative majority and the opposition as well. In spite of the high speed with which everything happened, the recent events did not come as a surprise at all. The speaker was accused of failing to take anticorruption measures, exercising inadequate control over law enforcement agencies, and personal misconduct. However, genuine reasons that led up to the removal of Stanislav Shushkevich from his post lie much deeper. The deputies could have presented an even longer list of his faults on Wednesday [26 January]. In the first place, most were extremely displeased with the legislative speaker's downright negative attitude toward the CIS collective security treaty, with numerous uncertainties about the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, and with him vacillating on issues of the Republic's state system. On the other hand, Shushkevich became inconvenient to the legislative opposition, too, which has lately adopted a radically nationalistic stance and a distinct orientation toward the West. The clash came to a head during the examination of a new draft constitution. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Soviet found itself in a political deadlock then. At that time, many realized that a quick and decisive outcome was imminent. I think that there is another reason for the removal of the leader of the country's highest legislative body, who was not supported by the majority. The deputies had to find and show society the main culprit of the delayed constitutional process that could somehow justify their poor work. Otherwise, the situation would have called for early elections -- a prospect that most of the legislators do not particularly welcome. Not only does Shushkevich's removal not settle any troubles of the Supreme Soviet, it may produce a whole range of new, and even nastier, ones for the parliament. Although the "buffer" policy of the former parliament's leader did not hasten the work on the draft constitution, it sometimes allowed opposing factions and groupings of the Belarusian legislature to reach compromises. Will such compromises be possible when the Supreme Soviet splits into two unreconcilable camps, especially on key issues requiring the constitutional majority?
