Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, has said that the initiative Russia has launched to resolve the Karabakh dispute has not ended and that the talks on the matter are being maintained without publicity. In an exclusive statement to HURRIYET, Kazimirov disclosed the most recent diplomatic initiatives on Daghlyk Karabakh. Stressing that the peace plan for Karabakh, which the sides failed to sign at the last moment after putting forward several reservations two weeks ago, is still on the agenda, Kazimirov asserted: "Compared with the crisis in Bosnia, the dispute on Karabakh is an older problem and has deeper roots. We are maintaining our initiatives. However, we do not expect to find a quick solution." Contacts With Aliyev Kazimirov stressed that he confers with President Geydar Aliyev and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan by telephone every day. He noted: "Russia's peace proposals will be accepted sooner or later. No other way exists to resolve the dispute. The Armenian and the Azerbaijani officials urge Russia to support them. However, complying with their requests is impossible. Considering the occupation of a part of Azerbaijan's territory, Turkey may view the matter in a different way. However, as far as we are concerned, no side can win or lose in the war on Karabakh. Both sides have to make significant concessions for the solution of the problem. The peace plan will be successful when they become mature enough to agree to make concessions." Turkey Must Not Worry Referring to the Russia's intention to deploy its peacekeeping forces in the region, Kazimirov said that Turkey must not be worried by Moscow's approach. He asserted: "We have been proposing the deployment of peacekeeping forces for the past year. Russia is the only country that has agreed to deploy troops in that region without delay. No other CSCE country has agreed to do so. It is true that Turkey has offered to send troops. However, Armenia has objected to that proposal. We should not be blamed for that. The deployment of the Turkish military units would have facilitated our work. Considering all that, I want to suggest that Turkey must not be worried by the idea that Russia will occupy Karabakh by deploying its troops in that region. Recalling that Turkey refrained from adopting a negative approach on Russia's latest proposals for peace, Kazimirov said: "I am aware of the message President Suleyman Demirel has conveyed to President Boris Yeltsin on the Karabakh dispute. The message was received two months ago. I have recently held talks with the Turkish ambassador in Moscow. We were not informed of Ankara's official objection on the Karabakh dispute." Why Involve Military Forces? Kazimirov explained why a prominent role has been given to the generals in the peace talks, particularly to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. He said: "The first stage of the peace plan includes several military issues. The separation of the warring sides, deployment of observers, and adoption of measures against the side that violates the cease-fire are military matters. That is why Grachev should be on the scene. Naturally, the diplomats will take over when the first stage of the plan is realized." The Aliyev-Ter-Petrosyan Summit Kazimirov said that an effort is being made for a meeting between President Aliyev and President Ter-Petrosyan to sign the agreement which has been drawn up by the defense ministers of the three sides. He asserted: "Predicting the exact date of that summit is impossible. However, we believe that the silence on the matter will be broken and the Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders will hold a summit soon."
