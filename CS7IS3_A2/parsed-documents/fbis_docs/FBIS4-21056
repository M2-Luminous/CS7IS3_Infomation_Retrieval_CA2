The operation was planned over a period of four months following an initial raid on 31 August 1993, when 40 Federal Police agents were met with heavy weapons fire on that same hill, where "Jogador" controls the distribution of drugs to seven neighboring hills. The hill was being protected by 160 men armed with AR-15 rifles, Uzi submachineguns, and automatic pistols. "The counterattack by the traffickers, who were descending in columns, was a tactic used in military combat," says a police officer who took part in the first operation. Preparation--That reception impressed the police and the Army. Federal agents spent the next four months studying photographs and maps of the area. The new raid was to be launched on 10 December. It called for 70 agents to take possession of strategic points on Alemao Hill at around 1900 so that eight Army helicopters could then attack the summit the following morning. Brizola explained his cancellation of the invasion by saying in Washington--where he has gone in connection with the release of a World Bank loan that will be used to clean up pollution in Guanabara Bay--that he felt that the operation was disorganized and that it lacked coordination with the State Police. According to his special adviser, Fernando Britto, the governor does not rule out cooperation between the Army and Federal Police in the fight against drugs and weapons. "But from the way the operation was being carried out, its character was much more a matter of bullying than anything else," Britto added. Alarm--According to federal agents, the absence of coordination with the State Police was intentional. The purpose was to prevent the traffickers from being warned. After the first raid, in August, the Federal Police prepared a detailed report on the way they had been received by the traffickers, with an emphasis on what was considered military tactical organization. In Washington, the governor said that "if raids on the hills actually solved anything, there would be no more traffickers or outlaws or anything else in Rio de Janeiro, because the dictatorship wore itself out conducting operations of that kind, even with the use of helicopters, and it didn't help at all." Leonel Brizola reiterated that bringing the matter "to the surface" now was an "act of political exploitation."
