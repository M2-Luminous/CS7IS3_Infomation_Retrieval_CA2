In our first question, we asked Shahaq to comment on Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' assertion in Bucharest that when he and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat perused the understandings reached in Cairo, they also discovered many points of disagreement. [Shahaq] I assume that at least our foreign minister discovered nothing new in Bucharest, seeing as we had met before his departure and Mr. Peres was briefed in advance on all the points discussed in the negotiations and what we had agreed or disagreed upon. I can tell you what is happening in Cairo, however, and I will also take a moment to comment on the committees. These committees were not established to sit in Cairo; they have nothing to do in Cairo. These three committees were not established on a temporary basis. They are all permanent committees which must operate from Gaza and have nothing to do with the entrance of any party to the area but rather must deal with working procedures inside Gaza, as well as coordination and cooperation between those who will enter Gaza and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops that will remain there. [Friedman] I take this to mean that the committees will be responsible for translating the understandings in principle reached in the negotiations into practical developments in the field? [Shahaq] Not only that. The committees will also be responsible for preventing friction and facilitating the best level of coexistence possible in the field on the basis of the agreements reached in Cairo. [Even] Are they supposed to operate until the final signing of the agreement or until the Palestinian authorities enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho? [Shahaq] These committees are part of the understandings reached in Cairo. The establishment of these committees was agreed upon in Cairo, and their job mainly begins from the moment the Palestinians assume authority. Clearly, the committees will be incapable of operating effectively from the first day if they are not situated in the area prior to the transfer of authority in order to familiarize themselves with the area, with us, and with the joint understandings that were reached. We will have to work together for a few days before the Palestinian authority can assume its responsibilities so that the joint committees, which also feature Israeli representatives, will have the opportunity to learn how to work together and cope with problems in the field. [Friedman] Major General Shahaq, can you give us any new target date this morning for the signing of the agreement between Israel and the PLO? Perhaps 5 May, as surmised by an Israeli television correspondent last night? [Shahaq] I never had any target dates. According to the Oslo agreement, there were certain target dates that we intended to meet but failed. Today, I would rather not mention any dates, because I simply do not know. If we had a date, I would not keep it a secret. There is still work to do. I think that the issues we still have to overcome are neither irresolvable nor numerous. Therefore, barring the emergence of new obstacles or the reopening of issues that we consider closed, and if everything continues the way things went this week -- and I see no reason for this not to be the case -- the negotiations can be concluded in not too long a period. [Even] While you were negotiating with the Palestinians in Cairo, the families of the Israeli POW's and MIA's demonstrated and waged a hunger strike. They are demanding a linkage between information on the fate of their children and their release and the release of Palestinian security prisoners held by Israel. Do you accept such a linkage between the two issues? [Shahaq] I agree that everything must be done on every possible level to resolve the very painful issue of the POW's and MIA's. [Friedman] Does Yasir 'Arafat have information on the POW's and MIA's that he is not giving us for some reason? [Shahaq] I cannot say if he has any information. I can safely assume that Palestinian elements have easier access to such information, and I believe they must do everything in their power to not only get this information but also relay it to us. They must do everything they can to resolve this crucial problem. I consider it their obligation under the current circumstances. [Friedman] Maj. Gen. Shahaq, Israel continues to reject the Palestinian demand to release Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] prisoners as part of the mass prisoner releases expected within the framework of the agreement. At the same time, Israel conducted mass arrests of hundreds of Hamas activists this week, mainly in the Gaza Strip. What is the point of these arrests if Israel is pulling out of the area completely in several weeks? [Shahaq] One can also ask why Hamas is continuing terrorist attacks. Israel will continue to fight Hamas as long as it perpetrates terrorism. I believe that a soldier's body was discovered only yesterday, after being murdered, to the best of my knowledge, by Hamas operatives. Israel is at war with Hamas, and this war will continue for as long as necessary. [Even] Did your interlocutors in Cairo read the assessments prepared by the director of the Shin Bet according to which the Palestinians will start massacring each other as soon as the IDF pulls out of Gaza? [Shahaq] I did not hear these assessments. I read about them in the newspapers, and I am not sure they are correct. [Friedman] One more question about Israel's agreement with the PLO: What is the gap between the signing of the agreement in Cairo and the completion of the IDF's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? [Shahaq] The interim period between the signing of the agreement and the transfer of authority to the Palestinians will take three weeks. [Friedman] Thank you very much, Maj. Gen. Shahaq.
