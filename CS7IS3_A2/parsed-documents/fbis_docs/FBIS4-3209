For supply is outstripping demand on the country's foreign exchange swap market, said Zhu Xiaohua, vice-governor of the central People's Bank of China as he opened the centre from which the new system operates in Shanghai. The country set up the national inter-bank exchange system early this month. But the swap market has been retained for now, so foreign-funded ventures can buy and sell hard currencies. Zhu said the new system, a major part of China's foreign exchange reform, was intended to bring the yuan considerably closer to being a freely convertible currency. And it had got off to a smooth start. However, he said, officials will work harder to improve the market's management and maintain a stable exchange rate. Nearly 200 domestic and overseas financial institutions have become members of the system and the number keeps increasing, said reliable sources at CFETS. The new centre is located on the Bund in Shanghai, the city's financial heart, and it provides services for inter-bank trading and the settlement of hard currencies. The ultimate aim is for the new system to replace the country's five-year-old swap market, said Zhu. And all domestic enterprises have been asked to do all their foreign exchange deals through authorized banks. Zhu firmly dispelled concerns over the supply of foreign exchange for overseas-funded ventures, adding that the foreign exchange surplus will go into a special account at the central bank, which has grown to $40 million since the start of the month. "The money will be put into the swap market if needed to keep the balance (between supply and demand)," he said. Zhu said the surplus came mainly from the increased flow of capital particularly to the coast. He said foreign banks might be allowed to sell foreign exchange after the market is properly bedded in. However, their business range will depend on the country's regulations on foreign financial institutions, he added.
