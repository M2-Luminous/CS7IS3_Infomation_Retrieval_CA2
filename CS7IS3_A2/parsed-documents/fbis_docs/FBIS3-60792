[see previous Terrorism Report for incident reports] "We were mistaken for DEA agents," said one of the two Ecuadoran soldiers who were captured after the ambush by the "32d column of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)" and were released hours later, "when they realized it was a mistake." The kidnappers, approximately 30 guerrillas between the ages of 14 and 20, reportedly said they were mistaken because "this area is where the DEA mostly operates," in reference to the Amazon jungle stretch of the Ecuadoran-Colombian border. At the Putumayo River, seven Ecuadoran military launches were ambushed by approximately 200 FARC guerrillas who fled into the dense jungle where they are being pursued on both sides of the border. Press reports on the alleged capture of at least three Colombian guerrillas has not yet been confirmed by the Ecuadoran Army, although Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo said on 22 December that "we are following the tracks" of members of the FARC's "32d Column." The account of soldier Segundo Chamba reportedly confirmed reports that FARC guerrillas and drug-trafficking rings linked to the two largest Colombian cartels are operating jointly in southern Colombia. The guerrillas who captured the two Ecuadoran soldiers did not explain the reasons why they tried to aim their attack against the DEA, whose agents are reportedly solely involved in fighting drug trafficking and are not participating in antisubversive operations. The day after the attack, Ecuador intensified security along its border to prevent new guerrilla incursions while the Army elite forces started to pursue the attackers.
