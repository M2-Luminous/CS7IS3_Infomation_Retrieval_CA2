In 1993, 1.3 billion schillings were spent; this year 1 billion is planned. It is expected that about 15 percent of subsidies, which correspond to European Union regulations, will be paid. So far, BMW has invested 13.5 billion schillings in Austria. In 1995-96 an additional 300 jobs will be created in Steyr on top of the existing 2,000, said Werner Saemann, chairman of the board of directors of BMW Austria. Last year the turnover of the BMW group in Austria declined by 15 percent from 18.2 to 15.5 billion schillings. Still, Saemann said that the result is "very satisfying," but it is below the 1.6-billion-schilling gross revenues of 1992. In Steyr, 331,200 (in 1992 -- 379,000) engines with a 17-percent proportion of diesel engines were produced. Domestic creation of value is given at about 20 percent. Turnover from exports amounted to 11.7 billion schillings (in 1992 13.8 billion). The entire purchasing volume of the BMW corporation in Austria amounted to 14.7 billion schillings in 1993 (in 1992 17 billion). Saemann does not rule out future deliveries of BMW diesel engines from Steyr to Rover. With 8,848 passenger cars and 515 motorcycles (3.3 billion schillings turnover), automotive sales declined by 25.8 percent and sales of two-wheeled vehicles declined by 6 percent. This year 10,000 cars and 850 motorcycles are to be sold in new models (manager Clary: "A normal year for BMW").
