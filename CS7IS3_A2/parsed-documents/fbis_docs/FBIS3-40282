Will secrecy continue to be the manner of the work of the Ministry for Foreign Relations? [Crvenkovski] Secrecy is characteristic of all foreign ministries in the world; therefore, that principle will also be there in the future to a certain extent. What is evident, if you have followed the events over the years, is that for a while there have been practically no secrets. There was also a period when we really cut off almost all information. If we compare the results of the two periods, I think we easily realise which of the two was better for the role and place of Macedonia in the international community. [Skerlev] Is it not somewhat naive to believe that the public, or whatever is published in our mass media, was the Greek Government's real source of information on the actions we were going to take? Your predecessor once said that was the reason why they were always "one step ahead of us," as justification for secrecy in the work. They probably have their own sources, and our public has the right to be informed. [Crvenkovski] Anyway, it is far from true that any diplomacy uses the newspapers as its source of information; there are certainly many other sources of information available. Every country, including our own, has many friends in international communications who assist in getting information. [Skerlev] If secrecy is characteristic of periods when something is in preparation, what preparations are underway for the Greek-Macedonian negotiations, since there is no other information except the public's general worries? [Crvenkovski] First of all, I would like to say that, regarding secrecy, an image has been created that we have less information than Greece. If you take a closer look, there are many pieces of false information! And they are accepted by our public, despite our frequent warnings they are false and untrue. It is necessary to follow up cautiously not only the quantity, but also the quality, of information, in order to see the attitude of the public to a certain ministry. As far as the negotiations with Greece are concerned, there are no secrets at all. We have clearly expressed our interest in resuming the negotiations in New York, and in December we had a meeting with Mr. Cyrus Vance, who was directly informed about our interest. Before that, we stated the same thing to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- all this was published, as were the contents of the letter, and there were no secrets there. There is nothing else. Not only are there no secrets, but there is nothing more than that. [Skerlev] According to the Greek press and the statements of their current politicians on different compromises and concessions, it seems that there is "something"? Has Macedonia received signals about a possible change in the Greek attitude toward our country? [Crvenkovski] I could not say whether and how much their attitude has changed, because it cannot be known before we sit down and listen to what they have to say. What is probably a fact, for a cautious observer of the events, is that both sides are maturing in the knowledge that good relations between the two countries are indispensable for both countries. How will that knowledge be reflected in some concrete actions in future is something we will have to wait and see. At this moment, since a continuation in the process of negotiation is missing, it is difficult to assess the real positions and the possible changes. On the other hand, we have not yet received any official information on the resumption of negotiations from the mediator. [Skerlev] Do we expect the relations with Greece to be solved first on the political plane and only then starting with the development of the economic, cultural, scientific, and other relations, or, are they going to be insisted upon as the basis for solving the political disputes? [Crvenkovski] I think that all spheres of cooperation with Greece are open and they have to be utilized. What we have clearly stated everywhere is that our policy is to be open with all, particularly with our neighbors. There should be no obstacles to cooperation. [Skerlev] Are there any initiatives on such a cooperation from the Greek side? [Crvenkovski] I do not know about initiatives on levels other than those that we are engaged in and that are within our competence. However, I can see there are a lot of contacts of businessmen, intellectuals, journalists. All forms of contact and cooperation can contribute to overcoming the problems. [Skerlev] Lately, a great number of U.S. politicians and high army officers visited Macedonia. Is the promotion of the level of diplomatic relations between the two countries in sight? [Crvenkovski] We have daily visits, not only by U.S. personalities, but from practically all over the world, which is a sign that interest in Macedonia is growing. Not only the interest of the United States, but of almost all important countries. Regarding relations with the United States, there exists a very clear continuity. Since the beginning of the process of our independence, we have received express support for the territorial integrity of Macedonia and for the stability of the country. I would also say that bilateral relations are developing according to a logical schedule. The level of contacts improve daily, the opening of the office in Skopje was a logical step, as well as the December meeting at the level of foreign ministers. That office will most probably be enlarged with new diplomats. It is sure that relations will be improved following that logical development. However, anticipating the dynamics of the development of relations can be an ungrateful job. [Skerlev] What is, in your opinion, the reason for this intensified interest in Macedonia, particularly in the context of the different theories on spheres of interest? [Crvenkovski] There appear to be various speculations in the public on different spheres of interest, different alliances of countries interested in having influence of one type or another on this territory. I must say that these speculations are mainly dominated by concepts of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. The strategic interest in Macedonia at this moment is the fact that we have promoted a new model of relations. In the external, but mainly in the internal policy. In extremely difficult surroundings, in extremely difficult conditions, with a war raging in the neighborhood, with blockades, and with a growing ethnic conflict in the Balkans, as in the greater number of postcommunist countries, we offered a model contrary to that leading to conflicts and wars. The success of the model of stability, with the help of all groups and structures in society, through the opening of economic and democratic areas, is of strategic interest and it is of great interest to the United States and Europe, as well as to the whole democratic world. In that sense, Macedonia has got an extraordinary strategic interest of the type that dominates at the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century. [Skerlev] Do you think that foreign policy is sufficiently engaged in the economy, first of all in making up for the damages caused by the sanctions, and how great an accent is placed on economic relations in the ministry? [Crvenkovski] The sanctions have been our main subject in all our international activities. Practically, there has not been a meeting in which the sanctions were not the first point on the agenda. However, in all the statements we have made, we were explicit in saying that overall compensation up for the sanctions is an illusion deriving from great hopes. What we succeeded in was to open a process in the United Nations with the Security Council Resolution with which the countries members were called to help Macedonia. We succeeded in arousing the interest of the international financial organizations in undertaking concrete actions. We have made an agreement with the IMF and we have signed an arrangement that has, so far, been the most favorable arrangement signed by the IMF with any country. The IMF has signed up such an arrangement only with Russia and Macedonia! It opens doors for negotiations with the Paris Club regarding the regulation of Macedonia's debts, thus opening a normal process of banking communication on a commercial level. What is worth mentioning about the economic situation in Macedonia is that we frequently talk about the sanctions, but even without them, we would have been faced with a very difficult situation. Normally, it was due to the break-up of the old Yugoslav market, but primarily due to the break-up of the whole Eastern European market. The establishment of relations will be carried out slowly, not because of us, but because of the situation in the Eastern European countries. Frankly speaking, the economic situation in Macedonia, as well as the standard, the level of currency stability, are far from the situation in all these countries. A year and a half ago, or two years ago, the main question asked by the international public relating to Macedonia was whether this country was capable of surviving economically. That was before the sanctions. When it became clear that Macedonia was surviving despite the sanctions and the blockades from the south -- that it was paying a much higher price, but surviving economically and politically, the image about Macedonia and the interest in Macedonia changed. Despite everything, we demonstrated that we were capable of surviving economically in abnormal conditions, paying a very high price. Thus the image of, and the interest in, Macedonia was suddenly changed in the international community and they could all see a new model. Although that model was promoted, and it turned out to be successful, it will spread to other countries at a slow pace. Even the strategic position of this region can be changed. Because of all that, a country with a 2 million population is playing a far, far greater role in the international policy and in the interest of the international community than it was expected to, bearing in mind its size and importance in the region. [Skerlev] What are the new developments in relation to the announced extension of the Macedonian diplomatic net throughout the world, and in that context, the main subject -- the appointment of ambassadors. [Crvenkovski] Very soon, we shall open two or three offices. In a greater number of countries we have our offices -- of course, we are now raising offices to the level of embassies. However, I can see that a false image has been created in the public on this issue, that we shall have embassies wherever we have established diplomatic relations. This will certainly not be the case, for many reasons. First of all, due to the financial conditions, because running offices is very expensive. Moreover, also because, today, a great number of countries have established a different model of diplomatic services, which we think will also be suitable for our state. It means that, in many countries, ambassadors of another friendly country in the region can hold our letter of accredition. Also, and perhaps the most frequent solution applied by Sweden for decades, slowly accepted by others, is to have accredited ambassadors located in Skopje, in the ministry. Therefore, the greatest number of countries will be thus covered. There is another thing that we are going to make the first practical action, and I consider it has to be spread very much and very fast, which is -- the appointment of honorary consuls. That is the cheapest and the most efficient way to implement services for our citizens abroad. The honorary consuls will be nominated, first of all, by the citizens of the host countries, therefore not by our citizens living abroad. [Skerlev] Nevertheless, you will agree that it is in the interests of Macedonia, is it not, to have real embassies in some countries, despite the financial restrictions.... Where will we have embassies? [Crvenkovski] The five countries that are permanent members of the UN Security Council will have to have embassies, and we have not yet established diplomatic relations with some of them. Those countries are: the United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and China. Germany and Japan also, of course, because they are countries of economic and political importance. After that, the countries with a great number of our people, like Canada and Australia, the Scandinavian countries, which will be most probably covered from one center, Switzerland because of its double role -- the bilateral relations and the relations with the United Nations, that is with the specialized UN agencies, and of course, the neighboring countries. [Skerlev] In the course of this year, the validity of the old Yugoslav passports expires, and only the Macedonian passports will be valid. However, there are many countries, for instance the Latin American, African, and some Asian countries, from which the ministry has not received information about the recognition of the Macedonian passport. [Crvenkovski] The ministry has received information from all those countries that have regulated the status of the Macedonian passport. It is true that some of the countries from Latin America and Africa have not yet regulated that status. We are now in contact with a greater number of those countries and we believe that this process will be completed in the near future. At this moment, apart from a number of neighboring countries with which we know well the problem about our passports, it has been accepted by all other European countries. The Macedonian passport has been recognized by the United States, Canada, and by almost all Asian countries. Nevertheless, a number of countries that we are now establishing contact with have not sent official information, but the practice has shown that, just after the establishment of contacts, there are no more problems, and this issue is easily regulated. We are expecting the imminent recognition of our passport, which is perhaps above the average compared to the other countries that started regulating their status at the same time. [Skerlev] How did a movie director [Crvenkovski's previous profession] succeed, in your opinion, in dealing with the policy of foreign affairs? And where do your ambitions lead -- policy, diplomacy, or directing? [Crvenkovski] Many people with different previous professions can cope with policy. A great number of foreign ministers used to be chemists in their previous lives. And there are rare ministers who were previously engaged in professional diplomacy. I would not like to talk about the way I manage it. The directing and my present profession have, I would say, a certain link -- communication with people and the assessment of the effects on the people of communication. I will, by no means, give up directing. I have come to this present function without any previous plans, and now, at this moment, the situation is such that I do not have enough time to plan my future. However, if I shoot a film one day, it will certainly not be a political film. That has been my determination since the days of my study, and the longer I deal with policy, the more I believe that my determination was right. [Box, p 6] Macedonia on the World Map [Skerlev] The critics of Macedonian foreign policy, among other things, often use as an important argument the fact that a great number of countries have recognized us by the name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the way in which we were admitted to the United Nations, and they say the happiness and satisfaction over the admission and recognition have been decreased because of that. [Crvenkovski] I do not know how much the satisfaction has been decreased, because satisfaction and emotions were not at stake, but it was necessary to put the Republic of Macedonia on the world map and to enable its function as a state! Survival was at stake. There are a number of organizations within the United Nations system without which a state cannot function, and those organizations regulate telecommunications, post office services, railways, air traffic, and if you are not a member of those organizations, you cannot function as a state in the world. You cannot travel, companies cannot include themselves in commercial cooperation, they cannot transport goods, banks and financial institutions cannot function, and the IMF is most important. It was practically demonstrated that membership in the United Nations was of the utmost importance. What is of interest from that period, for those assessments, as well as for relations in the foreign policy is that, from a period when foreign policy was attacked from all sides and with all possible means, and when the attacks against it were a daily subject in Macedonia, we have now moved to a situation in which the attacks are concentrated on one or two issues, and are of no great intensity. Therefore, if you take a look at what has been going on in Parliament over the past year, you will see that there have been no real criticism of the foreign policy.
