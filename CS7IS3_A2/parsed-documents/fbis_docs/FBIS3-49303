[Klaus] When the news first appeared that President Clinton would be visiting Prague after the Brussels NATO summit ends, no one doubted--and the opposite did not even cross anyone's mind--that he would use the visit to Prague to meet with the representatives of the governments of all four countries of Central and Eastern Europe--that is, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and the Slovak Republic. It was never even considered that we would be the only ones to talk with him. On the other hand, collective talks have not been considered, either. His stopover is simply used for a parallel meeting with four delegations. [Krejci] What will be, for the Czech side, the main topic of this meeting? [Klaus] The meeting with President Clinton is certainly the most important point for us because it is a very important signal for the entire world that President Clinton has chosen Prague in particular for this meeting between the NATO summit and his visit to Moscow. The official talks will be relatively brief and the matter of external security will be of greater importance because the visit will follow the NATO session. [passage omitted]
