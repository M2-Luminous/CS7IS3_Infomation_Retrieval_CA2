FBIS4-61552 "drsov089cc_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS Further Reportage on Nagorno-Karabakh Talks in Bishkek Further Reportage on Nagorno-Karabakh Talks in Bishkek Armenia, Karabakh Agree To Cease-Fire LD0605164794 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1315 GMT 6 May 94 LD0605164794 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh parliament speakers Babken Ararktsiyan and Karen Baburiyan said during the meeting with Kyrgyz Parliament Speaker Medetkan Sherimkulov in Bishkek Friday that they would take steps on their return home to achieve a cease-fire in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict zone. Sherimkulov, who is also the chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's peacekeeping group for Nagorno-Karabakh, told Interfax that both speakers had made the pledge in response to his own call for a unilateral cease-fire in the conflict zone beginning midnight on 9 May. The cease-fire would, he said, involve an agreement like the one which would have been achieved at the recent meeting in Bishkek on 4-5 May (on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict) had Azerbaijan not refused to sign the relevant protocol after objecting to some of the document's items. Sherimkulov announced that he would also meet with Azerbaijani representatives and repeat his request for a cease-fire from on 6 May. He said the next round of talks on Nagorno-Karabakh would take place in St. Petersburg at the beginning of June. The Armenian speaker, who had been impressed by the Bishkek meeting, assured Interfax in an interview that the Armenian party would be "putting the protocol signed in Bishkek into effect" unilaterally. He stressed that the "Azerbaijanis have once again displayed their unwillingness to solve the Karabakh issue by political means." However, Ararktsiyan said he was hopeful that Baku would appreciate that the conflict could not be resolved by force.
