As Interfax learned in the press service of the CIS Executive Secretariat, at the initiative of the Belarussian side a meeting of CIS experts is scheduled for next week to discuss this issue. In the meantime, a high-ranking official of the Belarussian Foreign Ministry, who requested anonymity, told Interfax "this idea most probably will be once again killed, because the states who are currently owners of non-military ships of the former USSR are unlikely to allow this issue to be put on the agenda of a CIS summit." The source believes that a significant number of former Soviet non-military ships have already been privatized or mothballed for a long term. In his opinion, "the time to achieve the fleet's division may have been irreversibly missed."
