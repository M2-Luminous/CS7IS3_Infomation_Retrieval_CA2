In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter, Association of European Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA) Secretary General Lenier [name as published] indicated that ACEA will ask the European Commission and other organizations concerned to take restrictive measures, saying: "The share of Japanese cars in the European market should be frozen." Similar opinions have also been voiced in the European Parliament. The 1991 Japan-EU agreement does not impose restrictions upon Japanese cars produced in Europe. However, this issue is likely to remain a controversial problem in the future, because the European auto industry has been faced with business difficulties due to the prolonged economic slump. The new ACEA chairman and secretary general took office this year. In his explanation of ACEA policies under the new leaders, Lenier touched on the Japanese car issue, and said: "The total volume of Japanese cars, including not only cars which are directly imported from Japan, but also those produced in Europe and imported from third countries (such as the United States) should be frozen." The ACEA has also presented this demand to the European Commission. In accordance with the Japan-EU auto agreement, Japan has restricted its exports at a rate higher than the overall drop in European car sales. For example, in 1993 Japan set the quota of direct exports at 980,000 units, which was 18.5 percent lower than that of the previous year.
