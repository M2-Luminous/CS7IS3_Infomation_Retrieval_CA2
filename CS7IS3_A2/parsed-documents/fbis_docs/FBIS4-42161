Two reactor blocs of the power plant are currently still in operation, while the third one was closed down following a fire. The experts are primarily developing a concept for gradually closing down the whole reactor, setting up a second "sarcophagus" for the defective reactor, and ensuring an adequate power supply by completing reactor blocs under construction at three other sites in Ukraine.
