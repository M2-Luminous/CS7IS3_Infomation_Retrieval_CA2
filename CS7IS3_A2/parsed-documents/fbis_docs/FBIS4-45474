Expertly, they searched the desk of a bank employee who was on sick leave, removed a few papers, and disappeared again. At the same time, investigators rummaged through the contents of the desk of an employee of the Bayerische Hypo Bank, also in Munich, and checked bank account entries. A total of 170 policemen and 18 prosecutors were involved in this operation. They investigated 41 premises in Munich, Hamburg, Dusseldorf, and Nuremberg, including 19 banks in Munich alone. The reason for the raids: Bank employees are suspected of having helped drug dealers launder money stemming from drug deals. Says Guenter Gold, Bavaria LVA deputy chief: "The drug ring has existed for at least 10 years, in which time almost one billion German marks [DM] of heroin money has gone through the banks." This is how the drug ring worked: Wholesale drug dealers from all over Europe paid for their heroin purchases in two small currency exchange booths at the Munich central railroad station and in the city center. "Couriers carried up to DM1.2 million in plastic bags and suitcases to the exchange booths," says Dieter Zitzler-Ant, head of the "Mozart" investigation group set up on 1 June 1993. The owner of the exchange booths, Aydin G., a Turkish citizen, then carried the drug money, some DM50 million last year, to the bank. Thus, the money-laundering began. Customer advisers in well-known banks then helped the Turk. They turned a blind eye to the legal requirement of reporting any financial transaction that exceeds DM20,000. In addition, they are supposed to have accepted forged receipts. Aydin G. used the money to pay drug couriers in Turkey, as well as the bills for legal transactions. As a token of gratitude, the cooperating bank employees supposedly spent a few evenings in the beer gardens of Munich at the dealer's expense. They received several other little perks. "There are black sheep everywhere," says Wilhelm Woebking, executive chief prosecutor, and spokesman for the Munich Supreme Land Court. "One must consider whether there is any way of surveilling bank employees via telephone. We have been calling for such a measure for a long time, within the framework of the law concerning money laundering." The heroin, which in the opinion of the LKA officers amounted to 2.5 tonnes in 1993 alone, never went via Munich. Concealed in articulated trucks, it traveled from Istanbul via Romania, Hungary, or the Czech Republic to the destination countries--Spain, Italy, or Germany. The suppliers received their money from Munich exchange booths that are suppose to belong to the chief of the drug ring, Muestecabi Dilek, 61. Says Gold: "In order to minimize the dangers involved in the transfer of money, there was no direct flow of money between the exchange booths in Munich and Istanbul." Even so, the "Mozart" investigators discovered the drug dealers. They observed the activities of the heroin-mafias for one year. Then the criminal police pounced on the international drug ring, arrested 14 persons, confiscated 400 kg of heroin, seized about DM2 billion in cash, and sealed the two Munich exchange booths. Investigations are under way concerning at least 19 bank employees. The banks are powerless against criminal bank employees. "The law on money laundering did not come into effect until November 1993. The preliminary experience is positive, says Stephan Steuer, chief lawyer for the Federal Association of German Banks. "However, erroneous conduct by individuals can never be ruled out. But an exacerbation of the law on money laundering would not be expedient." In the meantime, FOCUS has discovered that "Mozart" officers are going from bank to bank with a list of 10 members of the drug ring. They want to know where the dealers had accounts. "Some of the suspects had accounts with us, but no significant ones," said the spokesman for one large bank.
