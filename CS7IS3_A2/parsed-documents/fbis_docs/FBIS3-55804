At the post-session news conference President Lennart Meri's speech was also under discussion. Mati Kirotar reports: [Kirotar] The rivalry between Kadriorg [presidential residence] and Toompea [seat of government and parliament] seems to have ended for the time being. The subject of the presidential speech in the Riigikogu [parliament] today came up again at the news conference after the government session. Premier Mart Laar said that he had not declared any kind of war on the president. [passage omitted] [Begin Laar recording] There were definitely many very accurate observations in Mr. President's speech, in particular those to do with rivalry between Andres and Pearu [reference to a literary classic]. I think that such rivalry has indeed damaged the Estonian state. I believe that our common aim is to avoid anything similar in the future. There were also some other aspects which I fully subscribe to, for example the influx of Russian capital into the Estonian economy, as Mr. President claimed. As far as Russian capital influx into Estonia is concerned, this is indeed under the government's close scrutiny. We have for example arrived at a position not to support the granting of banking licenses in Estonia to Russian banks, whether state or non-state. Or at least we would consider each individual application very thoroughly. I believe that the new economics minister will definitely... [changes thought], as Mr. Meri sees a problem in this area and pays serious attention to it the problem has arisen for Mr. Meri at the moment [as heard]. I am not fully certain that this is so and I would not like to accuse the outgoing economics minister of anything. [passage omitted] I hope that these shocks of the past few days will not lead us further afield but will educate us instead to conduct our affairs better. [passage omitted] [end recording]
