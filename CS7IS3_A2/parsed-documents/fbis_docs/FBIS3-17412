He was speaking at the end of an inter-regional forum in the central Russian city of Tambov on Wednesday. The forum was attended by representatives of a number of regional associations from central and northwestern Russia, Siberia, the Northern Caucuses, Urals and elsewhere. However, such a change will take a long time to happen, Shakhray told a meeting of students and lecturers of the Moscow Institute for International Relations Thursday. He said Russia was "destined for a long interim period during which its current structure built along ethnic lines will adapt itself to a new pattern based on a territorial principle". Shakhray is skeptical about attempts to try to break Russia into provinces either from on-high or below. A lengthy interim period is needed because of the huge variety of Russian regions, he said. Only 23 out of 89 regions is economically self-reliant, others have to be subsidized. As it is now, said Shakhray, the federal government is having to act as an agency for the redistribution of wealth which creates a highly dangerous situation. The minister reiterated support for the recent agreement between Moscow and Tatarstan describing it as a first ever test of the new method aimed at resolving a power struggle between the center and a region. Shakhray believes this will also help resolve a similar dispute between Moscow and the southern autonomy of Chechnya which appears to be ready for some kind of accommodation. Shakhray believes that a lack of coordinated effort by the center and political dialogue between North Ossetia and Ingushetia are the main stumbling blocks to regional peace. However, he does not believe in any regional settlement unless Moscow applies some pressure. Shakhray said the federal government must use economic leverage to bring the two sides to the negotiating table. He reminded the audience that North Ossetia and Ingushetia depended on federal subsidy by 60 and 97 percent respectively.
