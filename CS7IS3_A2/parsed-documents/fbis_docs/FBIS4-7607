In a statement for SRNA after the meeting, Redman pointed out that he had come to reach political and territorial arrangements, albeit without concrete offers. We are making efforts to solve territorial borders in Bosnia in a new way, because after the creation of the Muslim-Croatian federation, we want to hear what the Serb side intends to do, Redman said and added that borders are a great problem that will not be easy to solve. These are extremely great problems as the war has been waged for two years already and I do not think that the situation will improve soon, Redman said. Karadzic reiterated the readiness of the Serbian side to (?support) every proposal for solving the crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina which would not be contrary to the interests of the Serbian people. Redman and Karadzic hailed the efforts Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations made with a way to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking about the ceasing of clashes between the Croats and the Muslims, Redman said that a united Croat-Muslim army will probably be formed, as, in his opinion, this is the best solution to establishing peace between Croats and Muslims on their territories. This afternoon in the Muslim part of Sarajevo, Redman will meet Alija Izetbegovic and convey to him the stands of the leadership of the Srpska republic.
