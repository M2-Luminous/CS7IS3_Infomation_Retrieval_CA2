The statement was made on behalf of the Union of Traditionalists, the Merab Kostava Society, the Conservative-Monarchist Party, and Charter-91. We talked on this subject to Akaki Asatiani, Giorgi Kobakhidze, Lamar Chkheidze, and Redo Paatashvili. [passage omitted] [Gurbutashvili] The National-Democrats are in the majority, the opposition, or.... What is your attitude regarding "Center?" [Kobakhidze] Let me, first of all, speak about the so-called "Center." In general, I think it is premature to speak about its creation (in spite of the fact that a statement has been made). I doubt that this will be an influential faction. It is one thing to be in a coalition and another to be in a faction where responsibility is restricted within fixed limits. I believe that, on account of the positions they adopt, the factions united within it will be unable to tolerate these limits. This is the first point. Second, when speaking of positions and principles, there are many things that I find incomprehensible.... For example, it is incomprehensible why the "Traditionalists" view themselves as part of the opposition when they have assumed responsibility for the implementation of economic reform (I have in mind their submitting Basil as a candidate and his appointment as deputy prime-minister [for economic questions]). In general, such a step taken by someone in the opposition is incomprehensible.... On the other hand, another organization that is a friend of the "Traditionalists" -- the Merab Kostava Society -- has a completely different attitude from them toward the head of state who determines state policy today. Proceeding from the rules of politics in general, such a thing does not usually take place, but, as can be seen, nothing comes as a surprise in Georgia.... As you know, society is touchy today and any caustic remark or violent action has a negative effect upon it. The word "center" (the very essence of the word) has a calming and positive effect upon people and this is precisely the reason why it was created. I repeat once more that the Merab Kostava Society or the "Traditionalists" cannot be in the "Center" because the former is completely opposed to the head of state and the latter have basically manifested their support for him (proceeding from the status of their member Basil). The center generally takes shape itself, but not by appropriating the name. The political center is not well-defined today but it should be viewed as being made up of, first and foremost, the National- Democratic Party [NAP] and the Republicans and then the Liberal- Democratic National Party. The center's course is charted in this way. [Gurbutashvili] Do you consider yourselves to be in the center? [Kobakhidze] From the political point of view, the NAP is in the center; there is us and then the two organizations that I mentioned. The order in which I listed the organizations corresponds to the level of their activity and their importance. [Gurbutashvili] That means we can expect confrontation between your center and the "Center" that has already been proclaimed? [Kobakhidze] We do not intend to wage a battle over the name. We have our own firm position. We have never played this type of game -- in this way or that -- and it is our intention not to do so in the future. Our position is as follows: Early elections to be held as soon as possible. [Gurbutashvili] Are you in opposition to the head of state? [Kobakhidze] We are in opposition from the position of the center. We disassociate ourselves from the majority [in Parliament] and the [Liberal-Conservative] coalition and the [Center] faction. [Chkheidze] It is difficult and also probably incorrect to say anything in advance. It depends upon how consistent a position they adopt; proceeding from this, one can speak about the "Center." Our society joined the [Liberal-Conservative] coalition because we wanted to see all the opposition parties united. Unfortunately, this has not happened; only some of them have united. We did not view it as right that there should be even greater integration with a part of them. We do not want our organization to lose its identity. That is to say, we agree to cooperate with all who adhere to national and democratic positions. The center is a fairly relative concept in Georgia today. If, before, radicalism was viewed as being politically the most profitable thing (and everyone was laying claim to this), today, centrism is, for some reason, viewed as such and everyone is now following the trend of declaring themselves to be centrists. [Paatashvili] As regards the "Center" faction, what was done a few days ago was a principled decision. These four organizations are necessary for the normal functioning of Parliament and overcoming the crisis (there were arguments among them on this score). [Gurbutashvili] Are you no longer in opposition? [Paatashvili] I consider us to be representatives of the opposition; we are opposed to the current policies and to the majority who support the present authorities. "Center" signifies the center from the political point of view; it does not mean that representatives of the opposition should not be united within it. Representatives of the majority can remain on the right, representatives of a part of the opposition on the left, and, at the same time, those in the opposition who are opposed to the authorities regarding a whole number of questions can remain in the center. As regards Charter-91, consultations have been taking place. The creation of the faction, in contrast to the coalition, signifies even greater cooperation. Joint decisions should be taken here. This, as you know, imposes strict limits upon the representatives of each individual faction. Consultations are continuing on a whole number of questions and nothing has finally been established. Charter-91 has, for the moment, not committed itself to becoming a member. The remaining three organizations are continuing consultations. As regards Charter-91, from the political point of view, we are in opposition to the authorities, but there is an opposition that is more radical than we are and that is demanding both the resignation of the head of state and the dissolution of the majority. We want the authorities to undergo a qualitative change but this should not be to the detriment of the country and should not result in Eduard Shevardnadze's fleeing or being driven out of Georgia, which would cause even more instability. We believe that there should be a change of power, which should proceed from the good will of the majority, including Eduard Shevardnadze; there should be a division of power and not instability. There is potential even in this Parliament and, if it is used correctly, it will be possible both to govern the country in a better way and create a governing team that is better than the present one (I have in mind both officials in Parliament and a whole number of government representatives).
