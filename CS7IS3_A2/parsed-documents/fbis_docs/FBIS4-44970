Although the satellite channels have played a major role in broadcasting news about the events taking place in Yemen, radios still remain the basic means by which they get their news and information. The reason for this is that a great many of the Yemenis living in Saudi Arabia cannot afford to buy satellite dishes. However, in some of the Yemeni households where there are satellite dishes, people have gathered around TV sets to follow firsthand what is being broadcast by the satellite channels. Likewise, some owners of commercial stores have said that there has been a noticeable increase in the demand for radio sets. Both Yemeni residents and visitors are worried because telephone communications and trips by air have been cut off, and these constitute the only means by which they can properly assess what is going on in their country. An official in the Yemeni Airlines Company said: "Large numbers of Yemenis are coming to us and asking whether or not there is a flight going to, or coming from, Yemen. Also, some passengers are having their names put on the reservation list in anticipation of flights starting up." AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT met with some of the Yemeni residents and conducted interviews with them in order to get their reactions concerning what their thoughts have been since the war broke out in Yemen. 'Abd Muhammad Hasan said: "I have been working in Saudi Arabia for three years. My wife and children visited me during the last month of Ramadan. Although our area is 400 miles from Sanaa, the fact that telephone connections have been cut off and flights and trips by sea have been stopped means that the situation has deteriorated." He added: "I thought of going along with my five colleagues who returned to Yemen via the land route. But my health didn't allow me to go, and I need to get well. I don't know if my colleagues, who left Jeddah on Thursday, will be able to enter Yemen or whether or not this door will also be closed." He ended by saying: "What can I say? There is no power and no strength save in God." I Can't Think Straight Ahmad Yislam [name as transliterated] said: "Worry is killing me. I can't think straight and I can't concentrate. My brother, mother, father, and child are all there. What can I do? I don't know anything after the telephone connections were cut off and trips by air and by sea stopped going to Yemen. Now all we can do is listen to the news and follow the events and developments of the war over the TV that one of our colleagues has in his house after we finish work--which helps us to forget things for a while. But our hearts and our minds are in Yemen. Really all we can do is to humbly pray that God will put out the fire of this war, have people come to their senses, and contain the crisis before Yemen pays the price of the disturbances and losses which are more costly than disputes over authority and other interests." The Radio Is My Friend 'Ali Muhammad Sa'id says: "My only friend is my radio. That is how I find out what is going on in Yemen, although I am not convinced of the truth of everything that I hear over the radio concerning the causes of the war. Yemen is too big to have someone try to divide it or exploit it for personal reasons. Whatever the disputes may be, they should not end up being fought with bullets, bombs, and missiles. The only place where brothers should wage their disputes is the negotiating table. This is the only place where these circumstances and tensions can come to an end without bloodshed. After the helping hands of our Arab brothers have been extended, the Yemenis themselves have to step in and stop this bloodshed, which is increasing every day because of the outbreak of the conflict between the two sides." He went on to say: "I am waiting to go back to Yemen, when flights resume, so that I can be reassured about my family and relatives--or whoever is still alive among them, I should say. We pray to God that justice will be done and Yemen be preserved." Rise in Prices and Lack of Security Salim Nasir says: "All I know is that there has been an increase in prices in Yemen and one is no longer safe there, and this makes life difficult. We heard promises that there would be an improvement in the situation and that those who were corrupt and committed fraud with the wealth of the nation would be punished. But all of these resolutions remained merely pieces of paper until the war broke out. We don't know what the extent of the effects of this war will be if it is not snuffed out right away. Certain considerations, fears, and results must be taken into account before it is too late. All we can do is to wait and see what tomorrow will bring us in terms of events." First and Last Group In reply to a question about what his feelings were, Muhammad 'Abdallah said: "We have been the first and last group of pilgrims to arrive in Saudi Arabia since the airports in Yemen were bombarded. We are praying to God here in the Holy Mosque [in Mecca] and in the Prophet's Mosque [in Medina] that this war will come to an end and that all the parties start a dialogue and be guided by reason." After a moment of reflection, he added: "My wife and I left our children in Yemen. We have tried to call them on the phone, but have not been successful. Telephone communications have been cut. All we can do is follow the news, wait, and pray." In addition to this, a fight broke out between a number of Northern and Southern Yemenis after an argument between the two sides concerning the situation in their country and the reasons for the conflict and the war. A number of people were injured, and it ended only when a number of older people intervened to stop the fight and to say that any victory by one of the two sides in Yemen would be a loss for everyone, since the killers and the persons killed, and the victors and the losers, are all Yemenis. For this reason, it is in the interests of Yemen that this war, which is being waged on its territory, be stopped.
