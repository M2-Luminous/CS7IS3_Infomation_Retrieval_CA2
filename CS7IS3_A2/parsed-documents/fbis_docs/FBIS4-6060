"Four batallions of police and military officials remain on alert here in anticipation of anti-ethnic-Chinese demonstrations," Medan Military District Commander Lieutenant Colonel Agus Ramadan told journalists. This adds up to about 2,600 security personnel. "The demonstrations might peak on Monday or Tuesday," Ramadan said. Tens of thousands of workers staged demonstrations in Medan Thursday and Friday, demanding an investigation into the suspicious death of one of their colleagues last month. The battered body of Rusli, a worker of Rubber industry PT Industri Karet Deli, was found in a local river one day after he had led a workers protest in March. But officials did not investigate his death. Workers also asked for better conditions and higher wages, as well as the right to organize in independent labour trade unions. The government only recognizes the official All Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI). Violence erupted on Friday when security forces tried to stop the demonstration, which was heading to downtown Medan. Some angry demonstrators then pelted shops, factories and vehicles, witnesses said. The violence appeared aimed at ethnic Chinese, who are often the target of jealously because of their general economic success. An estimated 40 to 50 shophouses and six cars were burnt, at least 150 shops and houses were destroyed, sources told AFP. Ramadan confirmed one ethnic-Chinese businessman identified as Juli Kristanto, or known under the Chinese name Wok Joe Lip, 53, was killed Friday, but declined to give details. Ramadan said that 120 people were a.nested for their alleged involvement in vandalism, murder and arson. On Saturday, an AFP correspondent saw nine armoured vehicles parking along the main residential areas inhabited by many ethnic Chinese. A journalist of Medan-based WASPADA daily said by telephone that dozens of other armoured vehicles were deployed on the suburban areas. Most of the shops, private banks, private ethnic-Chinese schools were closed in that city of 1.5 million, whose ethnic Chinese community makes up one third of the population. Lieutenant Colonel Ramadan said that the anti-ethnic-Chinese demonstration was prompted by workers' dissatisfaction over the annual bonus which was given before the Muslim celebration of Idul Fitri in March. There was also news of a 430-million-dollar scam at a state bank involving ethnic Chinese businessman Eddy Tansil. Demonstrators also protested against the involvement of the military in labour disputes, the chairman of the independent Jakarta-based Welfare Labour Union (SBSI), Mukhtar Pakpahan, told a press conference Saturday. SBSI, insisting the strike should be the last option for workers, was behind the first strike on Thursday, Pakpahan said. But, he added, "other parties have made use of the situation the following day, creating chaos and violent demonstrations." Pakpahan called on the government to stop using security measures as away of dealing with labour. "SBSI urges the government not to use the security approach and [word indistinct] actions to handle strikes," Pakpahan said.
