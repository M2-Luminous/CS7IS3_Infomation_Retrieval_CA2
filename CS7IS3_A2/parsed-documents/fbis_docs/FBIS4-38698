Only Not in Russia, But in the United States"] [Text] The joint Russian-U.S. military exercises that were scheduled to be held in our country at Totskiy but were ultimately canceled for political reasons will nonetheless go ahead. But in the United States. The proposal to hold the peacemaking forces' maneuvers abroad -- "in view of the domestic political situation in Russia" -- was made by Senator Sam Nunn, the influential chairman of the Armed Services Committee, at a meeting with his Russian colleagues in Moscow. His colleagues were enthusiastic about the idea. It is now up to the executive branches -- in Russia and the United States. Immediately on his return to Washington Nunn will discuss his proposal with President Clinton and Defense Secretary Perry. According to the senator, Americans will "give the Russian troops a good reception on their territory." Admittedly, Russia will lose the $2 million that the United States would have paid us had the maneuvers been held at Totskiy. That would have been payment for the use of our military installations, infrastructure, etc. We will hardly be given any money if we send our servicemen to the United States. What is more we will evidently have to ask the Americans to fund the trip, which will undoubtedly be a costly one. It is quite possible that if the maneuvers go well in the United States and our soldiers do in actual fact receive a cordial reception as if the Cold War had never taken place, the guarded suspicion which frustrated the plans to hold the exercises in Totskiy will ease and the next maneuvers will be held in Russia.
