[Wei] Two unexpected trends have developed. Many people were afraid of making contacts with us [not further specified] 15 years ago. Now, however, many people, from members of the communist party to ordinary old peasants (the general public), are giving us words of encouragement. Another thing is the fact that corruption, including bribery and embezzlement of state assets, is spreading among senior communist party officials at a faster rate than I expected. [Shimizu] Can you tell us about life in prison? [Wei] I was put in a punishment cell when I was in prison in Beijing. I was given only wotou (steamed bread made of cornmeal) to eat. Nobody, including the prison guards, was allowed to speak to me for five years. I became unable to talk. [Shimizu] What about your health? [Wei] I was not allowed to sunbathe one year during the five I spent in the Beijing prison. I was not given vitamin pills either. My teeth became weak, but I was not allowed to have dental treatment. Now I wear false teeth. At first, they did not even take me to a doctor when I had pain in my heart. I was allowed to see a doctor at long last and found out that I had heart trouble. Immediately after that, they transferred me to a prison in the highland of Qinghai Province. I think they wanted see me die in the prison. They began to treat me a little better about 1985, when Hu Yaobang (former CPC general secretary) improved treatment of political prisoners. Fortunately, my body was able to adjust the life in the highland. Otherwise, I would not have come back alive. Not many people come back alive from the highland prison. There is a saying in China: criminals may not be afraid of the death sentence, but they are afraid of a 15-year imprisonment. [Shimizu] Were you able to find out information on the Tianammen Square incident of 4 June 1989? [Wei] I partially knew about it because RENMIN RIBAO was reporting the truth for a while (before the incident). It was a big chance for China. But, since the government and the students handled the incident badly, only the most reactionary forces benefited from it. Because of this, freedom of the press and much of the political reform movement receded to the level of the time of the Great Cultural Revolution. [Shimizu] Do the security police still interfere with your activities? [Wei] The security police gave me warnings for several reasons, one of which was that I contacted foreign correspondents within three months of my release. I received an official warning for the article I wrote for THE NEW YORK TIMES last November. [Shimizu] The United States is changing its attitude toward the human rights issue. [Wei] It is not wise to do that. I understand the need to do business. However, I hope the United States will continue to maintain its responsible attitude toward the democratic movement and human rights conditions in China. [Shimizu] What do you expect of the Japanese Government? [Wei] Lately, the Chinese people think that the Japanese Government supported the most reactionary government of China. Japan supported China because of the traditional strategy that the more China lags behind Japan in the economic field, the safer Japan would become. However, China is lagging behind Japan so much in the economic field that major disorder in China will not benefit Japan. I hope Japan will support the progressive forces in China while giving consideration to historical perspectives as well. [Shimizu] But China is maintaining high economic growth. [Wei] We must not forget the fact that the statistics given, which are affected by China's social system, are not accurate. Virtually all conceivable products are sold in countries which have normal market economies. But many products are still not sold in China. Nevertheless, the statistics show that China's production is growing. Basically, China's wealth has not grown since 1989. Prices of goods go up rapidly and most of people's incomes cannot keep pace with inflation. In inland provinces, in particular, farmers, who are unable to make a living, are waiting for leaders who can help them start a riot. A serious riot will break out sometime in the future, when the Communist Party, which continues to oppress the people, is no longer able to keep them under control. [Shimizu] Deng Xiaoping says that liberalization will invite rioting. [Wei] Knowing that one form of party dictatorship does not work, the Communist Party is suppressing people who talk about new theories and new regimes. The history of overthrowing imperial regimes and the tradition of violent revolution still exists in China. Oppression of the people will invite rioting. Our task for the time being is to nurture a new, wise, and moderate political force which will challenge the Communist Party's absolute grip on power. [Shimizu] Is the process of forming a new political force making headway? [Wei] I have to get in touch with people who are willing to take part in the democratic movement, and many other people, including members of the Communist Party. There is no precedent for a violent revolution producing good results. Therefore, we are not hoping that the communist administration will be overthrown in a day. However, we have to change this system.
