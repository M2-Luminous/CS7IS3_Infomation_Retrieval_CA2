FR941207-0-00043 FR941207-0-00007 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;23&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9083; AD 94&hyph;24&hyph;10] Airworthiness Directives; Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B Airplanes Equipped With Flight Equipment and Engineering Limited Model 121 Series Seats AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes, that requires repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard sections of certain seats; and replacement of the inboard sections, if necessary. This amendment also requires repair and identification of the modification plate, which would terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively. This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking in the vicinity of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses, which could lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on these seats during aft loading. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the backrest on these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress. DATES: Effective January 6, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Flight Equipment and Engineering Limited, Technical Manager, Nissen House, Grovebury Road, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire LU7 8TB, United Kingdom. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Quam, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2145; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes, equipped with Flight Equipment and Engineering Limited Model 121 series seats, was published in the Federal Register on May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22771). That action proposed to require repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard sections of certain seats; and replacement of the inboard sections, if necessary. It also proposed to require repair and identification of the modification plate, which would terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter has no objections to the proposal, but questions the accuracy of the description of the point of failure, as described in the preamble to the notice. The preamble stated, ``Cracking in this area may weaken the machined component that attaches the backrest of the seats to the main spars of the airplane and may lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on these seats during aft loading'' (emphasis added). The commenter implies that it is not accurate to state that the failure point is where the seat backrests attach to the main spar of the airplane. The FAA has reconsidered its previous description and concurs that clarification is warranted. The FAA finds that the following wording comprises a more accurate description: Cracking in this area may eventually weaken the seat section such that the spindles attaching the table and seat back to the seat section may break free during crash loads or normal loads. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the backrest of these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress. This clarification of the description of the failure scenario in no way alters the basis for issuance of this AD or the unsafe condition addressed by it. As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per workhour to $60 per workhour. The economic impact information below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.
