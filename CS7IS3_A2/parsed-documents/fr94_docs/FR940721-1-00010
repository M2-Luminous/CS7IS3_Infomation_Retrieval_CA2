FR940721-1-00010 FR940721-1-00005 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AWP&hyph;8] Proposed Modification of Restricted Areas R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B, and Establishment of R&hyph;2303C, Fort Huachuca, AZ AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend Restricted Areas R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B, and establish R&hyph;2303C at Fort Huachuca, AZ. R&hyph;2303A would be amended to exclude the Fort Huachuca/Libby AAF/Sierra Vista Municipal Airport from the restricted area and provide airspace for visual flight rules (VFR) access to the airport when R&hyph;2303A is in use. The proposal would lower the floor and ceiling and revise the lateral dimensions of R&hyph;2303B in order to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicle training profiles. R&hyph;2303B would be further subdivided by redesignating the southeast corner of the existing area as a separate restricted area, R&hyph;2303C. Additionally this notice proposes to reduce the published hours of operation for R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B. As proposed, the time of designation for the new area, R&hyph;2303C, would be intermittent by a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). These changes are proposed to accommodate increased training requirements and to return unneeded special use airspace to the National Airspace System (NAS). DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, Air Traffic Division, AWP&hyph;500 Docket No. 93&hyph;AWP&hyph;8, Federal Aviation Administration, P. O. Box 92007, Worldway Postal Center, Los Angeles, CA 90009.

Availability of NPRM's Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA&hyph;220, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267&hyph;3485. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11&hyph;2A, which describes the application procedure. The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) to amend R&hyph;2303A to exclude from the restricted area the airspace from the surface to 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL), within a 3-nautical-mile radius of the Fort Huachuca/Libby AAF/Sierra Vista Municipal Airport. The airspace from the surface to 1,500 feet AGL within 1-nautical-mile either side of U.S. Highway 90 would also be excluded. This would provide VFR access to the airport when R&hyph;2303A is in use. R&hyph;2303B would be amended by relocating the northern boundary 3 miles south of its existing position. This would better accommodate hang gliding activity that takes place just outside of the northwest corner of existing R&hyph;2303B. R&hyph;2303B would also be subdivided to designate the southeastern section as a separate restricted area, R&hyph;2303C. This notice also proposes to lower the floor of R&hyph;2303B from 15,000 feet MSL to 8,000 feet MSL in order to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicle training profiles. The ceiling of R&hyph;2303B would be lowered from FL 450 to FL 300. This new subarea would extend from 8,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) to FL 300. The U.S. Army has determined that there is no longer a requirement for restricted airspace above FL 300, therefore, that airspace would be returned to the NAS. Lastly, the times of designation for R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B would be reduced from ``Monday-Saturday, 0700&hyph;1600 local time; other times by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance,'' to ``Monday-Friday, 0700&hyph;1600 local time; other times by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance.'' Activation of R&hyph;2303C would be intermittent by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance. Designation of R&hyph;2303C is proposed to accommodate hang gliding activities that occur just outside of the southeastern corner of existing R&hyph;2303B. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Section 73.23 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review An environmental review of the proposal will be conducted by the U.S. Army and the FAA prior to an FAA final decision on the proposal. The results of the review will be addressed in any subsequent rulemaking action. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 73 Airspace, Navigation (air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 73 as follows:
