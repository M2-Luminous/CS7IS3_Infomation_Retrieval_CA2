This is the only collective from Cuban Workers Federation's forces to reach the aforementioned figure as was announced during a ceremony chaired by Alfredo Enriquez Pina, first secretary of the party in Granma Province, where the collective was awarded the three-million arroba banner. The newspaper GRANMA reports that this achievement is considered a heroic deed, considering the material difficulties of the current harvest. The most outstanding members of the brigade -- with more than 100,000 arrobas -- were Victor Rodriguez and Benigno Hidalgo, and the most outstanding youth was Julio Guerra.
