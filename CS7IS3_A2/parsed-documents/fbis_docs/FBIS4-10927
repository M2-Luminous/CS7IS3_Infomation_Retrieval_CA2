According to Nelson Lopez, coordinator of the Bosawas project, the lack of clearly defined agrarian policies and the pressure by landless peasants for land are complicating the issue. Levalth Matute, supreme leader of the Miskitos, stated: "We are the historic owners of these territories which are now being deforested by the mestizos to such an extent that the land is being turned into cattle ranches. We are extremely concerned about this." Miskito leaders pointed out that the Bosawas preserve should be maintained and that penetration by peasant families be halted. The article reports that to prevent conflicts the Bosawas project, which is sponsored by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, is urging that deeds be issued to the owners of indigenous lands.
