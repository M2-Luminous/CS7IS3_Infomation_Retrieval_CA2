Both sides carried out discussions on three topics, including "the repatriation of people entering each other's area in violation of relevant regulations and other issues concerned," but no agreement was reached because the Taiwan side repudiated some areas of consensus reached earlier between the officials of the two organizations during their Beijing talks; discussions on other items on the agenda could not be held either. The SEF delegation returned to Taibei [Taipei] on 31 March. The latest talks were arranged on the basis of the consensus reached between Tang Shubei, executive vice president of the ARATS, and Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho], vice chairman and secretary general of the SEF, during talks in Beijing in February. Their main tasks were to hold discussions on the three topics, including "the repatriation of people entering each other's area in violation of relevant regulations and other issues concerned" and "the handling of cross-Strait fishing disputes"; to try to overcome, on the basis of the high degree of consensus reached by officials during their talks, remaining differences in order to reach a written agreement at an early date; and to exchange views or carry out discussions on "a joint crackdown on maritime smuggling, robbery, and other crimes," on the "protection of intellectual property rights," on "ties and mutual assistance between related law courts" on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as on economic, scientific, and technological issues listed in "the General Agreement on the Wang-Ku Talks." This time the SEF arranged to have Deputy Secretaries General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] and Shi Qiping [Shi Chi-ping] each lead relevant officials in two echelons to Beijing for talks. During the talks which began on 25 March, Sun Yafu, ARATS deputy secretary general, and Xu Huiyou, chief negotiators of both sides, discussed the written wording of an agreement for the three topics on routine affairs. However, after the talks began, the SEF side raised some issues which had been solved during earlier talks between the officials in Beijing, thus changing the nature of the current talks which should have discussed the written wording for the text of an agreement and once again leading to debates over past differences. Despite the eight discussion meetings over five days, no solution acceptable to both sides could be found, and talks on routine affairs between the two sides were once again deadlocked. The second echelon of SEF's negotiators including Shi Qiping and others have put off their visit to Beijing. In explaining the reason for once again bringing up differences which had been resolved, Taiwan's SEF Deputy Secretary General Xu Huiyu said: "Both sides should be serious and practical in interpreting the `consensus reached at the Tang-Jiao talks.' A process of discussion cannot be called a consensus. The conditions of the specific time should be taken into consideration in interpreting consensus." Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Council" has blamed ARATS for "magnifying the interpretation of consensus." As a result, the current talks created a spectacular issue -- how to interpret consensus reached earlier by officials of the two organizations during their talks in Beijing. Let us recall their talks. During the three-day talks, Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho] thoroughly discussed the differences faced in the consultation of three topics on routine affairs and reached consensus on solving several issues. Both sides also agreed to hold the fourth round of talks on routine affairs on the basis of the consensus. The principled consensus reached at the talks were written in the "Joint News Release by Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe After Their Talks." After conclusion of the talks, SEF Vice Chairman Jiao Renhe issued a statement, saying, the talks "almost resolved all the issues in the three topics for discussion. Only one issue -- the use of written expressions. The joint news release by both sides should be binding." He said he was confident the fourth round of talks would succeed in deciding the text of an agreement. Huang Kunhui [Huang Kun-hui], chairman of Taiwan's "MAC," also said the SEF conducted consultations within the scope it authorized, adding the MAC was not only satisfied with, but also highly affirmed the results of the talks. According to Taiwan media reports, the MAC convened two meetings of relevant departments in mid-March to discuss "countermeasures" for the fourth round of talks. During the meetings the MAC vetoed some of the consensus reached between Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe, and "repudiated the important consensus reached at the Tang-Jiao talks on three topics." It also asserted the necessity of "maintaining the bottom line in the Taibei talks between the two organizations under the premise of upholding the dignity of judicial jurisdiction." From this one can see it is the Taiwan side that repudiated the Tang-Jiao consensus and revived the differences that had already been resolved, thus causing the current talks to be deadlocked. Interpreting the consensus reached between the two organizations' officials during the Beijing talks is, no doubt, a question that must be dealt with seriously. Only the preservation of the consensus will help bring about an early agreement on the various topics discussed at the talks on routine matters between the two sides of the strait. In interpreting the "consensus," the two sides should begin with the following goals in mind: -- The consensus reached by the two organizations' officials during their talks must be recognized and earnestly carried out. This is because the officials conducted their discussions in accordance with "the agreement on the liaison and meeting of the two organizations" signed during the "Wang-Ku talks." Moreover, they were authorized by their respective competent departments. The authorization and legal basis for the discussions was beyond all doubt, and so the results are of course effective. -- In the area of major principle, the consensus reached by officials during the Beijing talks, for example: "Political issues should be pragmatically avoided in discussions on routine matters between the two organizations," was written into the "Joint News Release by Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe After Their Talks." As for the specific high degree of consensus reached on the three topics, only "a high degree of consensus was reached" was written in the "Joint News Release" without listing the specific contents one by one, but consensus is consensus -- and it was the common view agreed on by both sides during their talks. The words are still ringing in one's ears; the consensus should be carried out. -- In their talks on routine affairs, the two sides should adhere to the guideline of "seeking truth from facts, seeking common ground while reserving differences, holding discussions on equal terms, and respecting each other" and to the principle of avoiding political issues; and resolve the easy issues first and tackle the difficult ones later in order to quickly find a way in which both sides can cooperate in resolving issues which have developed in the course of cross-strait exchanges, to safeguard and promote cross-strait exchanges, and to avoid binding their own hands and feet, thus setting restrictions on themselves. The Taiwan side's adoption of an interlocking stratagem to confine the two organizations' operations and talks on routine affairs to one or two issues will cause the scope of cross-strait consultations on routine affairs and exchanges, which was very broad at the beginning, to continue to narrow down to the point where there is no more space to move. -- Keeping one's word and promise is a traditional, noble quality of the Chinese nation. Sincerity in resolving issues constitutes the necessary condition for success in cross-strait discussions on routine affairs. Therefore, in their talks on routine affairs, the two sides should conduct discussions by proceeding from the aim of solving issues and seeking mutual benefit -- benefit for compatriots on both sides of the strait. The consensus reached in each stage of the discussions should be cherished and safeguarded. Even if it is necessary to once again bring up an issue for discussion, mutual respect and consultations on equal terms should be adhered to with a sincerity to resolve issues. One should not negate the consensus already reached and deliberately raise new issues. Although the two organizations met with setbacks in their recent talks, the delegates -- realizing the need for an early solution of issues developed in the course of cross-strait exchanges and that the two organizations are willing to maintain ties and channels of communication -- indicated after the end of the talks that they will continue. Therefore, maintaining the consensus reached at the talks and striving to expand the results of such consensus will be crucial to the success of the next round of talks. People on both sides of the strait are expecting the two organizations' officials to continue to work hard, seek truth from facts, seek common ground while reserving differences, and discover a way to resolve the issues at an early date.
