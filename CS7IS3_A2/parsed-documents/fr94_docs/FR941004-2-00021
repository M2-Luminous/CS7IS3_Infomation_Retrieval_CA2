FR941004-2-00021 FR941004-2-00008 Currency Conversion We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Verification As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of butt-weld pipe fittings from Thailand, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are produced and sold by AST and that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ␣ 1Manufacturer/Producer/Exporter 1Margin percent Asahi Sangyo (Thailand) Co., Ltd. 10.37 Adjustment of Deposit Rate for Countervailing Duties Article VI, paragraph 5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that ``[no] product .␣.␣. shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation for dumping or export subsidization.'' This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act. Since antidumping duties cannot be assessed on the portion of the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no basis to require a cash deposit or bond for that amount. Accordingly, the level of export subsidies as determined in the most recent administrative review of the countervailing duty order, Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From Thailand; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 5248, February 13, 1992), which was 0.74 percent, will be subtracted from the margin for cash deposit or bonding purposes. This results in a deposit rate of 9.63 percent for AST. We did not determine an ``all others'' rate in this investigation, because all other producers and exporters of butt-weld pipe fittings from Thailand are already subject to an antidumpting duty order on this merchandise, which was published in the Federal Register on July 6, 1992 (57 FR 29702). ITC Notification In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination.
