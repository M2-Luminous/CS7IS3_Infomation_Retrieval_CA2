Early in 1993, under an illegal plan hatched by a certain Hong Kong businessman surnamed Ning, the general manager of the Qinzhou City Goods and Materials Company, Pei Yuchun [5952 5940 2504], the manager of the first corporate trade department subordinate to the Qinzhou branch of the People's Bank of China, Chen Zuheng [7115 4371 0077], the manager of the Beihai City Industrial Supply and Marketing Corporation, Luo Peng [5012 7720], and the manager of the Liuzhou City Foreign Economic Trade Corporation's Chemical Branch Corporation, Zeng Biao [2582 1753], in order to provide individuals and their own units with exorbitant profits, and using relevant stipulations under which China allows commodity trade to be carried out with a number of countries, adopted a falsely signed commodity contract, and bogus reporting of a production site as a method to avoid customs inspections, and without restraint engaged in automobile smuggling criminal activity. Without authorization, they used the name of the Liuzhou Foreign Economic and Trade Corporation, and plotted to sign false barter contracts for 1389.98 tons of zinc ingots and 294 tons of zinc oxide, respectively, in exchange for importing 686 and 112 "Modern" brand small automobiles. They falsely reported the vehicles' original place of production, keeping clear of the state import export licensing administration, and obtained a customs signed and issued "import export commodity tax free certificate." This resulted in the clinching of a deal for 798 smuggled automobiles which passed the border with no trouble. In order to defray the costs of the transaction, the Qinzhou Commodities Corporation Head Office and the Beihai Industrial Supply and Marketing Corporation actively raised money, and entrusted Chen Zuheng before the case was discovered to collect in succession eight sums of money totalling more than $11.2 million and deliver them to Ning's Yisheng Corporation in Hong Kong. After the case was discovered, they also mutually colluded, and continued to falsely create automobile original manufacturing site documentary materials, and provide false information on nature of their trading, to conceal their smuggling. The "798" smuggled automobiles case caused the country tremendous economic loss. In November of 1993, the Guangxi District Discipline Committee and the Supervisory Office conducted a rigorous investigation of the entire case. The four people involved, including Pei Yuchun et al., have been expelled from the party and administrative disciplinary measures have been taken against them. Because of their violations of the law, the case has been handed over to judicial organs for investigation. Others bearing major responsibility have also been punished through expulsion from their posts in the party, placement on probation within the party, and some have been relieved of their administrative positions.
