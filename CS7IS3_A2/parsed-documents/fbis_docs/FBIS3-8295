The Solidarity leader said on the Polish Radio Third Programme on 8 March that the action would be implemented with all force to "make the government sit down at the negotiating table at last." According to him, consensus is possible, although the government decision has made talks difficult. "I think that consensus is a real possibility, but the political decision made by the government has made talks with the union impossible," Krzaklewski said, adding that "some leaked information had reached him on the subject" because some union members tried to mediate in order to bring about talks with the government. Krzaklewski did not want to comment more on the "leaks." He only added that this was an "initiative of people of goodwill" who wanted to bring about mediation by talking to high-ranking state officials, from whom they got a reply that the government would not be discussing the demands that had been put forward. "I am surprised about this, and I think it is a clear challenge for Solidarity and an attempt to test the union," Krzaklewski said.
