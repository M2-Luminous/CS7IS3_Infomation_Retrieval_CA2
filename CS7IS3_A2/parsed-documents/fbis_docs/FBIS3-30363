Afterward, we will start public works in forestry and agriculture, and the reconstruction of Krajina. In this way, we will create the conditions for a normal functioning of the state, while drawing a sizable number of people into the reconstruction of the war-torn republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK]. All this, newly elected RSK President Milan Martic emphasizes, is contained in his electoral program. Everything that I have promised, he says, starting with a stable and efficient economy, the establishment of legal order, the revitalization of the economy, the social program, diplomacy, and naturally, the unification of the Serbian lands, I intend to carry out. However, prior to the unification we must build a stable country, with a strong defense and economy. I hope that we will accomplish this within a relatively short period of time and that we will not longer need to ask for aid from Serbia, but will help it as much as we can. Milan Martic does not doubt that he will get the support of the RSK Assembly for everything that he intends to do, regardless of the fact that it is the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] of Krajina and the SRS [Serbian Radical Serbian] for Krajina, which support Dr. Milan Babic, that have the majority in the new parliament. Nobody has an absolute majority in our parliament, Martic says. The SDS of Krajina has 31 deputies and can only achieve a majority through a coalition. I am not worried by this because I will carry out talks with the chiefs of the parliamentary groups and the leaders of the parties and demand that they respect the will of the people. I recommend them to refrain from working toward the differentiation and obstruction of the authorities, as the people expect a better life and a stable country for all of us. I will extend my hand to everyone, and give them a chance to work in the joint interests. The national interest of the Serbian people must be above party interests, Martic says. Adamantly Against Profiteers By saying this, President Martic emphasizes that the new government will carry a great burden and responsibility, as an extremely capable cadre is needed for the realization of such an ambitious program. Martic says that the government will be formed among the most capable people in the RSK, regardless of their party membership. The Krajina residents who are currently in Serbia or Montenegro, among whom are numerous acclaimed businessmen, will definitely be included, too. Martic's intention is to create capable teams of experts, consisting of powerful personalities and acclaimed businessmen, who will be prepared for round-the-clock, self-sacrificing work. When asked whom he would like to see at the head of such a government, Martic did not wish to give a precise answer. It is inevitable, he says, that he holds consultations before he announces the name of the prime minister designate. However, he will do this soon. One of the conditions for the RSK to become a truly stable country is also the information system, of which a real mess has been made in the electoral campaign. This is one of the priority tasks, the president says. In a moment in which efforts are being undertaken to create a unified information space of all Serbian lands, it is intolerable that our information system is being fragmented into some sort of communal, and other, media systems. Asked to comment on the divisions between the "north" and the "south" of Krajina and the ways in which they reflect other problems, Milan Martic says that this division does not exist. There are differences that will definitely be overcome. The north and the south of the RSK wish to live together and none of them wish to secede, as has often been overemphasized, Martic says. We will find a way that nobody will be harmed, he adds, that all who work will be stimulated. I have nothing against lavish hosts and rich people if they have acquired their property honestly. However, I am a fierce opponent of all who have acquired wealth through profiteering, theft, and criminal activities. With such we shall deal mercilessly. They will all be held responsible, that is for sure, Martic emphasizes. No Bargaining With Krajina The economic, political, and other trends in the RSK are in many ways also influenced by the republic of Srpska. It is natural, Martic says, that we are also "interwoven" in the Geneva negotiations. If we do not stick together, there will be no survival. The main Krajina capacities are linked to companies in the republic of Srpska, and, with the formation of a consortium of experts, the economies of the RSK, the republic of Srpska, and Serbia have been thoroughly linked. This is a way toward the formation of a unified economic territory of the Serbian lands. There will soon be unification of the monetary system and the new Yugoslav "super dinar" is being introduced in the RSK. It is realistic to expect that the unification of all Serbian lands will materialize this year already, Martic says. Many Krajina residents have left their homes and have ended up in Serbia, Montenegro, and all over Europe. Their fate is uncertain for the time being, however, the RSK president says that this will be resolved soon. We have already have prepared a program that will be applicable to all those who have left Krajina. We will cooperate closely with the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro. We will demand that all those who have unjustifiably gained refugee status be found and immediately returned to their homes. The majority of them have left their houses in Krajina. If they do not want to return, we will be forced to confiscate their property. Naturally, we cannot apply the same treatment to the Serbian refugees from Croatia, they are a special category, Martic adds. Many see the way out of the situation, in neither peace nor war, in bargaining with the Krajina territories with Croatia. Significant regions and towns are on auction. Milan Martic categorically denies all these stories and malicious disinformation that are, according to him, aimed at disuniting the RSK. There is no substance to these stories, Martic says. There is no bargaining with Krajina, not a single part of Serbian soil. True enough, we cannot regain Western Slavonija now, however we have not given up on this region. We cannot resettle the Serbs from that area there, and we cannot even promise them this now. However, it is definite that, if they return there, they will not be doomed to the Croatian checkerboard [reference to Croatian flag]. For the time being, I believe, they are safer in Baranja, Eastern Slavonija, and Western Srem, where they should feel like equal citizens. I expect the old settlers to accept them as their own. [Box 1, p 2] Only on an Equal Footing The statement about the cooperation of the governments of the FRY and Croatia is a positive step in the resolution of Serbian-Croatian relations. It represents the insistence on a peaceful solution of problems and offers a guarantee of peace. It is important that the statement does not prejudice a political solution, which gives hope that, with sufficient engagement and patience, a final solution will be reached, Milan Martic says. The fact that Croatia and its leaders use this to prove that the international community considers Krajina to be Croatian territory has no realistic grounds. I am not surprised by Tudjman's statements, because he has not prepared his people for the truth, and it is thus logical that he always looks for ways to throw sand in their eyes and placate them with promises. In the future, Krajina will strive to win an equal status in all international negotiations, just like the Serbian Republic. Our fate will not be tailored without us. [Box 2, p 2] Without Vengefulness The circumstances made Milan Martic become a politican, too. As he says he understands his current role as a transitional phase in the constitution of a unified Serbian state. He believes that his mandate will last a shorter time than envisaged. This legendary warrior and chief of the Krajina police, known as a man of high moral qualities, says the following about his role as a politician: I believe that I will justify the trust of the nation and accomplish the joint goal -- the unification of the Serbian lands. This means numerous changes in the RSK, primarily cadre changes. Naturally, cadre changes must take place, but there will definitely be no revenge again anyone. All changes will be implemented exclusively for the sake of the faster development of Krajina's prosperity. Generally speaking, the army will undergo the biggest changes. If we realize the program according to the established schedule, I hope that the RSK will have a professional army and considerably stronger defense in half a year's time. [Box 3, p 2] Unified State There is no alternative to the unification of the Serbian lands. I believe that a unified Serbian state will be formed very quickly. This is the only solution by which we will grow economically stronger and become a stable European country. Naturally, the capital of this country will be Belgrade and its president Slobodan Milosevic, Martic says. [Box 4, p 2] Zhirinovskiy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is a friend of the Serbian people and I am glad that he has visited the Serbian lands. I am awaiting meeting him joy. I believe that he can do a lot for the Serbian nation. We, of course, would not consider comparing him to anyone in Russia, as the entire Russian nation is our friend and we expect support from him, the RSK president says.
