FR940203-1-00007 FR940203-1-00002 The addition to 10 CFR part 20 of a requirement to notify individual workers and individual members of the public of exposures in excess of the dose limits is not considered to impose any additional burden on licensees. 3 The addition would make clear in 10 CFR part 20, where such a requirement would normally be expected, that when existing reporting requirements would result in reporting exposure information on an identified individual member of the public to NRC, then the identified individual would receive a report on his or her exposure. 3 See also 10 CFR 19.13(d) (When a licensee is required to report to the Commission any exposure of an individual to radiation or radioactive material, the licensee must also provide the individual a report on their exposure data.) The impact of these proposed rule changes on materials licensees is considered to be minimal. The NRC believes that these changes will provide additional clarity when implementing the revised 10 CFR part 20 and will not have an adverse impact on the health and safety of workers or the public. Removing the implied option to establish controlled areas for radiation protection purposes, and simplifying the definition and administration of occupational dose will require minimal changes in procedures and in some cases may even involve a net reduction in burden. Licensees continue to have the option to control access to areas for reasons other than radiological protection. Licensees who have already written procedures including provisions for controlled areas for radiation protection purposes would have the option to request exemptions. Materials licensees, particularly those who have already implemented the new regulations, are invited to comment on whether or not the proposed changes impose significant burden. Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability The NRC has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. The option of establishing access control over an area owned by a licensee for reasons of security, for example, exists whether or not the term ``Controlled area'' is specifically defined in 10 CFR part 20. The provision for controlled areas in the rule is not a requirement. Deleting the term ``Controlled area'' from the rule is not expected to result in a significant change in the number of areas to be controlled or in an increase in exposure to any member of the public. Public access to licensee owned facilities and land is expected to remain unchanged as a result of this amendment. No other environmental impact or benefit is associated with the ``Controlled area'' provision. Changing the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to make it clear that individuals whose assigned duties involve exposure to radiation and radioactivity are subject to radiation protection procedures associated with occupational exposure and that members of the public cannot be permitted to receive doses that exceed public dose limits just by entering a restricted area is considered a benefit with no environmental impact. This change would have no effect on the type or quantity of material released into the environment and, if anything, would make it less likely for members of the public to be exposed to more than public dose limits.
