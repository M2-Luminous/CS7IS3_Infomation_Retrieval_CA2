Minister Celso Amorim noted that it will now be up to the Portuguese institutions to discuss the situation of these professionals. He noted that the agreement applies to professions such as attorneys-at-law, doctors, and architects. The two ministers also signed an agreement that guarantees the promotion and protection of investments between the governments of Brazil and Portugal.
