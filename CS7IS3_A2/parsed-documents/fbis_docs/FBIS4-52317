The market control force, in coordination with the public security force and the authorities at various levels, has made arrests involving large quantities of electronics goods illicitly imported through the port of Qui Nhon. It has also confiscated some 400,000 packs of foreign-brand cigarettes smuggled through the Central Highlands to Qui Nhon, from where they would have been transported to various northern and southern provinces. It is especially noted that the province has dealt with some cases of car imports which were not carried out in accordance with the state regulations. After sending a report to the government, on 21 March 1994 the province people's committee decided to confiscate eight cars with steering wheels on the opposite [right-hand] side which had been illicitly imported and put into use by the Binh Dinh Province Marine Import-Export Corporation. On 3 May 1994 the provincial people's committee decided to confiscate 38 sedan cars illicitly imported and kept at a storage facility rented from the Dieu Tri branch of the 2d Central Agricultural Supply Corporation in Danang. These cars were later claimed by a number of people who said they were representatives of the Khanh Hoa Province General Trading Corporation, the Kon Tum Province General Trading Corporation, the Nhatrang Sea Liners Supply Service Corporation, and the Thai Binh Duong [Pacific] corporation under the Ministry of the Interior. But these people were unable to produce any papers -- affidavits or powers of attorney -- of the agencies they claimed to be representing. Although some of them did produce some papers, there were many irregular and contradicting points found in them. For instance, an import permit issued by the Nhatrang licensing department was found to be at variance with the regulations of the Ministry of Trade. All the owners of these goods were found to have no authority or no licenses in the car import-export business. There were also wrongdoings on the part of the Binh Dinh Customs Office. For instance, the office did not put the cars under temporary custody pending customs measures. It kept them in storage without informing the local administration of this. Customs control measures were taken before some cars involved had arrived. Cars already checked by customs were kept indiscriminately among unchecked cars. Although imported through the port of Danang, some of the cars were found when they arrived in Qui Nhon to have not gone through control procedures as stipulated. The Binh Dinh Province People's Committee has decided to confiscate the 38 [as heard] cars cited above. The Provincial Market Control Steering Committee has forwarded the files of these cases to responsible investigation agencies to clarify violations involving a number of customs cadres, some individual owners of goods, and some agencies. Binh Dinh province is also taking legal action against the province's Marine Import-Export and Shipping Company on charges of illicitly importing 73 car chassis, 60 automotive engines, and 35 sets of truck chassis with engines, which were originally trucks with steering wheels on the right-hand side.
