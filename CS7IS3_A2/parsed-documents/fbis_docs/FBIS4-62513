[Gukasyan] A public opinion survey, carried in Mountainous Karabakh, has shown that our people voted for independence. Today the RMK Ministry of Foreign Affairs is implementing the will of Karabakh people. Our work is directed to stipulate recognition of the RMK independence. [Correspondent] In what way is this work coordinated with negotiations within CIS, CSCE and UN frameworks? [Gukasyan] The work, carried out within CIS, CSCE and UN frameworks, is of tactical nature. But the strategy remains the same. We have to deal with the international community, with the opinions of foreign countries and international organizations, with international law norms. In our opinion, if we succeed in shifting the struggle from the battlefield into the political arena, if we sit at a negotiations table, we'll have an opportunity to present our arguments, which, we believe, are sufficient for recognition of the RMK. Our main problem is to stop the military operations. Only then will it be possible to resolve political problems. Azerbaijan is not ready to a cease fire today. In my opinion, the Azeri Government didn't give up the idea of resolving the Karabakh problem by force yet. They still hope that military success may create a favorable political situation for future negotiations. This is a mere illusion, and the Azeri Government will have to meet the reality, and sit at the negotiations table together with the RMK authorities. I do not exclude the possibility that this may be already a new government of Azerbaijan. [Correspondent] In your opinion, how many ways for resolving the Karabakh conflict are offered by different political forces in Azerbaijan? [Gukasyan] There is only one opinion in Azerbaijan regarding the resolution of the Karabakh conflict. I can't see other forces in Azerbaijan, which would act today differently than the current Azeri government. The problem is -- which politicians will be smart enough to give up force methods. And as long as Aliyev is unable to give these up, the situation may end up with a shift of power in Azerbaijan. [Correspondent] Do you agree with the concept of "Territories for peace", as suggested by the Chairman of the RA [Republic of Armenia] Supreme Council? [Gukasyan] We agree with the concept but we always try to explain what "peace" means in essence. In our opinion, peace is only possible after a final status of Mountainous Karabakh is defined. Without resolving the problem of status, the danger will persist. In other words, as long as the problem is not resolved finally, peace is impossible. [Correspondent] You agreed with stationing disengagement forces along the whole length of the front line. Do you think, these forces may become an obstacle to the goals of the RMK? [Gukasyan] The risk factor has always existed. It was present when we pulled the problem of Mountainous Karabakh and took the responsibility for defending (our country) from an Azeri aggression, and now, when we try to shift from the sphere of war and to switch into the sphere of peace. We have been always taking risk. Risk is inevitable. But if resolution of the problem is related with a choice between war or peace, we always prefer peace. Though risking, the RMK government will try to gain not only international guarantees in the stage of transition to peace, but will take measures to insure security with our own forces. [Correspondent] Azerbaijan does not accept the idea of stationing peace-making forces. Which forces would you prefer -- CSCE or Russian? [Gukasyan] The most important thing for us is to have international guarantees. The more guarantees, the better. CIS guarantees are good, UN guarantees are even better, and to have both together would be an ideal case. In our opinion, the status of Mountainous Karabakh should not depend on will of Azerbaijan or other countries. [Correspondent] Azeri journalists have been clearly indicating that third forces hinder, and have been pointing at Russia. In your opinion, could the current situation be possibly reached by means of bilateral negotiations? [Gukasyan] If there is such a notion in Azerbaijan, then I can't understand why the Azeri leaders are not willing to sit at the negotiations table with the RMK. Unfortunately, this is not true, and this proves once again that the Azeri government is not sincere in its evaluations. [Correspondent] Azerbaijan continues stating, that Karabakh continues implementing the policy of Armenia. How would you evaluate the Armenia-Karabakh relations in the sphere of external relations? What's the rate of their influence upon each other? [Gukasyan] Armenia and the RMK are completely independent in their external policies. Of course, this does not exclude some agreement in our positions. Our opinions differ in several questions. We do not face any pressure by Armenia in this regard. Karabakh carries an independent external policy. Regarding the policy of Azeri leaders -- they have psychological difficulties in understand the fact that Mountainous Karabakh is now a separate military and political entity. We are in friendly relations with the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our different positions regarding several questions do not hinder to carry a coordinated policy. The RMK external policy is developed in Stepanakert, and if it doesn't coincide with the opinion of the Armenian authorities, they understand that Karabakh should defend its opinion. [Correspondent] How do you see the future of Armenia-RMK relations? Would it be a single entity or separate units? [Gukasyan] I see Mountainous Karabakh as an independent country, though I do not exclude the possibility that Karabakh may become a part of Armenia.
