As far as we could learn from the reports of press agencies, at the congress of the Civic Alliance in the Republic of Moldova, an organization set up in order to give unconditional support for President Mircea Snegur, the latter declared that the unification with Romania must be eliminated from the preoccupations of the political life in the Republic of Moldova and any stand toward Bucharest must proceed from the delimitation of the term Moldovan from the term Romanian. In Mircea Snegur's view, the Romanians in Bessarabia are not Romanians, but Moldovans, and it is not the Romanian language that is spoken between the Prut and Dniester Rivers, but the Moldovan language! Thus, as Dumitru Motpan, the leader of the Agrarian Democratic Party of the Republic of Moldova, said in a speech made on the same day at an electoral meeting in the locality of Cantemir, if the issue of unification is ever raised, this will mean not Romania, but only a part of it, namely Moldavia, and the Republic of Moldova and Moldavia will make up, in the view of those in Chisinau, one single nation, namely the Moldovan nation. The affirmations of Mircea Snegur and of the leaders of the ruling party in the Republic of Moldova were not just some statements made during a drinking bout. They were made in an official framework and, what is more serious, with the intention of making them, from now on, become a fundamental idea of the domestic and foreign policy of the Republic of Moldova. As such, the affirmations of the two leaders are not at all surprising. The categorical rejection of the unification has, for quite a while, been one of the dominant ideas of the policy promoted by Mircea Snegur. The fact that people in Bucharest viewed this issue differently is very simple to explain. Mircea Snegur's true position has been hidden under a veil of ambiguous smiles, smiles meant to put the Chisinau leadership in the role of a lamb that is feeding from two sheep. Smiling at both Russia and Romania, Mircea Snegur was able to obtain significant economic aid from both countries. The illusion created by Mircea Snegur's duplicity was supported for a long time by the special relations of the Republic of Moldova with President Ion Iliescu. Did anybody realize that the Chisinau leader is a ferocious anti-unionist, more than certain that the "brotherly" Snegur-Iliescu meetings would have led to the deterioration of Ion Iliescu's electoral capital. The affirmations made by Mircea Snegur and Dumitru Motpan are not surprising, not in the least, if we look at the current situation in the Republic of Moldova. Elections are approaching beyond the Prut River. And considering that the unification with Romania does not seem to be favored by the great majority of the population, including Romanians, Mircea Snegur and his people, in order to win the elections, saw themselves compelled to make the issue of rejecting unification a whipping boy of the electoral campaign. If, taken as they are, the declarations of the two leaders are not surprising, nevertheless, the feelings that can be guessed behind them are shocking. To the astonishment of the Romanians, the declarations made at the end of last week betray a genuine hatred for the Romanians in Romania. Willingly or unwillingly, the two leaders want to picture us as a mortal danger for the interests of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova. One can see clearly that Mircea Snegur and Dumitru Motpan intend to lead an electoral campaign based not only on the rejection of unification, but also on stirring up hatred against us, that is, the Romanians on this side of the Prut River. No matter what is reason for this goal, the attempt to implement it is as dangerous as possible for Romania. Since the dismantlement of the former Soviet Union, the economic, social-political, and cultural relations between Romania and the Republic of Moldova have increased. Within the framework of this process, the Romanians in Romania have become a real presence beyond the Prut River both through the numerous trips they made there, and through the numerous private firms and cultural organizations that they have established there. The declarations of the two leaders might be the beginning of violence of great proportions against all Romanian citizens present, for one reason or another, in the Republic of Moldova. In the case of correspondents Anda Florea and Mircea Dascaliuc, this is most significant. From this point of view, it would not be an exaggerated act if Romanian citizens would be advised to avoid, at least for the period of the electoral campaign, trips to localities beyond the Prut River. This would be beneficial not only for them, but also for the cause of unification.
