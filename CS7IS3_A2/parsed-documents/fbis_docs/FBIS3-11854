During the news conference, Chavez did not rule out the possibility of an armed struggle, and he called for profound changes in Venezuela, including an constituent assembly and economic reforms. With the support of mid-level officers, the ideologue of the so-called 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement (MBR-200) organized the first coup attempt against former President Carlos Andres Perez on 4 February 1992. Today, however, Chavez harshly criticized the government of President Rafael Caldera for his "improvised plans" to combat the crisis facing the nation, and he insisted on the need for "structural reform." Chavez stressed his organization is political in nature, but in discussing the group's goal "to seize power," he did not rule out the possibility of an armed struggle. Any path, whether by way of armed conflict or elections, remains valid, and the choice depends on the people, he said, describing himself as a "soldier of the people." Chavez added, "We hope for the peaceful path, but we expect profound changes." He also noted he did not regret the events of February 1992, adding that only "the sovereign" people can decide whether or not he stages a rebellion. The news conference, which was attended by a large number of reporters, was held in a concert hall, while hundreds of people waited in the streets to greet him. Chavez indicated that one solution to keep "the people from taking up arms" would be to summon a national constituent assembly, and he went on to criticize the "politicos" and leaders of the traditional political parties. Regarding former President Perez, who is now accused of alleged misappropriation of public funds, Chavez was skeptical that the Supreme Court would issue a warrant for his arrest, adding that he knew of "under the table" agreements by Democratic Action and the Social Christian Party to exonerate Perez. Chavez, who has benefited from what President Caldera has described as "pacification," said peace within the Armed Forces can only by achieved through the release of those individuals involved in the two coup attempts of 1992 (4 February and 27 November). He demanded more jobs and respect for the thousands of soldiers involved in or accused of being involved in the two coups, many of whom have joined the MBR-200, an organization that seeks to create a "great national front." Chavez reiterated he struck no deal with President Caldera in exchange for his release, and instead he criticized the economic policies being implemented by the government that took office on 2 February. "I hope President Caldera confronts the difficult situation in our country in a firm and forceful way," Chavez said as he answered more than 20 questions posed by reporters from domestic and foreign news media. [Caracas Radio Rumbos Network in Spanish at 1836 GMT on 27 March carries a two-minute report that includes recorded remarks made by Chavez to supporters after his 27 March news conference had concluded. In the recording, Chavez says: "One cannot talk of retirement. Nobody is retiring here, because true soldiers never retire. We are now walking hand-in-hand with the people, and we are here to appear before the country and to summon unity around the strategic goal of transformation."]
