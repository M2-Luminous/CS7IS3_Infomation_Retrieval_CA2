Colonel 'Abd-al Hamid al-'Awadi, head of a crack police unit responsible for arms seizures, said three antitank rockets and a mortar were found along with the SA-7 Strela (arrow) missiles in the arms cache Sunday. Al-'Awadi, quoted by newspapers here Wednesday, said the weapons were abandoned by unidentified persons. The Iraqi Army left behind thousands of tons of military equipment when it withdrew from Kuwait in February 1991 after a seven-month occupation. The authorities have seized thousands of weapons, including missiles and antiaircraft guns since an official deadline expired for the population to hand over abandoned Iraqi military equipment. On January 10, Kuwaiti police said they had arrested a Saudi soldier trying to smuggle 36 crates of bullets into Saudi Arabia.
