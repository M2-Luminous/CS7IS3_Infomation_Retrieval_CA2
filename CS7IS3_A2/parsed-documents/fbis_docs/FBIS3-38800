In an opening statement at the SDPP Central Executive Council meeting, Karayalcin said the recent massacre in Sarajevo has taken the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina beyond the dimensions of a human tragedy. Stressing that Turkey will not allow the problem to be defined as a human tragedy and then discarded among the many daily discussions, Karayalcin said that foreign policy friendships are different than individual ones. He added: [Begin Karayalcin recording] Should our friends fail to demonstrate their friendship after this incident as well, then I believe that ties of friendship do not mean a lot. Turkey will feel the need to reassess its relations of friendship and mutual assistance depending on the stand to be adopted by its allies following the developments of 5 February. [end recording] In reply to a question, Karayalcin said Prime Minister Tansu Ciller briefed him on the appointment of Isparta Deputy Aykon Dogan as state minister. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin briefed the meeting on the steps taken toward a solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem.
