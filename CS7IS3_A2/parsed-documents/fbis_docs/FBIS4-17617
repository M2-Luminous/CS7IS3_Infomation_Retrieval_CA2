Immediately rumors started: There are disputed sectors. Even the press has divulged this. "Mongolia and Russia recognize the inviolability of the existing borders," J. Choynhor, Mongolian deputy minister of foreign relations, was forced to state in the government newspaper ARDYN ERH. The present commission's cochairman, N. Pavlov, explained that "a planned verification is in progress which is stipulated under the treaty on friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries. Neither of us have any territorial claims toward each other." The inspection is not of a political nature. Nevertheless, there is disquiet. Especially in the area of Tuva. The inhabitants of the border regions of Tuva and Mongolia have the same attitude toward the striped border posts as to a telegraph pole. They simply cross the border at any time and steal each other's cows, horses, and sheep. At times they they set fire to yurts, brawl, and when sorting out their differences go for their knives and rifles. Recently, Major General A. Kochetov, deputy commander of the Transbaykal Border District's forces, visited this area. He ordered the homeland's sentries to*strengthen their combat training. As soon as he had left, a herd of cows was rustled from beside the Shara-Suorata border post. But later Tuvinian shepherds crossed over, killed some Mongolians, and seized some horses. The guerrilla war in the Eastern Sayan Mountains continues.
