FR941222-2-00073 FR941222-2-00062 [Docket No. AB&hyph;103 (Sub-No. 10X)] Kansas City Southern Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Jackson County, MO Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon approximately 1.42 miles of rail line, known as the Independence Air Line Branch, in Kansas City and Independence, in Jackson County, MO. The trackage is from the west line of Kentucky Avenue at milepost 6.93E to the end at milepost 8.35E. 1 1 The City of Independence (City) owns and maintains a power transmission line along the tracks and right-of-way lying between Kentucky and Independence Avenues. KCS states that, once the abandonment becomes effective, it will transfer the right-of-way to the City by quitclaim deed. KCS has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic, if any, which previously moved over the line, has been rerouted; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on January 21, 1995, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 2 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 3 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29ยง 4 must be filed by January 3, 1995. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by January 11, 1995, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 2 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit this Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 3 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 4 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Jay M. Nadlman, 114 W. Eleventh St., Kansas City, MO 64105. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. KCS has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environmental and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by December 27, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: December 14, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31449 Filed 12&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
