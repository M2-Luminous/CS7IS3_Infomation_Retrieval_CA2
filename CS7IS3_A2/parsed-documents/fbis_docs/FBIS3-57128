He told TASS on Friday that a publication of the British "GUARDIAN" newspaper which claimed that he had asked US Ambassador in Russia Thomas Pickering to find a job for him in an influential international organisation was a "provocation". "I have not been in the US Embassy for several months and I was not even present at the meeting with US President Bill Clinton in Spaso House on December 14 although I was invited to it", Fedorov said. He added that he would now focus on his work as State Duma deputy to draft lawbills boosting reforms.
