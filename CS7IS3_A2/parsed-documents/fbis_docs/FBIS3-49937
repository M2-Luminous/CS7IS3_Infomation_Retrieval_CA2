In Han i Elezit border crossing between Macedonia and Kosova, there were crowds of people waiting to go through the border crossing. As ATA correspondent in Pristina Belul Jashari reports, another wave of expulsion of Albanians has burst out in Kosova recently. To this end several socalled "Tourism agencies" are involved which carry out the strategy of Serbs' genocide for ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosova. The wave of Albanians' expulsion was instigated by Serbs' violence and repression to expel Albanians before January 15 when entry visas will be used in the Czech Republic, which is the principal station of Albanian emigrants from Kosova. From there the Kosovar emigrants move to Western European countries. According to the data of the Human Rights Defence Council in Pristina, more than 350 thousand Albanians have been expelled from Kosova.
