The ROK and the United States agreed in principle to the deployment of Patriot missiles in December 1993 when sanctions on the North were being seriously discussed due to North Korea's persistent negative stance toward the resolution of the nuclear issue. The two countries began to disagree, however, about the need for the deployment of Patriot missiles after North Korea accepted International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections on 15 February. By formalizing the issue of the deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula, in addition to the military preparation for the possibility of North Korea's southward provocation, the U.S. Government used the deployment as a warning to North Korea that a southward provocation should not be attempted and as a political and diplomatic demonstration that the United States can enforce UN sanctions on North Korea. On the other hand, public opinion in the ROK have focused on political problems, rather than military effectiveness, citing that Patriot missiles are not appropriate for Korean peninsula's terrain and have very low accuracy. ROK media emphasized concern that in addition to such military defects, the deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula might arouse negative effects on the acceptance of nuclear inspections by agitating North Korea. In addition, it was strongly suspected that the United States was trying to sell inefficient weapons to the ROK at a high price. In this regard, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visited the United States on 10 February and asked U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry to postpone the decision on the deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula until after the IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 February. When North Korea notified the IAEA of its willingness to accept nuclear inspections on 15 February, Minister Han proclaimed in Washington that the deployment of Patriot missiles should be reconsidered and the issue has since become an issue of disagreement on a full scale. Before and after Minister Han's remarks, the U.S. Defense Department revealed that it will not consider the ROK Government's opinion by raising the objection that the deployment of Patriot missiles is purely a military issue that cannot become an issue in political negotiations and by expressing its intention to separate the Patriot missile issue from political issues. Before North Korea announced its acceptance of nuclear inspections, the ROK and U.S. Governments agreed that the deployment of the missiles was politically and militarily appropriate. After the notification of the acceptance of nuclear inspections, however, differences in positions emerged because the United States stressed military reasons, while the ROK stressed the Patriots were not needed for political reasons. The U.S. Defense Department is stressing that the deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula has become a major issue because it was reported by the media at the same time the North Korean nuclear issue became an urgent matter. Actually, the deployment has nothing to do with the nuclear inspections in North Korea. The U.S. stance is that the deployment is part of the plan to establish the Theater Missile Defense system connecting the ROK and Japan -- which was planned in 1991 long before the North Korean nuclear issue emerged -- when North Korea concluded the development of Nodong No. 1 missile. The fact that the United States is pushing ahead with the deployment of Patriot missiles at the same time North Korea has accepted nuclear inspections appears it is a strong sales motive to make a final pitch in the prolonged effort to sell Patriot missiles to the ROK, thus taking advantage of the situation. This is the time for the United States to consider the fact that if they overly stress the sale of Patriot missiles, while the U.S. Army has already selected ERINT [extended-range interceptor missile] as the next-generation interceptor missile instead of Patriots, it may weaken ROK-U.S. security cooperation.
