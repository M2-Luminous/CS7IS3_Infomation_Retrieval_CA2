The higher prices of retail commodities, which have prevailed since the beginning of this year, is unprecedented for many year. If we fail to adopt strong and effective measures to readjust or control them, the continuously excessive price hikes in markets certainly will affect the economic construction and the people's normal lives. It should be said that governments at all levels throughout the province have attached great importance on the work of commodity prices. They have issued many legal documents to prevent from rising prices and collecting fees arbitrarily each year and spent more than 20 million of financial revenues on curbing the price hikes. Over the past three months, the provincial people's government has organized two mass inspections over commodity prices throughout the province, in which it discovered more than 500 price violation cases as well as confiscated the illegal profits and imposed on fines that total 1.57 million yuan. Although the results scored in the inspections conducted with all methods, including economic, legal, and administrative ones, are obvious; the evil trend of rising commodity prices and collecting fees arbitrarily has not been totally rooted out. As soon as the mass inspection has been over, the prices of the necessities of the people's lives, such as rice and cooking oil, are still being risen again and again. The price tags issued in a unified way for many commodities have been replaced with the self-made ones with exorbitant prices. Nobody cares the price maximum and relevant price regulations issued by the governments at all levels. Since the enforcement of reform and opening up over the past more than 10 years, the economic construction has gone ahead by leaps and bounds and the demands of the people's lives have increased day by day. Adequate price hikes under such a situation may stimulate the commodity production and are favorable for the country's construction and the people's lives. However, excessive price hikes will surpass the masses' bearing; curtail the consumption, and lead to the withering of commodity production. They will not only affect the livelihood of consumers but also directly affect the producer and dealers of commodities, as well as will damage the social stability. As for excessive price hikes, not only China but also developed capitalist countries will not sit by idly and remain indifferent and they will be able to adopt economic, legal, and administrative means to meddle them. Many commodity dealers have contended that relaxing the restrictions on commodity prices means to ask prices at will. Thus, they have become price violators again and again. Therefore, abiding by the price regulations set by the government, running business legally, and consciously safeguarding the price order represent the duty exercised by every dealer. The price departments should strictly investigate and handle the price violations. It is unfortunate that there are only more than 10,000 work personnel in the price departments throughout the province. Successfully managing the market prices requires the joint efforts made the relevant departments and the masses. They should jointly conduct comprehensive management of commodity prices as they did for public security. For example, the departments of industry and commerce, tax affairs, and quality inspection at all levels, should concurrently take up the work of price management. The mass organizations and communities, such as women's federations and trade unions, should enliven their contingents of staff members and workers to conduct price supervision. Consumers should actively supervise the market prices. Only by so doing are the price violation dealers unable to avail themselves of loopholes and can we fundamentally deal with the problems of rising prices and collecting fees arbitrarily and truly and successfully manage the market prices.
