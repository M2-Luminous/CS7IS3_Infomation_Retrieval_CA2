The development of the economic zone around the Tuman River, which finds its way to the East Sea, is still merely a plan without any clear prospect for investments although it has been promoted by the UNDP [United Nations Development Project]. The Sinuiju development plan is, however, likely to be realized soon and produce visible results because this area is connected with China's West Sea economic zone, which is under a full-scale development. This fact draws public attention. People are interested, in particular, in the possibility that North Korea will partially introduce the Chinese-style opening policy because the opening of Sinuiju is going to be promoted in relation with China's opening policy. In fact, rumors on the development of Sinuiju began last year, and have been popular for a long time among people in Dandong, the Chinese city across Sinuiju, at the other side of the sea, but there was no way to confirm it. Real facts of the rumor began to emerge as North Korea recently set out its second-stage opening plan in a full scale. North Korea opened the Najin-Sonbong area on 28 December 1991 according to Decree No. 74 of the State Administration Council. Thus, the three North Korean ports along the East Sea coast, including Chongjin located in this area, are now open. When Sinuiju and Nampo open in the second stage, North Korea will have open areas in, both, the East and West Sea coasts. In spite of this fact, we could not realize North Korea's opening up because of the deadlocked North Korean nuclear issue and because of no visible progress in the plan to develop the Tuman River area, including Sonbong and Najin, due to the contradiction in interests of the countries concerned. Moreover, North Korea has been very cautious of the Chinese-style way of opening up based on the socialist market economy, and it was hard to believe that North Korea would really open the West Sea area -- its opening would inevitably be related with China -- under the situation in which relations between the two countries became delicate because of the North Korean nuclear issue. North Korea, however, could not help but seek its way in the changing situation represented by the collapse of the Soviet Union and East Europe and China's reform and opening up. North Korea finally worked out a "region-lockout opening policy [kukchi pyeswoehyong kaebangchaek]" as a means to protect its system from the shock caused by the opening up as well as to break the economic deadlock. This policy was experimentally applied to the Najin-Sonbong area. The policy is aimed at preventing the wind from an open area from blowing over to other areas by completely banning the people's contacts with open areas and by having unfaithful residents in open areas and those in the region neighboring an open area move out. North Korea forced residents in the region around Najin and Sonbong to move out and replaced some of them, and now is reportedly having the residents of Puksinuiju move out. Why has North Korea worked out this opening policy internally although the nuclear issue, externally, is running into a tougher phase? Public interest is focused on this. Some people guess that though it assumes a nuclear confrontation policy, North Korea is well aware that it has no choice but taking a line of peaceful coexistence based on economic exchanges. It can be said that the opening of Sonbong, Najin, and five cities for border trade with China is nothing but preliminary arrangements for the second-stage opening of Sinuiju and Nampo. Sinuiju is as important to North Korea as Pusan is to the ROK. This border city competes with China's Dandong and Donggou. This city can play a role in beefing up North Korea's opening up. This city has abundant hydraulic power (Supung power station), abundant water supply, and the railway system, and is convenient for maritime and river navigation. A pipeline for oil, which China exceptionally supplies to its brotherly country [North Korea], runs from the Daqing oil field to the Pakchon refinery via a bottom section of the Yalu River in front of Sinuiju. Needless to day, Sinuiju's industries, including the textile industry, are important to North Korea. China, a world-class base of non-ferrous metals, is developing borax, magnesium, talcum, and graphite. Japanese trading corporations have so far been making profits by re-exporting these minerals to the ROK. Dandong has an international airport directly linked to Hong Kong; Shanghai; and Beijing; and the Donggou port, where four 40,000-tonne boats can berth simultaneously, is nearby. Therefore, Dandong is equipped with all conditions for development. Dandong was formerly Andong. A historic irony is that the military airport, railway, bridges, and roads which were used when the Chinese Army was invading the Korean peninsula are now being used for opening North Korea and promoting exchange with North Korea. China seems to believe that if it links China's three northeastern provinces [Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang] in which Shenyang is a central city, Dandong, Dalian, and Donggou to Sinuiju, this will contribute to developing the Yellow Sea sphere, unlocking North Korea's economic potential, promoting regional economic cooperation with the ROK, and, thus, promoting stability on the Korean peninsula. It is presently far from certain that North Korea will further open up. Still, indications have appeared that North Korea is moving toward carrying out practical economic policies. And, the opening of Sinuiju must be assessed in this context.
