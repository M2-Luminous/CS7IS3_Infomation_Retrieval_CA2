The sources said that two officers of the U.N. commission, one from Great Britain and one from Belgium, independently came to the conclusion that the shell had been fired from the Moslem side. The ballistics experts sent the report to the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), but the document apparently got side-tracked somewhere along the way, the sources said. The sources told TANJUG that the White House also had a copy of this report. The French television network TF-1 recently broadcast a report by its New York correspondent which mentioned the UNPROFOR report blaming the Moslems for the massacre. The official UNPROFOR report on the massacre, which killed 68 civilians and wounded around 200 according to Moslem media, said that it was not possible to establish the guilty party. THE WASHINGTON POST said on Tuesday that the shell which caused the massacre at the Sarajevo market, judging from its effects, could have come from the Moslem side. This article is the first of its kind in a major U.S. newspaper which even allows for the possibility that Bosnian Serbs were not responsible for the massacre. The massacre triggered NATO to issue an ultimatum and demand that Bosnian Serbs and Moslems withdraw or place under UNPROFOR control their heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo or face air strikes. Western politicians and media, however, interpreted this as an ultimatum and threat to Serbs, urging only them to honour the NATO ultimatum.
