FR941007-0-00072 FR941007-0-00020 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Transit Administration 49 CFR Part 604 Charter Service Regulation; Technical Amendment AGENCY: Federal Transit Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final Rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY: This document amends the Federal Transit Administration Charter Service Regulation by extending the charter service demonstration program mandated by section 3040 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) through October 31, 1995. This extension has been granted in order to accommodate several participants in the demonstration program, who consider that the initial demonstration period is inadequate. It will allow both public and private operators to participate in the program over two summer and two winter periods, thereby providing FTA with more substantive data on which to base its evaluation of the effectiveness of the program. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rita Daguillard, Deputy Assistant Chief Counsel, FTA Office of Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1936. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A final rule published in the Federal Register on July 9, 1993 (58 FR 36894) established a charter services demonstration program which would allow transit operators to meet the needs of government, civic, charitable and other community activities, as directed by section 3040 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Under the program, recipients in eight sites within four states are allowed to provide direct charter service as determined by local officials. The rule provided that the demonstration program would be conducted from August 9, 1993, to August 9, 1994. Because of specific local circumstances, however, certain participants were unable to begin their demonstration programs on the effective date of August 9, 1993. In order to provide these participants with a full 12-month implementation period, FTA published, on October 12, 1993, a technical amendment extending the program through October 31, 1994 (58 FR 52684). In May 1994, the American Public Transit Association (APTA), on behalf of several transit agencies participating in the demonstration program, requested a further extension to allow both public and private operators to participate in the program over two summer and two winter periods. APTA indicated that the extension would provide FTA with more complete data upon which to base both its evaluation of the program and the report and recommendations to Congress on the charter regulation mandated by section 3040(c) of ISTEA. Section 3040 of ISTEA provides that the demonstration program should be established in consultation with both public and private operators. To this end, FTA developed the program in consultation with an advisory committee convened for that purpose, and composed of an equal number of representatives of the public and private sectors. Since some private operators in the demonstration sites are likely to be affected by the extension of the program, FTA forwarded copies of APTA's request to all of the private sector members of the advisory committee for comment. The majority of committee members responding to FTA's request for comments were favorable to an extension of the demonstration program. Moreover, FTA agrees that extending the demonstration would allow the collection of more substantive data on which to base its evaluation of the program. Accordingly, FTA hereby extends the charter service demonstration program for an additional 12-month period, ending on October 31, 1995. All transit agencies participating in the program may provide charter services in conformance with 49 CFR 604.9(b)(8) during this period. Regulatory Impacts and Assurances A. Executive Order 12866 The Department ha determined that this proposed rule is not subject to review under Executive Order 12866. Moreover, the rule is not significant under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; Feb. 26, 1979). Since this final rule makes only technical amendments to current regulatory language, it is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), as added by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, FTA certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Act. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. D. Federalism This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12612 on Federalism and FTA has determined that it does not have implications for principles of Federalism that warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. If promulgated, this rule will not limit the policy making or administrative discretion of the States, nor will it impose additional costs or burdens on the States, nor will it affect the States' abilities to discharge the traditional State governmental functions or otherwise affect any aspect of State sovereignty.
