FR940602-0-00037 FR940602-0-00015 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 48 CFR Parts 1601, 1602, 1609, 1615, 1632, 1642, 1646, and 1652 RIN 3206&hyph;AE67 Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation; Miscellaneous Changes AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: On March 30, 1994, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published a final rule that amended certain provisions of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation (FEHBAR). The regulations were effective immediately upon publication and OPM intended that they would apply for the first time to the 1995 FEHB contract (rate) year. Upon publication, we found two references in the Supplementary Information Section with regard to the effective date that we believe will be confusing to FEHB carriers. We are publishing the following corrections to clarify our intent and eliminate the ambiguity. In the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section beginning on 59 FR 14761, in the issue of Wednesday, March 30, 1994, make the following corrections: (1) On page 14762, in the 2nd column, the first full paragraph, in the fifth line, ``1994'' should read ``1995.'' (2) On page 14763, in the lst column, the first full paragraph, last sentence should read, ``These regulations will be in effect beginning with the 1995 rate year.'' Office of Personnel Management.
