[Mesic] The Council of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ], just like the leadership of any other party, can and must discuss all problems in foreign and domestic policy. And it is not strange at all that the Council analyzed some of Manolic's performances. However, the debate did not give a single indication that the exclusion or punishment of Manolic might be demanded. Only three members demanded that Manolic be excluded. Everything else was within the limits of a principled debate. [Erceg] Who are those three members? [Mesic] Antun Vrdoljak, Ivan Milas, and Ivic Pasalic. At the end, President Tudjman concluded that the Manolic case should still be brought up in the Court of Honor. Even that could be accepted as a part of the democratic procedure, and a right of the party's chairman to make such a decision. [Erceg] What was the debate at the meeting of the Council like? Did you support Manolic's attitudes? [Mesic] I referred in my speech to the attitude that the issue of Bosnia was a difficulty for both the great powers and the European Community, but now, when we have the Washington agreement, everybody has to take the consequences for his or her earlier policy, and that is it. When the president demanded that Manolic go to the Court of Honor, I thought that would be the end of the issue. Moreover, President Tudjman invited us all to a lunch. I did not join them for the lunch, because a meeting of the Assembly was to start at the same time. And then everything, which is so far away from any democracy, started. Lunch at Tudjman's [Ercog] When did you realize that the invitation to the lunch was actually an invitation to something completely different? [Mesic] At the time when Manolic and I reached the Assembly, the action of his removal from the office of chairman of the Chamber of Counties was already going on, despite the conclusion of the Council that the Court of Honor was supposed to meet only later! When we arrived at the Assembly, we heard that some signatures were being collected, and who was collecting them. [Ercog] Who was collecting them? [Mesic] Vrdoljak and Milas were engaged from the beginning, and then Pasalic and Jure Radic joined them. The issue is about an action that reminds me of a sort of enlightened bolshevism, and I cannot accept that. For it means that, while we were sitting in the Council, somebody sent a message that the action should start. [Ercog] Somebody means President Tudjman, does not it? [Mesic] I do not know that, but if he had been against it, he could have stopped it. He still can stop it, and call to account those who took to themselves a right to ignore the Court of Honor. Of course, the question is raised how that group in the Assembly came to know what the HDZ Council had decided, since there are no letters, written statements.... This means that an underground connection provided the information, and all that has nothing to do with democracy. [Ercog] It is being claimed that 36 signatures have been collected against Manolic. [Mesic] Which method did they use to obtain those signatures? Who charged them with doing that, and on whose behalf? The Council did not make such a decision, while the HDZ club is not the place where the policy of the party is designed. Everything that was done is illegal, and somebody has to take the consequences for that! [Ercog] Do you share the opinion that there is a parliamentary crisis in Croatia? [Mesic] Basically yes, although it does not necessarily have to continue, unless it is insisted upon. The cause of the crisis is to be found in the fact that the internal conflict in one party has reflected itself in the work of the parliament. Of course, that may cause a deeper parliamentary crisis. Because, look, a meeting of the Assembly has been announced for Thursday, but prior to the meeting we have to get the approval from the Chamber of Counties with regard to certain laws. If the Chamber of Counties fails to meet, or its work is blocked again, then neither will the Chamber of Representatives be able to function, and the entire work of the parliament will be called into question. Early Elections? [Ercog] In that case, will early elections possibly be taken into consideration? [Mesic] If the crisis continues, early elections will be inevitable. [Ercog] Milas persistently maintains that the majority of the parliamentarians lost their confidence in Manolic a long time ago. [Mesic] Everybody has a right to struggle for his or her opinion, and to disagree with Manolic's opinion. A right of the parliamentarians is also to say and undertake whatever actions they want, but regardful of the Assembly procedure. However, we have reached the stage where a university professor is used, namely Smiljko Sokolj, who publicly, in front of the TV audience, does not speak the truth, who misconstrues the essence of the dispute. I am a jurist as well, and I have checked out the document that the group demanding the removal of Manolic brandished all over the place. All that is stated there is a demand, written in a commanding manner, that a commission should be called, while everything else are illegible signatures. Civility, rather than law, demands that it should be written as follows: We would appreciate it if a meeting of the Commission were to be called... we propose that the following issue be put on the agenda... and also that the deputies who make that demand should put their signatures next to their typed names, so it can be seen that those are authentic signatures. We are not living in a dictatorship, for God's sake.... Instead, scandalous violence has been applied that discloses the uniformity of opinions. I said already 100 times that I shall never accept to put up with the uniformity of opinions again, and now it is being imposed on me again. And when I only think about who is doing that.... [Ercog] Was it not natural, and what was obviously expected by Manolic himself, that after the Washington agreement, those who are responsible for the breakout of the Muslim-Croatian conflict should be removed from political functions? [Mesic] It would be normal if everybody were to take the consequences for his or her earlier policies, because the people are neither mentally retarded, nor are they politically ignorant. The people know all too well which policy any of us supported. I still stick to my principle that names should not be publicly named, but I have a right to perceive certain occurrences, and consequently, those who brought about those occurrences as well. [Ercog] Do you think that it is his public disagreement with the policy of President Tudjman, particularly with the policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina, that was fatal for Manolic? Do you personally agree with Manolic? [Mesic] Manolic is a man who had entered politics as a principled fighter for democracy and the lawful state. If the lawful state does not function, somebody has to be called to account. The same attitude is also toward the Croatian policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Manolic rightfully raises the question of who made the decision on the opening of the concentration camps in Bosnia. It is not sufficient to say that the other warring faction also had such camps. That is no justification. Let us see who made the decision. Who passed the regulations on the behavior in the camps, who is to blame for the conditions there? Who made decisions on that? Somebody had to make decisions on that, as well as the decision that a conflict with Muslims should be triggered. And when the conflict broke out, why was not a way out sought in negotiations? No, the efforts were made only to make the conflict escalate. All these questions urged Manolic to demand that accountability for that policy be established, and that the names of the guilty parties be made public. He has never been in a personal conflict with Gojko Susak, but all Manolic demands is that occurrences and their protagonists be identified, and that they be called to account. Vrdoljak's Announcement [Ercog] Did you expect this attack against, until yesterday, the second most important official in the country to happen? [Mesic] First I have to say that Manolic is so independent that he never consults with anybody. So it is first you and your newspaper that learned about his latest performance, while as for myself, I knew there would be reactions as soon as I read the interview in the FERAL TRIBUNE. In the first place because President Tudjman often emphasized that Susak is his best HDZ member, and one of the best ministers. I supposed that the president would try to protect Susak. However, the way in which that group tried to make use of Manolic's criticism equals the most magnificent moments of bolshevik persecutions at the time of Stalin. [Ercog] Why did not President Tudjman ever defend you and your dignity from the attacks by your party colleagues in the way he is defending Susak now? [Mesic] You know, Branimir Glavas said of me that I was a personification of evil, while -- conditionally said -- Vrdoljak said, following my warning at a parliamentary meeting that he ought to calm down, that he did not talk with the politically dead. And nothing happened! Nobody calls him to account, although I am the chairman of the parliament. Is that not interesting? Which means, an entire group of HDZ members is involved in the defense of one man by attacking Manolic, while in view of everything else that other people were told -- and many offensive things were said -- nothing has ever been done about it. [Ercog] Will the issue result in the creation of some more room for hawks, and even for the possible continuation of purges? [Mesic] I expect that the supporters of Manolic will be the main target now. All those who want to square accounts with somebody will be finding Manolic's supporters in their towns, firms, neighborhoods,.... Just like at the time of the most rigid communism. I am afraid of that, and it would be really good if that could be possibly avoided. [Ercog] Do you think that the time for doing away with you has come? [Mesic] I think it has. Particularly in view of the fact that Vrdoljak has already announced that by calling me a politically dead person, and he is usually very well informed. Many Are Intimidated [Ercog] If Manolic still offers his resignation, will you stay in the office of the chairman of the Assembly? [Mesic] Manolic is not going to resign, and therefore I am remaining in office. [Ercog] There are many other mechanisms of elimination. [Mesic] Yes, there are, but the democratic ones, and that process is quite long, you know.... [Ercog] Do you believe that President Tudjman will stick to his attitude in this situation, or is he going to make yet another of his political turns? [Mesic] I want to believe that the president will call to account all those who have gone for such a vulgar way of squaring accounts with opponents, and that the tensions will ease off. If that were not to be that way.... [Ercog] Would you then join the party the foundation of which has been announced by Manolic? [Mesic] Manolic is a co-founder of the HDZ platform that suited me at the time. If Joza [Manolic] proposes a new platform that proffers much more, I will certainly think about that. [Ercog] What has been the reaction in the world to this sort of onslaught on the Croatian Parliament? [Mesic] I have received many inquiring letters from many colleagues from the European parliaments, as well as from our citizens from abroad. For all of them it has been quite unexpected, and many feel intimidated. I told them the same as I have told you. I repeat that a vulgar, bolshevik-style attack has been undertaken against Manolic. I do not know who approved it, but do not worry, I shall bring that issue up for discussion at the next meeting of the HDZ Council. [Ercog] Are you afraid of a possible turn toward dictatorship? [Mesic] I shall bring the issues we have talked about up in the Council, and after that you shall see what kind of conversation we shall be carrying on, and if we shall be able to carry on any at all.
