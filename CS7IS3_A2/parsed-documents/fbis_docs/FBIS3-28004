IAEA officials pointed out that even if an inspection team leaves for Pyongyang at the end of this week, there is not enough time for even submitting a preliminary report to the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. The IAEA officials said that North Korea has assumed a firm stance on a third round of IAEA-North Korea negotiation for nuclear inspections. They stressed, however, that the IAEA has not yet given up all hope and that the door is still open for North Korea.
