The document that was drafted by party leader Scharping and his "shadow ministers" Oskar Lafontaine and Peter Glotz represents a departure from the SPD's former ideas of a research that is independent of the economy. The memorandum explicitly states that the economy should be granted "more influence on the priorities" in large research institutions. The state and the economy are not living in different worlds, and competition requires a "new understanding of the industry" and "coordination and concerted economic efforts by the economy and the state." Glotz, who is responsible for research, education, and media for Scharping's team, announced that, after an election victory, the SPD wants to introduce regular talks between the economy and the state similar to the ones of the Clinton-Gore Administration. Independent advisers should participate. The document that was presented was also prepared after talks with all major organizations in the sphere of science and economy, Glotz pointed out. The SPD criticized the decline of the research budget, which was still 2.8 percent of the entire budget under Helmut Schmidt, and which has now dropped to below 2 percent. Yesterday Scharping described this as a "serious mistake in the field of economy and research" which has weakened Germany's attractiveness as an economic base. The research budget lacks a "consistent industrial orientation that would make the goal of winning new growth markets over the medium term realistic," the document reads. Referring to the nomination of new ministers for research and education -- Minister Krueger (Christian Democratic Union) and Minister Laermann (Free Democratic Party of Germany), the SPD criticized that the government considers these areas as "switchyards of secondary importance." Scharping spoke of a "respectable but unprofessional research minister." Within the framework of its investment program, the SPD wants to promote particularly the medium-sized enterprises. Thus, risk capital is to be provided for young and capital-intensive technological enterprises. Tax privileges for future-oriented investments are to be introduced, and permit procedures are to be shortened. Germany needs a "new period of promoterism," Glotz stated. The SPD called on the present government to go back on its decision to cut the research budget by 250 million German marks [DM] and to increase the funds for research and the construction of universities in the new laender. If the government should not comply with this wish, an SPD-led government will adopt these measures. Scharping stated that another billion marks for future- oriented research should not be a problem in view of a total budget of DM480 billion.
