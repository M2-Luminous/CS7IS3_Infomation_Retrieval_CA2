As a matter of fact, he repeated the same things he had said at a meeting with the staff of the Minsk pharmaceutical plant on the previous day. Also addressed at the meeting were today's most urgent problems. "We have lost control over our Republic." With this sad remark, the chairman began his analysis of the current situation. He is convinced that the lack of control will be remedied when Belarus defines its political system (Belarus and Tajikistan are the only former republics of the USSR not to have done so yet), and the presidential office is instituted. Presidential elections could be held as early as June, and if the results are positive, the Supreme Soviet elections might be held another three months later. The president will form a government that will be approved by the new legislature. All these changes should be based on a new constitution and electoral law. As the chairman noted, the Supreme Soviet Presidium has already drafted such a law. Should the current Supreme Soviet be unable to adopt these documents, Mechyslaw Hryb does not rule out the possibility of holding a referendum. He is convinced that it is impossible to continue with the old Constitution. The local soviet elections should complete the political reforms in the spring of 1995. As the chairman emphasized, the advantages of this scheme are a consistency of reforms, no power vacuum during the various stages of the process, and eventually a strong vertical power structure. Although his comments on the current problems were rather brief, they were quite specific. For example, Mechyslaw Hryb completely supports economic union with Russia and the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, because he does not see any other possible way of saving our economy and agricultural sector, which are in worse shape than their equivalents to the east. He believes that the Supreme Soviet and its Presidium should not dodge urgent economic problems or pass the buck to the Cabinet of Ministers. Regarding relations with the government, Mechyslaw Hryb supports friendly cooperation, and believes that the confrontation "which has been seen lately," must be halted. Following his meeting with the kolkhoz staff, the Supreme Soviet chairman answered the following questions from a NARODNAYA GAZETA reporter. [Reporter] Yesterday, you discussed supplies of pharmaceuticals, and today you are dealing with agricultural problems. What results can the people expect from these "spot checks" by the new state leader? [Hryb] It is very helpful to hear people speaking personally about their problems -- it is easier to find one's bearings and look for appropriate solutions. Regarding pharmaceuticals, I have come to the conclusion that it is better to define the groups of the most essential drugs, and concentrate our attention on them. Unless we concentrate on developing our pharmaceutical industry, drugs will be very expensive in Belarus, because we are still a far way from achieving Western standards of living. [Reporter] Yesterday it was health care, today it is agriculture. There are, however, more problems. What, in your opinion, must be solved first and foremost? [Hryb] I have already said -- we must define our political system, no matter which direction we orient ourselves -- West, East, South, or North. If we do not unite and restore discipline and order, we will get nowhere. Our people do not listen to anybody today. [Reporter] When our paper is published on 15 February, strikers will be gathering in Independence Square, putting forward some very tough political demands. What would you like to tell them? [Hryb] I have already explained that I am generally against strikes. I am for solving problems diplomatically. If you have problems, let us sit down at the negotiating table and look for solutions. Every strike is an attempt to forcibly affect the results of talks. Of course, everybody has the right to express their opinion, but what will a strike bring? I see the solution as lying in the economic union and unification of monetary systems. Will a political strike advance this? I doubt it. On the contrary, it will push us even further away from it. However, if the strike is held in accordance with the law, I will have no right to ban it.... [Reporter] You do not rule out the possibility of sitting down at the negotiating table with the strikers? [Hryb] No, I do not. There is only one "but".... We should respect one another. Nobody has yet called them criminals, as they are doing, for example, with regard to the government. Excuse me, but only a court is allowed to call someone a criminal. [Reporter] The proposals for political reform that you voiced yesterday and today reflect the position of the Supreme Soviet Presidium. Was this position unequivocal, or were other opinions voiced? [Hryb] The members of the Presidium were unequivocal, at least those who participated in the meeting. We decided that we should define our stance on all those issues -- the presidential and early legislative elections. We should not delay them any longer. We will try to convince the deputies to give us support. [Reporter] There is an option of holding presidential elections at the Supreme Soviet, not in a nationwide ballot. What is your attitude toward this? [Hryb] I know about this alternative, but I advocate nationwide elections. This, though, will depend on our decision on the political system. If we become a parliamentary republic, the president, as everybody knows, will have to be elected at a Supreme Soviet session -- there will be no sense in holding nationwide elections. Nevertheless, I am for a strong, democratically elected president, and I hope that the Supreme Soviet will support me on this. [end Hryb] On the eve of the meeting with the kolkhoz workers and this interview, Mechyslaw Hryb was shown the working conditions of milkers and machine operators, and visited a kindergarten and high school in the village of Petkavichy.
