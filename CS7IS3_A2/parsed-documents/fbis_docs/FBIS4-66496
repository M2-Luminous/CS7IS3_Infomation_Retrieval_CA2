Is there fear that the move will be from the Israeli military censor to a Palestinian censor controlling our domestic press? These are notions and questions that occur to the mind of the occupied territories' press workers who hope that the coming phase will be a phase of openness and free expression that compensates Palestinians for the deprivation they have endured in the preceding phase. Here, I will record the visions and expectations of a number of specialists and workers in the Palestinian press. Journalist Majid 'Aruri, from Sanabil Press Bureau in Ramallah, believes that the Palestinian press has been restricted, even before the arrival of autonomy. In addition to the Israeli military censor's control, Palestinian organizations have experienced control over most of the press publications issued in the occupied territories. The Palestinian journalist has not been able to offer press analyses and reports conflicting with the tendencies of the existing political organizations. The other papers (AL-QUDS and AL-NAHAR) have been characterized by their neutral presentation, which imposes restrictions on any critical press material, especially material addressed to the official circles. Despite the liberalism it has displayed in the past two years, AL-NAHAR does not allow any articles it publishes to criticize Jordan. Therefore, any paper controlled by the party that finances it during the occupation era will continue to experience the same problem under the autonomous authority, which will also take control of censorship and of issuing permits to publish papers. Thus, autonomy will employ its authority to prevent the emergence of any voices that criticize autonomy. This task will be easy in the absence of a press union body capable of confronting this policy. The union body (i.e., the Journalists League) is controlled and dominated by the tendency supporting self-rule, even though it incorporates other parties. However, these parties' role is ineffective and not influential. Journalist 'Ali Jiddah from AL-QUDS newspaper has said: "Very regrettably, I say that in the coming phase, the Palestinian press will not be in a better condition than its current condition, not to say that it will be in a more difficult condition. I say this by virtue of my full awareness of the Palestinian forces' miserable history of democratic action. Moreover, the coming government will focus its efforts on cementing and entrenching the mainstays of its rule, which necessarily means that it will try to curb the voice and echo of the forces that are likely to pose a threat to this government and to its authority. "I assert that this is what will happen in the future, especially since the statements of some Palestinian officials point in this direction. I will particularly note Hakam Bal'awi's statements on how the opposition will be dealt with in the future." Dr. 'Abd-al-Sattar Qasim, from the Political Science Section of al-Najah University, has said: "Future press freedom is tied to the Gaza-Jericho accord, i.e., it is tied to the degree of freedom permitted by the accord. Freedom is restricted by the provisions of the accord. For example, it isn't permissible to incite against Israel. The Palestinian government will have to respect this tendency. Else, it will violate the accord. "Therefore, there will be a Palestinian censor. If one doesn't exist, Israel will insist on his presence, keeping in mind that a Palestinian censor is operating now while the occupation exercises its own censorship. So, how will the situation be in case a government overseeing daily life is established!" Journalist Hani al-'Isawi from Jerusalem has said: "I don't believe that there will be an independent Palestinian government if the accord is implemented. What will be there is a civil administration controlled by the occupation. At best, it will be the authority of one individual who establishes laws compatible with his interests and plans. This is why one cannot talk about any form of freedom under the canopy of a self-rule like the rule projected currently. "I believe that the current military censor watches press material from the security angle. But if there is press under self-rule, it will be a yellow press, i.e., government press solely. It is feared that whoever violates this [rule] will be pursued. Therefore, there will be no need for a special press censor, because all agencies under autonomy will be in the service of government propaganda solely." Journalist Ghazi Bani 'Awdah has said: "I don't believe that press conditions under the self-rule government will be fundamentally different from the current conditions. All signs indicate in one way or another that oppression and persecution will be the lot of any voice or pen that writes about real issues and that doesn't sing the praises of autonomy and doesn't applaud the cardboard feats and accomplishments of the coming leadership. Let us learn a lesson from the recent expulsion of Hijazi, a journalist, from FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH and from numerous other incidents. "As for censorship, there is no doubt that the coming Palestinian authority's censor will `capably' replace the Israeli censor, even though materials affected by this `censor's scissors' will be different at times from materials affected under the occupation." Journalist Amin Abu-Wardah from AL-QUDS PRESS AGENCY believes that "the Palestinian people's hardship in all fields dictates that any authority that takes control of the reigns avoid whatever can touch the wounds of all Palestinian people and whatever undermines the sanctity of the individual who has taken part in the ceaseless struggle to attain his rights and who has made great sacrifices for these rights. "This is why I expect, optimistically, great openness in the press. But there is a founded fear of the future because of the numerous experiences of the Arab world where authoritarianism prevails despite all the raised slogans that have been proved to be a failure by reality. However, it is my hope that the Palestinian experiment will be distinguished by giving the opportunity to everybody to express his positions and opinions democratically."
