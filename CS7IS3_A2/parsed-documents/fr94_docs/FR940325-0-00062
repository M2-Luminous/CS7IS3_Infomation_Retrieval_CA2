FR940325-0-00062 FR940325-0-00014 The Service has consulted with the USDA regarding the addition of Gulfport, MS, Vancouver, WA, and Portland, OR, to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or CITES. Those consultations were necessary to determine whether the ports possess adequate facilities and personnel to carry out enforcement activities related to the Act and CITES. As a result of those consultations, the Service believes that Gulfport, MS, Vancouver, WA, and Portland, OR, could be added to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES. However, because they were not listed in the July 21, 1993, proposed rule, Gulfport, MS, Vancouver, WA, and Portland, OR, cannot be added to the list of designated ports in this final rule. Therefore, the Service intends to include those three ports in a new proposed rule for publication in the Federal Register . In this final rule, the Service has changed the order in which the ports are listed in new paragraph (e) of section 24.12. The ports are now listed in alphabetical order, by State, in order to simplify any future amendments to the paragraph. Requests for Public Hearing Section 9(f)(1) of the Act provides that any person may request an opportunity to comment at a public hearing before the Secretary of the Interior confers designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service's July 21, 1993, notice invited public hearing requests, which were required to be received by the Service on or before September 3, 1993. No such requests were received. Treasury Department Approval to Designate Proposed Ports Section 9(f)(1) of the Act also provides, in part that: ``For the purpose of facilitating enforcement of this chapter and reducing costs thereof, the Secretary of the Interior, with approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and after notice and opportunity for public hearing, may, by regulation, designate ports and change such designations.'' Approval from the Secretary of the Treasury was obtained in accordance with these provisions. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, the Service is adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule with the changes discussed in this document. Effective Date The effect of this rule is to grant an exemption from 16 U.S.C. 1538(f), which generally prohibits importation of wildlife and plants except at such ports as may be designated. Accordingly, it may be given immediate effect under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), which permits a rule that ``grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction'' to be given immediate effect. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. The Service believes that establishing the USDA ports at Mobile, AL, Savannah, GA, Baltimore, MD, Morehead City and Wilmington, NC, Philadelphia, PA, Charleston, SC, and Norfolk, VA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES will have a positive economic impact. These ports are major ports of entry for logs and lumber, but they had not been designated as ports for the importation of logs and lumber from listed trees. Before the effective date of this rule, importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a port on the east coast of the United States could use only Hoboken, NJ, or Miami, FL, and importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico could use only Brownsville and Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA. Establishing Mobile, AL, Savannah, GA, Baltimore, MD, Morehead City and Wilmington, NC, Philadelphia, PA, Charleston, SC, and Norfolk, VA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES will result in a savings in time and transportation costs for importers of logs and lumber. The Service also believes that establishing Wilmington, NC, as a designated port for the exportation of Venus flytrap plants will have a positive economic impact. The Venus flytrap occurs chiefly in North Carolina and also in South Carolina. Before the inclusion of the Venus flytrap in appendix II of CITES became effective on June 11, 1992, exporters of the Venus flytrap had been able to use Wilmington, NC, and other USDA ports for the exportation of their plants. After June 11, 1992, however, those exporters were required to send their plants through ports designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of listed plants, with Miami, FL, and Hoboken, NJ, being the closest such ports to North Carolina and South Carolina. Establishing Wilmington, NC, as a designated port for the exportation of Venus flytrap will result in a savings in time and transportation costs for exporters of the plant. Under these circumstances, the Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, as described in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).
