South African President Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years and has become the first black president of a multiracial and democratic South Africa, was given a rousing welcome as he entered the conference hall. Rwanda, with its hundreds of thousands of deaths and refugees, became the main topic of discussion at the opening session during which the Egyptian president handed over the OAU chairmanship to Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. General Eyadema, who is also attending the summit, saw his mediation efforts crowned with the reconciliation between Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state, who were at loggerheads over the Bakassi Peninsula. Kojovi Gbadayi reports from Tunis: [Begin recording] [Gbadayi] There were 42 African heads of state and monarchs present at the opening session of the 30th summit of the pan-African organization. Among these heads of state was President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who went to Tunis to make Togo's voice heard. The various speakers -- from President Ben Ali of Tunisia to President Mubarak of Egypt, passing through President Konan Bedie of Cote d'Ivoire and Nelson Mandela of South Africa, as well as UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- in turn called for the redress of Africa, the strengthening of mutual understanding, and inter-African cooperation. The main event of the day, however, was the meeting in the afternoon between Presidents Paul Biya of Cameroon and Sani Abacha of Nigeria. This is the first time that two heads of state, at loggerheads over their common border, are meeting at the initiative of President Eyadema. For several months now, the Togolese head of state has been devoting his efforts to reconciling the views of the Nigerian and Cameroonian leaders in order to arrive at the peaceful settlement of the conflict over Bakassi Island. The Abacha-Biya meeting was sanctioned by a joint communique, the French version of which was read by Cameroonian Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono: [Oyono] At the initiative of General Gnassingbe Eyadema, president of the Republic of Togo, President Paul Biya, president of the Republic of Cameroon and General Sani Abacha, president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria met in Tunis. The two heads of state examined the situation created by the territorial conflict between their two states. They agreed to set up a joint commission, under the auspices of the Togolese President in order to seek ways and means of finding a just and peaceful solution to the conflict, without resorting to the International Court of Justice. To this end, a meeting, to be preceded by a foreign ministers' conference, will take place within the next few weeks in Lome. [Gbadayi] The Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state embraced each other before leaving their host, Gen. Eyadema. President Eyadema had earlier in the morning received Rene Delaire, the French president's adviser on African affairs. [end recording]
