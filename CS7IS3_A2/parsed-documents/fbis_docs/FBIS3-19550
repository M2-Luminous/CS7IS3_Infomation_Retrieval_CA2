If we are united, have plans, vision and determination, and if we proceed, this can be a golden era for Hellenism, which has every capability to become an important regional economic force in the Balkans, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean. In this era, Hellenism has the capability to play its historic role, because it is situated at the crossroads of the North, South, East, and West. We have the capability to shape the world's cultural trends and once more influence political developments with the particular nature, originality, and expertise of Greek civilization and its principles. Hellenism today has the capability to proceed with united and planned collective security in the region and to secure its own defense. Hellenism today is alone capable of securing its own defense and independence. [passage omitted] The new world order has not yet shaped the form of collective security. We live in a transitional period, which will be long. It is very possible that our entire life will be spent in that transitional period. The new, balanced world system that will be born could come in time. We must accept that we live in an unstable and transitional period that is full of problems but also full of opportunities. It is very important to understand the dimensions of the world system being formulated so that we do not make the same mistakes we made in the past. We must understand the new dimensions so that we might make the right choices with planning and vision. [passage omitted] There are three basic issues that should constitute the basis of Hellenism's national strategy. Seeing things beyond today's difficulties, I think the three axis are the following: First, Hellenism's clear and firm European orientation. Second, a strong economic policy by Greece and Cyprus for economic cooperation in the Balkans, Black Sea countries, eastern Mediterranean, and Africa. Third, and in parallel with the first two, is the formulation of a defense policy that will cover Hellenism's unified area. The Cold War put Hellenism somewhere on the sidelines of European developments. This should change. Greece is today a firm member of the European Union, inside which it must fight for Greek issues. Greece's basic goal is and should be the immediate accession of Cyprus to the European Union. The Europeans should realize that Europe's border does not stop at Greece. Europe's border, its responsibility for collective security, ends at the independent Republic of Cyprus. Europe owes this to Hellenism because the Greek tradition forms its cultural and political base. But Europe also needs Greece and Cyprus' Hellenic element to compete with the other groups in the regions where Hellenism can be first, that is, the Balkans and Middle East. The fight may be hard. Greece was often isolated in the European Union while fighting the struggle for Cyprus. But we fight and we will win the struggle together, and in 1995 the issue of Cyprus' accession to the united Europe will at last come up so that Hellenism will not be mutilated and divided. It will be as it should be--one part of the European civilization and idea. The second issue we should follow is that of the great economic opportunities offered to Greece's region and to Greek business in small countries. There is another paradox: Whereas competition exists within big economic groups, new technology justifies the smaller countries operating within these groups. It benefits the versatile countries, the countries with business talents and those that can move quickly, to look into the future and take on the risks. We are reliving the economic opportunities that Hellenism had in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is Hellenism's golden opportunity to develop economic initiatives and cooperation throughout the Balkans and also in Eastern Europe, the Black Sea, the east Mediterranean, and North Africa. The move has already begun. Greek investment projects in Bulgaria are second only to Germany's. Significant openings have been made in Romania and further north, in Moldova. In addition, when the civil war in Yugoslavia ends, Greece will play a significant, dominant role in economic cooperation in the area. Closer to Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean, following the moves between Israel and the Arab countries, Cypriot Hellenism is in a good position to utilize the new possibilities for cooperation that are available in the Middle East. [passage omitted] Now I come to the third issue, defense. Nothing would be better for Hellenism than if we lived in a peaceful region, with no problem of security, and if we had general disarmament, because our civilization, our values, are based on the concepts of democracy, peace, and cooperation among free peoples. It is in this spirit that the president of the Republic of Cyprus was right, very right, to propose, in connection with the island's security, a general disarmament and the withdrawal of Turkish troops so that the people themselves may use other methods to solve their problems and live well. But this dream of peaceful coexistence remains a dream; the reality is different, a nightmare. Both Greece and Cyprus--two independent states but both Hellenic--make the correct appraisal that they face the common threat of Turkish expansionism. And, while we are building the future with optimism and economic cooperation with other peoples and the European Union, we have a duty to ourselves, a duty to our history, to protect Hellenism, to defend ourselves jointly. [passage omitted] When two states judge that they face a common threat, the least they must do--and woe betide them if they do not--is to coordinate their defense plans so that their defense cooperation can confront the threat more effectively. Speaking in the Chamber of Deputies, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said that any further advance of Turkey in Cyprus would be a casus belli for Greece. As long as there is a threat, it follows that our defense plans must be coordinated. The unified defense area is an answer to this need. But I would like to stress: Greece also has an increased responsibility toward Cyprus. According to the Zurich Agreement, Greece is a guarantor power for Cyprus and can do nothing but, as a guarantor power, guarantee the independence of the independent state of Cyprus, which is part of Hellenism. [applause] The defense doctrine is a clearly defensive concept. I repeat: Had there been no threat, had there been no illegal occupation of part of Cyprus by Turkish troops, who, despite the many UN resolutions have not withdrawn from Cyprus, had there been no forceful demographic change caused by the [Turkish] settlers, then the issue might have been different. But the threat exists and the defense doctrine, the unified defense area, is an attempt to restore the balance so that the feeling of security may be consolidated within Cypriot Hellenism in that Cyprus is not an open range, that all the Greeks [applause] are together with the Cypriots. In times of danger we are all Cypriots. [applause] Serious work has already been done in the unified defense area, which was announced by Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis last November. The Cypriot defense minister's visit to Athens followed and we held discussions on a specific basis. Serious preparatory work has been carried out by leading members of the Greek and Cypriot military General Staffs and we are discussing the conclusions drawn by the military so that this week, I can say, will be a historic one for promoting Greek- Cypriot defense cooperation. Many decisions have been made and others will be made but they cannot all be announced. Defense has this peculiarity: You do things first and the people see them later. You talk less and do more. This is what we are doing this week. [applause] The press has also reported various scenarios. We are imaginative people and we like mythology, which is, after all, a Greek product, but when we discuss national issues we should spare the rumormongering and mythology. Doubtless, the declaration of the unified defense doctrine disturbed many quarters. There are many who want Hellenism to be weak, who want to see Cyprus unable to negotiate its rights. Our answer to them is that our defense doctrine is defensive. We recall [Greek historian] Thucydides' words: The strong imposes on the weak what his strength allows and the weak retreats as much as his weakness forces him to retreat. I do not believe the negotiations for a Cyprus solution can be conducted under the current unequal terms of defense. The restoration of the balance we seek does not go against programs for negotiations and a Cyprus solution. On the contrary, it is a prerequisite for a correct and peaceful Cyprus solution. This is so because only when Cyprus has negotiating power, only when Cyprus has a trustworthy defense, with its inclusion in the unified defense area of Hellenism, only then can it go to the negotiating table with its claims, which have been unanimously passed in UN resolutions but have not been realized. We know we are in the right but we also know another thing: To find our right we must be united and strong. This means a unified defense area. [applause] So the efforts are in parallel, not in discord. Efforts must be made to negotiate a viable Cyprus solution. I do not mean tactical moves that fail to touch upon the problem's substance--the illegal occupation by Turkish troops of the independent Cyprus. [applause] A viable Cyprus solution should start with and solve the question of the security and independence of a UN member state-- Cyprus. To strengthen and turn the negotiations in this direction, which is the only way to solve the issue, we create our defense prerequisites. This is primarily to discourage adventuring by some quarters, who, sensing a defense weakness, might attempt, and why not, to repeat something that was done in the past, in 1974. The message must be passed to the other countries that the issue of solving the Cyprus problem will be resolved on a basis in which Cyprus has a trustworthy defense. This is the framework and concept of the unified defense area. The first steps have been taken; we will proceed quickly to consolidate this doctrine. Hellenism has only one heart. We strike with one heart. Greece and Cyprus have the same heart. There is no defense and security of Cyprus separate from the defense and security of Greece and there is no defense and security for Greece when Cyprus is in danger. We are together in this struggle for national survival, national vindication. We are together on a difficult, uphill path. But, as I said earlier, I look far, perhaps too far, to the horizon, where the future looks bright if we can overcome our national weaknesses. Our national strategy must be coordinated, planned, and united. We are faced with many domestic problems, which can divide us. We may quarrel. We are a people who like dialogue and dispute. We have many domestic issues that can divide the parties. But on national issues there must be unanimity, a national strategy for all Hellenism. This message is beginning to reach other countries. I felt really proud when foreign diplomats started to ask me about the unified defense area and what it means. They believed me, because they know that we are determined to go ahead. For the first time I saw that they are beginning to take us seriously. This way we will solve our issue. I am not a daydreamer. I am one of many Greeks who believe in their tradition and who believe we have a bright future. Seeing this bright future beyond the difficulties, I see nothing in which Hellenism is inferior. We can realize this vision. To those who mistrust, those who doubt, I say: Why not this vision? Greece has achieved it often. We will achieve it this time too. We will win. [applause]
