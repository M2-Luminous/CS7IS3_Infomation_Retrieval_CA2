In its report, MITI points out it has become difficult for foreign-affiliated firms to advance into Tokyo due to high land prices, among other factors. Among key points which the report stresses will help promote efforts to attract such firms to rural districts are the following: 1) to draw up a program regarding attracting foreign-affiliated firms to Japan in which local governments will play the main role; 2) to implement more measures which offer financial and other incentives to foreign- affiliated firms; and 3) to build an information network. As a new policy for fiscal year 1995, MITI now plans to work out details of its program for promoting foreign investment in Japan based on this report. The report was compiled by the "Committee for Promoting Smoother Domestic Investment in Rural Districts" (a private study panel under the director of MITI's Industry Policy Bureau). In its report, the panel asserts that the advance of foreign-affiliated firms into Japanese markets will promote competition within the domestic economy and help increase productivity. It asserts this will consequently contribute to rectifying the gap in commodity prices in Japan and abroad. It stresses that in rural districts, in particular, extensive exchanges among firms with differing customs and traditions will lead to the increased possibility of the birth of new local industries as well as to the internationalization of rural districts, and an increase in employment opportunities.
