Li made the remark when meeting with representatives to a conference of the Licensing Executives Society (LES) International, which was opened here Friday [6 May] with businessmen, jurists and scholars from some 30 countries and representatives from international organizations in attendance. Li said that China will make greater efforts to transfer technology abroad while introducing more technologies from foreign countries. China's legal system for the protection of intellectual property has been improved, Li said, and the country's new-amendment to the Patent Law and the Trademark Law have strengthened the protection of patent and trademark rights. The vice-premier said that China's participation in the Bern Convention and the World Copyright Convention has basically made its copyright protection meet the requirements of international practice. The country's protection of trade secrets has been stipulated in the Anti-Unfair Competition Law enacted last December, he added. Li congratulated the opening of the conference on behalf of the Chinese Government and appreciated LES's contribution to the dissemination of licensing knowledge in China, the exchange of licensing information and enhancement of the working skills of licensing executives. Li said that as China is accelerating its pace of establishment of a socialist market economy and maintaining a sustained and healthy economic development, the country has seen a speedy development of technology transfer. Statistics show that China has signed a total of 7,000 contracts of technology import and export with a contractual value totalling 48 billion U.S. dollars. Li said that China is to import more advanced and useful technology from foreign countries to update the present enterprises at home. Meanwhile, the country will spare no effort in exporting technology abroad, the vice-premier said. Oliver Axster, president of LES International, was present at the meeting in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
