The privatization of major units such as hotels and banks is bound to provoke heated disputes in Bulgaria, Mr. Karabashev said. The Government should support those interests which are in defence of the national economy. In response to a question, Mr. Matinchev denied having pursued at government level the interests of certain circles in the privatization of tourism, interested in the preservation of the old structure of this economic branch. This year privatization in tourism may yield revenues exceeding 2 billion leva, Mr. Matinchev said.
