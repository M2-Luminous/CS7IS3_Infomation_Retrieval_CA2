FR940617-1-00017 FR940617-1-00006 3. C010.1.0 is amended to reduce the role of address placement in the determination of which of a mailpiece's physical dimensions are its length, height, and thickness. Existing standards are inconsistent in associating these basic physical dimensions to the delivery address. The proposed rule would remedy this by establishing consistent definitions, based on the physical characteristics of the mailpiece. For the typical letter-size piece, the proposed rule always defines its length (horizontal dimension) as the longest dimension; the mailpiece's height (vertical dimension) is the next longest dimension, and the thickness is the remaining dimension. Variations on this rule are proposed for pieces that do not have three unequal dimensions. While the Postal Service realizes that this change may affect a small volume of customer mail, as discussed above, the benefits of the consistent definitions contained in the changes proposed below, and of the processing efficiencies of the mail these proposals would produce, far outweigh any loss of creative latitude. 4. C050.1.0 is amended for consistency. By the revised wording, assignment of most mailpieces to a processing category depends solely on their dimensions as determined by C010.1.0. Existing standards base processing category on physical dimensions, without regard to address placement, so that the proposed rule, in effect, makes only minor changes to ensure that this section is harmonious with those discussed above. 5. C050.5.0 is amended to make it clear that merchandise samples are not by definition always irregular parcels, and may be categorized as letter- or flat-size pieces based on the usual criteria. Other Revisions Concerning Addressing 1. These proposed changes to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards relate to the content and placement of delivery and return addresses. The proposed revisions are intended to serve two general purposes: making existing standards more consistent and improving the address quality of mail. 2. Revisions to the standards in A010.4.3 and 4.5 are proposed to mandate the use of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in the return address on certain mail. (The standard for required use of a return address is not changed by these proposals.) Specifically, by the proposed revision to A010.4.3, the correct ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code would be required in the return address on any mail where a return address is itself required under existing standards. Further, by the proposed change to A010.4.5, the existing placement standard for the return address on mail claimed at a ZIP+4 rate is both made more specific and extended to all mail on which a return address is required. Under the proposed rule, the return address must be placed in the top left corner of the address side, area, or label of the mailpiece, parallel to the delivery address. On ZIP+4 rate cards and letter-size mailpieces that do not bear a delivery point barcode, the return address would have to be outside the OCR read area (a current requirement applied broadly to all ZIP+4 rate mail). The proposed revisions should facilitate the accurate and efficient return of mail by making complete return address information available in a readily identifiable location. Because mailers know their own ZIP Codes, the Postal Service believes that the proposed standards do not represent either a significant new burden on customers or one that customers will have serious problems in implementing. Customers who believe that deferred implementation will be necessary are asked to indicate this in their comments, with an explanation of why they require deferral and how long an adjustment period they require, and should propose appropriate terms for excepting those mailers/mailings while the necessary operational adjustments are made. 3. A010.5.3 is added to clarify the meaning and appropriate use of the terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``POB,'' ``P. O. B.,'' and similar combinations. These terms are sometimes incorrectly used to denote destinations other than post office box or caller service, such as a rural or highway contract route box, a college or business mailroom box, or a private commercial mail receiving agent. As a result, the imprecise use of terms conveys incorrect information or causes misinterpretation, either of which sometimes impedes the Postal Service in providing the desired service_delivering the mail where the sender intends. The potential for misdelivery has increased in today's automated mail processing environment: Optical character readers scan and ``read'' addresses to determine the correct delivery point barcode to assign to the mailpiece. Once this barcode is applied, the mailpiece is processed with minimal human intervention so that ambiguous address information applied by the mailer may result in a misdirected mailpiece. To avoid these potential delivery problems, the proposed standard defines the terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``POB,'' ``P. O. B.,'' and similar combinations as referring exclusively to the delivery services provided by the Postal Service under D910 and D920 (Post Office Box Service and Caller Service, respectively). The proposed standard states that those terms are always included in the correct address of mail destined for post office box or caller service addresses, that they are incorrect for mail intended for other addresses, and that the Postal Service cannot ensure accurate delivery of incorrectly addressed mail. (Correct addressing practices are described in detail in Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards, available from postal business centers and larger post offices.) This proposed rule will not have an adverse affect on customers because it merely clarifies the correct use of these terms. Moreover, many large mailers have already taken measures to improve the quality of their address lists, and may have already standardized such lists in conformance with the proposed rule. 4. A010.3.2c is also revised for organizational consistency.
