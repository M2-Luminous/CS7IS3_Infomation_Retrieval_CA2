The official, from the Organizational Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said this at a forum attended by leaders from the party's organizational departments at all levels which closed here today in Beijing. He stressed the importance of the study of Deng Xiaoping's works and his theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and its relation to the formation of leading bodies. He pointed out that the emphasis should be placed on the building up of ideology and work style in strengthening the leading bodies. It should also be linked with the anti-corruption campaign, he added. The official said that it is necessary to maintain and safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee in order to enable the policies and reform measures made by the Central Committee to be carried out successfully. He said that redoubled efforts should be made to foster and select outstanding cadres, both young and middle-aged, to the leading posts. Addressing the issue concerning the party's grassroots units, he said, it is necessary to explore how to enhance the building of the party organization in the state-owned, foreign-funded and township enterprises, as well as in the private sector. He said that the pace of reform of the personnel system must be quickened. A scientific, classified personnel management system and a fair, just and competitive mechanism for selecting cadres should gradually be set up, in line with the principle of putting the cadres' management under the party's control. He stressed that party organizations should take active part in, and give guidance to, the implementing of the state civil servant system in the new year.
