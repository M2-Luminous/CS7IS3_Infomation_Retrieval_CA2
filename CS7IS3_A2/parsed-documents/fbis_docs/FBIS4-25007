Construction contracts involving 50.4 billion yuan (5.8 billion U.S. dollars) have been drawn up between Guangdong and overseas investors since 1993, local officials said. The overseas investment, which accounts for 61.9 percent of construction funding, comes from the United States, Brazil, Malaysia, France and Hong Kong. Local officials said that the existing highways are far short of the economic boom. The daily flow of cars on most highways in the province surpasses 5,000, with some even reaching 10,000. Under construction are expressways from Guangzhou, the capital city, to Zhuhai, a special economic zone, between the special economic zones of Shenzhen and Shantou, and along the coast from Yangjiang to Zhuhai. Besides, Guangdong Province has already signed agreements of intent with overseas partners for the construction of the Guangdong section of the Beijing-Guangzhou Expressway and three other expressways. The projects are expected to be started next year and completed by 1998-99.
