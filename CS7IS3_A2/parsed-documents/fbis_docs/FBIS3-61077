The Vologda Governor's Policy in the Election Mirror"] [Text] Vologda--In Vologda Oblast Zhirinovskiy's party obtained almost twice as many votes as Russia's Choice. Not without the help of local personnel. Nikolay Podgornov, chief of the administration of Vologda Oblast, has several biographies for various of life's contingencies. In the January issue of the journal VASH VYBOR (Yaroslavl) he informed the readers that he had acquired a higher legal education and that at the age of 24 he had been appointed director of a sovkhoz. On 16 November I learned with surprise from the Vologda Oblast newspaper KRASNYY SEVER that Nikolay Podgornov had an "incomplete higher education" and that he had become a sovkhoz director at the age of 27. And 10 days later, on 27 November, I read in the list of candidates for deputy of the Federation Council carried by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Nikolay Mikhaylovich Podgornov, born 1949, higher education...." A brief journalistic investigation showed that these facts of the biography of the Vologda governor are inaccurate, to put it mildly. In August 1977 Nikolay Podgornov was dismissed from the third year of the All-Union Legal Correspondence Institute for unsatisfactory progress. So such education cannot even be called "incomplete higher." Other "touch-ups" were discovered in the governor's biography also. He maintains that he graduated from the Velikoustyugskiy River School (a technical school) and worked as a ship's mechanic at the port of Kotlas. But he in fact graduated from a vocational-technical school with the specialty of "ship's engineer-helmsman-mechanic" and worked as a motor mechanic-seaman of the oil station. People's Deputy Nikolay Podgornov was in the Supreme Soviet of Russia, incidentally, a member of the Supreme Economic Council of the republic. Look Who Has Come Nikolay Podgornov was appointed chief of the administration of the oblast in October 1991 and had prior to this been the director of the Avrora sovkhoz. Those who recommended him to the president maintain that they had been won over by Podgornov's reform activity: He had converted his farm into a collective-share enterprise. Simply put, he divided the sovkhoz's assets among the employees. Podgornov took for himself five hectares of land, a share of the property, and a large brick house with all the conveniences, with a private parcel of land of 40 hundredths. In March 1992 the tax inspectorate of Gryazovetskiy Rayon discovered that the chief of the administration of the oblast was continuing to receive his director's pay in Avrora. The scandal was hushed up. Your Money Will Be Ours In May the Vologda leaders proclaimed their oblast some "state-territorial formation with the constitutional status of republic." The federal authorities, politicians, and the press perceived this event with irony--as they had until the recent elections perceived Zhirinovskiy. But they should not have. Real power belongs to whoever puts together the budget. Having become firmly established in the governor's chair, Nikolay Podgornov issued a directive by which he essentially brought under his jurisdiction the Vologda Oblast Tax Inspectorate. But Veniamin Alekseyev, chief of the inspectorate, declined to comply with the directive as being contrary to federal laws. The angered governor began to complain regularly to the leaders of the state tax office of the Russian Federation about Alekseyev, accusing him of antireform activity and demanding his immediate dismissal. The latest such report was dispatched to Moscow immediately following the elections. Judging by this, it is the chief of the tax inspectorate who is to blame for the victory of Zhirinovskiy's party in the Vologda region. While the capital is investigating these complaints, Nikolay Podgornov is doggedly attacking the federal budget. In October he suspended on oblast territory the telegram of the Russian Ministry of Finance and the Russian Tax Office of 19 August "On Transfer of Small-Scale Enterprises to Value-Added Tax Treasury Payments Quarterly." Vologda Oblast has not yet refused, like Chechnya, to pay federal taxes. But it is chronically short in its payments to the Russian Treasury of a large sum. On a Good Footing With the President Every Monday oblast television shows a half-hour interview with Nikolay Podgornov. And whatever the journalist's questions he is answering, he unfailingly, at least once, emphasizes his closeness to the president of Russia. Business is in a bad way: A reduction of 10,000 employees has begun at the Cherepovets foundry, and another industrial giant--the Vologda Optical-Mechanical Plant--will as of 27 December come to a halt "for the Christmas holidays." One-third of the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes is in fact bankrupt. The price of food in Vologda and Cherepovets is the highest in the Northwest. But very pleasant happenings have been taking place, on the other hand, in the private life of the governor himself. On the eve of the elections he had a house-warming party in a three-story private residence built at budget expense especially for the ruling elite. He himself has taken one 145.5-square-meter apartment. Another--of 160.4 square meters--he has given Nikolay Golovin, chief of the oblast militia. In a third he has installed Vologda mayor Boris Upadyshev. And a fourth remains empty as yet. Vologda is a small city. And there is nothing surprising in Podgornov's having lost the elections for Vologda itself. Yet the remote areas, where the governor is known only from his television homilies, still elected him to the Federation Council. Down With the Democrats! A day before the elections, on Friday, the oblast newspaper KRASNYY SEVER, a cofounder of which is the administration of the oblast, carried an article by the writer Vasiliy Belov, whose authority in the Vologda region is simply enormous. Vasiliy Ivanovich called on his fellow countrymen under no circumstances to vote for Russia's Choice or other democrats. This publication was hardly fortuitous. In the summer Nikolay Podgornov had allocated to KRASNYY SEVER from the budget a very large amount of money for the daily publication of this newspaper, "to increase the influence of the printed word on the readers, explain and propagandize the economic policy of the administration of the oblast...," and since that time KRASNYY SEVER has criticized only the federal authorities, hereby emphasizing, as it were, that the policy of the administration of the oblast and the policy of the Russian Government are not one and the same thing. At the start of the election campaign, the official newspaper of the Vologda governor carried an appeal of the communists for a boycott of the elections. And concluded it with a call by Vasiliy Belov for all democrats to be given a thrashing. Judging by the results of the elections, the people of Vologda did not let the words of this fellow countryman go unheeded.
