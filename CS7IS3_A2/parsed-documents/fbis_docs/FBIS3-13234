While we clarify this matter for public opinion, we assert that it is the Zionist enemy's forces that killed the civilians while they were coming on the scene of the heroic operation in order to chase our heroic comrades. The PFLP-GC will turn the captive, who was brought by our comrades, over to the Islamic Resistance after questioning him.
