During his appearance before the Congress of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee, Solana recalled NATO's two air strikes against the troops besieging the city, but deplored the statements by Russian President Boris Yeltsin: "In my opinion, his words gave the Serb forces some hope." "Perhaps a permanent member of the (UN) Security Council should have weighed his words more carefully," because they reduced the effectiveness of the NATO action, he added. The minister attributed Yeltsin's "mistakes" to factors relating to the domestic policy of Russia, a country where nationalist feeling is on the increase. The Russian head of state, who was in Madrid at the beginning of last week, just after the NATO attack, criticized the use of force by the alliance, complained that Moscow had not been consulted or even informed, and urged continuing to negotiate. In milder terms, Solana intimated his bewilderment about the Clinton administration's recent actions. He recalled that both Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the U.S. chief of staff had ruled out strikes against the Serbs hours before they finally occurred. "It is true that there were statements -- fortunate or otherwise -- which gave cause for the senseless Bosnian Serb forces to make decisions (to attack), perhaps believing that they were safe because of the international community's inaction." As a result of Washington's and Moscow's "indiscretions," "the Bosnian Serb forces' position is now a strengthened position," the minister stressed, and he warned: "Until the international community presents a united front, the Serbs will take advantage of any chink."
