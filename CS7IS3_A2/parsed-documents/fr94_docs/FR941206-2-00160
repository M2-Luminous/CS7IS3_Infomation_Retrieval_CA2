ACTION: Notice of availability of funds. SUMMARY: The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), U.S. Department of Commerce, announces that applications are available for planning and construction grants for public telecommunications facilities under the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP), which is administered by NTIA. Applicants for grants under the PTFP must file their applications on or before Wednesday, February 15, 1995. NTIA anticipates making grant awards by September 30, 1995. Approximately $25.3 million is available in fiscal year 1995 for PTFP grants. The amount of a grant award will vary, depending on the application project. For fiscal year 1994, NTIA awarded $21.2 million in funds to 140 projects. The awards ranged from $4,102 to $850,000. Prospective PTFP applicants should be aware that the Congress has appropriated funds for a related NTIA grant program. The program, which is part of the National Information Infrastructure effort, is called the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP). The TIIAP's funds may be used for the planning and construction of telecommunications networks or for the purchase of telecommunications services and facilities that enhance the delivery of social services, such as education, culture, health care, public information, public safety, and other related services. The TIIAP program funds demonstration projects that support the formation of an advanced nationwide, telecommunications and information infrastructure incorporating the widest variety of information technologies. The Congress appropriated $64 million for the TIIAP in FY 1995. Formal announcement of the TIIAP program for FY 1995 will be made at a later date in a separate Federal Register notice. The TIIAP is distinct from the PTFP, which is the subject of this Notice. The PTFP or its predecessor programs have been in operation since 1962. The Final Rules and Policy Statement for the PTFP were published on November 22, 1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 59168 (1991)). These rules, codified at 15 CFR part 2301, will be in effect for FY 1995 PTFP applications. Parties interested in applying for financial assistance should refer to these rules and to the authorizing legislation (47 U.S.C. 390&hyph;393 and Pub. L. 103&hyph;317) for additional information on the program's goals and objectives, eligibility criteria, evaluation criteria, and other requirements. Authority: The Public Telecommunications Financing Act of 1978, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 390&hyph;393 (Act), and Pub. L. 103&hyph;317. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance No. 11.550) DATES: Pursuant to 15 CFR 2301.5(c), the Administrator of NTIA hereby establishes the closing date for the filing of applications for grants under the PTFP.
