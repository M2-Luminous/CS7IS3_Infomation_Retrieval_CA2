Prime Minister Berov suffered a vote of censure on 19 May but failed to offer his resignation, SDS leader Filip Dimitrov declared. What is more, he added, parliament's refusal to accept the cosmetic changes proposed by the prime minister represent a new vote of no confidence in him, in the sense of Article 112, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution. Dimitrov added that Berov is also attempting to infringe on Article 8 of the country's basic law, which regulates the division of powers. In his view, the cabinet is therefore governing without legal foundation, while parliament is supporting this lawlessness. It is clear that in this dramatic situation we will demand standard solutions, Dimitrov declared, but he did not reveal the tactical steps that the SDS has in mind. He appealed to the media to be more energetic in acting to end the lawlessness in the country.
