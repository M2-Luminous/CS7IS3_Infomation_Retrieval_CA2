Opposition leader Chris Haiveta said Sunday that parliamentary speaker Bill Skate was given notice of the the motion on Thursday. The motion, which nominates Haiveta as prime minister, was filed by Bougainville MP John Momis and was signed by senior opposition MPs, including two former prime ministers, Sir Michael Somare and Rabbie Namaliu. It was expected that it will be formally read out in the house by the parliament's clerk this week. Under parliamentary rules, the house can then wait seven days before taking a vote on the motion. Haiveta said in a statement that a change of government was warranted because of what he described as mismanagement of the economy together with the undermining of PNG's traditionally good relations with neighbours and scandals among the leadership. "Our cities are fast becoming the hell-holes of the South Pacific, their infrastructure collapsing, their people living in fear," Haiveta said. Wingti, who seems to have a solid majority, has described the opposition move as unne@essary, labelling it "a cynical and destabilising grab for power." "If they are serious about this vote, where are their alternate policies?" he said Sunday. Wingti has the support of 70 of the 109 MPs in parliament. To get the motion through, the opposition needs at least a simple majority of 55 votes. For the motion to go through, one of the four coalition parties would have to cross the floor when the vote is taken, observers said.
