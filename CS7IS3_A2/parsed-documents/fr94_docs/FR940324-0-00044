FR940324-0-00044 FR940324-0-00019 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 032194A] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that comprise the shallow water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. This action is necessary because the first seasonal allowance of Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) apportioned to the shallow water trawl fishery category in the GOA has been caught. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), March 21, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., March 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Fishery Biologist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. An emergency interim rule (58 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) apportioned the Pacific halibut PSC limit for trawl gear into bycatch allowances and seasonal apportionments thereof among fishery categories. In accordance with §672.20(f)(3)(iii) the shallow water species fishery, which is defined at §672.20(f)(3)(ii)(A) was apportioned 500 mt of Pacific halibut PSC for the first season, the period January 20, 1994, through March 31, 1994. The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with §672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating in the trawl shallow water species fishery in the GOA have caught the first seasonal allowance of Pacific halibut PSC apportioned to that fishery. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for each species and species group that comprise the shallow water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. The species and species groups that comprise the shallow water species fishery are: Pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, and ``other species''. This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., March 21, 1994, through 12 noon, A.l.t., March 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20.
