The two companies by now have agreed on the amount of supply and conditions of delivery, while talks are going on to find a formula for price calculation, Saar said. Price calculation formulas based on heavy oil and heating oil prices at the Rotterdam stock exchange, as generally used in the West, are not suitable with respect to Russia because of a higher percentage of sulphur in gas from Russia, Saar explained. Eesti Gaas and Gazprom expect to sign the agreement already in August or in September. The Russian concern owns a 30-percent stake in Eesti Gaas. The Estonian Government holds 39 percent of the company's shares. Fifteen percent of the shares are to be sold in Estonia, and another 15 percent, to some western company. Negotiations with potential investors are under way, Saar added. Eesti Gaas turned over 0.5 billion kroons last year. The company's share capital is 38.8 million kroons.
