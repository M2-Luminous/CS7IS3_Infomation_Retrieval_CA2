Governor Jia Zhijie, and Vice Governors Li Daqiang, Wang Shengtie, Han Nanpeng, Meng Qingping, Chen Shuiwen, and Su Xiaoyun attended the meeting. [passage omitted] Governor Jia Zhijie made an important speech in which he first reviewed the 1993 economic work. He said: In 1993 the province registered sustained and speedy economic development. People throughout the province seriously implemented Deng Xiaoping's southern tour talks and the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, deepened reform and widened the scope of opening up, seized the opportunity for faster development, and blazed new trails in reform, opening up, and economic construction. Jia Zhijie focused on the target of endeavor for 1994. He said: The general guiding principle for this year's economic work is this: Under the guidance of the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we will conscientiously implement the instructions of the national economic work meeting and the Sixth Provincial CPC Congress, comprehensively deepen reform, widen the scope of opening up, bring into full play the leading role of large and medium-sized enterprises, pay attention to economic development, speed up the implementation of the scientific, technological, and educational strategy, promote scientific and technological progress and their structural adjustment, work hard to improve our economic results, and bring about the sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the province's national economy. [passage omitted] Jia Zhijie pointed out: In ensuring the fulfillment of all national economic development tasks, we must break away from old conventions, create new ideas, and make new moves and breakthroughs. First, we must have new ideas in terms of development. Fundamentally speaking, we must explore a development method which requires little investment, produces much, yields good quality and results, and accumulates fast. Second, we must make a new breakthrough in terms of policy. At present, we must speedily formulate a number of detailed policies and methods for economic invigoration to encourage grassroots enterprises and masses to develop the economy. Third, we must have new moves in work. In other words, we must resolve the main contradictions and weak links and do something which can propel the overall situation forward. In this year's economic work we must pay attention to one nucleus, materialize five major breakthroughs, ignite three major projects, and alleviate the four major contradictions. Namely, we must do our best to improve large and medium-sized state enterprises; develop a diversified economy by breaking away from old conventions, develop township and town enterprises by breaking away from old conventions, develop tertiary industries by breaking away from old conventions, develop individual and private economic sectors by breaking away from old conventions, and develop an export-oriented economy by breaking away from old conventions; ignite the production of automobiles, the transformation of the Wuhan steel factory, and the construction of other projects in coordination with the three gorges project; alleviate the fund shortage; and strengthen energy, transportation, and telecommunications construction. Jia Zhijie said: According to these objectives and development ideas, this year's economic development must focus on the following aspects: First, we must continue to strengthen the position of agriculture as the foundation, focusing on increasing the peasants' income and developing a diversified economy and township and town enterprises. We will initially arrange a 6 percent increase over last year in the province's gross agricultural output value; a 37 percent increase in township and town enterprises' gross output value; a 100-yuan increase in the peasants' per capita net income; set a target of 23 to 23.5 billion kg for grain output, and 500,000 metric tonnes for cotton output. To fulfill these targets, we must adjust and optimize the internal agricultural structure. [passage omitted] Second, on the basis of improving economic results, we must maintain a speedy growth in industry. We will initially arrange a 15 percent increase in township industrial output value; over 95 percent for their production and marketing rate; an 8 percent increase in budgetary enterprises' output value; and a 12 percent increase in their fulfillment of taxes and profits. This year's tasks are arduous and we must take effective measures to fulfill them. For this reason, we must make great efforts to improve large and medium-sized state enterprises so as to provide powerful support for the speedy growth of industrial economy. [passage omitted] We must increase the momentum of technological reform and update textile and other light industries. We must strengthen management over enterprises and improve their economic results. Third, we must increase the momentum of investment, optimize the investment structure, raise funds through various channels, and make a success of key construction projects. The investment structure in fixed assets must be adjusted this year. [passage omitted] Fourth, we must develop tertiary industries by breaking away from old conventions so as to form a new pattern for industrial growth. It is necessary to ensure an 11 percent growth in output value and to surpass the indices set by the plan. For this reason, we must develop industries which require small investments, can produce quick and good results, can provide adequate job opportunities, and have much to do with economic development as well as the people's lives. In the meantime, we must further stabilize our policies and support the development of individual and private economic sectors. Fifth, we must give prominence to focal points and speed up market formation. 1) We must further improve commodity markets. 2) We must speed up the establishment of financial markets and gradually form regional financial centers. 3) We must actively develop labor service markets. 4) We must cultivate technology markets. On expediting reform, Jia Zhijie said: This year, the macroeconomic and microeconomic fields, the economic base, and the superstructure will be reformed. We must actively and steadily carry out macroeconomic management system reform and ensure the smooth implementation of central reform measures. We must deepen enterprise reform with focus on the establishment of a new enterprise system. We must reform the social insurance system and the housing system, and we must speed up institutional reform. [passage omitted]
