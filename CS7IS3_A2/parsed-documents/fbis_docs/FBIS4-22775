The Activity of an Investment Fund and a Mutual Fund of an Investment Company Pertaining to Joint Investments 21. Investment funds, as well as investment companies, that have founded mutual funds (hereinafter, funds), issue investment certificates that are offered for placement among the participants in order to carry out joint investment. Open funds invest the funds that are received from the participants in securities of other issuers. Closed funds have the right to invest in securities and acquire real property, and the portions and shares that belong to the state in the property of public companies in the process of privatization. The investment certificates of open funds may be acquired for the funds of the participants, and those of closed funds for the funds of the participants and privatization vouchers. 22. The issue of investment certificates is accomplished after the registration of their issue at a financial body under the procedure defined by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The funds have the right to make a general issue of investment certificates in an amount whose size should not exceed 15 times the amount of their authorized capital. Open funds issue investment certificates that are not subject to unrestricted resale, and closed funds issue certificates that are subject to unrestricted resale. The investment certificates are offered for placement and are redeemed by the fund at a price that is equal to the value of the net assets, at the time stipulated by the investment declaration. The value of the assets in which the funds of the founders and participants of the fund are placed in current prices at the moment of valuation is deemed to be the net assets of the investment fund. 23. The investment certificates of closed funds may be exchanged for privatization vouchers, if those funds have received permission to carry out commercial activity with privatization vouchers under the procedure stipulated by the State Property Fund of Ukraine. The closed funds serve the owners of privatization vouchers with the restrictions that the investment certificates are subject to redemption by the fund no earlier than the conclusion of the term of utilization of the privatization vouchers, and that the participants in the investment fund are not guaranteed a fixed amount of dividends. Privatization vouchers that are under the ownership of the fund are subject to indexing in a case of the general indexing of privatization vouchers. The fund has the right to make additional issues of investment certificates at 50 times the amount of the privatization vouchers accepted for placement, under a procedure that is approved by the State Property Fund of Ukraine and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. 24. The valuation of the net assets of the fund is performed in accordance with the Statute on the Procedure for the Valuation of the Net Assets of Investment Funds and Mutual Funds of Investment Companies as approved by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The value of the net assets per investment certificate of an open fund is calculated quarterly, on a date that is stipulated by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. A mutual fund is obligated to redeem the investment certificates from the fund participants at that price. 25. The income of the fund is formed from dividends and other receipts from securities that are under the ownership of the fund, and income from operations with securities and other assets. The income of the fund and its founders and participants is taxed in the payment of dividends under the procedure stipulated by prevailing legislation. The profits of the fund are subject to division among the founders and participants in the form of dividends. The profits of the founders of the fund may be applied, in accordance with the investment declaration, toward increasing the size of the authorized capital. 26. The fund composes and publishes information on its activity at the times and in the amounts that are defined by prevailing legislation. The accounting and monitoring of the activity of the fund with regard to the placement of privatization vouchers are performed under the procedure stipulated by the State Property Fund of Ukraine and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The open funds are obligated to report to their participants every six months and publish in the press a financial report, which shall contain the accounting balance sheet with a listing of the investment fund (quantity, types and market value of the securities that are under the ownership of the fund), a report on income and expenses, as well as dividends paid over the period, a report on the value of the net assets of the fund, a report on the quantity of investment certificates issued by the fund, the nominal value of one investment certificate and the value of the net assets of one investment certificate as of the date of compilation of the report, and information on changes in the composition of affiliated individuals and members of the oversight council, as well as changes in the investment manager and depositary. The financial report on the results for the year must be verified by the auditor. Closed funds every six months publish the following data: the value of the net assets of the fund (including the value and quantity of non-utilized privatization vouchers that are certified by the findings of an auditing organization), a listing and the quantity of securities from a single issuer (in an amount greater than one percent of the assets of the fund) that are under the ownership of the fund, the value of other assets that are under the ownership of the fund, a report on the indebtedness of the fund, and data on the overall quantity of investment certificates of the fund that are in circulation at the end of the six months. The investment company conducts an accounting of the presence and circulation of the property of each mutual fund separately from its own property. The funds that place privatization vouchers are obligated to save the documents on all agreements made by them with privatization vouchers for a term of five years. If the funds are liquidated prior to that time, the documents on their activity with privatization vouchers are transferred to the State Property Fund. 27. State monitoring of the activity of a fund is provided for, in accordance with the Law of Ukraine "Securities and the Funds Exchange" and this Statute, by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and local financial bodies. State monitoring of the commercial activity of funds with privatization vouchers is provided by the State Property Fund of Ukraine. Violations of the requirements of this Statute entail civil, administrative and criminal liability in accordance with prevailing legislation. 28. Monitoring of the upholding of anti-monopoly legislation in the process of carrying out joint investment by an investment fund, investment company or mutual fund of an investment company is provided by the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine in accordance with prevailing legislation. The investment fund or investment company should inform the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine, either directly or through the investment manager, on their conclusion of agreements between the investment fund, investment company or mutual funds of an investment company and third parties pertaining to the acquisition of securities, as a result of which the fund or company obtains more than five percent of the securities of a single issuer. That information is submitted within five days from the moment of reaching the agreement on the purchase of the securities. 29. The fund curtails its activity in accordance with prevailing legislation and with a regard for the requirements stipulated by this Statute. Closed funds that serve the owners of privatization vouchers may be liquidated before the end of the time period for the use of privatization vouchers only by decision of a court of arbitration. In a case of the bankruptcy of an investment company, penalties may be imposed on the property of a mutual fund only after settlements with all participants in the mutual fund except the founders. The liquidation commission publishes in the print media, by location of the fund, information on its liquidation and the procedure and time periods for the making of claims by creditors. The commission shall publish the first information a week after its creation, and repeat it not less than twice for a period of two months. The property of the fund is sold exclusively at auction. The receipts from the sale are applied toward satisfying the demands of creditors. The funds that remain after this are distributed among the participants in proportion to the quantity of investment certificates. In a case where the value of the property per investment certificate is less than its nominal value, the difference to the participants is covered at the expense of the funds of the founders. The fund is considered to be liquidated from the moment of its deletion from the state register. A closed-type fund curtails its activity after the completion of the declared time frame. A closed fund may also be converted into an open fund by decision of its founders.
