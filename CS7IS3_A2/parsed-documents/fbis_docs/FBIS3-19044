What views does France wish to share with the other members on this subject? [Giraud] The seven major industrialized countries meeting in Detroit will exchange views on the measures they are taking to counter unemployment which is affecting everyone. A year since the idea of a G-7 meeting on employment was proposed, I have seen a degree of convergence in views and proposals. All the industrialized countries are concentrating on in-depth, structural, and medium-term measures. These consist of reducing the overall cost of poorly qualified labor in order to fight youth unemployment; substantial reform of the relationship between education and industry through the development of alternating work and study schemes and vocational training programs; the modernization of labor regulations allowing greater flexibility in working time and the development of part-time work; and the reorganization of employment services with a view to making them more efficient. Whether we are talking about the OECD report, the white paper adopted by the European Council at the end of the last year, or the draft law to be proposed by President Clinton, the direction taken is the same in every case. The interest for France and, I hope, for all the G-7 countries lies in the fact that these measures coincide with those proposed in our five-year law on labor, employment, and vocational training. [FIGARO] Is it not paradoxical that this meeting will focus only on the microeconomic aspects of the problem when a coordination of macroeconomic policies would seem essential? [Giraud] It is true that the G-7 has traditionally been a forum for macroeconomic concertation. This unprecedented meeting is, nevertheless, the sign that the public authorities are becoming increasingly aware not only of the interaction between macroeconomics and microeconomics, but also of the fact that the latter cannot be neglected in favor of the former. It is a good sign that this trend is now being observed in the industrialized countries. We need time and effort, as well as good will, for this point to get through to the leaders of all the countries in the world. The end of the ideological confrontation that has dominated the world stage for three-quarters of a century gives us the opportunity and even the duty to once again put the individual at the center of society's concerns.
