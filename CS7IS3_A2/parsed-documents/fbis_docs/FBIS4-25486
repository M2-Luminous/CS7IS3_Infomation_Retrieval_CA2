The 17-sq-k Zhangjiang Park is aimed at applying new- and high- tech research and development to industrial production. Education is also its focus. Construction was started in late 1992. The city's first high- tech development zone, Caohejing, was initiated six years ago. A grand project to compose biomedical industry is under way. Now some world leaders in pharmaceuticals have poured money into the zone, while local medical universities and research institutes are planning to move some operations there. The sector will turn out about 7 billion yuan (0.8 billion U.S. dollars) in products by the end of this century, one-third of the total in medicine production in Shanghai. A "computer software town" is also being built in the park. The Golden Bridge export processing zone in Pudong has concentrated on telecommunications and other pollution-free industries. Here two out of three projects are in the new and high- tech field, while half of the factories are producing for export. More than forty large overseas and domestic companies have located in the 19-sq-k area, together with a high-tech group made up of 33 of China's top universities. In the Waigaoqiao bonded zone, there is already a free flow of goods, foreign exchange and personnel abroad. Businesses ranging from import and export, to re-export, export processing, bonded storage and real estate are in full swing. Four deepwater berths have been completed, capable of handling 2.4 million ton of goods a year.
