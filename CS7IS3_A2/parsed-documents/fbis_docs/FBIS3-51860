On behalf of dozens of Indian and peasant organizations in Chiapas State, Marcelino Gomez Nunez, a leader of the National Coordinating Board of the Ayala Plan, invited President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to visit Ocosingo or San Cristobal de Las Casas as soon as possible. The visit would allow the president to get first-hand knowledge of the situation from those affected and offer him the opportunity to encourage the people to find a solution to the problems facing them after the New Year's conflict. The meeting between Indians and peasants and Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas took place at a warehouse complex known as El Pajal on the outskirts of San Cristobal, on the road to Rancho Nuevo. Eraclio Zepeda and Andres Fabrega, members of the National Commission for the Overall Development and Social Justice for Indian People were present, as well as Rigoberta Menchu, Beatriz Paredes, and Jose Narro Robles. All Indian and peasant leaders and representatives repeatedly expressed their desire for progress through dialogue. The leaders asked Secretary Carlos Rojas to set up a meeting between the Indian and peasant organizations and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis in an attempt to reach agreements that will guarantee justice in Chiapas. One of the more important proposals made during the meeting was the establishment of a produce wholesale program for the conflict area.
