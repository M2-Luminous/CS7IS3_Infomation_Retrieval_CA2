ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Secretary proposes to amend the Student Assistance General Provisions and Federal Family Education Loan program regulations. These amendments are needed to implement changes in the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and to improve the monitoring and accountability of institutions and third-party servicers participating in the student financial assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs). The changes would establish requirements governing contracts between institutions and third-party servicers to administer any aspect of an institution's participation in those programs. In addition, the changes would strengthen sanctions against institutions for violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements and establish similar sanctions for third-party servicers. The changes also would establish standards of administrative and financial responsibility for third-party servicers that administer any aspect of a guaranty agency's or lender's participation in the Federal Family Education Loan programs. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning these proposed regulations should be addressed to Mr. Greg Allen, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., room 4318, Regional Office Building 3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5343.
