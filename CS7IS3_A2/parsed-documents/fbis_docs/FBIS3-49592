Also attending were representatives of international organizations. President Berisha greeted the participants in the reception and Romanian Ambassador George Miku, dean of the diplomatic corps, greeted on behalf of foreign diplomats. Firstly, I would like to wish you and your families, your governments, peoples and countries wholeheartedly a Happy New Year, President Berisha said at the beginning of his greeting and added: The year that elapsed some days ago was for us, Albanians, a year of efforts, sacrifices and challenges as well as a year which greatly consolidated Albania's turn on the road of democracy, which marked an important development and progress of the reform in the political, legislative, economic and institutional fields. In 1993, the human rights and freedoms were further expanded in legislation and in life, the rule of law is functioning increasingly better. The economic reform in its major components, that is in the financial aspect, the privatization of the economy, the growth of production and attraction of foreign investment, has marked considerable progress, which, I hope, will make Albania in the future a country of fully successful reforms. 1993 was also the year of our great efforts to overcome the serious consequences of isolation, to construct a foreign policy based on the principle of reciprocity and in accordance with our national interests, which aim is to realize Albania's integration into Europe and the international community, to establish cooperation and friendly relations with all those who want and respect those values which are so sacred now for all the peoples. I believe that to this end have also served the visits to Albania by heads of states, prime-ministers and high ranking government members from countries of the region, Europe and the world. Likewise, the treaties of friendship, agreements of economic, military, cultural cooperation with many countries have led to a closer and greater cooperation of our country with your countries, with international institutions and organizations, with the European Union, NATO, and other organizations. Naturally, our most serious difficulties during the past year were poverty and unemployment. But alongside these, the contradictions that have arisen from the conflict in Bosnia made that old quarrels and grudges reappear on our horizon as well. But, it is important to note that we proved to be determined to solve disagreements through tolerance, dialogue and negotiations, avoiding their aggravation to open conflicts. We also proved our resolution to follow a policy of good neighborliness and friendship with all those neighbouring and non-neighbouring countries that are for such a friendship and abide by the same principles as we do. Honourable ambassadors and representatives of international institutions and organizations, I would also like to stress that of extremely importance for our achievements have been the aid of the countries and institutions you represent and your personal commitment to realize this aid and cooperation. Therefore I would like to express our profound and eternal gratitude to the governments, institutions and citizens of the countries you represent for the generous aid they have given and are giving to Albania. Ladies and gentlemen, This year Albania is facing serious challenges and difficulties. We are optimistic because the all-sided progress of the reform during 1993 has restored in the people a great faith in it. It has created conditions for us to solve the problems for 1994 with success. The reform in our country has established closer relations of Albania with the other friendly countries and nations. Cooperation with these countries has been and will be of primary importance for Albania's integration into Europe. Our main objectives for 1994 are related with the privatization of large and medium-scale enterprises, creation of the market of vouchers, encouragement of foreign investment, reduction of unemployment, improvement of infrastructure, greater integration of Albania into Europe and international institutions, prevention of the conflict in the region and a correct solution of the question of the Albanians in Kosova and in all former Yugoslavia. All the above are our objectives which call for great efforts and support. Ladies and gentlemen, Our road and also others' toward progress and stability has become difficult due to Bosnia syndrome. This is the most ominous syndrome that has affected our continent since 1945. On a local plane it was characterized by an devastating war and aggression and an unprecedented genocide. But it is not a local syndrome, that is of a single country or region. This syndrome is also international and precisely on the international plane it may probably have the most catastrophic consequences. In this respect, I would say that Bosnia syndrome is a result of the lack of responsibility and loyalty and courage of international community to the fundamental principles and laws which guarantee order, peace and stability in the world. Consequently, it may be also considered as a syndrome of complete or partial paralysis of those principles which immediately lead to the blocking of international institutions (suffice it to mention that out of several resolutions and decisions of the Security Council, NATO, and the European Union, the embargo is the only one, which has been implemented, though not completely). The consequences of this paralysis in a long-term future may be extremely disastrous. They may encourage and permit the revival of rivalries and ambitions, claims of the past, which may gradually replace the spirit of cooperation with that of confrontation, and which may lead to several consequent conflicts with unprecedented results for us and the generations to come. Therefore, let's wish that the year 1994 and the NATO summit scheduled for today be a success in returning loyalty to the international principles on which is based our peace and security, in condemning aggression and raising efficiency of international institutions and creating a new climate of fostering a close cooperation among Eastern and Western countries. In this regard I would like to confirm that we have supported and continue to support the initiative of "Partnership for Peace," but considering it not as a stage of fixed classification, but as an active preparatory process for Albania and other Eastern countries to become NATO members. In this respect I would like to stress that because of Albania's strong historic relations with the West and accidental relations with Russian factor, its withdrawal from the Warsaw Treaty in the 60s, its strategic geographic position, the intensive cooperation it has already developed with NATO, and because of the fact that Albania was the first country to present its official request to become a NATO member, undoubtedly this request for membership to the alliance deserves to be considered first. Wishing once again a good year I want to assure you that Albania is and will continue to be ready to develop the spirit of understanding, the honest and friendly cooperation with your countries and all those countries and institutions that will be interested in this. In his greeting on the occasion, the Romanian ambassador in Albania, Mr. George Miku, said that diplomatic representatives accredited to Tirana note with pleasure that during 1993 cooperation and relations between the countries and the international organizations which they represent and Albania have marked new positive developments and a significant progress of mutual interest. Mr. Miku said that during this year Albania will make new steps regarding the solution of economic problems on the road of its integration into the international community. Proceeding from the fact that the Albanian nation is equally an old and new nation, Mr. Miku expressed his belief that these objectives will be realised as soon as possible.
