FR940216-0-00013 FR940216-0-00007 To reduce the likelihood that an infant restraint would be placed in a vehicle seating position that has an air bag, the agency is requiring each infant restraint to be labeled with a warning against such use. The warning must state either: Warning: When your baby's size requires that this restraint be used so that your baby faces the rear of the vehicle, place the restraint in a vehicle seat that does not have an air bag. or Warning: Place this restraint in a vehicle seat that does not have an air bag. The former warning is used for convertible infant seats, i.e., seats that can use rear-facing for infants and forward-facing for older children. The latter is for seats that can be used only rear-facing for infants. The warning must be labeled on a red, orange or yellow background and be visible to a person installing the restraint. NHTSA is also requiring that infant restraint manufacturers provide information on the air bag/infant restraint interaction issue in their printed instructions accompanying the infant restraint. The manufacturers must provide a warning against using rear-facing restraints in seating positions equipped with air bags, and explain the reasons for, and consequences of, not following the warning. NHTSA has already required vehicle manufacturers to provide warnings and information about the interaction of air bags and rear-facing infant restraints. This information must be placed on the sun visors in vehicles with air bags and provided in the vehicle owner's manual. (This requirement is included in the rule implementing the provision in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act requiring the agency to mandate air bags at all front outboard seating positions in passenger cars, and in light trucks and multipurpose vehicles. 58 FR 46551, September 1, 1993.) Today's rule supplements that requirement to increase the likelihood that parents will be made aware of the possible effect of a deploying air bag on an infant restraint. Further, when the vehicle itself is labeled, parents will be provided the safety information even if the infant restraint they are using lacks the label required by today's final rule (which could happen if the infant restraint were manufactured before the effective date of today's rule). The requirements adopted in today's document are substantially similar to those NHTSA proposed in the April 1993 NPRM. The text proposed in the notice for convertible seats (which are designed for use by both an infant and toddler) and infant restraints read, respectively:
