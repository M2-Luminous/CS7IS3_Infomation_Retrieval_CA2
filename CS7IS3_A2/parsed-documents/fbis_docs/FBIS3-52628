The president told the students: "Even if oil prices fall to $10 a barrel, we will not face a problem." In his remarks to the Majles when presenting the budget bill, he said: "Oil is one of the country's major sources of income and recently income from this important resource has dropped 20 to 30 percent and has affected our Plan. This made us review and readjust our Plan and our budget. This was a very difficult task; hence, the two-week delay in presenting the budget." The basic problem is that the main slogan of our economy after the Islamic revolution has been the need to try to decrease the role of oil in our country's economy; and one of the major objectives stated in the First Plan was the need to alter the country's economic infrastructure and to gradually decrease the role of oil. If today we compare our budget with our budget four years ago, we will not see a perceptible change in the true dependence on oil incomes, and this point was extremely clear in the president's remarks as well. Now we should try to see why--despite extensive plans that have been implemented and the extensive investments that have been made--our dependence on oil incomes has not perceptibly changed. In part of his remarks to Martyr Beheshti University students, the president stated that the drop in the exchange rate is due to the psychological atmosphere that has been created and that the drop in oil prices is a plot by world arrogance. The issue is that if we have really reached a stage where even the drop in oil prices to $10 a barrel is not a problem for us, then why--during the past one month--has there been a 100 percent rise in the exchange rate of the dollar? If between 20 to 30 percent of this stems from the psychological atmosphere and because of middlemen, then the remaining 50 to 60 percent definitely stems from the drop in oil prices that form a large part of our country's foreign exchange income. Or if we glance at the figures in next year's budget, we can see that more than 50 percent of our country's incomes will be from the sale of oil. Under these conditions, can the sudden drop in the price of oil to almost half--a resource that represents 50 percent of our income--not create acute problems for us? It is true that within the framework of our macroeconomic plans, a large part of foreign exchange allocations for basic and industrial products has dropped but because of uncalculated economic and commercial policies, this foreign exchange economizing has not materialized. On the contrary, an unrestrained quantity of foreign exchange has been spent for the import of consumer and luxury goods. In these four years, because of the implementation of positive economic projects such as the petrochemical, aluminum, steel, and other industries, we have been able to save on between $1-$2 billion in foreign exchange each year--which is an extremely optimistic figure--but we have spent billions of dollars to import luxury items such as color television sets, household goods, cars, Coca Cola, chocolate, clothing, and other unnecessary items. If we accept the above-mentioned facts, then we will see that these unrestrained imports have wasted all our savings or our foreign exchange incomes from our exports of industrial and non-industrial goods. This is why oil and income from it during the past four years have continued to play a key role in current expenditures and in economic and development plans. And it is because of this that the fluctuations in the dollar and foreign exchange rates have been between 100 to 120 percent. This fluctuation and drop is because of the weakness of our national currency, and the weakness of our national currency is because of the fact that our true gross national product is low. If economizing in foreign exchange and in foreign exchange incomes coupled with economic projects could have led to economic investments, the gross national product could have increased and a rise in the gross national product could have paved the way for a brighter future and the repayment of our foreign debts. And if correct plans had been drawn up, we would not have faced acute problems that we are facing today in meeting our foreign exchange commitments. Saying that such debts should not have existed in the First Plan is unprincipled. But the fact these debts have reached the level they have during the past four years is because of our failure to create a balance between incomes and expenditures and the implementation of economic plans. Stating these points is in no way a criticism and should be considered only to be within the framework of our interests because basically, the ability to see realities and to create a correct basis for plans and programs can help the government achieve the objectives that it has laid out.
