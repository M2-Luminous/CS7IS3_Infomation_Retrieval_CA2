Some time ago Vladimir Volfovich came to Paris, where Eduard Limonov, who was great friends with him at the time, organized for Zhirinovskiy a warm meeting with Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the extreme right-wing National Front, and also a news conference attended by two French journalists and four Russian ones. In the opinion of certain commentators, the French have no formal grounds for refusing the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] chairman a visa. Zhirinovskiy, who claims that the LDP is closer in its views to the ruling Rally for the Republic party than to the National Front, would like to meet with Jacques Chirac, chairman of the Rally for the Republic and mayor of Paris. "I am against such a meeting, which will lend legality to someone who openly espouses fascist views," Pierre Lelouch, National Assembly deputy and Chirac's foreign policy adviser, declared in this regard. A number of French public organizations have already come out against Zhirinovskiy's visit. The official position was expounded most clearly by Alain Lamassoure, minister for European affairs. France, he said, cannot tolerate the statements which the LDP chairman has made concerning Bulgaria, the Romanian people, Finland, Turkey, and other countries. It is perfectly clear, the minister emphasized, that unless he changes his position, we will hardly be able to receive him in France. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is of the same opinion. This warning from Paris, however, does not seem to have had any effect. To all appearances, Vladimir Volfovich has energetically begun making travel arrangements. One of the stages in his preparations was an interview with a woman presenter for France's TF-1 television station against a backdrop of the Kremlin. (Incidentally, the Western press writes that Zhirinovskiy is now demanding $300 for a five-minute newspaper interview and many times more for a television one. At least, he asked one U.S. station for 60,000 "greenbacks"). The LDP chairman intimidated people with the war which will break out in Russia if events develop as before, and with wars in general -- from India to Serbia. He announced that Chernomyrdin will be replaced as premier in March -- no, not by Zhirinovskiy but by a more neutral figure. He behaved aggressively -- which can hardly have pleased the French. Bonn -- After Zhirinovskiy promised to "remove" an official of the FRG Consular Service in Sofia, declaring that he is still backed by the KGB and its best secret agents in Bulgaria, even those German mass media which reacted comparatively restrainedly to the previous threats against Germany by the "lawyer's son" (to arrange a second Chernobyl or send back the Russian troops being withdrawn from Germany) took an interest in him. Even if Zhirinovskiy receives a diplomatic passport as a parliamentarian, a government spokesman emphasized, this will not mean he has the right of free entry to Germany, and he will in any case have to apply for a visa. Along with seven people accompanying him, Zhirinovskiy was intending to spend 18 days in Germany and indicated as the purpose of the visit participation in a "European conference" supposedly to be held in Berlin. But all attempts by official establishments and journalists to find the organizers of this conference were in vain. Nor was it possible to establish which firm had invited him to Berlin. The name which Zhirinovskiy himself indicated in the appropriate column of the form could equally well have applied to at least 20 very diverse enterprises.
