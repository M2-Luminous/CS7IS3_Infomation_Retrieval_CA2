FBIS4-59572 "drnes094_s_94008" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA Iran Reaction Continues to Alleged Embassy Bugging Reaction Continues to Alleged Embassy Bugging `Abundant Problems' Hinder Ties LD1305203294 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in English 1930 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305203294 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran English BFN [Station commentary] [Text] The discovery of a transmitter equipped with a microphone inside a wall in the Islamic Republic of Iran's [IRI] embassy in London has led to the disclosure of Britain's intelligence and spying operations, know as ME6 [as heard] against the IRI. Iran's deputy foreign minister in European and US affairs, Mr. Mahmoud Va'ezi, in an exclusive interview with the Central News Bureau of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was broadcast on the nationwide television channel last night, exposed further details of the ME6 spying operations against Iran's embassy in London and considered it as the British statesmen weakness in Irano-British relations. Iran's deputy foreign minister also said: Following the disclosure of this issue, the British charge d'affaires in Tehran was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and Iran's severe protest was conveyed to the British Government. In response to the question as to what impact will these kinds of anti-diplomatic acts leave on the two countries relations, Mr. Va'ezi said: Irano-British relations are not normal for they have been faced with abundant problems. The main issue is the existence of certain (?roles) in the British Government. Mr. Va'ezi's direct reference to this issue that problems in the Irano-British relations arise from groupings inside the Conservative British government is significant in view of problems which have led to weakness in John Major's government. It shows that the British statesmen have problems in following a coordinated policy in relation to Iran. Bringing up such claims as links between Iran and the Irish strugglers, which was categorically denied by Iran, further discredited John Major's government. On this basis, spying operations in a foreign embassy, which against all the international accepted standards and diplomatic practice, will put further pressure on the Conservative British government. Some analysts consider John Major's weakened position as the factor behind such controvertial operations by the ME6 and they argue that the British officials' silence indicates difference of views and crisis which exist in the British Government. Nevertheless, since the Iranian Government is waiting for the British Government's answer, the British statesmen are unlikely to keep their silence. Hence they have to explain about their political mistakes.
