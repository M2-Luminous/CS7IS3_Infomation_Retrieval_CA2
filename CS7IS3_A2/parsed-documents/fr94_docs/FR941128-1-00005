Authority: Sections 5(b) (6) and (21) of the Small Business Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 634(b)(6) and 648; Pub. L. 101&hyph;515, 101 Stat. 2101; Pub. L. 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2814; Pub. L. 102&hyph;366, 106 Stat. 986; and Pub. L. 102&hyph;395, 106 Stat. 1828. §130.100 Introduction. (a) Objectives. (1) The overall objective of the SBDC program is to create a broad-based system of assistance for the small business community. To accomplish these objectives, SBDCs link resources of the Federal, State and local governments with the resources of the educational community and the private sector to meet the specialized and complex needs of the small business community. (2) SBDCs are intended to be responsive to local needs in providing assistance to the small business community as mutually identified by the SBA Project Officer and the SBDC Director. (b) Overview. The SBDC program shall be under the general management and oversight of the SBA. However, in keeping with the legislative authority for the SBDC program, the SBA recognizes that a partnership exists between the SBA and the recipient organization for the delivery of assistance to the small business community. Services shall be provided pursuant to a Cooperative Agreement. The SBA shall also consult with SBDC Directors and recognized organizations representing SBDCs in the formulation of the annual Program Announcement and the development of other program guidelines. (c) Incorporation of amended references. All references in these regulations to OMB Circulars, Standard Operating Procedures, other SBA regulations, and other sources of SBA policy guidance are intended to incorporate all ensuing changes or amendments to such sources. §130.110 Definitions. (a) Applicant organization: The eligible entity under §130.200 which applies for Federal funding to operate an SBDC network. (b) Budget period: The 12-month period in which expenditure obligations are incurred by a SBDC. This period must coincide with either the calendar year or the Federal fiscal year. (c) Cash match: Non-Federal funds allocated specifically to the operation of the SBDC network equaling no less than fifty percent of the Federal contribution. Cash Match includes Direct costs committed by the applicant or recipient organization and SBDC service providers, to the extent that such costs are committed as part of the specific line item Direct costs verified by their certifying representative prior to funding. As an example, Cash Match would include non-Federal salaries and fringe benefits paid to employees of the SBDC. Cash Match does not include: (1) Funds contributed from other Federal sources; (2) Program income or fees collected from small businesses receiving assistance; or (3) Indirect costs, overhead costs or in-kind contributions. (d) Cognizant agency: The Federal agency, other than the SBA, which has established an indirect cost rate for budgetary and funding purposes for a recipient organization or sponsoring SBDC organization. Normally, this is the agency from which the organization has its largest grant or receives its greatest amount of Federal funding. Once established for an organization, its Indirect cost rate is universal throughout the Federal government. (e) Conflict: For purposes of this part, Conflict means all programmatic disagreements, whether pre or post award, between an applicant or recipient organization and the SBA. (f) Cooperative agreement: The legal instrument pursuant to the terms of which the SBA awards Federal funds to recipient organizations and recipient organizations provide services to the small business community. Cooperative agreements are used because there is substantial involvement between the funding agency and the recipient organizations. It is also known at times as a Notice of Award.
