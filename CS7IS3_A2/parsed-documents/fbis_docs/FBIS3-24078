Zhirinovskiy, arrived in Petersburg yesterday. Apparently, one of the purposes of this trip is preparation for the March elections to the City Assembly. This is how V. Zhirinovskiy commented at the press conference on his party's defeat in Petersburg during the elections to the State Duma. He said that with the exception of the mafia--in which he included scholars, jurists, artistic profession, and "bomzh" [people without an established place of residence]--nobody voted for Russia's Choice. As to other voters suitable for the LDPR, according to Zhirinovskiy, Petersburg does not have any. The LDPR delegates delivered their request to postpone the elections to the Petersburg City Assembly to Dmitriy Sergeyev, chairman of the mayoralty committee on economic development. Naturally, they had gripes against the city's mayoralty as well. V. Zhirinovskiy told D. Sergeyev that "town governor Sobchak had no right to leave the city knowing that the LDPR delegation was coming." The mayoralty committee for economic development refused to comment on V. Zhirinovskiy's visit. The committee's press service only said that the meeting with the LDPR leader had not been planned, but they have managed to find half an hour for it.
