This authority said that in 1933 the futures market for nonferrous metals went through a "tightening and relaxing" phase. At the beginning of last year, the national economy heated up sharply, due chiefly to a rise in nonferrous metal prices, which dropped gradually in the second and third quarters to finally bottom out in October, the lowest point for the whole year. After this, following an improvement in the national economy, prices on nonferrous metals rose again, though not to the level of the first part of the year. Price fluctuations for the chief nonferrous metals this past year are described as follows: Copper: China has a short supply of copper. Output in 1993 was 710,000 tons, an increase of about 12 percent over that last year. As copper use required 800,000 tons, the shortfall was met partly by imports. International prices on copper which dipped in early May and late October, led to sizeable increases in copper imports. Adding the imports of copper, copper alloys, and copper processing materials for the year, estimated to range from 350,000 to 400,000 tons, the available copper supply totalled around 1.11 million tons. After allowing 150,000 tons for normal inventory stocks, the excess which added up to 200,000 to 250,000 tons created great pressures on the domestic copper market. From January to September, the price of copper inventories at the Shenzhen Nonferrous Metals Exchange was maintained between 19,000 yuan to 22,500 yuan per ton. Since mid-September, copper prices began sliding sharply, finally bottoming out in mid-October at 16,700 yuan per ton, but rising again to about 18,500 yuan per ton by the end of December. In comparison with international copper prices fluctuating in the range of $600 U.S. per ton, the fluctuation range of 6,800 yuan per ton in domestic copper prices basically reflect the trend in the international market. Aluminum: Aluminum output in China last year reached 1.2 million tons. Imports of aluminum and aluminum alloys were roughly 170,000 tons. The total amount of aluminum expended during the year was around 1.3 million tons, so supply and demand of aluminum on the domestic market were basically balanced. From January to March, when the people's currency used to regulate foreign exchange showed acute variation, aluminum prices at the Shenzhen Nonferrous Metals Exchange remained between 12,400 yuan and 12,950 yuan. Because of the great pressure of imports and the effect that the rapid drop in aluminum prices on the international market had, aluminum prices at the Shenzhen exchange finally stabilized around 12,000 yuan per ton. Lead and Zinc: Besides meeting domestic needs, China's supply of lead and zinc had surplus amounts available for export. In 1993, the output of lead and zinc in China were 400,000 tons and 800,000 tons respectively, valued at 7,860 yuan to 8,000 yuan per ton. The trend was stable. Tin: Besides adequately meeting domestic needs, most of China's tin output was exported. In 1993, tin output was about 49,000 tons, an increase of 34 percent over the year before. The amount expended domestically was 13,000 tons, comparable to amounts expended the previous year. Tin prices last year showed great fluctuation, between 43,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan per ton. One reason for this was partly excessive supply over demand, and another was a sudden drop in international tin prices in mid-September to $4,300 U.S. per ton. Nickel: In 1933, China's output of nickel was about 30,000 tons, an increase of 1.72 percent over that for the year before. The amount of nickel imports was about 9,000 tons, making the total supply of nickel available at 39,000 tons. As the amount of nickel expended was 38,000 tons, supply and demand were basically balanced. However, affected by international price fluctuations, domestic nickel prices in 1933 were found to range between 58,000 yuan and 48,300 yuan per ton, a rather substantial fluctuation. The main trends concerning the market for nonferrous metals in 1994 will now be discussed. Because the supply of nonferrous metals on the international market exceeds demand, inventories at the London Metals Exchange were as high as 600,000 tons for copper; for aluminum, 2.4 million tons; for lead, 300,000 tons; for zinc, 880,000 tons; for tin, 19,000 tons; and for nickel, 120,000 tons. This showed a considerable range of increases over inventories for the year before. Against such a background, and right at a time when the building of China's socialist market economy is entering a new stage, and reforms in finance, international trade, and capital investment are opening up on a broad scale, China's nonferrous metals market is facing an opportunity and a challenge at the same time. For 1994, output estimates for the main nonferrous metals are noted as follows: copper, 800,000 tons; aluminum, 1.35 million tons; lead, 410,000 tons; zinc, 750,000 tons; tin, 35,000 tons; and nickel, 32,000 tons. These figures all showed rather large increases in output. But output expended is expected to reach 900,00 tons, 1.1 million tons, 350,000 tons, 709,000 tons, 15,000 tons, and 40,000 tons respectively. The trading pattern in nonferrous metals will show that copper and nickel will still depend on imports to meet part of their needs, though some of the lead, zinc, and aluminum will have some excess for export, while a good part of the tin will be exported. In 1994, because international trade has great hopes for economic recovery in countries such as Great Britain, the United States etc., that within a quarter, the international price for copper will undergo a substantial rise, though the range may not be as broad as that for the year before. Under such circumstances, domestic copper prices may show a noticeable rise possibly to a figure as high as 22,000 yuan per ton, and follow the slide of international copper prices and drop. For the year, the fluctuations may range between 18,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan per ton. International prices for aluminum are affected by international copper prices, in that at the beginning of the year, prices may rise, though not steeply. Because of this, domestic prices for aluminum at the beginning of the year can be expected to stabilize at 12,500 yuan per ton, but very quickly would be subject to depression. For the year, prices can be expected to remain at an average of 12,000 yuan per ton. Peak prices for lead, zinc, tin, and nickel in 1994 are also expected to appear in the beginning of the year. As domestic prices for lead and nickel in 1994 are affected by the international market, they would likely stabilize at more than 3,900 yuan per ton and 48,000 yuan per ton, respectively. Domestic prices for tin are most depressing, and their overall level during the year is expected to remain around 16,000 yuan per ton. Zinc prices are expected to be sustained around 8,000 yuan per ton.
