Vice Prime Minister Guy Coeme first, publicly and bitterly. Bitter because, in his own words, he was the victim of a sustained, merciless campaign in both the media and political circles. The daily bombardment became too much for him. Now Coeme is free to organize his defense, as it were. Shortly after, he was followed by Guy Spitaels, who resigned as minister-president of the Walloon region. Walloon Interior Minister Guy Mathot who had been named in a whole list of scandals, and is heavily suspected of involvement in the Agusta-Cools affair, was -- very noticeably -- the last to go. Impudence beyond all measure. The PS [Walloon Socialist Party] dropped Coeme to save the government. About time. In the last three weeks, the party had remained firmly behind the three PS ministers, claiming that they were innocent; that there was nothing for which to reproach them; that it was a party political maneuver, a plot on the part of resentful Flemings who could not bear to look the new, pragmatic Wallonia in the face. This life raft was deflated rapidly, in just a few hours. The situation became untenable particularly when it emerged unmistakably that the main evidence against the PS ministers came from within the party itself. The result is a historic blow against the PS leadership, which is shaking the party to its foundations. Torn by internal disputes and vendettas, crushed and humiliated by the forced resignation of three ministers, Party Chairman Philippe Busquin has been left standing knee-deep in the rubble. What still remains of the dream of socialism? What still remains of the most powerful party in Wallonia? Are the hard times for the PS now over and done with? Does it mean that the Agusta story is now a closed book? No. Not only because by no means all the information about this Italian helicopter order has emerged yet. The role played by the economic minister at the time, Willy Claes, remains disputed. And what about the senior army commanders? Why was Commander in Chief Jose Charlier so enthusiastic in his defense of Guy Coeme? However, above all, the murder of Andre Cools remains unsolved. The theory of a link with the Agusta affair, of some dreadful vendetta within the PS, is gaining ground. We need to know who issued the orders, who knew, and who carried out the act. This inquiry must not be allowed to come to a halt. The resignations of the PS ministers must be the cracks of the whip that urge an accelerated denouement of the affair. The damage caused to the government cannot be estimated for the time being. However, one thing is certain: A political earthquake of these proportions has left the Dehaene team shaking at the knees. The PS is a shadow of its former self, and many members of the party are thinking of revenge. In such a situation, and with even more revelations hanging over them, who would want to commit themselves fully to budgetary measures or contentious bills? Who will dare -- or can afford -- to pretend that there is nothing wrong? The entire political sphere is being turned upside down, and a murder was required to make this happen. Over the years, people have gotten away unpunished with far too much. That is disturbing. Even more disturbing are some reactions, especially in Wallonia, which give rise to suspicions that people find it normal for politicians to do their best for the region, party, and supporters, even if their actions do not really comply with the rules. These kinds of Italian practices must disappear. And not just in Wallonia, but here too. The resignation of the PS ministers, or even a government crisis, must not be allowed to stand in the way of the process of purification. The political class no longer has any choice.
