Zhang Yufeng, rumored in China and abroad to be Mao Zedong's "secret wife," was once Mao's confidential secretary and looked after Mao in his daily life over a long period of time. She recently broke her silence, which lasted over a decade, and accepted an interview with the mainland's top movie star, Liu Xiaoqing [0491 2556 1987], special hostess of the television history program entitled "Mao Zedong's Path." At the interview, she revealed how she met Mao Zedong and what she saw and heard during that time. "When I first began to work, I was with the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau as a dining car attendant and train announcer. Later, I was selected and transferred to the special purpose section of the Ministry of Railways. In 1960, at the age of 17, I was transferred to Chairman Mao's exclusive train. My first errand was to serve on the train that took Chairman Mao to Guangzhou, where he was to attend a discussion on the formulation of the 60-item agricultural policy. The train was in Guangzhou for quite some months. At the beginning, I did not know who the master of the train was and because we followed very strict discipline, I dared not try to find out. The exclusive train had 12 cars. Train attendants were not allowed to enter cars that were for leaders' use only without permission. On our way back to Beijing, Chairman Mao and the crew had a photo taken at the platform of Anhui's Bengbu Station, and it was then that I saw him for the first time. In 1962, I was transferred to Chairman Mao's compartment to work, and in 1970, I was transferred to Zhongnanhai to work by the chairman's side. I started as an ordinary member of the staff. In 1974, I was appointed "confidential secretary." "I had only seen Chairman Mao on pictures or in movies. When he appeared before my eyes in real life, I was very excited, so much so that I even forgot to greet him. But later, when I was with him from morning to night every day, I was no longer as excited as when I first met him." "In my eyes, in terms of status, he was our great leader; in terms of knowledge, he was my teacher; in terms of age and the emotional aspect, he was like my father. When I went to his residence in Zhongnanhai to work, he was already a 77-year-old man. By that time, he was suffering from a number of health problems. Sometimes he was in a bad mood. He showed all his emotions: Joy, anger, sorrow, and grievances." Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao ever lose his temper with you? Zhang replied: Everybody has a temper, and so did Chairman Mao. When we did something wrong, or when he was in a bad mood, he would have a fit of temper. For instance, one time he was reading some documents and kept putting off his mealtime. I saw the dishes were getting cold, so I reminded him to have his meal first. Chairman got angry over this and said: Don't you see I am reading documents? At that moment, I felt wronged and thought: I do not deserve criticism for doing my best to serve you. Now I can see that I should not have blamed him. He was very old then, and yet he had to take care of major matters of the country. The international climate was fast-changing and stability at home was also in question. He was under a lot of stress, so his mood swings were normal. After the fit, he would be over it and never brood on it. Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did you feel very blessed to work by Chairman Mao's side? Zhang said: I only felt it was a big responsibility. Even to this day, I still feel the heavy burden on my shoulders. Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Lin Biao's case have any effect on Chairman Mao's health? Zhang replied: Yes, it did. Not just the 13 September incident when Lin Biao fled the country. It can be traced to the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee in 1970 when his conflict with Lin Biao had intensified, which gave him a negative mental impact. After Lin's defection, he got very ill. From then on, his health went downhill. Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao take tonics? Zhang replied: Chairman never believed that medicines could cure everything. He often went for a walk and consciously ate mixed grains, such as corn and sweet potatoes. Sometimes he would also eat some wild herbs, such as purslane. He did not go for wheat products and found it very hard to understand why people in my native home eat dumplings in the New Year season. He said: What is so nice about dumplings? He would rather eat brown rice [considered inferior rice] than dumplings or steamed buns. But he also routinely took some tonics, such as American ginseng and vitamins. Liu Xiaoqing asked: What was Chairman Mao's attitude toward death? Zhang replied: One day, I heard the chairman talking about a proverb which goes: At the age of 73 to 84, one would leave this world even without the King of Hell's invitation. So I comforted him and said: You have a good constitution. Any problem will go after a good treatment. But to my surprise, he did not like what I said. He said: You are going against nature's law. Where there is life, there is death. Everybody has to die. To say that someone would not die is just nonsense. He was a materialist. He kept a composed and serene look even to the last moment of his life. Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao leave a will? Zhang said: As everybody knows, as early as in 1957, Chairman Mao advocated that central leaders be cremated after death and set an example by being the first to sign on the resolution about cremation. Liu Xiaoqing: Chairman Mao was still learning foreign languages in his old age. How well did he speak them? Zhang replied: The chairman liked to learn foreign languages. He did not stop even after he was ill in his final years. He used English in conversations with foreign visitors. Interpreters said he spoke quite well. Liu Xiaoqing: Did Chairman Mao know about the big earthquake at Tangshan? Zhang replied: Yes, he did. Before the earthquake, in June, he had an attack of myocardial infarction and was rescued. By July, his condition was a bit unstable [as published], but he could not move or get out of bed. When the earthquake struck on 28 July, we were woken by the tremor and immediately rushed to Chairman Mao's study [shu wu 2579 1450]. He was still lying in bed. The medical personnel opened a big sheet and covered the bed in case something dropped from above. The chairman was in his right mind at that time and was aware that an earthquake had happened. Unable to say anything, he just feebly waved his hand, probably telling us not to panic. The special interview, originally timed for eight minutes, actually lasted one-and-a-half hours. The time for screening the interview has not been decided.
