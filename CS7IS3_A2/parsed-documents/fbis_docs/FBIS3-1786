This program is being introduced to answer questions raised by taxpayers on how to further implement the new tax system. Now, I would like to introduce the leading comrades who are here today. This is Comrade Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and this is Comrade Zhang Zhongcheng, chief economist of the State General Administration of Taxation. This is Comrade Jiang Qiangui, director of the Enterprise Department of the State Economic and Trade Commission. Now, I would like to ask Vice Minister Chen Qingtai to speak during the first lecture. [Chen] Viewers and comrades: To further study and publicize the new tax system and new tax codes, and to promote a smooth transition from the old tax system to the new one, the State Economic and Trade Commission and the State General Administration of Taxation are cosponsoring this program called "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax System," with the assistance of China Central Television Station. It is common knowledge that the current reform of the tax system is of great intensity and covers a wide range of areas; it is a major measure for our country to establish macroeconomic regulation and control in a socialist market economy. Generally speaking, the new tax system has been implemented smoothly since it was introduced on 1 January, and no major problems have arisen. In specific areas, however, we have encountered one problem or another, and these problems require further efforts on our part. The first concerns our understanding of the new tax system. Some people, enterprises included, do not quite understand the new tax system. For example, they cannot clearly distinguish between taxes included in the calculated prices and those not included in those prices. They do not understand why the value-added tax should be counted as one not included in the calculated prices. Moreover, some problems have stemmed from distortions of the implementation process. Some localities and enterprises, for example, have not issued special invoices under various pretexts, thereby increasing the burden on enterprises further down the line in the taxation process. Also, the new tax system is very rich in content, and some problems arising from inadequate coordination exist in management and other specific areas. Besides, some special businesses have incurred additional tax burdens, and tax reduction and exemption policies have been abolished for other businesses as a consequence of the current reform of the tax system. These businesses find this hard to accept. We should seriously study these problems and solve them step by step. It should be noted that the current reform of the tax system is the sum total of sweeping and structural changes. Speaking from the viewpoint of the state, we have the overall situation under control by maintaining the total tax burden of enterprises at the same level. Changes in tax categories, tax rates, tax calculation methods, and taxation sectors, however, have inevitably led to increased or decreased taxes for individual enterprises. Enterprises should understand and absorb such changes. Whether enterprises, which are the mainstay of our country's economic construction and development, understand and effectively implement the new tax system can affect the stable development of our economy as a whole; it is also a basic condition that determines whether our tax system can make the transition smoothly. Hence, on the one hand, we should redouble our efforts to publicize and study the new tax system so that enterprises can have a more profound understanding of it; on the other, we should constantly uncover and study problems, and adopt timely measures to ensure the smooth implementation of the new tax system. In dealing with people who take advantage of tax reform to increase prices in order to make exorbitant profits, the state should take action to mete out punishment, as necessary, in accordance with the law, after conducting inspections and exercising supervision. For their part, enterprises should thoroughly study the new tax codes, master the essence of those codes, and protect their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the new tax codes. Moreover, enterprises should promptly bring to our attention, through normal channels, the lack of convergence and coordination between policies, laws, and regulations in the course of implementing the new tax system, in order to facilitate the solution of such problems. Last year, we successively held three study classes for factory directors and managers on reform of the tax system. We studied and publicized the basic guidelines and major contents of reform of the tax system, and achieved some results in this respect. In holding those classes, we realized the problems that enterprises might encounter in the course of reforming the tax system, as well as problems that were of concern to them. Moreover, enterprises have brought to our attention new problems arising from this year's implementation of the new tax system. Therefore, we decided, after discussion, to introduce this special television program, to be presented in a question-and-answer format, with the main purpose of answering questions, in a single forum, concerning some problems that enterprises have encountered in implementing the new tax system, especially problems of a common nature. This will help people better understand the new tax system and facilitate its implementation. Besides, we are introducing this special program to promote an in-depth study and implementation of the new tax system nationwide. [Xu] Well, now we will ask Chief Economist Zhang Zhongcheng of the State General Administration of Taxation to speak. [Zhang] The new tax system to be implemented starting this year is a relatively complete and profound reform in the history of formulating the industrial and commercial tax system. It is also a relatively big adjustment in the structure of the tax system. The purpose of the current tax reform, to put it in short, is to establish a tax system to cope with the need for the development of a socialist market economy so as to better promote a sustained, fast and healthy development of the economy. The guiding principles for the current tax reform are as follows: First of all, the principles are to unify the tax law, levy tax in a fair manner, simplify the tax system, reasonably divide the jurisdiction in taxation, straighten up relations between the state and enterprises and between the state and individuals, and guarantee the state's revenue income. In the current reform of tax system, we have adhered to the fundamental principle of strengthening the central authorities' macrocontrol and whipping up the enthusiasm of both the central authorities and localities. Second, they are to levy tax in a fair manner to promote fair competition. Third, they are to simplify the tax system. I think we should mention one more important principle: that our current reform of tax system has followed the principle of maintaining the original level of total taxation of society on the subject of the tax burden. In other words, we will not increase the aggregate amount of taxes on enterprises because of the current reform of the tax system. The state revenue income also will not be reduced because of the reform of tax system. Basically, we will maintain the original level of total taxation of society. However, in the current reform, we have changed the tax rates by a great extent, in relative terms. Accordingly, it is quite possible that, among various enterprises, products and trade, the tax rate of some of the enterprises will be reduced, the tax burden of some of the enterprises will in the main remain the same, and the tax burden of a small number of enterprises may increase somewhat as compared with their tax burden before the reform. Therefore, on this question, we should implement the State Council's guidelines that those enterprises which will have a heavier tax burden should strive to change their operational mechanism and raise their own economic efficiency to absorb the relatively greater tax burden due to tax reform. We can also say that the increase of their tax burden will contribute to the entire reform of the country. The basic contents of the current reform are generally as follows: The current reform, because of the relatively great adjustment of the tax structure, will be a new issue for study by the broad masses of people as well as the broad masses of taxation cadres. So it is necessary to hold a question-and-answer session on the new tax system. Prior to answering questions, I wish to put forward some requests: First, to the broad masses of taxation cadres and taxation organizations at various levels: they must implement the tax law in a strict manner, seriously and penetratingly understand various problems in implementing the new tax system, conduct investigation and study in a deep-going manner, promptly and seriously solve all problems within the limit of tax law, put forward their suggestions through investigation and study for handling problems which cannot be solved by them and promptly report those problems to their higher taxation organizations up to the State General Administration of Taxation. We will solve these problems if they are within our power to do so. If we cannot solve these problems, we will report them to and ask for instructions from the higher leadership. Second, I would like to make several demands on taxpayers. 1) They must truthfully act in accordance with tax laws. This is very important. They must truthfully file tax returns and pay tax according to the regulations. 2) They must promptly report to tax office problems in implementing tax laws; their rational requests will be earnestly handled by the tax office. At the same time, they must further study the new tax provisions and, with the help and guidance of the tax office, acquire a better understanding of the tax laws and successfully implement them. 3) We also welcome people to raise questions to ensure that with the help of people in all quarters, the new tax system will be smoothly implemented. [Xu] Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and Zhang Zhongcheng, chief economist of the State General Administration of Taxation, have just explained the purpose and significance of this program, as well as the basics of the new tax law. Now, let us ask Jiang Qiangui, director of the Enterprise Department of the State Economic and Trade Commission, to briefly discuss the contents of the entire program.
