In May, having decided to procure either the COSIS 200k1 system of Germany's AE or the SSCSMK system of Britain's Baesema, the council asked the DLA for a document with which to evaluate the British firm's ability to deliver the system within the set period. Baesema forwarded the document and a bank affidavit guaranteeing its financial solvency to the DLA within a week. But the DLA concealed the British firm's documents and advised the council that it was not an adequate contractor because of its poor financial status and low credibility, misleading the council into selecting AE. The council's dominant opinion was that the British product was optimum for Korean destroyers and better than the German product, but the DLA's misinformation led the council to select the German system, the white paper says. The board recommended that the Defense Ministry take action against DLA deputy foreign procurement officer Yun Sam-song for producing the misinformation, and the ministry disciplined him.
