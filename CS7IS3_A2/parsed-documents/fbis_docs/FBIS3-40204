Power Shortages: An Opportunity for Electric Power Development in the West China's power shortages have continued for many years, and in particular, since a new round of rapid economic development began, the sluggishness of the electric power industry has become increasingly serious. When the state announced the policy decision that the country's energy development strategy should shift toward the West, the party committee and government of the Nei Monggol Autonomous Region wasted no time in setting the guidelines of making coal-fired power production the pace-setter and having the power industry stimulate both coal industry development and the comprehensive development of the economy. Nei Monggol has proved coal resources of 217.4 billion tons, and its long-term reserves may exceed 1.2 trillion tons. In both these respects, it is second in the country. It has 15 coal fields with reserves of more than 5 billion tons; the Ordos coal field has coal reserves equivalent to 10 percent of the national total and is the largest of the world's seven major coal fields. Nei Monggol has abundant water resources: the Yellow River, the Ergun River, Daihai Lake and Huangqihai Lake are all within its boundaries. The Yellow River flows through the large Wuhai, Dongsheng, and Junggar coal fields. There are 17 locations that are suitable for the construction of power plants with capacities of 1 million kW or more, with a total potential capacity of 35.47 million kW. Nei Monggol's territory spans the "three northern" regions; it is near industrially developed regions that are relatively resource-poor, and electric power markets in such areas as Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang offer extensive prospects. The question of whether to ship coal or transmit energy has been aggravated by the contradiction between rail transport and haulage capacity. But the problem is becoming better understood and views are maturing. In large-scale development of the electric power industry, the changeover to local resource conversion and from hauled coal to transmitted electricity will both decrease the pressure on the railroads and realize the objectives of a short construction cycle, low costs, and good benefits. Party secretary of the autonomous region Wang Qun [3769 5028] has repeatedly emphasized that "If the development of the energy industry can be done rapidly, it should not be done slowly, and if it can be done at a run it should not be done at a walk. We must make electric power lead the way, replace coal with electricity, have the coal industry stimulate the power industry, export more electric power outside the province, and convert resource advantages into economic advantages." As a result, the silent expanses of Mongolia have become the scene of bustling activity in the construction of an electric power base. Between 1988 and 1992, the region expended a total of 3.389 billion yuan to fund electric power construction. It installed 1.5098 million kW of new generating capacity, representing an average increase of 30 percent a year. Its total installed generating capacity has reached 4.103 million kW, and it has built 793 km of 220-kV transmission lines. In the western zone, the framework of a superhigh-voltage grid running eastward from Wulashan to Datong has been built, and power lines have been connected to the North China power grid and have been put into operation. In five years, a total of 81.787 billion kWh of electricity has been produced, yielding a profits tax of more than 1.6 billion yuan. Major electric power construction projects spread like wildfire, and "sun cities" sprang up across the land. In the course of five years, three 100,000-kW generating sets were added at Baotou, and the installed capacity at the Fengzhen power plant in the floodplain of the Yinma River reached 600,000 kW. The construction of the first stage of the Junggar power plant, with two 100,000-kW generating sets, has been completed. Work on the expansion of facilities at Hohhot, Yuanbaoshan, Tongliao, and Huiliuhe and on new construction projects at Haibowan, Yimin, Huolinhe, Youzhong, and Dalad has been whipped up to a superhigh pace. Magnificent blueprints for 17 large power plants with capacities of 100,000 kW or more have been issued. In the first six months of this year, Nei Monggol's electric power industry has experienced four gratifying events: a total output of 567.5 billion kWh and the transmission of 954 million kWh of electricity to North China, representing increases of 13.8 and 17.04 percent respectively over last year; payment of 255 million yuan in profits taxes, up 14.14 percent from the previous year; 80-percent implementation of 2.5 billion yuan in investment funds; and the signing of 13 equipment delivery contracts, representing a total of 4.6 million kW of capacity. Benefitting From Policies, and Using Others' Funds for Power Production Under a planned economy, the electric power industry receives centralized state investments for construction, prices are specified centrally by the state, and output, distribution and sales are controlled by government departments. As a result, very large investments are inherently unmanageable, the prices charged for electricity do not reflect production costs, the enterprises take on increasing debt, and investment capabilities are, in essence, lost. Nei Monggol's economic strength was limited, and even in the best years, the local financial departments could only squeeze out 30 or 40 million yuan in funds for electric power. In 1988, the leadership of the Nei Monggol Electric Power Management Office signed an eight-year funding and production agreement with the government of the autonomous region. This broke the stereotype of having exclusive government control of power production and began a new practice of independent operations, "having those who pay the money produce the power and receive the benefits," with unified creditor's rights. The contract specified that the profits paid annually to the finance organs would be entirely returned in the form of investments in electric power construction; it instituted new prices for new power generating facilities and new heat supply facilities; and those who used external funding for power production were not only to receive favorable consideration in state policies, but in addition would be given special consideration in taxation, land use, and the like. When this policy was announced, investors appeared in droves. In the last several years, they have established reliable investment partnership ties with a multitude of domestic financial groups and enterprises, as well as more than 10 countries and regions. The leadership of the Nei Monggol Electric Power Management Office further liberated its thinking by expanding funding channels. Cause for encouragement is the fact that this April, leaders from Beijing City and the Ministry of Electric Power personally visited Nei Monggol to discuss arrangements for the provision of electricity to the capital. For many years Beijing has been short of electric power, and power cutoffs and cutbacks are a frequent occurrence. This fact not only imposed serious constraints on Beijing's economic development and caused great inconvenience to the masses, but was also inconsistent with Beijing's status as the capital. On 23 April, the three parties signed a joint power generation agreement, whose first stage is about to begin. According to the agreement, by 1995 Beijing will have made contributions totaling 1.55 billion yuan, the installed generating capacity in Nei Monggol's western power grid will have increased from 1.835 million kW to 4 million kW, and the amount of electricity that it supplies to Beijing will have increased from 1.1 to 1.5 million kW, so that Beijing will no longer experience power shutoffs. The second stage will begin in 1996, and by the end of the Ninth 5-Year Plan, the installed capacity of Nei Monggol's western power grid will reach 12 million kW, enabling it to supply 5 million kW of electricity per year to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region. Will Electric Power Become the West's "Radiant Center"? China's electric power industry bears a heavy burden and has a long road to travel. This year, the Nei Monggol Autonomous Region party committee repeatedly emphasized the guiding ideas in accelerating power industry development. The Nei Monggol Electric Power Management Office drafted objectives and measures for the period through the end of the century in order to make electric power construction the "radiant center" that will bring prosperity to the western region. -- Make reform increasingly thorough, transform the mechanism, move toward markets, strengthen management, stabilize existing power generating facilities, implement capital construction investments of 1.83 billion yuan, commission 374,000 kW of generating capacity, and carry on effective preparatory work for new power plant construction. -- Make thorough use of advantages in resources, location, and policy, develop funding channels, attract large amounts of domestic and foreign construction investment. -- Jointly with large domestic power production groups, use such flexible and diverse forms as equipment investment partnerships to obtain domestically produced equipment. Concurrently, appoint experts to be responsible for obtaining equipment from the west and from Russia. Implement mutual guarantees for coal supply, power production, and transport, unite with organizations that use electricity to produce steel and aluminum, and assure that materials are delivered on time. The objectives are as follows: add 4.5 million kW of new generating capacity in the region by the end of the Eighth 5-Year Plan, with the total installed capacity reaching 8.25 million kW, and deliver 1.5 million kW of electricity to North China and 2.3 million kW to Northeast China; by the year 2000, bring the total installed generating capacity in the region to 21.369 million kW and deliver 5 million kW to North China and 6.5 million kW to Northeast China. A Japanese economist exclaimed in amazement that China is implementing a "concentric circle" strategy in its energy economy. As he expressed it, the Ordos is the inner circle, which will be the first to produce an effect and also the pivot which will receive the benefits first. The second circle, which radiates outward for 200 km, will constitute Nei Monggol's central economic region. Finally, using the world's most advanced technology, electric power will be transmitted outward over a radius of 1000 km. These radiating circles will thus encompass the central region, representing a third of China's area. Thus the radiating segments of circles or "gradient circles" produced by the relatively developed coastal regions will advance circle by circle into the interior, and the resource-rich great northwestern region will radiate its powerful electricity outwards in expanding circles. Ultimately, when the two sets of radiating circles coalesce into a network, the differences between northern and southern China and between eastern and western China will shrink rapidly.
