The new currency will have 100 percent backing in hard currency and gold. At the very onset of the programme, it will be backed by half a billion dollars, he said. The implementation of the programme for the monetary reconstruction will begin on Monday, January 24, and its primary objective will be to curb the world record hyperinflation, which amounted to one million percent in December. The old dinar will remain in circulation in parallel with the convertible dinar, but the government has decided to stop the issue of money which has no backing. The author of the idea of a "super dinar" said that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in spite of being under severe international sanctions for 20 months, has managed to secure a hard currency backing for the reconstruction of its monetary and fiscal system. The state should stimulate the return of capital which entrepreneurs, private banks and firms took out of the country in the past few years, since this could be the most substantial "outside" support to the new programme at the present time because of the financial blockade, Avramovic said. The exact amount of this capital is not clear--an estimated five billion dollars or more--but it would be a significant financial backing for the programme in its entirety for a long-term period, especially to the convertibility of the dinar. Experts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week turned down a Yugoslav Government request to join in the formulation of the stabilization programme. The United Nations (U.N.) Sanctions Committee has not answered Yugoslavia's request of December last year to thaw at least part of its hard currency reserves in foreign banks, which were frozen 20 months ago when the implementation of the U.N. sanctions began. Under the government programme, these funds would serve as a backing for the new sound national currency.
