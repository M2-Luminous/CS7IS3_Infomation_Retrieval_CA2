R&hyph;404A, which consists of HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted cold storage warehouses.

See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration. (17) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 Cold Storage Warehouses, New. Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers. (c) HFC&hyph;227ea. HFC&hyph;227ea is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;227ea under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (d) R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B. R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, propane, and HFC&hyph;125, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new cold storage warehouses. Testing of these blends with centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by the manufacturer. Further testing may resolve this uncertainty. For further information, see the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration. (e) R&hyph;404A. R&hyph;404A, which consists of HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration. (f) R&hyph;507. R&hyph;507, which consists of HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;143a, and HFC&hyph;134a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration. (g) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on ammonia under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (h) Evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to cold storage warehouses using CFC&hyph;12 or R&hyph;502. See the discussion on evaporative cooling under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (i) Desiccant cooling. Desiccant cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to cold storage warehouses using CFC&hyph;12 or R&hyph;502. See the discussion on desiccant cooling under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (j) High to low pressure stepdown. High to low pressure stepdown process is acceptable as an alternative technology to cold storage warehouses using CFC&hyph;12 or R&hyph;502. This process takes advantage of the work potential of pressurized natural gas. As its pressure is reduced from transmission pipes to the distribution system, the gas cools. This refrigeration is then used to cool a transfer medium such as water, which then cools the refrigerated space. It uses very little energy and produces no global warming emissions, since the gas is not burned. (k) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to cold storage warehouses using CFC&hyph;12 or R&hyph;502. See the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.
