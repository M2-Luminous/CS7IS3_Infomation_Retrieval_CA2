FR940505-1-00201 FR940505-1-00012 The FIP will not alter the fact that the motor vehicle emissions budgets for 1996, which are contained in the 15 percent SIPs submitted by California for these three nonattainment areas (required by Clean Air Act section 182(b)(1)(A)), must be used for the purposes of conformity according to the requirements of 40 CFR 51.448. If EPA disapproves such a SIP or finds it incomplete, the 1996 emissions budget shall be used for the purposes of conformity for 12 months following the final disapproval or incompleteness finding, if EPA explicitly states that the SIP submittal would have been considered approvable or complete with respect to requirements for emission reductions if all committed measures had been submitted in enforceable form (see 40 CFR 51.448(a)(3) and (c)(1)(iii)). However, if there are other reasons for the disapproval or incompleteness finding, time clocks will be started after which new plans and TIPs may not be found to conform and existing plans and TIPs will lapse. Budgets contained in any future state-submitted attainment and post-1996 RFP plans must also be observed. Such state-submitted budgets may not replace budgets established by the final FIP until the state-submitted budgets have been approved by EPA. Demonstrations of conformity to the FIP may use the same motor vehicle emissions model which EPA uses to demonstrate attainment in the final FIP, unless EPA announces a revision to the model. (In that case, a grace period for use of the latest motor vehicle emissions model applies, as described in 40 CFR 51.414.) The final FIP will be based on a VMT growth estimate which is the MPO's own growth projection at the time of FIP promulgation. Difficulty demonstrating consistency with the FIP's budget would therefore most likely be due to VMT growth which is higher than the MPO expected. The FIP does not propose any TCMs that are eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act. The Employee Commute Options program proposed for Sacramento might be eligible for such funding if it were adopted by local authorities, but EPA itself is not an eligible recipient. Therefore, determinations of conformity to the FIP will not have to demonstrate timely implementation of TCMs in the FIP. J. FIP Implementation by State and Local Agencies Congress has determined that the primary responsibility for air pollution control rests with state and local governments. CAA section 101(a)(3). Moreover, as discussed elsewhere in this NPRM, EPA lacks many of the authorities, instruments, and established local and regional organizations and trained staff to administer, on a daily basis, comprehensive air pollution control initiatives such as these FIPs, which affects hundreds of thousands of individual sources and activities. Massive federal intrusion would inevitably result if EPA were to shoulder the chief burden of enforcing the California FIP. Accordingly, EPA has attempted to design the FIP rules to ensure that, wherever possible, State and local implementation is encouraged and facilitated by the FIP's regulatory approach. Thus, for example, the FIP generally employs local California rule organization and terminology in the proposed stationary and area source rules, including the new source review permitting rules (40 CFR 52.284 through 52.289, and 52.304). 1. State and local obligation to incorporate FIP requirements in operating permits. In Title V of the 1990 CAA Amendments, Congress established an important new state responsibility. Title V and EPA's implementing regulations require state and local air pollution control agencies to adopt and submit for EPA approval a regulatory program for issuing operating permits to major stationary sources, sources covered by emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants pursuant to section 112 of the Act, sources covered by any new source performance standards set under section 111 of the Act, and affected sources under the acid rain program. The operating permits must contain necessary limits and conditions to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Act, including all provisions of the applicable SIP and the FIP. Title V includes specific requirements for EPA oversight and for sanctions against states for failure to adopt, administer, or enforce the operating permit program. Title V establishes the following timeframes for state and EPA action: 1. Program submittal by November 15, 1993; 2. EPA approval or disapproval within one year of program submittal, with the possibility of interim approval for up to two years; 3. EPA application of sanctions for failure to submit approvable programs, and establishment of a federal program by November 15, 1995, if a state or local program has not been approved; 4. Source operating permit application within one year after EPA approval (or interim approval) of a state or local program, or after EPA establishment of a federal program; 5. Issuance of all permits within three years after EPA approval of a state or local program or promulgation of a federal program; and 6. Operating permit application within one year of commencement of operation for new sources subject to New Source Review. On July 21, 1992, EPA promulgated 40 CFR part 70, specifying the minimum elements of state operating permit programs (57 FR 32250). EPA's promulgation makes clear the Agency's interpretation that approvable operating permit programs must provide that the applicable permit include FIP emission limitations and other FIP requirements (57 FR 32258). As noted, operating permits are required for all ``major'' stationary sources, as well as air toxics sources subject to requirements under section 112 of the Act (unless exempted), and sources subject to any new source performance standard under section 111. 105 In ozone nonattainment areas, section 182 defines major source according to the area's classification and the source's potential to emit VOC or NO X : 50 tons per year in ``Serious'' areas, 25 tons per year in ``Severe'' areas, and 10 tons per year in ``Extreme'' areas. 106 105 Part 70 provides that certain nonmajor sources, including those subject to standards under section 111 and 112, may be exempted from the obligation to obtain a part 70 permit until EPA completes a rulemaking to determine how the program should be structured for nonmajor sources. Section 70.3(b)(1). 106 For this purpose, Title I treats VOC and NO X sources somewhat differently. In areas qualifying for an exemption under section 182(f), NO X sources with the potential to emit less than 100 tons per year would not be considered major sources. None of the three FIP areas covered in this Notice, however, qualify for the exemption, and thus the major sources cutoff is the same in these areas for NO X as for VOC.
