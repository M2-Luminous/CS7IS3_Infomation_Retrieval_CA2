More than 10 very outdated submarines have accumulated at a division for dismantling submarines at the White Sea Naval Base in the roadstead of Severodvinsk port. Some of them have been there for more than 15 years, waiting to be dismantled. Yet not even the fuel from their nuclear reactors has been unloaded yet. There is simply nowhere to put it. Nuclear waste storage facilities in Murmansk and Severodvinsk are full to capacity. Because of the Northern Fleet's lack of money, the dismantling of the reactors and subsequent storage of the nuclear waste have been postponed for many years. Meanwhile considerable sums of money are having to be spent to keep these submarines afloat. [V.P. Shempelev, White Sea Naval Base chief of radiological, chemical, and biological defense] These submarines have been in service for a great many years and there is therefore a potential danger that the radiation situation will deteriorate. So painstaking ecological monitoring of the radiation situation in the area where these submarines are located is essential. [Anuchin] But how are the White Sea Naval Base specialists of to carry out such monitoring when the Akademik Vavilov -- the only vessel in the North equipped for monitoring radiation and ecological safety -- is being withdrawn by its owner, the "Krasnoye Sormovo" shipyard in Nizhniy Novgorod, despite the fact that the Northern Fleet is prepared to sign a long-term lease?
