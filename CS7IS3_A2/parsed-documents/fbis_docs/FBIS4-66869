FBIS4-66869 "jptac004___94017" JPRS-TAC-94-004 JPRS Arms Control 11 May 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA Weapons Developer Tsyrkov Reminisces on Nuclear Programs Weapons Developer Tsyrkov Reminisces on Nuclear Programs 94WC0051A Moscow DELOVOY MIR in Russian 4-10 Apr 94 p 15 94WC0051A Moscow DELOVOY MIR Russian CSO [Weapons Developer Georgiy Tsyrkov interviewed by Vladimir Gubarev: ``Reflection of the Nuclear Age: Georgiy Tsyrkov on the Fate of Nuclear Weapons Past and Present''] [Text] I have been trying to interview Georgiy Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov for 25 years. I think it was a few days before a gas flare was extinguished in Urtabulak that Minister of Medium Machine-Building Yefim Pavlovich Slavskiy gave permission to me, a correspondent for KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in those years, to witness an experiment. ``And now I will introduce you,'' he said, ``to our main `producer.' Take a good look at him, for a journalist he is a mine of information! He knows everything about weapons, but he won't talk about them. Bear in mind that I am permitting all subjects except `products,' you have no right to go near that subject. But don't worry: You won't be allowed to anyway.'' Yefim Pavlovich laughed, apparently quite pleased with his joke. A few minutes later I met Georgiy Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov, chief of the ministry's most secretive chief administration. As it turned out, we established a good rapport. To be honest, I tried several times in recent years to strike up a conversation about weapons, but Georgiy Aleksandrovich always said no. And understandably so, for his assessments of various researchers, designers, events, successes, and failures could not be ``purely personal''--he held too high a position in the ``nuclear pyramid'' that had formed not just in our country, but also throughout the world. To bear responsibility for a nuclear weapons program is too heavy a load, and he always has to be cautious. After all, people are people, and the comments of a chief administration director are too important. Moreover, it is hard to assess one's own work from the side, for Georgiy Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov has been at the center of events from the creation and testing of the first atomic bomb to the present. However, quite recently I nonetheless succeeded in conducting the much-sought interview. There was a good occasion for doing so: The birthday of Yuliy Borisovich Khariton is approaching, and I took advantage of it. Georgiy Aleksandrovich couldn't help but say some good things about Khariton. Then the discussion moved on to other subjects, although again, Tsyrkov could not speak with a level of openness that would fully open many pages of the history of nuclear weapons. And he was probably right again on this score: The time has not yet come when it might be possible to tell all secrets to the public. In both the past and the present, the development, production and testing of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons remain one of the most tightly guarded secrets of any state. And international treaties ban the proliferation of nuclear technologies--the world is too fragile and not as secure as some might think. And so I present excerpts of my discussion with Georgiy Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov. We talked only about the tip of the iceberg; the bulk of it remains in the depths of an ocean of secrecy. Gubarev: When did you first meet Yuliy Borisovich? Tsyrkov: In 1948, when intensive efforts were under way to develop the first model of our nuclear weapon. I saw him at work, and he was energetic and demanding. He followed literally every measurement and carefully analyzed all areas of work. In general, Khariton was everywhere. At least that's the impression one got, and it was close to reality. Gubarev: Where was that? Tsyrkov: In Arzamas. I went there and ended up in the sector that was intensively engaged in developing the warhead, and so Yuliy Borisovich and I immediately established working contact. Gubarev: What exactly were your duties? Tsyrkov: To fine-tune the design of the first warhead in actual dimensions. Many parts were various laboratory models and so forth, and I was assigned to a group led by Zakharenkov. We were engaged in so-called ``physical final design.'' Gubarev: In the celebrated ``green house''? Tsyrkov: It was white then. Gubarev: Where the security was especially tight, with the lowest rank being captain, as I recall? Tsyrkov: That's right. Gubarev: And Khariton was there all the time? Tsyrkov: Of course. He hardly ever left. Gubarev: He was the director, a theoretician, was he not? Tsyrkov: That's incorrect. He was always not only a very talented theoretician, but also a very talented experimenter. He was interested in every detail, every experimental method. And for this reason his advice was always useful. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of nuclear physics, explosives, and metallurgy. It was simply amazing: His knowledge in all fields of science was so vast! I am not saying this for flattery, not because it is Khariton's birthday. It is the absolute truth! Gubarev: But today many people in both the West and in our country write that the first atomic bomb was not our achievement, that all the data were obtained by intelligence operatives, and that Fuchs, in particular, provided detailed information about the bomb. Tsyrkov: Yes, that's what they say, but I can't agree. I became convinced from my own experience that we had to work through literally every detail of the ``product,'' and very carefully at that. Naturally, I did not know at the time, nor did most people, that Fuchs had provided any materials. We didn't read anything, and we worked out all the details from scratch, from ``a'' to ``z.'' Maybe Khariton and Shchelkin read something. If Fuchs did pass something on, it was a general plan, but all the technology and details are incredibly complex. The verification methods, physical parameters, technology for making the most complex measurements and so forth--Fuchs did not pass on any of that, nor could he have! The general plan for the first American atomic bomb would have something else. Such data would be important, of course, especially for that time, but the development of our first model required the development of an entire complex of sciences and production, the acquisition of equipment and much, much more. At the time, we who were directly involved in the project thought that we were doing everything from scratch. We had no prompting. Gubarev: How did it happen that you were immediately assigned to Zakharenkov's special group? Tsyrkov: I worked in the Ground Forces Engineering Academy where professor Georgiy Iosifovich Pokrovskiy was head of a department and laboratory. He was a very talented researcher in gas dynamics and demolitions. Gubarev: As well as a very talented artist! Tsyrkov: That's right. And a very intelligent and kind man. And fortunately, I worked for him after graduating from the Moscow Higher Technical School. I was working on munitions. When they started selecting specialists for Arzamas-16, I got an offer to go there. Obviously, because I was already a demolitions specialist, and for that reason I was immediately assigned to Zakharenkov's group. Gubarev: No doubt all that was happening seemed strange to you. Tsyrkov: Absolutely. We realized what an enormous task confronted the country--it was essential to end the Americans' monopoly on nuclear weapons, and so everybody worked at full capacity. Everybody without exception. We worked till two and four o'clock in the morning, ignoring our own interests; there was just one desire--to develop the atomic bomb as quickly as possible. Incidentally, we never mentioned it, except perhaps only in whispers, although everybody know, of course, what we were doing. This, the work, is what was unusual. And the whole country was helping us. While it was sometimes hard to obtain equipment and various materials for Pokrovskiy's laboratory, there we had a ``green light.'' The work was interesting and enjoyable. Gubarev: You are one of the few people present at the tests of the first atomic bomb. What did you do there? Tsyrkov: I was assigned by General Pavel Mikhaylovich Zernov to the operations group, which consisted of three people: Yegorov, Maslov, and myself. We made sure that preparations for the first test proceeded on schedule. I had responsibility for ``scientific aspects of preparations,'' which is to say physical measurements, equipment, and preparation of the ``product.'' Maslov was in charge of design, and Yegorov was in charge of experimental production. Pavel Mikhaylovich obviously saw me as a fairly good organizer, and that path ultimately led to become director of the Ministry of Medium Machine-Building and the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power chief administration in charge of producing nuclear weapons. When I went to the test range, it happened that I essentially become the assistant to Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov for all matters relating to coordinating the work of all divisions and so on. In addition to organizational work, I also participated in Zhuchikhin's group, which prepared the ``product'' detonation lines. We were also in the tower, prepared the control panel in the command and control facility and the detonation lines. We were supervised by Kirill Ivanovich Shchelkin. Gubarev: The man who was ``responsible'' for the bomb and who detonated it? Tsyrkov: At that time he was neither a three-time Hero nor a corresponding member. Gubarev: Were those good times? How do you look back at them? Tsyrkov: I think those years were exceptionally unusual. The work was interesting, important, and enjoyable. We knew that we were doing something very important and essential for the country. Gubarev: Who stands out in your memory most? I know that you consider Zernov your mentor. What about the others? Tsyrkov: At the tests, Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov. He was striking in terms of his energy, knowledge, and determination. You would look into his eyes and feel that some sort of radiation was coming from them. He had a stimulating effect on people. I probably have the strongest impression of Igor Vasilyevich at that time. Gubarev: You met and worked with very many outstanding people. Tell me, for example, about Kirill Ivanovich Shchelkin. Unfortunately, little is known about him. Tsyrkov: He was a thorough researcher. Not only was he involved in theoretical research on gas dynamics and nuclear physics; he also knew how to ``build bridges'' to practical work. He was a magnificent experimenter and organizer. He was Yuliy Borisovich Khariton's first assistant for nuclear weapons development. Unfortunately, he fell ill, left our work, and died shortly thereafter. It is said that he ``burnt out in his work,'' and this fully applies to Kirill Ivanovich Shchelkin. Gubarev: What happened to you after the first bomb test? Tsyrkov: I left Zakharenkov's group and was offered a position in the research department as a deputy to Yekaterina Alekseyevna Feoktistova. She was a very famous scientist and demolitions specialist. In that period I was engaged in the first research on magnetic commulation [kommulyatsia], which had been proposed by Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov. This refers to the direct conversion of the energy of a blast into magnetic energy. We conducted the first experiment. There were no instruments, and we wanted to convince ourselves that we were on the right path. Was it really possible to convert blast energy directly into magnetic energy? I proposed that we set up simple neon lamps. The first experiment was conducted in April 1952, and it was very successful--the lamps turned on. Sakharov's idea was confirmed. Back then this was all new; today this field has been developed and new experiments are under way. And only recent the two nuclear centers of Arzamas-16 and Los Alamos began working together. Gubarev: I can confirm that the experiment was successful--I was there! Tsyrkov: Back then we were just getting started, taking the first steps. We continue to lead in this field, just ahead of the Americans. Gubarev: And after that? Tsyrkov: A new ``facility'' was being set up in the Urals. Gubarev: Hold on! You mean you were involved in developing the hydrogen bomb? Tsyrkov: You have good information. Indeed, I was also involved in developing the first hydrogen bomb and took part in the tests. Gubarev: Was the detonation frightening? Tsyrkov: No. I was in an emplacement from which the detonation was controlled. It was 10 kilometers from the epicenter. All the effects were known, and we felt them. Still, my main impression is of when we emerged after the shock wave passed, and we saw an enormous red cloud over us. It hung over us, frightening and unusual. We got in the cars and left, you couldn't stay there. Gubarev: Did you take part in essentially all the tests? Tsyrkov: I once tried to count them, but I couldn't. One hundred or 150, maybe 300--I don't remember. I need to take a look at the lists of participants in each experiment some time--they have certainly been preserved. Gubarev: What took you to the Urals, to Chelyabinsk-70? Tsyrkov: An accident, you could say. I went to Moscow, dropped in at the ministry, where we were working on a new piece of equipment, and I ran into Kirill Ivanovich Shchelkin. He immediately said that he wanted to offer me a position as his first deputy. ``Agreed?'' he asked. ``I would follow you to the edge of the earth!'' I answered. And that is how I was first transferred to the Urals. Gubarev: Why was it necessary to create a second nuclear center? Tsyrkov: Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev was Central Committee First Secretary at that time. And he felt that a backup for Arzamas-16 was needed. You will recall that not everything was calm in the world at that time. It was 1955, the height of the cold war, and there was a real danger that it would become a hot war. It that event, the ``facility''--that is, Arzamas-16--could be destroyed, and the country would lose its nuclear weapons developers, there wouldn't be anyone to service the weapons or designers to supervise their maintenance, and so forth. I think that is why the decision was made to establish Chelyabinsk-70. Secondly, any monopoly is harmful; without competition, a field can become stalled. And both research and design work go far more slowly in the absence of competition, as we said at the time. And indeed, once we had two institutes, there began a constructive competition of ideas, methods, and ways of solving various design problems. I think the appearance of the center in the Urals was of enormous benefit to the development of the nuclear weapons complex. Gubarev: I would now like to ask you, as director of the chief administration in charge of both federal centers, what are the virtues of each one? And naturally, what shortcomings at Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 do you see today? Tsyrkov: Of course, Arzamas-16 has more traditions, its physical sector is more developed, and it is better equipped. The two centers probably have equal capabilities with respect to gas dynamics. Experimental production--that is, plants--is more advanced at Chelyabinsk-70, simply because it was established later, and hence the equipment is better. The theoreticians are close in terms of skills and talent. However, there is one difference: Chelyabinsk-70 has a younger staff, and so in the early years one sensed fervor, vigor, a search for unusual solutions. A certain conservatism at Arzamas-16 began to affect its work, while in the Urals, as is characteristic of youth, bolder decisions were sought and found. I don't want to talk about shortcomings, because it is my job to rectify them! Moreover, in my view, we ourselves can sort our problems out better and faster, excuse me, ``without the help of the public.'' Gubarev: So secrecy plays a role? Tsyrkov: How could it be otherwise?! We're not accustomed to giving interviews. Gubarev: Georgiy Aleksandrovich, in what way do modern nuclear weapons differ from the ones you developed in the early 1950's? Tsyrkov: The difference is enormous, very great progress has been made! I won't go into any design features. I will only say that given equal yields, weights and volumes differ by a factor of tens. The automatic equipment that controls detonation has changed sharply and unrecognizably! For example, the automatic equipment that sends signals to the warhead used to weigh 300 kilograms, while today it weighs 150. That's the kind of progress that has been made! The element base has changed, and our scientists and designers have made an enormous contribution to the development of this field of science and technology. Not just in nuclear hardware, but in the field as a whole. So the differences are very great. Not to mention the wide assortment of ``products'' that perform strictly defined functions. The progress is apparent not only in figures; one only need visit the Nuclear Weapons Museum at Arzamas and Chelyabinsk and then compare what you see with the weapons that are sometimes shown on television. You don't have to be a specialist. Gubarev: Why so many weapons? I understand that the politicians demanded new projects from you, but you should have understood that such numbers of nuclear weapons were unnecessary. Tsyrkov: I didn't have that problem, since we had little information. But there was real competition with a certain adversary across the ocean, to which we did not have a right to fall behind in technical terms. For example, we learned that the Americans were developing some sort of antimissile defense weapons. Were we not obliged to take appropriate steps? We understood that if we did nothing, our missiles wouldn't reach them, and hence they would acquire military superiority. The same applies to naval weapons and other types. That concerns types. As for the numbers of warheads, I honestly admit that I didn't even know; nothing was said of this to us the developers, everything was decided ``at the top.'' So nuclear weapons developers are not to blame for ``nuclear excesses.'' Gubarev: The following question is logical: What is nuclear disarmament, in your view? Tsyrkov: If it is to be carried out properly, we have to not only dismantle the nuclear warhead, but also convert the plutonium and uranium to a state in which they cannot be reused in weapons. Then you can talk about complete disarmament. But I don't think we can do that as yet, since the situation in the world is complex and dangerous. There are many so-called ``threshold countries'' that could start testing and developing nuclear weapons. They are well known. They may not be able to develop sophisticated ``products,'' but they are fully capable of ``primitive'' ones. Gubarev: What is a ``safe'' nuclear weapon? Tsyrkov: To talk about it, I would have to reveal the design, and I don't want to do that. So I will confine myself only to some general aspects. A ``safe'' nuclear weapon rules out the possibility of nuclear detonation in any accident, by any operator error, in a fire, or when being transported. That was the first stage. The next one is to develop designs that cannot disperse plutonium. It is very dangerous, and everything possible is being done to make sure this never happens under any conditions. Gubarev: I saw how a train car holding a container built up speed and then smashed into a concrete wall. But no scattering occurred? Tsyrkov: That was just one of many tests. We are trying to ensure the full safety of our ``products''--it's one of our main tasks today. Fortunately, we have many years of positive experience--we have had no Chernobyl-type accidents with weapons. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the Americans. Gubarev: When will there be real nuclear disarmament? Tsyrkov: You're asking a bad question. Gubarev: Why? Tsyrkov: I think that nuclear weapons should exist. And they will. By treaty, we and the Americans will both have 3,500 warheads in the early 21st century. So nuclear weapons are going to stay. And 3,500 is a lot. The country's self-defense system requires that we retain a certain number of ``products.'' Gubarev: Have you ever thought that nuclear weapons would be used sometime? Tsyrkov: We have always felt that our country's weapons are intended only for a counterstrike. No one in our country has ever thought that we are the sort of ``aggressors'' and ``nuclear monsters'' capable of launching a first strike. Nothing of the kind! And we worked as hard as we did, forgoing a lot of things in life, only because we knew that the defense of this country and our motherland was in our hands. We understood that policy. Gubarev: If you had to start life over again, would you go into this field? Tsyrkov: Absolutely! I am still happy that I was able to enter this branch of science. I have always been an ``arms-maker,'' I found it interesting, and, finally, each of us should regard himself as a defender of the fatherland. That is real patriotism, if you please. As a youth I dreamed about becoming an officer, I wanted to enroll in a tank academy. But they didn't take me right out of school, and then I developed vision difficulties. And so I wound up in the military department at the Moscow Higher Technical School, at least close to the army. I became a munitions specialist. Life was hard for our generation, but we spared nothing--not even ourselves!--for the country, for the motherland. If you don't know that, if you don't feel it, it is impossible to understand why and how we developed nuclear weapons in such a short time.
