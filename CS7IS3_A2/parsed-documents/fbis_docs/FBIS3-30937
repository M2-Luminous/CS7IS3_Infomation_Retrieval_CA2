The offensive on the free territories of the Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, and Teslic communes has been going on for 25 days. The most difficult situation was in the zone of operations of the 203d Glorious Motorized Brigade of Doboj-Bosnia. After crossing the Usora River, the chetniks attacked Karusce, where they were successfully repelled as they have been on so many occasions in the past. Two hours later, a chetnik sabotage group was infiltrated in this region, but it fared in the same way as all the previous ones. The 110th Glorious Usora Brigade told us that over 500 projectiles of all calibers landed on the defense lines in this area overnight. The enemy's forces and hardware were repositioned in the operational zone of the 207th and 202d brigades this morning. The [Serbian] aggressor is preparing an artillery and infantry attack.
