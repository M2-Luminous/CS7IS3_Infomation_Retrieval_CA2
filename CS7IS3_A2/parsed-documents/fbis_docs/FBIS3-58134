Positive vetting of key personnel is being set up for the first time in the secretariat of the Council of Ministers in Brussels. The Commission is extending arrangements originally designed to protect Euratom nuclear secrets. The moves were disclosed in a letter from Niels Ersboll, secretary-general of the Council of Ministers, to Alex Falconer, Labour MEP [Member of European Parliament] for Mid Scotland and Fife, who led the European Parliament's successful campaign to fight previous attempts to instigate official secrecy in the Community. "Given its responsibility under the new treaty (of Maastricht), the Council secretariat will have to deal with certain classified information (e.g. information relating to the security policy of member states or information on terrorist threat) which, as you will understand, necessitates special precautions to ensure confidentiality and avoid unauthorised disclosure of material which would seriously damage the security and interests of member states and their citizens," Mr Ersboll said. A small number of staff would be "required to undergo the security screening which will form part of the proposed security regime." A senior Council official said that positive vetting would only apply to staff who were given access to sensitive documents, including security analyses and comments by member states' diplomatic services on foreign governments. The vetting will be carried out by the security services of the individual's own member state or, in the case of foreigners living in Belgium, by Belgian authorities. "The European Union does not itself have the services which could handle these matters. We are very much in the hands of the national capitals. They will have to take care of their own nationals," he said. The Commission is understood to be preparing to increase the number of offlcials who must be positively vetted before they can work on the more sensitive parts of common foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs -- the second and third pillars of the EU agreed at Maastricht. Hitherto, only a handful of Commission officials have required positive vetting by MI5 or other national security services. Routine checks are carried out at recruitment to ensure that staff have no police record. But security clearance was only needed for staff with access to Euratom secrets and a few other sensitive documents. The Commission's Security Office can handle threats to the personal safety of commissioners and visiting dignitaries. It also co-operates with national security services when espionage charges are made against staff -- such as the current inquiry into the alleged Stasi connections of a German official in the Overseas Development Directorate. To add to German embarrassment, it was revealed yesterday that its ambassador to Gabon, Rainer Muller, has been arrested as a suspected Stasi spy. Mr Falconer said he was concerned that a special cadre of vetted officials was being set up without reference to the European Parliament, which threw out the Commission's previous proposals for security vetting of staff. In 1992 the Commission called for an official secrecy regime which would have classified its documents "top secret," "secret" and "classified," according to their sensitivity. It was forced to drop the idea by criticism from the MEPs. Mr Ersboll's letter said the new scheme was much more limited in scope. Mr Falconer warned that he could find himself in conflict with parliament if he did not come clean about what was being done.
