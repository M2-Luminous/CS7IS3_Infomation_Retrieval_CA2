Zheng Zengmao emphatically stated in his speech: The people's courts at all levels across the province should strengthen their determination to tackle difficult cases, strictly enforce the law, and resolutely implement court decisions so as to safeguard social order and maintain political stability. Zheng Zengmao noted: Over the past year, by negotiating all sorts of difficulties, courts at all levels across the province have placed on file for investigation and prosecution a total of more than 52,000 cases involving more than 529 million yuan. Moreover, courts at all levels across the province have also assisted courts of other provinces and regions in handling more than 2,600 cases and directly handled a total of 685 cases on behalf of those courts, thus pushing ahead with Henan's economic growth and safeguarding Henan's image. Zheng Zengmao pointed out: There are still more than 15,000 court decisions awaiting implementation across the province at the moment. The slow pace of implementing court decisions has hindered courts at all levels across the province from serving economic construction and safeguarding social stability. In view of this situation, courts at all levels across the province should actively take measures to improve and strengthen court work and resolutely implement court decisions regarding anyone irrespective of his position, rank, or personal influence.
