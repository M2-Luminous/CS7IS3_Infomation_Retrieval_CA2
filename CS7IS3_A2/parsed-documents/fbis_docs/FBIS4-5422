Recent plans to raise public fees should not be easily justified at a time when many countries are calling on Japan to rectify its heavy price gaps with other countries, International Trade and Industry Minister Kumagai told a regular press conference. The warning came after the government earlier in the day unveiled basic guidelines for increasing public fees. The guidelines, prepared in response to a barrage of public criticism of public rate hike plans, address the importance of local governments and concerned entities taking full consideration for the impact such hikes may have on overall prices and people's livelihood. Kumagai said further deregulation and administrative reform intended to remove structural problems needs to be implemented to push down Japanese prices to international levels. Rate increases now under consideration include medical expenses, highway tolls, tuition at national universities, taxi charges, gas and electricity rates, municipal buses and subways, rents for publicly owned houses and telephone rates. In line with the latest guidelines, the government is expected to postpone or scrap part of these plans. Kumagai indicated his support for the introduction of a product liability law when he referred to a court ruling on a defective TV. The March 29 ruling by Osaka District Court said the maker, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., should be held responsible for a defect that caused a fire unless it could prove there were no mechanical problems with the TV. The ruling was epoch-making because the court accepted that consumers seeking compensation simply need to prove that a product was defective, instead of having to prove negligence by the maker, as at present. A government panel recently proposed excluding such a provision from any product liability law passed in Japan. The ruling "showed that the current surrounding product liability is moving in a certain direction," Kumagai said. Matsushita said Thursday it will not appeal the ruling.
