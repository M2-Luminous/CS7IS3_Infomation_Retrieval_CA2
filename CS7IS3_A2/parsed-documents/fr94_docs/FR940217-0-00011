FR940217-0-00011 FR940217-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;58&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8825; AD 89&hyph;02&hyph;12 R1] Airworthiness Directives; Gulfstream Model G&hyph;IV Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Gulfstream Model G&hyph;IV airplanes, that currently requires deactivating instrument landing systems (ILS) that utilize dedicated Bendix radios. This amendment provides for an optional terminating action, which, if accomplished, allows reactivation of the Bendix ILS systems. This amendment is prompted by the development of a modification that positively addresses the identified unsafe condition. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the hazardous deviations from the intended course. DATES: Effective March 21, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, P.O. Box 2206, M/S D&hyph;10, Savannah, Georgia 31402&hyph;2206. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Flanagan, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ACE&hyph;120A, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;2910; fax (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by revising AD 89&hyph;02&hyph;12, Amendment 39&hyph;6155 (54 FR 11165, March 17, 1989), which is applicable to certain Gulfstream G&hyph;IV airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57756). That action proposed to revise AD 89&hyph;02&hyph;12 to continue to require deactivating the instrument landing systems (ILS) utilizing dedicated Bendix radios and modifying the electronic display controller wiring. That action also proposed to provide for an optional terminating action, which consists of modifying the ILS receivers hardware and TCAS symbol generators software for the # 1 and # 2 electronic display controllers. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that there are approximately 95 Model G&hyph;IV airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 59 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this action. The actions currently required by AD 89&hyph;02&hyph;12 take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,735, or $165 per airplane. This revision of AD 89&hyph;02&hyph;12 will add no new additional costs to operators, since it merely provides for an optional terminating action. Should an operator elect to accomplish the terminating action, the associated modification will take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish. The relocation and certification of a new AM/FM entertainment antenna will take approximately 120 work hours per airplane to accomplish. The average labor charge is $55 per work hour. All required parts will be provided free of charge by the manufacturer. Based on these figures, the total cost of accomplishing the optional terminating action is estimated to be $6,930 per airplane. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
