According to figures from the Customs Department, the country's export volume reached 19.1 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter, up 18.7 percent on the same period last year. The figure turned out to be 20.4 billion U.S. dollars for the import sector, which saw a rise of 18.2 percent. Ye Zhen, spokesman for the SSB, told a press conference here today that China also enjoyed an increase in its foreign exchange reserve, and the market exchange rate remained stable. According to him, the government's financial revenue (debt receipt was not included) was raised by 21.4 percent in the first three months, while financial expenditure (debt servicing was not included) registered a 23.8 percent growth. Loans for working capital and fixed assets made up much of the 35.1 billion yuan-bank loans newly granted during the period. At the same time, bank savings were raised to about 207.2 billion yuan. To sum up the whole situation of China's economy, Ye said that the main stem of the macro-economy was good, but prominent difficulties and problems still exist. The prices in the country's urban and countryside markets remained on the rise. The retail sales prices jumped by 21 percent over the same period last year. Prices of life necessities witnessed the highest rates of increase. But Ye also said that as the government stipulated policies to restrict price rises, price soaring has obviously been slowed down since March. In other aspects, production of the state industry was only increased by 2.2 percent. The state-owned enterprises were making less profits, more enterprises suffered from losses, many others were in arrears with loans or goods payments. Ye noted that China's macro-economic control is at a critical period, adding that the economic growth rate was moderate, but tight control was still necessary for the rate of price rises. He concluded that reforms in the next period should put equal emphasis on stabilizing prices and boosting economic growth.
