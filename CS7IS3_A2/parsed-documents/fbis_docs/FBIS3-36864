An average of five or six candidates per Supreme Council seat has already been registered in many electoral districts. The leaders of parties and movements are not stinting on interviews in the mass media, are proposing various scenarios for emerging from economic collapse, and are analyzing the present blunders in detail. But everyone is expressing his attitude toward the recent agreement on nuclear-free status for Ukraine. Some are unconditionally supporting L. Kravchuk, while others are accusing him of betraying national interests. The latter people mostly represent national-radical parties. Judging by their speeches, you get the impression that they missed the press conference by the foreign minister and defense minister, which has been repeatedly shown on republic television. At the press conference the department heads explained in detail that implementation of the agreement entirely accords with the state's interests, that Russia and the United States have given Ukraine clear national security guarantees, and that machinery for immediate compensation for each nuclear missile that is removed has been enumerated. A recent speech by Stepan Khmara stands out. Accusing the United States and Russia of imperial ways, he painted a black picture of the "humiliating agreement" signed by Leonid Kravchuk, who, according to him, should be immediately relieved of the presidency. He called on parliament to block the "adventure by the head of state." At the present stage the sharp attacks by opponents of the agreement pursue a single aim -- to influence the course of parliament's discussion of nuclear status. The "New Ukraine," Ukrainian Civic Congress, and Slavic Unity Party movements have spoken out against the wholesale criticism of the president.... Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma declared that in Ukraine there are many "patriotic" politicians who were at first all in favor of nuclear-free status, but now are campaigning equally insistently on the other side. When were they being sincere? Nevertheless, most observers are hopefully awaiting the discussion of the agreement between the three presidents in the Supreme Council. In their view, only a positive result will enable the young state to strengthen its independence and stabilize the economy with the help of long-term large-scale credits.
