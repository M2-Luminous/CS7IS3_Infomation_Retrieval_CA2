However, Thailand insisted on the minimum rate of 5 baht per meter and would agree to further lower the tariffs only if the United States removes it from the (PWL) watchlist. Regarding the U.S. call for the calculation of import tax based on the value of the imports, the Finance Ministry said that it could not give up the present calculation system, which is based on the condition of the imported goods. However, futher details of the present tax calculation system will be spelled out in the memorandums on trade with the United States and New Zealand so as to convince the two countries that their exports to Thailand will not be subject to high import duties, at least, not higher than those calculated in the U.S.-proposed system.
