"We sometimes have the feeling," Lamassoure told the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Thursday, "that other senior member states of the CSCE are not doing everything they could to encourage all parties involved to choose peace. "Considering the point where we're at in the Yugoslav crisis, it is time for each of us to clearly take on some responsibility and choose, not only in words, but in action, the logic of peace." Earlier this week, the U.S. rejected a French initiative for stiffer diplomatic and military action in Bosnia.
