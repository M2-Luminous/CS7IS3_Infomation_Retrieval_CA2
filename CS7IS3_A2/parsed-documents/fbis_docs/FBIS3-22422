Foreign enterprises should be given the opportunity to acquire Russian state enterprises, the environment minister said in an interview with HANDELSBLATT. Although enterprises are currently being privatized it does not take place in the way "that I consider necessary." For the reformist politician it is impossible to understand why the Russian Government does not use the possibility to mobilize foreign capital by selling state enterprises. In view of the pronounced decline in production in Russian industry, funds for investment are very scarce, Danilov-Danilyan said. The country is not able by itself to modernize enterprises and thus to reduce the burden on the environment. The minister is convinced that Russian industry must be modernized to achieve success in the area of ecology in Russia. Higher direct investment by foreign enterprises might help to eliminate the capital shortage. The environment minister confirmed the figures contained in a report issued by the German Economic Research Institute, Berlin, according to which the share of environmental investment in total investment in Russia was 2 percent in 1992 and continues to decrease. This decline can be ended only when industrial production recovers, Danilov-Danilyan said. The government is of the opinion that 1994 will be the last year of falling production in the Russian Federation. He said he did not understand the "inactivity of German enterprises" regarding investment projects in Russia. Regarding the major projects that involve billions of rubles for the development and production of oil and natural gas, German companies did "not stand out," and the Russians noticed a "lack of initiative." The environment minister does not accept the argument of difficult financing. "The Americans and Japanese have managed to establish themselves on the Russian market." The Germans should follow their example. Still, as far as smaller projects are concerned, cooperation does work. At the Terratec special fair for environmental protection two contracts were signed on German-Russian cooperation in the sphere of environmental protection. One project is the development of a measuring network for the continuous monitoring of the air quality in the Saratov area. This is a first step to include Russia into the European environmental data network. The partner to the contract is the Committee for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Saratov area and Medium-Sensor GmbH in Berlin. The second agreement has to do with the development of an industry for the processing of secondary plastics in the Russian Federation. A processing plant with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes per month should be set up in the first phase. The partners to the contract are the industrial and trading company Cooperation and Development Ltd., Moscow, and the Ostimex Import und Export Handelsgesellschaft mbH, Berlin. Things are taking place on a regional level, too. The district committee of Ekaterinburg (formerly Sverdlovsk) last year bought two mobile environmental monitoring stations in Germany. These stations were financed by the Russian ecological funds. These come from payments from enterprises that pollute the environment. The German-Russian project for the cleansing of the Tula area is also being financed through local funds. For Danilov-Danilyan, Germany is one of the leading countries in the area of environmental technology. However, even Russia has very good environmental technologies. A series of innovative achievements, which were originally developed in armament enterprises, can be used also for environmental protection. A plant for the incineration of toxic refuse was, for example, developed on the basis of a rocket engine. Temperatures of up to 3,500 degrees are reached in this process. The environment minister is hoping that this year it will be possible to finance the program "Conversion for Environmental Protection," which was developed more than two years ago. The program consists of several hundreds of projects whose development has been concluded. The "real achievements" in the area of conversion are not yet very impressive, Danilov-Danilyan stated.
