The activities in the region must be coordinated and strategically oriented, the Latin America initiative of the three supporters mentioned above says. The starting point of their concept is the insight that the negative image of Latin America, where involvement has long been stable but rather limited, has deterred new investors or people interested in exports from German industry. The profound reform process of Latin American states, the "victory of the market economy," is seen only by insiders. "For German industry, Latin America threatens to become a continent for specialists only," the associations warn. Above all, medium-sized and smaller companies have missed new opportunities for getting involved in Latin America, the authors of the initiative criticize. In contrast, large German industries can partly point to positions that dominate the market. The expansion of the foreign trade infrastructure, the use of foreign trade instruments as a whole, but also the lack of planned diplomacy by visits and contacts are seen as the main reasons for the dismal situation. As a result, the framework conditions for entrepreneurial involvement are deteriorating even further, it is said. In addition, the BDI clearly criticizes Bonn's thrift policy, which has led to dramatic cutbacks also in the system of chambers. The bad classification of the Latin American trading partners in connection with the reform of the Hermes system is also felt to be of little help. After its founding, the discussion group of the three associations, which will be joined by the Foreign Ministry, the Economics Ministry, the Development Aid Ministry, and the spokesman of the Latin American chambers, will engage in similar activities as the APA [Asia-Pacific Committee]. One of the most urgent tasks consists of: - Working out a political framework concept of the Federal Government for Latin America; - Planning of regional conferences in Latin America and of entrepreneurs' conferences in Germany, which is to address primarily medium-sized companies; - Improving the transparency of activities of the Federal Government and the laender as well as of the economic promotion companies, institutes, chambers, and associations; - Improving public relations work; - expanding and further developing foreign trade instruments with the goal of making involvement in Latin America also possible for medium-sized companies and of promoting cooperation with Latin American companies. In detail, this means the expansion and interlacement of the network of foreign trade chambers and the coordination of a concept of fairs and exhibitions with regional focal points. In addition, there is the improvement of the coordination of officials sent by chambers, the Technical Cooperation Association (GTZ), and political foundations. Furthermore, it would be desirable to jointly plan trips by Federal Government officials and industrial figures, giving priority to regional focal countries.
