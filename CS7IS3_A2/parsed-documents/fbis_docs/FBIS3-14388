This decision was made directly by the publishers following the armed attack on the premises of the L'HEBDO LIBERE weekly last Monday. The attack led to the killing of a cameraman and one worker and the serious wounding of three other. The weekly's sources had said that one of the wounded, Nadir Mahmoudi, brother of the L'HEBDO LIBERE's director, died of his wounds. The papers involved are EL WATAN, EL MOUDJAHID, El HAQ, LA GAZETTE, CONFIDENCE, OLYMPIQUE, ALGER REPUBLICAIN, L'ECHO DU CENTRE and other newspapers. This is the first time national newspapers are to cease publication for two consecutive days in protest against repeated armed attacks on journalists and media men. The security issue, which is an aspect of the political crisis the country has experienced for over two years, is a source of concern for the government. The series of negotiations President Liamine Zeroual has been holding is expected to resume this week in the framework of the dialogue he had started since the beginning of last week aimed at seeking the best means to overcome the current crisis the country is experiencing.
