Whatever the predictions of Vano Syradegyan on Armenian Television concerning the possible outcome of the elections, the opposition intends having its say. Shamiram Agabekyan's interview with Aram Sarkisyan, chairman of the Democratic Party of Armenia, will help readers of GOLOS determine what specifically this party brings to the elections and the position that it holds. [Agabekyan] Mr. Sarkisyan, it may be said that GOLOS has just once comprehensively addressed the activity of the Democratic Party. This was two years ago. Much water has since then flown.... [Sarkisyan] Yes, and it is to be regretted merely that four years ago, when the party was founded, it came to be called democratic, being essentially a social democratic program also. We were reluctant to "steal a march" on the people of Gnchak--the traditional national party. The gesture of propriety was, I believe, inappropriate. Aside from all else, time has shown that this party is far removed from social democratic ideas. I can only go by the newspaper GNCHAK AYASTAINI, for that matter, for there is simply no other evidence of this party's presence and political behavior in the republic. The political platform of the Democratic Party is freedom of the individual, justice, and solidarity. The aim is defense of the interests of the man working for wages, that is, the working person. So this is the quintessential popular party, a party of social justice. [Agabekyan] Should it be assumed that the "economic slogan" of your party rules out private ownership and market relations? [Sarkisyan] On the contrary. We support the development of market relations. But without a flouting of the principles of social justice, without the abrupt polarization of society into poor and rich. A vulgar market is unacceptable not only because a polarized society is the most dangerous society. We need to take account of the fact that for 70 years the people of Armenia lived according to different political, economic, and social criteria and that they totally reject the transformation proposed by the present administration. Our formula is the market to the extent that it is possible and government regulation to the extent that it is necessary (Willy Brandt). In order that the first part of the formula operate efficiently it is essential to put both parts on an equal footing in functional significance. Priorities should be conditioned merely by economic necessity. We would recall that when she assumed office, Margaret Thatcher nationalized some companies, compensating them for loss, of course. Then, having increased the profitability of the works and sectors even by government measures, she denationalized them. We also reject identification with foreign models, proceeding from the fact that Armenia's economy, like the evolved national mentality, bears the imprint of 70 years of the building of socialism. The model that we have devised fits into the general social democratic concept of democratic socialism, but is based on the realities that have taken shape in Armenia. [Agabekyan] The political behavior of the Democratic Party today is more "oppositional" than that of other parties of a socialist persuasion. Why is this? [Sarkisyan] One reason, perhaps--rejection of the style and methods of government of the present administration. The path that it is proposing and pursuing has brought our people suffering and irreparable losses both economically and socially. The authorities maintain that they are being true to the principles of democracy: freedom of speech, some other things besides. In actual fact, the very concept of power, the civil society, and so forth have been discredited. But the problem is that there is with us a certain internal dissension. On the one hand our program principle dictates Armenia's conversion into a democratic state with stable, developed democratic institutions, which in itself precludes a revolutionary, forcible change of power. On the other, seeing the situation in which the people and the state as a whole have found themselves, we understand that each day that the present administration continues in office brings the republic closer to catastrophe. It is this dissension that forces us to seek radical changes democratically. The Democratic Party proposed the creation of a national-state council, the formation of a government of national accord.... And recently, availing ourselves of the right of legislative initiative, we proposed that parliament discuss the question of the government's resignation. [Agabekyan] And are the authorities paying any attention to your proposals? [Sarkisyan] In February of last year we met with the president, for it had been contemplated that the state council would be headed by the president himself, but without the right of veto. Ignoring all that had been proposed, the president responded merely to this fact: He would not be such a president, he said. On the other hand, he reprimanded us for bias--we were unobjective in our analysis of the situation that had taken shape in the republic, had not mentioned the good works of the president himself.... Levon Ter-Petrosyan expressed his position, for that matter, in a memorable speech at a sitting of the Supreme Soviet. The idea of national accord was for him a fraudulent category. Was this not an attempt to "justify" by hook or by crook his reluctance to be a president of all the people, not its AOD [Armenian National Movement] part? And since the AOD retains the least significant part of society, he is president of this small stratum. [Agabekyan] Your party no longer, we are to infer, cleaves to the idea of a state council. What are its tasks today? [Sarkisyan] Yes and no. It is essential now to seek the adoption of a constitution (the draft of the six parties) and new elections. If the constitutional process reaches impasse, it is essential to seek early parliamentary elections. With the people's support for our demands for early elections, a new political situation, with which both the authorities and the opposition would be forced to reckon, would be created. [Agabekyan] But will you have this support? It is no secret that a large part of the populace is skeptical toward both the authorities and the opposition, considering the first greedy and aggressive, and the second, amorphous and inactive. [Sarkisyan] The head-butting of antagonistic political forces is unacceptable to us. There would be no way of crawling out of such a situation--the republic would be doomed. I would advise some ardent champions of militant confrontation inciting from their own quiet corner the opposition to drive the people to the barricades to try this themselves. It would then be quickly seen that the people do not support these methods. Account must be taken also of the situation in the region. Serious policy rejects a disregard for national interests. But the key to a solution of the Karabakh conflict is in the hands of a third force also. The opposition itself has a problem. The problem of consolidation. In a normal society parties with different ideologies are at different sides of the political arena. But we have achieved cooperation on specific issues of constitutional arrangement. The Democratic Party has considered and now considers a principal area of work the unification of constructive political forces for the solution of specific questions of constitutional arrangement. Take if only the constitutional council for civil accord. What is this if not an example proving to the president that consolidation in the name of the national interest is not only possible but also essential? [Agabekyan] Is it possible to speak of the mass character of the Democratic Party? [Sarkisyan] Were there a party of 50,000 persons in Armenia, I assure you that this party would have been in power long ago. There are no mass parties in our republic nor, perhaps, will there be until the legal status of the state has been determined, a true multiparty system has become firmly established, and on this basis a president of the republic has been elected. We understand those who are demanding more assertiveness of the opposition. People are bitter, and not everyone cares to accept the motives for the "quiet behavior" of political forces, believing that such rules of the game are appropriate in a democratic society, but not here. They are largely right. When a person who is accustomed to average sufficiency is forced to sell his chattels that it has taken him years to acquire, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that the people have been reduced to poverty and that the state has ceased to perform its elementary functions. We have become a self-governed society subjected, in addition, to unique repressive measures in the form of the absence of minimal protection and of corruption, impunity, bribery, and a whole bouquet of other vices forcing Armenians to leave their homeland. The mass outflow is a consequence of the policy of the present regime. At the same time, on the other hand, availing itself of the current legal turmoil, 10-15 percent of society is making colossal fortunes, which also are being exported from the republic, incidentally. But we would emphasize the following reality as well. While subjected to the above repressive measures, the people are strangely yielding to implanted cliches of the type: Who if not Levon, or what would change with the advent of new people, or everywhere else is just as bad as here! And the blockade, the energy crisis, and so forth that set the teeth on edge. But is the problem of the leader urgent? In proposing a parliamentary form of rule our party is sure that in the present transitional period it is essential to have an authority that is subject to control. Armenia needs today not a leader with a team but a team with a leader. The advent of new forces is a natural process. And to impede this is to make the situation in the republic worse, especially since the present administration has exhausted itself in all parameters. As far as the "everywhere is just as bad" cliche is concerned.... I can bear witness to the fact that the situation in republics similar to Armenia is many times better, for the state structures are performing their functions. And the blockade.... This is a good screen for covering one's own inability to govern. It is a screen, rather, that is needed for the burgeoning of mafia structures. If a private trader can under the same conditions bring into the republic X quantity of a commodity, why is the government--the principal banker--incapable of competing with him? Yes, the present administration is fully played out. It is no accident that we are witnessing periodic showdowns between former associates. In a normal state, given such exposures, the president does not remain in the role of detached observer of the scandals shaking his noble family. For let us consider. Even the initiative for the creation of an interim parliamentary commission does not belong to him, the president. Comment here is superfluous. [Agabekyan] What do you propose? [Sarkisyan] There is one way out of the present situation. Specifically, our party is embarking on an election campaign and is calling on all political organizations to begin without delay to present their political program to the people. It is essential to once again revive the people's faith in honest, competent politicians and honest, competent policy.
