Paredes, the man who closed the media and imposed censorship on 31 July 1982 with his famous phrase "as of now," negotiated with Carles for an advisory position on public security matters as well as for the creation of a support group. Paredes has called at least three meetings with former officers, among them Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Delgado, Lt. Col. Carlos Arosemena King, Lt. Col. Juan Antonio Guizado, Major Severino Mejia, and Arrigo Guardia, one of the main promoters of Carles' candidacy. Mitchel Doens, first assistant secretary of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that his group knows about these meetings and asserted that there is a "fallacy campaign" promoted by Paredes and Carles' electoral team. According to Doens, "the main goal (of the campaign) is to spread the rumor that the PRD wants to reestablish the army and that it has made a secret pact with former FDP officers." "Carles' and Paredes' goal is to keep the PRD from attaining power," Doens said. When Perez Balladares launched his presidential campaign he said that he would not make changes to the current Public Force, that he would make the Public Force more professional, and that under no circumstances would he incorporate the former FDP officers into that force. Last week Doens sent a letter to Stanley Muschett, president of the Peace and Justice Commission, warning him that a campaign was being prepared and that it "is based on false documents, slanderous statements, and even offenses against the candidacy of Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares." According to Doens, they are planning to make public an alleged pact "between Dr. Perez Balladares and officers of the defunct FDP to reestablish militarism in Panama." "Everyone knows our candidate's position. He has stated quite clearly that he will respect the current structures of the Public Force and will not reinstate any former officer who was not already an active member of the force on 1 January 1994," Doens recalled. Doens reminded Muschett that the PRD will continue to respect the Santa Maria La Antigua Political Parties Pact that was also signed by the coalition that supports Carles. "Our goal (the PRD's) is to follow that ethical line, giving priority to the debate of the problems of the Panamanian people and suggestions for the solution of these problems," Doens said, adding that the Peace and Justice Commission must not allow itself to be surprised "by those who are bent on violating the agreements they promised to respect."
