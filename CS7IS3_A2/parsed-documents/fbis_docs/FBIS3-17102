At the same time, the parliament has rejected the government program for the republic's socioeconomic development and monetary policy for the current year, which were opposed by the "Dashnaktsutyun" Armenian Revolutionary Union and the National Democratic Union factions. In addition, the "Dashnaktsutyun" faction proposed that the parliament's standing commission on legal matters draw up a draft on reallocating the powers of the Supreme Soviet and the president. The opposition has accused the government of lacking a clear model of the republic's economic development and the principles of improving the government system, and also specific social safety nets. The parliamentary debate has shown that the opposition itself lacks a specific program to lift the republic out of the crisis. For all the abundance of criticism, no viable alternative to Bagratyan's policy has been proposed. In the view of some observers, the opposition acts according to the principle "Let's topple the government first, and then we will see." According to a local independent newspaper, "in case events unfold this way the people risk choosing between two evils." During the discussion, some opposition deputies have made so radical proposals (for instance, on concentrating all the state's financial reserves in the hands of one institution) that the prime minister accused them of calling for "economic fascism." In Bagratyan's view, even in the current difficult conditions, with the minimum resources available, the government may improve macroeconomic indicators by 15-17 percent.
