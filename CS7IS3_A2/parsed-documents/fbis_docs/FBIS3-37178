At the moment, Saburov is a director of the Center for Information and Social Technology under the Russian Government, and intends to remain in this post. Our correspondent Irina Akhiyeva got in touch with Saburov on the telephone and asked him to say to whom -- the Ukraine or Russia -- will Crimea chiefly direct its economic policy? [Begin recording] [Saburov] Crimea will direct it in such a way as will be best for the Crimean population from an economic standpoint. There is no question of a secession or a withdrawal from Ukraine. It is a question of using Crimea's economic potential to the utmost and to improve the well-being of the people living there. Naturally, all these actions of Crimea's will be directed, as they always have been, toward all the republics of the CIS -- people from the Baltics have come to us and have been pleased, and if any other countries come to us, then that will be even better. [Akhiyeva] But Crimea will require a great deal of money for this. [Saburov] Of course. That is why it will welcome any investments, wherever they may come from. [Akhiyeva] You submitted your economic program to the government. Will you try and implement this program in Crimea? [Saburov] Crimea is not a separate country and it does not have its own monetary system. Therefore, the opportunities to work in this direction are extremely limited in Crimea. As far as the Russian program -- of which I am the author -- is concerned, it is directed toward an instant halt in inflation. It is being examined at the moment in a pretty serious way; it has, in my view, very great purpose. Indeed, it is my firm conviction that there is no other way for us, and we will have to do this in any case, and the sooner the better. This is an unpopular belief. [Akhiyeva] What do you mean by an instant halt in inflation? Today, straightaway? [Saburov] Yes. [Akhiyeva] Let us put it this way: I am an ordinary citizen, how will it affect me? [Saburov] The standard of living will fall, in the first instance. Incomes (?will rise). Then there will be no inflation and life will be normal. It is not very pleasant, but there is no other way to go. Otherwise, we will just have disastrous unemployment. [end recording]
