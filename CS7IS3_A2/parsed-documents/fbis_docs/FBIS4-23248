Inaugurating the 16-man election committee for the constitutional conference in Abuja, the head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha said that the government allowed previous meetings so as to give ample opportunity for ideas to evolve and memoranda produced at such to be forwarded to the national constitutional conference commission for collation. Though he announced that all political meetings were still banned, Gen. Abacha said that individuals could canvass to be elected as independent candidates in their various conference- district constituencies. No one should be left in doubt as to our commitment and determination to find an acceptable and lasting solution to the problems that have bedeviled our great country in the past many years," Gen. Abacha said. The head of state said that the decision to set up the committee was informed by the need to evolve a reliable election culture in the country. He urged the committee to ensure that the spectrum of elected candidates was broad, independent and representative, and that they should be persons who were conscious of their responsibility to peace and the progress of the nation. Abacha said thet the elecion process must be completely above board, leaving no shade of doubts in the minds of anybody, adding that stiff penalties must be set to discourage the activities of bloc and parochial interests. He said the committee must ensure adequate publicity of their operations so as to properly educate delegates. The head of state urged the committee to delimit the constituencies in conjunction with the states' administrators and supervise and conduct the elections with the assistance of the states and local governments. He also urged them to enunciate the guidelines of the elections which should ensure equity, justice and fair play, and screen intending delegates in accordance with constitutional provisions to discourage people with criminal records from participating in the conference. Gen. Abacha said that the committee should take any other action that would ensure a smooth and fair election. The election is expected to produce 273 members, three from each of the 90 senatorial districts and three from Abuja, while 96 will be appointed by the government.
