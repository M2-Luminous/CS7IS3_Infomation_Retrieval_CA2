After the talks finished, Saburov gave an exclusive interview to a correspondent of the Ostankino radio and television company. [Begin Saburov recording] We spoke about specific things connected with the need to begin economic reforms in Crimea. The situation is extremely difficult, extremely difficult. So we will hasten to take the measures to enable us to adopt a law on the division of powers between Ukraine and Crimea. We will act within the framework of Ukraine's law. Of course, not all of Ukraine's legislation facilitates reforms. Let us state this frankly. This is obvious from the standard of living both in Kiev and Crimea -- it needs to be improved. If the reforms in Russia are sometimes cursed for having reduced the standard of living there, I would advise the critics to come to Ukraine and see what happens when reforms are not carried out. It is a terrible situation. On the whole, the president's attitude toward our proposals was one of complete understanding, and since he is the upholder of the law, all of our activities carried out within the framework of the law will naturally be supported by him.
