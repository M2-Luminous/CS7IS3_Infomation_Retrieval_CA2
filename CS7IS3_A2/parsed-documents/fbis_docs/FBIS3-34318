Several Arab, foreign, and Iraqi figures, representing humanitarian groups and organizations throughout the world, spoke during today's session, which was chaired by Amin Shuqayr from Jordan. [passage omitted] Hugh Stevens from the United Kingdom said that the Muslim communities in Britain suffered from a wave of racism as a result of the policy of the British Government, which decided to declare war against Iraq and deliberately created a racist and tense atmosphere to prepare British public opinion for war. It also exerted efforts to cooperate with the United States to hamper any peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis. He added that creating war deliberately is a crime against peace, in accordance with the Nuremberg principles. Therefore, in light of our experience, we can assert that the British rulers committed crimes against peace, as well as war crimes unprecedented in the history of war. He said: I accuse former British Prime Minister Thatcher of committing war crimes, as well as crimes against peace. He also accused British Prime Minister Major and Foreign Secretary Hurd of war crimes and of committing the crime of deliberately creating poverty in one of the most important areas of the world by imposing an unjust and illegal economic blockade, whose consequences have become clear in Iraq's cities and hospitals. He pointed out that, through its alliance with the United States, Britain committed the ugliest crime of modern times. He described the alliance as most hostile to Iraq. He called for breaking that hostility through joint struggle by the free people of the world, who yearn for freedom and to live in peace. He added: We should continue, through public opinion, to accuse the imperialists of crimes against peace, as well as war crimes, in order to strengthen opposition against the blockade imposed on Iraq.
