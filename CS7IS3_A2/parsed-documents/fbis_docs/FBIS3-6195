Because of North Korea's adoption of an agriculture-is-best, trade-is-best, and light-industry-is-best policy at the 21st plenary session of the 6th party Central Committee on 8 December 1993, it had been predicted that North Korea would drastically reorganize its economic structure. Since then, it has reshuffled a considerable number of ministers of the economic-related ministries and drastically reorganized the enterprise organizations. According to an analysis made by the Information Analysis Office of the National Unification Board [NUB] from January to 10 March 1994 based on reports in North Korean newspapers, North Korea has increased the size of enterprises in light industry and trade, while reducing the size of enterprises in heavy industry. First, the "General Bureau of the Shoe Industry," which belongs to the light industrial sector, has been upgraded to the "Joint General Bureau of the Shoe Industry, and the "Korea Silk Company" has been upgraded to the "Joint Korea Silk Company." On the other hand, the Kangso District Coal Mining Complex has been downgraded to the Kangso District Coal Mining General Enterprise; the Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive Complex to the Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive General Enterprise; and the Kumsong Tractor Complex to the Kumsong Tractor General Plant. A general enterprise is a combination of enterprises that deal with the same kinds of materials according to the order of the production process. On the other hand, a complex is a combination of general enterprises that are technologically related to each other based on a large-scale production unit. Therefore, a complex has been defined as a parent organization of a general enterprise. The reason for North Korea's upgrading light industrial sectors into complexes and for downgrading heavy industrial sectors into general enterprises is the result of its policy to give priority to light industry. This is a change in policy to remove the unequal development of light industry and heavy industry, which is a deep-rooted problem of the North Korean economy. According to North Korea's announcement of the trade-is-best policy, the Unha Trade General Bureau has been upgraded to the Joint Unha Trade General Bureau. The Joint Unha Trade General Bureau has several light industrial subsidiaries, such as the Sariwon Textile Plant, the Kaesong Textile Plant, the Hwangju Fiber Plant, and the Songjin Fiber Plant. In early January, North Korea reshuffled ministers of economic- related ministries by appointing Kong Chin-tae as deputy premier in charge of economic affairs of the State Administration Council; Kim Pyong-kil as minister of the Mining Industry Ministry; Yi Chun-sok as minister of the Forestry Ministry; Kim Kil-yon as director of the State Academy of Science; and Chae Hui-chong as chairman of the State Science and Technology Committee. All of the above are from the working class rather than politicians. North Korea has undoubtedly taken these steps to raise its economic productivity.
