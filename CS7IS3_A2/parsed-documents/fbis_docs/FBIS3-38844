However, he made a final decision dependent on the meeting of the European Union's foreign ministers in Brussels today, and on a decision of NATO's permanent council this afternoon. This was stated by a Foreign Ministry's spokesman this morning. According to Dutch diplomats in Brussels, Kooijmans reportedly is willing to endorse a French plan to impose an ultimatum on the Bosnian Serbs, urging them to take up positions further away from Sarajevo, so that they can no longer shell the city. The Bosnians' and Serbs' heavy weapons must be collected in one place. If they refuse, air strikes will follow. In Brussels, it is expected that NATO's foreign ministers will also talk about air actions above Bosnia. The Netherlands has taken this position of "action wherever necessary" since the Security Council's resolution of 4 June 1993 to protect the "safe areas" from the air, and since NATO's decision of 2 and 9 August last year, when NATO decided to provide air support and to proceed to air strikes, if the population in the "safe areas" was threatened by bombings or armed attacks. NATO can also provide air support, if UN troops can no longer perform their task in the "safe areas." Kooijmans said that he was deeply shocked by the bloodbath in Sarajevo. On Thursday, he called for a greater effort from the United States to give the peace negotiations on Bosnia a new impulse. He told Parliament, that he fears for new outbursts of violence, unless a peace settlement is reached soon. The Netherlands also appealed to its allies not to withdraw the UN's peacekeeping forces for now. In March, it will be decided how the UN troops' mandate can be adjusted.
