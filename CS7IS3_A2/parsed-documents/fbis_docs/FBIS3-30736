Some 595 participants were invited, 35 of whom were guests. Some 362 participants took part in the session here in Sarajevo, 26 of the invited participants were in Zenica on a direct telephone line. Twenty-two participants arrived from Zagreb, four from Germany, and four from the United States. The assembly adopted several documents -- the decision on the negotiations for the solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the decision on the participation of Croats in the representative bodies and bodies of authority, and the declaration of the Council. A Croatian National Council was also formed as the executive body of the assembly of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The assembly presented a completely concrete proposal for the future organization of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The assembly participants claim that this proposal does not support Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unitary republic, that it is not at the detriment of the Serbs in the territorial sense, that it annuls all the excuses the aggressor found for carrying out the aggression, and that it offers a territorial organization that enables the return of the refugees and the evicted people. [Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member] Ivo Komsic, chairman of the Croatian National Council, told the correspondents about the territorial organization of the republic, the structuring of the state authority -- starting from communes, to cantons, and possible republics -- and the necessary federal authorities. [Komsic] The Croatian assembly that took place yesterday adopted a concept of a reorganization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which could remove the causes of the war, which could remove the reasons behind the conquests of other people's territories -- that is, the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory -- as the fundamental cause of the war. This map shows that. These numbers depict these territorial units in a three-level federal state -- as we propose for Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which represent full autonomous units or cantons, and they would be directly connected with each other through the Federal Assembly. The authorities would, therefore, be unified but broken down into 17 autonomous units, while Sarajevo, Mostar, and Banja Luka as extra territorial status as the most important and largest cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with an ethnically mixed population. What is important to say here is that we presented this proposal of a three-level federal state as the grounds for another option that could be discussed during further negotiations, and that is to reorganize the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina into a federal state with four levels of authority. We have left this proposal open for the simple reason that we want to respect the positive results of the negotiating processes on Bosnia-Herzegovina so far. [sentence as heard] [Bosnjak] As for the legitimacy of the Croatian assembly and the Croatian National Council, Bozidar Matic said the following: [Matic] In times of war, assemblies such as this one cannot meet the strict requirements for legitimacy as set out in times of peace, when deputies are counted for a quorum, and so on. I know there will be questions as to how legal this Croatian National Council is and the way it was elected, and I would like to say one thing: Not one party that won power at the last elections had the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its program. Therefore, whoever and however elected -- if he works on the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a country -- he has lost all legitimacy. [Bosnjak] [passage omitted on the Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences and its Bosnia-Herzegovina counterpart demanding end of war and respect of human rights] The correspondents did not have many questions, but they all referred to the proposal for the territorial organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The most important of the replies is the one that contained the hope and conviction that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly will support at today's session the proposal of the assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, which would strengthen the negotiating positions in Geneva of those who support a united Bosnia-Herzegovina.
