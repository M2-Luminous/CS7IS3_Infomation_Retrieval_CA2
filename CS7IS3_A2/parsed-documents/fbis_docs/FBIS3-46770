The three-day visit, scheduled for 12-14 January, will be the first visit to that country by the prime minister. Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa says that Thailand has played a vital role in the reconstruction of Cambodia. The government has provided economic assistance to Thai business people who earlier concluded agreements with various Cambodian factions. Mr. Aphisit says that the ongoing fighting between the elected Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge will not affect the visit to Cambodia by Prime Minister Chuan. However, he says, among the neighboring countries of Cambodia, Thailand will be most affected by the fighting. He reaffirms that Thailand has always complied with the United Nations resolutions on Cambodia.
