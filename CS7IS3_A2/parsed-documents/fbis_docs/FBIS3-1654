The province plans to invest more than six billion yuan in development of non-metallic minerals with 54 exploration projects. The province's verified reserves of refractory clay amount to 537 million tons, about 26 percent of the country's total. Its annual clay output reaches over one million tons. Other major non-metallic minerals include alumina, zeolite, rutile, pearlite, potassium, lime and plaster stones, ranking first in the country both in such reserves and their quality. The increasing exploration for non-metallic menerals is attributed to the country's fast-growing construction and industrial demands and the minerals' high economic returns. Analysts here say that the costs of exploration for and use of non-metals are very low and the prices commanded by non-metal products can be ten times, or even a hundred times those for raw metallic ores. In addition, they have a wide use in many industrial sectors, including metallurgy, chemistry, light industry, construction materials, agriculture and environmental protection. Yangquan, known as a coal city in the eastern border area of Shanxi, produces refractory materials which have been sold to many countries in East Asia and the Western world, as well as to most of China's domestic iron and steel companies. The city's annual output value for refractory materials has been over 200 million yuan over the past few years. It also plans to build a new center with a production capacity of one million tons of refractory materials yearly and another for high-quality production of half a million tons of such materials. The province also has an ample storage of construction materials such as red and black granites, which have for some time enjoyed a good reputation on the world market. For this reason, five big rock materials processing companies will be built in Lingqiu, Hunyuan, Jiangxian and Wutai counties, and Xinzhou City, with a total output of 200,000 cubic meters of rock materials and 1.45 million square meters of rock plates each year. The richness of the non-metallic resources also promotes the province's chemical and porcelain industries. The provincial government has decided to rebuild a chemical plant to bring out a series of expanding clay products which have a wide use in casting, textiles, cleaning, and the national defense industry. In the porcelain sector, the production targeted for this year is a total of 61.75 articles for everyday use and 1.4 million square meters of decorative porcelain. Figures show that out of 115 kinds of ore reserves that have been discovered in the province, 64 are non-metallic, accounting for 55.6 percent of the total. Analysts here attribute the province's wealth of nonmetals to the constant changes in its special geologic structures formed in different periods. About 45 non-metal materials have been explored and widely used in many fields. The non-metals sector has now become a mainstay industry of the province.
