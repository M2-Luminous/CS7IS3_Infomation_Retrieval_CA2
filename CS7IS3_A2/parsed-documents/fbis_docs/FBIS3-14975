In this connection Kazannik emphasises that "the prosecutor's office has not right to legislative initiative. It does not discuss acts but accurately and undeviatingly applies normative-legal acts". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that "upon release, Russia's former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy applied to former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov in a proposal to convene an extraordinary congress of the people's deputies of Russia. This was announced on Tuesday by presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov when he was introducing Aleksey Ilyushenko to the staff of the office of the prosecutor-general. Ilyushenko was appointed acting prosecutor- general of the Russian Federation by a presidential decree." ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on recent developments: "The events of the recent days have shown once again the weakness of state power, the need to strengthen which was mentioned by the president in his message to the Federal Assembly. Not just the weakness of all its elements but complete mismatch in their functioning. "It has turned out that we have got a not so strong constitution if the need for its interpretation arose when it was necessary to take a serious decision" NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the crisis of power in Moscow: "All maintain that the current crisis of power in Moscow has been provoked by the State Duma's well-known decision on a political amnesty. However, it is now clear that the crisis was triggered by no means by the Duma decision but by the attitude of former Prosecutor-General Aleksey Kazannik (and, apparently, that of former chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Nikolay Golushko). "Presidential assistants' incoherent reasoning, because of which they are blamed for lack of professionalism and efficiency, proves not the lack of the assistants' professionalism but the non- professinalism of the order issued to them -- to give explanations at a press conference. How can they give explanations when Kazannik is backed by law and they are backed only by their boss's instruction?" KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin, who expresses his opinion about the announced amnesty. He said "the amnesty is intended for a sufficiently long period of time. According to the president's legislative initiative, a total of 222,000 people are to be released from places of confinement, plus those who were involved in the events of the August of 1991, May, September and October 1993. "It so happened that due to insufficiently efficient interaction of authorities, there was a certain inconsistency in the realisation of the decisions taken. All this undoubtedly brings about certain problems in society," Rybkin said. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. "It has long become clear that in present-day conditions an aggressive nationalism, the Brezhnev and 'Berlin Wall' doctrines, domination ambitions, and 'sanitary cordones' are unacceptable," he writes. "It is now essential to ensure stability and security for the entire Europe and jointly overcome ethnic conflicts... it is important now not to lose the positive movement momentum created by Presdient Boris Yeltsin's initiative which led to a major breakthrough in lifting the siege of Sarajevo. "Energetic and joint actions are necessary. Individual powers and their associations, including NATO, will find their place and make their contributions within the context of combined efforts". VECHERNYY PETERBURG reports that the assembly of lower panels in the Amber Room of the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo is nearing completion. Over the past nine years local restorers have made anew almost 40 percent of panels. The main restoring work will apparently have to be suspended because not a single gramme of amber has come from Kaliningrad over a period of almost three years. All amber is exported from there at commercial prices.
