Talking about worrying phenomena, Horn indicated that they have become aware of telephone tapping, and certain people are watching the movements of socialist politicians in the vicinity of their party offices from cars. [Szombathy] Recently, you have stated a number of times that the opposition does not know anything about the country's economic situation. If this is true then how is it possible to draw up an action program for governing? [Horn] We know the size of the budget deficit, the state debt, and we have information on the continuous deterioration of the balance of payments. No one has denied that in the first two months of 1994 the government spent the entire budget reserve. Before the extension of the deadline, the state is facing a 230-billion-forint obligation in connection with compensation. However, the opposition is not aware of what kind of domestic, or perhaps international, payment obligations the government has undertaken in the period before the elections. We asked the government to inform Parliament about the country's true financial and economic balance but this was refused. Parallel with the coalition talks, an expert team should draw up a true picture that will largely influence the next coalition's room for maneuver. [Szombathy] What can you say about the arguments that are used by the government to prove that the economic situation is much better than is claimed by the opposition? [Horn] Positive results must also have been achieved in the past four years, but we cannot see even any traces of the defined concept on the change of the economic structure. It is futile to argue with a government that claims that agriculture is a successful branch of the economy and privatization has only positive results. In the course of this propaganda of success, I find it unacceptable that the government has frightened people with the colorful brochures that have been sent out in 1 million copies. Personal data was used here that gives people the impression that they are on file. We experienced this while we were collecting the candidate nomination forms. [Szombathy] In what areas can the new government expect some surprises? [Horn] In finding out what actually happened in the course of privatization decisions. We do not know what kind of asset distribution will take place in the remaining time. For me, giving away headquarters buildings for nominal prices is appalling; I am mainly thinking of the provisions to do with the World Federation of Hungarians. As far as we know, most of the asset distributions were legal, but unethical, which is a different matter. [Szombathy] What have you experienced of the oft-mentioned fears of the population in the provinces? [Horn] Fear can mainly be seen among the intelligentsia. In other social groups, the determination for change is rather strong. I am afraid that the campaign will become even rougher. We are experiencing virtually inexplicable phenomena almost every day: We see telephone tappings, and various cars are waiting around our party premises, observing the movements of MSZP officials. We receive many threats. Some television programs also contribute to inciting hatred. The radio dismissals can also increase the hatred. The new government will have to implement political rehabilitation in connection with these journalists, and this actually has a legal basis. [Szombathy] Do you consider an opening toward the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] in opposition to the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], and toward the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] in opposition to the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] possible? Otherwise, would the establishment of various blocs result in a new isolation of the MSZP? [Horn] It is impossible for the liberal bloc to gain an absolute majority; therefore, they will need a coalition partner. If we want to achieve a real governmental change then the Socialists cannot be left out of executive power. The decisive factor is whether the current opposition parties -- this mainly applies to the Fidesz -- will take the need for change seriously. However, this does not permit making an alliance now with the MDF. The Fidesz has to decide what kind of politics it wants to see implemented. We have normal relations with the Free Democrats because their politics are more predictable than those of their partner. In my view, a social-liberal government is a real possibility. However, the MSZP does not intend to drive a wedge between the forces of the liberal bloc. The liberals are struggling with the situation that they would definitely like to get into government in 1994 and, partly because of their supporters, it is difficult to envisage them in opposition for another four years. [Szombathy] Are we not threatened by the danger of the country becoming ungovernable? [Horn] From the country's point of view, it would be most desirable if the Socialists and the possible liberal partners acquired a two-third majority. This has a small chance but a 58 to 60 percent majority will definitely be needed. A two-third majority would only have been possible if a social-liberal election alliance had been formed months ago. The Fidesz's behavior was the main obstacle to this. But I do not think that the country will become ungovernable.
