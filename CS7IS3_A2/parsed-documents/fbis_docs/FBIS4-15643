As everybody knows, the second international conference on the Baltic-Black Sea oil collector (BChNK) was to be held in Kiev on 29-30 January of this year. The conference's initiating group elected Mykhaylo Boychyshyn chairman of the organizational committee. All documents concerning the preparations and course of the conference disappeared with him. The conference was to be attended not only by specialists and government economists from Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, but also private bankers and entrepreneurs who had previously voiced their readiness to establish the Regional Bank of Development. The bank is expected to finance all design and assembly work connected with the implementation of the idea behind the BChNK. As Stanislaw Husak, author of the BChNK concept, notes, the implementation of this idea would diametrically change the geopolitical situation in the Baltic-Black Sea region. If the collector is built, Russia will lose its monopolistic status in the four countries' raw materials markets, and, perspectively, also Estonia's. Such a situation would contradict with Russia's aspirations. Therefore, Stanislaw Husak believes, the Russian special services might have kidnapped Mykhaylo Boychyshyn to hinder the conference. All the more so, since such a conference held two months before the elections could have significantly influenced the course of elections and bolstered the authority of Rukh as a political organization. Although Stanislaw Husak sent a report to Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich on the BChNK project as early as the spring of 1993, he has never received any response. The ADPB and BNF leadership decided therefore that it is necessary to support the project through politics. The Belarusian opposition applied to the Peasant Party of Latvia, the Lithuanian Sajudis, and the Ukrainian Rukh for assistance. In the summer of 1993, the first international BChNK conference was held. The high level of the conference was confirmed by the participation of Ints Jansons, director general of the Latvian conglomerate Latvijas Nafta; Arimantas Dragunevicius, Lithuanian Government adviser for energy issues; Fedor Molochko, director of the Belarusian Thermal Power Engineering Institute; and Stanislav Ivanytskyy, deputy engineer general of the Ukrahazproekt Institute. A feasibility study on the idea of BChNK was conducted during the conference. The invited specialists in design, assembly, and operation of oil pipelines confirmed the feasibility of the project. Members of delegations representing the governments of participating countries supported the idea of building the BChNK. The Latvian and Lithuanian authorities have recently established committees to support the BChNK project. Despite the mysterious disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, the initiating group is preparing the second international BChNK conference in Minsk. The timing of the conference is currently being discussed, and the necessary documents are being reconstructed. Stanislaw Husak has been elected chairman of the organizational committee.
