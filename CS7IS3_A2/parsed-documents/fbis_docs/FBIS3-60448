World Health Organization (WHO) projections indicate that, by the end of the 1990's, there will be 43 million infected people in the world. Moreover, 10 million children will be left orphans of parents who were victims of the disease. "AIDS is one of the most serious problems confronted by the human race," declared Lair Guerra de Macedo, coordinator of the Health Ministry's Program To Fight AIDS, yesterday. She spoke during the course of the World Day To Combat AIDS program, in which health ministers have participated since 1985, when the program was created. In Brazil, the statistics from 1980 until 30 October of this year show an accumulation of 43,964 AIDS cases, revealing that 41 percent of those infected have already died. There are 420,000 Brazilians with HIV. It is expected that, during the next two years, 87,000 new cases will appear, and that there will be 85,000 deaths resulting from the disease. According to estimates, within the same period the government will spend $875 million on patients in an advanced stage alone. Lair claimed that the government will attempt to reduce the infection levels over the next three years, based on a comprehensive AIDS control program financed by the World Bank. The program cost is $250 million, with $90 million in matching funds from the Brazilian Government. According to Lair Guerra, a striking feature in Brazil is the spread of the disease among various population groups, such as women and young people. The expert warned: "The use of injectable drugs is playing a preponderant role in the spread of the disease among the youth." In 1980, there were 28 cases among adolescents; and in 1991, 261 cases were recorded, with 50 percent infected through drug use. During the government's informational campaign disseminated by radio and television, it had been planned to air a video instructing the drug user on how to disinfect needles and syringes, but the film was banned. Two films will be aired promoting the use of condoms, and there will be two radio spots providing information on the disease.
