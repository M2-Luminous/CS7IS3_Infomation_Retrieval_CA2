In fulfillment of the latter, in December the DPS initiated meetings in certain municipalities to discuss and adopt a "Charter for an Association of Municipalities." DPS municipal councillors had taken the trouble to draft a document called a charter for establishing a new administrative-state organization not prescribed under national legislation. At this point it must be stated that the association dreamt up by the DPS is illegitimate. The National Assembly is the only body with the powers to constitute and create new state bodies not covered by the Constitution and the law of the land. The aims and tasks of the association as recorded in its charter emphasize its supramunicipal character. It is to be an body of government that can impose a dictate over its member municipalities in deciding specific issues, albeit with the "consent" of the mayor of the municipality in question. It is no accident that the charter includes this phrase -- with the consent of the mayor, because the purpose of this is to make it easier for the association to impose its dictate in practice, for the mayors exercise the power of the state, not only representing the municipalities, but also governing them. On the other hand, not every mayor in the territory covered by the association can be a DPS member. For this reason, the association's leadership will not be able to wield its dictate in every municipality. Furthermore, all the DPS mayors are functionaries of the local DPS leaderships and are subject to their will. They are obliged to fulfill the DPS program. Evidently, the association's leadership will consist solely of DPS representatives. In the last elections, 27 municipal mayors, 653 village mayors, and 24 National Assembly deputies were elected from the DPS list. According to the decisions of the DPS national conference, they are all DPS functionaries and must obey its orders. Under the charter, the association's member municipalities can preserve their economic, political, and juridical independence, but how will they retain it when, according to the same charter, the association may set them tasks, supervise them, adopt decisions to be carried out by the municipalities, and call them to account. Although they have joined the association "voluntarily," the municipalities are placed under its leadership. Accordingly, the association becomes an body of the DPS and is anticonstitutional in nature. It will comprise not one, but several associations, established on administrative-territorial and ethnic principles. Accordingly, the associations form an intermediate link in the state structure. They are tending to replace the regional and district municipal councils as specified in the Local Self-Government Act that have not been created so far and are unlikely to appear in the future. The DPS has decided to fill this gap by forming these associations. They are being created in regions with a Turkish- speaking population and are differentiated on an ethnic basis. The Constitution does not permit such autonomous territorial formations (under Article 2, Paragraph 1). According to the charter, the leadership of the association consists of one representative for each municipality -- its mayor, who has only one vote in the adoption of decisions, which are passed by an absolute majority, that is, by half the number of members present plus one. The charter does not state the number of members in the association's collective leadership, its minimum or maximum membership, or where its headquarters will be located, nor does it in any way resolve the not unimportant issue of how the association will be financed. The charter, despite its legal imperfections, is of great political importance because of the ethnic aims that it pursues. For this reason, prominence must be given to the ethnic goals that the DPS aims to achieve through the association. The DPS is trying to use it as a form of intermunicipal unification so as to provide qualified assistance to the DPS mayors in their administrative work. Accordingly, it may help them to stick more closely together, exercise more effective control over them, and help to resolve more efficiently the problems addressed in the DPS program. The DPS wants to create an independent administrative and territorial unit that is protected from external influence. Here one can perceive the idea that Ahmed Dogan put forward at the DPS national conference, namely that no one should be able to exercise his dictate in the territory covered by the association -- not parliament, the president, the government, or anyone else. In this way, the DPS provides itself with a terrain for acting and holding sway, undisturbed by anyone, over the territory of the sovereign Bulgarian state, and for manipulating and deciding everything that arises from its program. This is already a basis for ethnic differentiation and for developing political, cultural, and economic autonomy. Thus, the association becomes "a state within the state," in complete contravention of the Constitution and the laws. By creating the association on this basis, the DPS can direct it and link it more closely with our southern neighbor, which in recent years has been displaying and following a purposeful and well- planned policy in many ways in the regions of Bulgaria with a Turkish-speaking population. This already represents a threat to the national security and sovereignty of the state of Bulgaria.
