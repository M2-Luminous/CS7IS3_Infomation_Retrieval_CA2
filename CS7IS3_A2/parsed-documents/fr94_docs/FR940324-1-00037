FR940324-1-00037 FR940324-1-00009 III. Proposed Amendments To Subpart R A. Application of Section 216(2) Section 216(2) of the Act defines the term ``motor vehicle'' as ``*␣*␣* any self-propelled vehicle designed for transporting persons or property on a street or highway.'' Generally, EPA proposes to amend section 40 CFR 85.1703 to provide additional guidance on when a vehicle is not a ``motor vehicle'' under section 216 of the Act. To provide further guidance to the regulated industry, EPA proposes to: (1) Amend this exclusion provision to reflect EPA's policy that the use of a governor to limit a vehicle's speed to 25 mph is unacceptable unless the speed control device cannot easily be removed, disabled, or circumvented; (2) amend 40 CFR 85.1703(a)(2) by deleting the reference to safety features required by Federal law; (3) revise 40 CFR 85.1703(a)(3) to state that the Federal Interstate Highway limitations will be used to determine if a vehicle is of ``inordinate size''; (4) include a new provision reflecting the Agency's policy that racing and other vehicles which are not capable of safe and practical street or highway use will not be considered motor vehicles under section 216 of the Act; and (5) include a new provision to specify when a motorcycle (as defined at 40 CFR 86.402&hyph;78) will be deemed to not be a motor vehicle. It is important to note that converting a non-motor vehicle into a motor vehicle, and operating it on a public street or highway may be considered to be manufacturing and introduction into commerce of an uncertified motor vehicle. This is a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Act and may subject the manufacturer to civil penalties under section 205 of the Act. B. Precertification Exemption EPA proposes to amend 40 CFR 85.1702(a) (3) and (4), to clarify the distinction between a ``Precertification motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine'' and a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine subject to a testing exemption (40 CFR 85.1705). EPA further proposes to revise 40 CFR 85.1702(a) (3) and (4) by substituting the terms ``Manufacturer-owned vehicle'' and ``Manufacturer-owned vehicle engine'' for the terms ``Precertification vehicle'' and ``Precertification vehicle engine'' respectively. Finally, EPA proposes to rename 40 CFR 85.1706 ``Manufacturer-owned exemption''. For purposes of this provision, this substitution does not expand the meaning of the subject terms, but only distinguishes them from the exemptions provided to ICIs under Subpart P in order to eliminate possible confusion created by the current use of the terms. C. Display Exemption EPA is also proposing a revision to the display exemption found at 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(4) and 85.1707. Presently, EPA will grant a temporary display exemption for uncertified motor vehicles under certain conditions. Although the exemption will be retained, EPA is proposing several clarifications. These clarifications include incorporating EPA's policy of granting the display exemption for business or public display purposes only; and establishing a time limit for the display exemption. In addition, the language in the display exemption in 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(4) and 40 CFR 85.1707 will be reconciled so that both provisions will prohibit use on public streets and highways except for purposes incident and necessary to the display purpose. IV. Administrative Requirements A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51,735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.
