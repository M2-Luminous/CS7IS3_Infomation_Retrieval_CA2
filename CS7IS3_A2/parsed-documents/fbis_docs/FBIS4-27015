After the White House session Clinton told reporters that Chile's success in handling democracy and its economic growth made it a potentially important trading partner with the U.S. During talks with U.S. businessmen this morning, President Frei emphasized that any future negotiations about a free trade agreement with the United States or whether Chile plans to join NAFTA, will be considered taking into account the country's strategy for increasing investment and developing exports. Clinton, meanwhile, said that it was most important for the U.S. Congress to approve the development of relations with Chile so that the negotiations for NAFTA membership can be speeded up.
