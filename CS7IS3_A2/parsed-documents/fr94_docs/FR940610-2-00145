FR940610-2-00145 FR940610-2-00073 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 030&hyph;19747 License No. 52&hyph;21082&hyph;01 IA 94&hyph;013] In the Matter of Guillermo Velasquez, M.D. San Juan, PR Confirmatory Order I Guillermo Velasquez, M.D. (Licensee) is the holder of expired Byproduct Materials License No. 52&hyph;21082&hyph;01 (license) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30 and 35 on September 3, 1982. The license authorized the use of strontium-90 for ophthalmic radiotherapy in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The license was renewed in its entirety on August 21, 1987, and expired on August 31, 1992. The byproduct material remained in the possession of the Licensee until it was transferred to an authorized recipient on January 7, 1994 pursuant to an NRC Order to Transfer Byproduct Material to an Authorized Recipient (Effective Immediately) and Demand for Information issued July 21, 1993. II The Licensee did not submit an application for renewal of the license prior to its expiration, as required by 10 CFR 30.37, nor did the Licensee notify the Commission in writing, pursuant to 10 CFR 30.36, of a decision not to renew the license. Therefore, on September 11, 1992, NRC Region II issued a Notice of Violation (Notice) to the Licensee for failure to request renewal prior to expiration of the license or to file a notice of non-renewal or transfer of the byproduct material. The letter forwarding the Notice directed the Licensee to place the strontium-90 in storage and to discontinue use of the material until he obtained a new NRC license. In the alternative, the Licensee was directed to transfer the material to an authorized recipient if adequate storage was not available, or to submit an NRC Form 314 to the NRC if the Licensee chose to dispose of the byproduct material. During a December 4, 1992 telephone conversation between a Region II inspector and the Licensee, the Licensee stated that the source was locked in storage and that the Licensee had not used the source. The Licensee responded to the Notice on December 4, 1992, by requesting renewal of the license. Because the Licensee failed to provide the appropriate licensing fee, no action was taken by the NRC to renew the license and the Licensee was notified. The NRC performed a routine inspection of the Licensee's facility in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico on February 24, 1993. One purpose of this inspection was to determine the status of the strontium-90 source. The inspection revealed that the Licensee had continued to use the material: (1) After expiration of the license; (2) after receipt of the NRC letter and Notice dated September 11, 1992, which directed the Licensee to place the material in storage and to discontinue use of the material until a new license was obtained; and (3) after the December 4, 1992 telephone conversation with the Region II inspector when the inspector explained that the source could not be used and the Licensee had stated the source was in locked storage and not being used. In April and May 1993, the NRC Office of Investigations conducted an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the Licensee's apparent use of the source after the license had expired and after receiving notification from the NRC to discontinue use of the material until a new license was obtained. As a result of this investigation, it was determined that on 20 occasions, between October 9, 1992, and February 19, 1993, the Licensee, with the full understanding that use of the source was prohibited, deliberately used the strontium-90 source for patient ophthalmic radiotherapy, in violation of 10 CFR 30.3. In addition, the investigation confirmed that the Licensee deliberately provided false information to the NRC inspector during the December 4, 1992 telephone conversation and during the inspection conducted at the Licensee's facility on February 24, 1993. Specifically, the Licensee told the NRC inspector that the strontium-90 source had not been used for ophthalmic radiotherapy since receipt of the Notice which was issued on September 11, 1992, when in fact the Licensee had used the strontium-90 source at least 20 times between October 9, 1992 and February 19, 1993, which was as recently as five days before the inspection. This deliberate submission of materially false information constitutes violations of 10 CFR 30.9 and 30.10. III Based on the NRC inspection and the subsequent investigation, the NRC determined that the Licensee, by continuing to use licensed material after being notified of the expiration of the license which authorized that use and by deliberately providing false information to an NRC inspector, had demonstrated an unwillingness to comply with Commission requirements. The Commission must be able to rely on its licensees to provide complete and accurate information. Willful violations are of particular concern to the Commission because they undermine the Commission's reasonable assurance that licensed activities are being conducted in accordance with NRC requirements. Therefore, on July 21, 1993, the NRC issued an Order to the Licensee requiring the transfer of the strontium-90 source to an authorized recipient within 45 days of the date of the Order. The NRC also issued a Demand for Information with the Order requiring the Licensee to submit a written statement, under oath or affirmation, stating why the NRC should have confidence that in the future the Licensee would comply with NRC requirements or provide complete and accurate information to the NRC. The Licensee responded to the Order in letters dated September 7 and 13, 1993, and in telephone conversations with the NRC Region II staff on September 10 and 20, 1993. During these communications, the Licensee indicated that he was making a good faith effort to transfer the byproduct material to an authorized recipient. Based on this good faith effort, the NRC by letter dated October 15, 1993, extended the strontium-90 transfer date to December 6, 1993. On January 24, 1994, the Licensee submitted a completed NRC Form 314 notifying the NRC that the strontium-90 source had been transferred to an authorized recipient and provided the documentation required by the Order to demonstrate that the source was tested for leakage prior to the transfer and that the transfer had taken place.
