The aim of the talks was to examine issues on the implementtion of the agreement on a gradual settlement of Black Sea Fleet problems, to wit: division of warships and vessels as well as their temporary separate basing. Guided by a flexible and constructive position and seeking to find a realistic and mutually acceptable solution of existing problems, the Ukrainian side suggested a stage-by-stage approach to their settlement and put forth several possible versions. Despite the initial considerable difference in approaches of the sides to quantitative indexes of the fleet, the Russian side tried to lessen the Black Sea Fleet's sea-going forces by more than 50 per cent. The substantiated position of the Ukrainian side made it possible to agree all the main quantitative parameters, including the list of Black sea Fleet craft as well as warships and vessels, which should compose a Ukrainian Navy. At the same time, the sides managed to settle the problem of a temporary base of the Russian Navy on the Ukrainian territory. Guided by the need for disengaging the two countries' fleets, provided for by the Russian-Ukrainian agreement of 1994, the Ukrainian side offered several versions, including separate deployment of the Ukrainian and Russian Navies at various facilities in Sevastopol. The Russian side insisted that the Russian Navy should be based at all the Crimean facilities, while the Ukrainian Navy -- outside the peninsula. The Ukrainian delegation justifiably showed that it is impossible to create a viable Ukrainian navy without Crimean bases. Nevertheless, Russia's approaches were immutable. Moreover, unwilling to heed common sense and to understand Ukraine's legitimate position concerning the deployment of the Ukrainian Navy on its own territory, the Russian delegation stopped the talks and disappeared without any explanation. This happened at a time when experts tried to register the approved parameters and provisions which were numerous by that time. The press service of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry expresses regret over the conduct of the Russian delegation, not meeting norms of international negotiating ethics. This is even more deplorable, since real outlines for settling Black Sea Fleet problems became more evident after the last meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry imposes the entire responsibility for the disruption of the talks on the Russian side and reports its readiness to continue the negotiations at any time.
