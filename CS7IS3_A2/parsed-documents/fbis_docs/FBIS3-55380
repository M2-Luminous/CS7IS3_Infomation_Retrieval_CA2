Speaking to journalists before the meeting began, B. Clinton said that discussion of his proposed "Partnership for Peace" concept, which provides for the phased integration of East European countries in NATO, must be one of the main themes on the agenda at the upcoming Brussels conference of NATO countries' leaders. However, according to the U.S. President, it would be premature to start talking abut the possibility of giving Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic full membership status in NATO right now. "I am not opposed to expanding NATO," the head of the White House stressed. However, from what he said "there is no accord" at the moment among the organization members as to the expediency of accepting East European countries. "Therefore, following many decades of work to abolish the `boundary' dividing Europe, we do not want to create the impression that we are aspiring to a new division of the continent," Clinton said. "We favor a secure and stable Europe. At the same time, I believe that sooner or later the `Partnership for Peace' concept will lead to an expansion of NATO." When asked whether in his view the implementation of this concept would lead to the integration of all European states, including Russia, in the North Atlantic Alliance, the U.S. President said: "I hope that ultimately all European countries will clearly and unequivocally put themselves in the hands of a peaceful, stable, and secure Europe, whose states will respect each other's borders." "We cannot simply move the Berlin Wall several hundred miles to the East," General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated at a White House news conference Tuesday. He warned against "creating a division" in Europe again, whether "deliberately or unintentionally," and expressed his opposition to expanding NATO at present by including former Warsaw Pact states. Speaking to journalists on the same day, U.S. presidential national security adviser Anthony Lake stressed that the United States is committed to the "evolutionary" process and is avoiding drawing "new demarcating lines" right now between East and West in Europe. The hasty acceptance of East European countries into NATO could lead to the destabilization of the region and "would be an involuntary confirmation of pessimistic predictions in respect of Russia," was the way he explained Washington's official viewpoint. This, in his opinion, would not be in line with "either NATO's interests or the interests of the states of Central and East Europe." Lake deemed it necessary to stress that this position enjoys the support of President Bill Clinton.
