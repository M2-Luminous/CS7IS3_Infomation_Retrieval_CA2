The proposal aims at getting India and Pakistan to agree to cap their nuclear programmes and accept international inspection of their nuclear production facilities. There is hardly anything new about this approach. It had prompted earlier unsuccessful initiatives to bring about bilateral or regional accords on nuclear-free zones. The present attempt is essentially to present the same idea in a more attractive package. New Delhi must be extremely wary of the underlying trap. The renewed move is suspect especially because it looks like a clumsy stratagem to overcome strong Congressional opposition to the administration's frantic bid to scuttle the Pressler Amendment and supply F-16 combat aircraft to Pakistan. Originally, the administration had sought to oblige the Pakistani military establishment in return for the latter's agreement to verified capping of that country's nuclear programme. Since the proposal made no headway, Washington has now come up with the idea of roping in India into this dubious exercise. This suggests not so much an eagerness to promote nuclear non- proliferation as an overriding need to fulfill Pakistan's ambition to get hold of the sophisticated aircraft as soon as possible. It is particularly significant that while a specific incentive has been offered to Pakistan for accepting the capping idea, no sign is yet discernible of a quid pro quo to India, too. The more intriguing aspect relates to the facile talk of verifiable capping of nuclear installations. It is by now common knowledge that the existing mechanism of verifying these has proved to be anything but foolproof. The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] was totally in the dark about Iraq's nuclear programme although it was a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. The same fatal deficiency has now been indicated in the case of North Korea which, too, has formally subscribed to NPT. India has often underscored the vital importance of an unquestionably sound verification regime if the objective of non-proliferation is to be achieved. But the IAEA has not yet devised one. So long as this is the stark reality, New Delhi must not allow itself to be cajoled much less coerced into accepting any non- proliferation proposal. In fact, credible verification of full compliance with nuclear obligations should be high on the agenda of the NPT review conference next year. The Clinton administration's bid to jump the gun is thus entirely misconceived. Most pertinently, India is already a co-sponsor with the US of a UN resolution seeking an international convention for fissile material cut-off. This is all the more reason why the US initiative limited to South Asia lacks justification
