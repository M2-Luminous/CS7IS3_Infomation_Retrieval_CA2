Speaking about the possibility of starting the process of resolving the Kosova problem, Rugova stressed that the Muslim-Croat agreement in Bosnia and, before it, the NATO ultimatum, mark the beginning of the process of ending the war in Bosnia. Within this framework, we can consider the possibility of the necessity of resolving the Kosova issue. After assessing the pragmatism of U.S. policy and its role in considering the question of Kosova, President Rugova added that so far, Europe has enabled the preservation of the status quo but not the solution of problems in former Yugoslavia. He stressed the role of U.S. initiative in mediation, in which European allies should take a part in consultation with Russia. He added that the beginning of a dialogue would mark an important achievement, although dialogue should be seen as a process. We should be prepared for negotiations to defend our position.
