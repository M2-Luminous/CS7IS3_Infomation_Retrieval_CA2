The areas affected included Vanderbijlpark, Johannesburg, Nancefield and Randburg, the ministry said in a statement. "The ministry recognises the deprivations of the past and the shortages of houses for the majority in the PWV region. But it is of the view that such campaigns were aimed at the previous government, which closed all avenues of addressing basic and fundamental demands of our people." A new situation had developed in the country. A government elected on the basis of the will of the people was now firmly in power, and it had stated publicly its commitment to the Reconstruction and Development Programme which would ensure the basic demands of the people were met. "The ministry, with the private sector, is in a process of developing a programme aimed at alleviating the housing shortage in our province. In this regard, the (provincial) government has committed itself to providing 150,000 housing units in this current financial year." The ministry believed continued occupations might lead to unnecessary tensions, fuel animosities and create a climate conducive for third force elements to exploit and undermine programmes of the democratic government. "The ministry will organise an urgent meeting with all interested parties to seek ways and means of resolving the current impasse and to ensure the development of a people-centred programme to alleviate the problem. In this context, the ministry appeals for a moratorium on new land occupations pending the outcome of such consultations. The ministry will also hold urgent discussions with the Transvaal provincial administration to ensure an end to the harassment of our people."
