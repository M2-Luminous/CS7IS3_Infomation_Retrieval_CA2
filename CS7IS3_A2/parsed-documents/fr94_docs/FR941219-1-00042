FR941219-1-00042 FR941219-1-00015 Rulemaking Analyses and Notices A. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This action has been determined to be ``nonsignificant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA has estimated the costs of the amendments in a Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation (PRE) which has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. As discussed in that document, NHTSA estimates that total testing and container costs for this proposal are $15,020 to $34,780 per container size and type. The agency believes that a CNG container which meets the current industry standard, NGV2, would also comply with the requirements of this proposal, with the exception of the salt spray test. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon the agency's evaluation, I certify that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For six of the seven tests, there will be no small business impacts since the proposed standards are already being met. Comments are requested on current compliance with the salt spray test and whether this would have small business impacts. Information available to the agency indicates that the businesses manufacturing CNG fuel containers are not small businesses. C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. NHTSA has determined that the rule would not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. No state has adopted requirements regulating CNG containers. D. National Environmental Policy Act In accordance with the national Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts of this rule. The agency has determined that this rule would have no adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. On the contrary, because NHTSA anticipates that ensuring the safety of CNG vehicles would encourage their use, NHTSA believes that the rule would have positive environmental impacts since CNG vehicles are expected to have near-zero evaporative emissions and the potential to produce very low exhaust emissions as well. E. Civil Justice Reform The proposal does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. Public Comments Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to thee submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion. If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512.
