The party made the decision during a convention held over the weekend in Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais). The convention was attended by 74 of the 117 delegates with the right to vote. Of the 74, 69 voted in favor of the alliance. There were four votes against, while one delegate abstained (he did not vote either for or against). PPS Secretary General Francisco Almeida, 54, said the party will work to expand the front that supports Lula and "progressive parties." The PPS does not want the campaign and Lula's program of government to become radical. "We want a broad debate on the program. We will begin with the PT program, but it must be open to change, because new sectors should join in for the run-off election," he said. The PPS will deliver its proposals to the PT in 15 days. Of the PT factions, the PPS supports the one led by Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino. Almeida has said that the differences between the PPS and the PT "are not insurmountable." [passage omitted]
