This is what was particularly talked about by Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, when he conducted investigation and studies at Shenyang Railway Bureau and Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone on 12 January. That morning, after listening to briefings given by Liu Zhijun, director of Shenyang Railway Bureau, and Ma Zengqing, secretary of the party committee of Shenyang Railway Bureau, Gu Jinchi extended congratulations and thanks, on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, to Shenyang Railway Bureau for its success in overcoming many difficulties and overfulfilling various state-assigned transportation targets last year. He said: The Shenyang Railway Bureau has done a good job in coordinating with the localities in carrying out their work, and has been involved in what the people are concerned with and worried about, cooperated with the local authorities in economic development, and made prominent contributions. He said: The development of the socialist market economy will bring new problems to the railway departments. For example, enterprises will set their production quota according to the market, and will make the transportation of cargoes more irregular. This will disrupt the planned arrangements of the railway departments, and urge railway departments to understand and accurately find out the pulses of enterprises and markets on their own initiative in order to meet the new changes in cargo transport. He called on the local authorities to cooperate with railway departments in public security, the improvement of work style of railway departments, and safe transportation work on their own initiative, and solve problems at any time. During a forum with comrades of the Shenyang Development Zone in the afternoon, Gu Jinchi fully affirmed the work of the development zone, and expressed the hope that Shenyang city will study the kinds of technological transformation projects that should be introduced by a number of large and medium-sized enterprises with difficulties in Shenyang at present, the kinds of achievements that can be made by colleges, universities and scientific research institutes in the city, and which research projects are suitable for building in the development zone in line with its advantages of being a mother city near the development zone with a strong supporting capacity and numerous scientific and technical personnel. He suggested: After full preparations, the development zone may use the three existing types of foreign-funded enterprises as "match-makers," or ask the commercial counselors of embassies of some countries to serve as bridges, specially invite a number of foreign large commercial corporations and big financial groups to Shenyang to hold economic and technological talks, and make use of the favorable opportunity that all countries are trying to develop markets to bring in some big and high level items. He also said: At present, Shenyang will no longer be under direct provincial control in making economic and investment planning. All departments in the province should actively support the work of Shenyang city. The development zone should report on its own initiative its excellent situation of speedy development and the difficulties it has come across to the relevant provincial departments and bureaus, and may invite leading comrades of some departments and bureaus to participate in the leadership work of the development zone. Gu Jinchi also inspected the main control room and the main communications station of Shenyang Railway Bureau, and Lifu Garment company, Zhongguang electronics company, and Tianxing computer equipment company, and three other types of foreign-funded enterprises in the Shenyang Development Zone. Wang Huaiyuan and Zhang Guoguang, deputy secretaries of the provincial party committee; and Xu Wencai, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and secretary general, also accompanied Gu Jinchi during the investigation and studies.
