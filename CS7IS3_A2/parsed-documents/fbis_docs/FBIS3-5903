At a two-hour meeting Friday morning, Kim and Yi, however, disagreed on abolition of the controversial National Security Law, Yi's proposed visit to North Korea and ratification of the Uruguay Round accord. The two party leaders also showed a considerable difference of opinion on the political neutrality of the police. The meeting, held at the invitation of the president, was their second since Kim Yong-sam inaugurated the first civilian administration in more than three decades in February last year. In view of their differing opinions, the abolition of the National Security Law and National Assembly ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement are expected to become hot political items in the months ahead. Responding to Yi's demand that the National Security Law be revised, President Kim said firmly: "It cannot be done." "North Korea, which had denounced the South in propaganda broadcasts for 10 hours a day, is doing it now for 13 hours a day and it (Pyongyang) has never given up its ambition of communizing the South. "Under the circumstances, we cannot revise the National Security Law any more," the president said, according to presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. With regard to Yi's request for support of his plans to visit North Korea, President Kim warned the DP chairman might be "caught up" in North Korea's strategy to communize the South. Yi's plans to visit North Korea at a time when Pyongyang is trying to gain nuclear weapons capability are undesirable both for Yi and the country. Commenting on the Uruguay Round, Kim said renegotiation of the global trade agreement is not possible, while asking Yi to marshal opposition support for ratification of the accord at the National Assembly. As for issues of political neutrality of the country's police forces, the president said the National Police Administration has already been launched for that purpose. "There was no need, however, to set up a new government agency for police neutrality in a small country like ours," Kim said. Touching on implementation of the revised political bills that were just passed by the National Assembly, President Kim said there can be no ruling and opposition parties "in the sense that they (new laws) signal a renaissance of parliamentary democracy in this country." The president also pledged to mobilize all administrative powers to crack down on those who break election laws during polls for the heads of local autonomous governing bodies in 1995. "It does not matter how many law-breakers we catch," Kim said. "We will bring all of them to justice." Yi told the president that the government should demonstrate its determination to implement the new political laws in order to foster a cleaner political climate. The opposition leader also proposed that National Assembly proceedings be televised to help realize political reform. On the National Security Law, Yi said it should be replaced with democratic law-and-order legislation or absorbed into the criminal code because the law as it stands now is liable to abuse. With regard to the North Korean nuclear question, Yi said it should be resolved through negotiation among the three involved parties -- the United States, and South and North Korea.
