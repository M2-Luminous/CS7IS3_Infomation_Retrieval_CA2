Dr Stamps told reporters in Chiredzi that 20 nurses and six general hands had contracted TB but neither confirmed nor denied that four nurses had died of the disease. "They did not die of TB, we all know what they died of," he said. Investigations to establish the cause of the outbreak were underway while efforts to protect staff from TB were being made, he said. Dr Stamps said precautions being taken to prevent the recurrent of such incidents included proper disposal of TB positive Sputum, the use of masks by staff, proper changing of bed linen and thorough cleaning of hospitals. "TB is a big problem in Chiredzi, you should put in place extra precautions to reduce the risk of TB spreading," he said. He, however, said staff also had a duty to protect themselves but did not guarantee a "non-risk situation." Dr Stamps said in 1992 Masvingo recorded 377 deaths resulting from TB of which 144 were from Chiredzi. He said at least 200 TB cases were reported every three months in Chiredzi.
