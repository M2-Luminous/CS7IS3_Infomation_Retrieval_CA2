Only four months after replacing Benda as party chairman, 30-year-old Ivan Pilip is the quite natural successor to outgoing Education Minister Pitha. Vaclav Klaus will not be overjoyed at the resignation of the ill minister of education. While involving the prime minister in philosophical discourses, Petr Pitha, an admirer of [Czech linguist Vladimir] Smilauer and a Czech history buff, never disagreed with Klaus on government affairs. Pitha's hitherto deputy Pilip, on the other hand, has already clashed several times with the prime minister during debates on the education concept. And only a few minutes after his election as KDS chief, Pilip said about Vaclav Klaus: "I do not think that we have to make any radical concessions to him." Being a realist, the prime minister realizes that he cannot deny Ivan Pilip any longer a place in the government, which the coalition owes the KDS since the times of the "unplaceable" Vaclav Benda. The prime minister even tried to seize the initiative and proposed to Pilip that he replace Frantisek Benda as minister of environment. The circumspect Pilip did not let himself be lured into the trap, however, and did not enter a field in which he is not well versed. The two other chairmen of coalition parties, Jan Kalvoda and Josef Lux, hope that Ivan Pilip's taking up a ministerial post will reinforce them. The hitherto fairly successful deputy minister must, however, first come to terms with the role of minister and all the intricate problems of the education department. If any minister wants to take on the prime minister, even in the political arena, he must have done his "homework" first. Otherwise he ends up being disgraced, which would be even more true of a government greenhorn like Pilip. Whether Pilip's coming to the government, connected with his greater media presence, will help the Christian Democrats is highly uncertain. For the time being, it seems that the ambitious chairman has a better chance of reviving the education Moloch than of reviving his slender party, which is plunging irresistibly into the depths of voters' oblivion.
