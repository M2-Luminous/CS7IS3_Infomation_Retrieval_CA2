But they stressed that the extension of new official development assistance (ODA) to Myanmar, formerly Burma, awaits more "tangible developments" in terms of its moves toward restoration of democracy and improvements in its human rights situation. "In principle, our bilateral assistance remains suspended, except for humanitarian and emergency assistance rendered on a case-by-case basis," said one source. The sources said Japan welcomes the Myanmar military junta's holding earlier this month, after a four-month break, of a national convention charged with drawing up a new constitution. But they said the timetable for completion of the constitution and a transfer of power to a new democratic government remains unclear. The sources said that while some political prisoners have been released by the junta, it is not known when Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi will be released from house arrest. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections in May 1990, but the junta, governing as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), nullified the results. She has been under house arrest since July 1989. SLORC leader Lt. General Khin Nyunt told Japanese journalists last week that a five-year limit on house arrest would be reached in July, but did not clarify if Suu Kyi would be released then. One ministry source said the Myanmar junta "should be commended to some extent" for its recent moves in the direction of openness. "But to more seriously consider resumption of ODA we need to see more tangible developments," the source said. He said Japan wants "to encourage Myanmar to further open its society and ameliorate the human rights situation, and to promote the transfer of power." Japan, long Myanmar's largest benefactor, joined other major donor nations in suspending economic assistance in 1988 after the army killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters. But early the following year it broke ranks and decided to continue with economic assistance already pledged, which by some calculations totaled in excess of 100 billion yen. There are views in the Japanese Government that new official yen loans should be resumed if Suu Kyi is released and allowed to undertake some measure of political activities, the sources said. They said there also exist views that the restoration of such assistance would help stabilize the Myanmar economy, which would in turn facilitate the promotion of democracy. Between 1973 and 1988, Japan provided more than two-thirds of all bilateral ODA disbursements to Myanmar.
