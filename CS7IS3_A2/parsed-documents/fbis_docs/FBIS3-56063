Everything depends on whether the United States will have an understanding attitude to Ukraine's position and its economic situation. In Ukraine the attitude to this meeting is not unequivocal." Borys Bazylevskyy added that today members of the commission are working on the ratification of conventions and international agreements that will be discussed at the next session.
