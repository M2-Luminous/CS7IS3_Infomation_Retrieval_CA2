The total number of drug addicts in Yunnan dropped from 57,000 in 1990 to 40,000 last year. Data provided by departments of the Ministry of Public Security show that Yunnan Province, which is near drug sources across the border, is one of the areas where drug abuse is most serious in China. In recent years, while carrying out well-planned investigation and sternly cracking down on drug criminals, Yunnan Province has done solid work to strengthen the banning of drug abuse and the rehabilitation of drug addicts. Growth in the number of new drug addicts has been curbed, and has dropped from 10,000 new drug addicts each year before 1990, to about 2,000 each year in the past three years. The percentage of new drug addicts among the total number of drug addicts has also dropped from about one-sixth in the past, to about one-twentieth at present. Through experiments in banning drug abuse and rehabilitating drug addicts over the past 10 years, Yunnan Province has gradually formed an effective system for rehabilitating drug addicts which tallies with local conditions. Since 1990, Yunnan has helped over 20,000 drug addicts to rehabilitate themselves each year and has summed up and spread successful experience in preventing them from becoming drug addicts again. The rate of success in rehabilitating drug addicts is about 10 percent. Over the past two years, governments at various levels in Yunnan Province have allocated more than 16 million yuan for building 28 permanent centers for rehabilitating drug addicts by compulsory means. The ``Rules for Running Centers for Rehabilitating Drug Addicts by Compulsory Means in Yunnan Province'' have also come into force.
