His country will do all it can to "become a member." However, with regard to "Russia's encirclement phobia," nothing will be undertaken that would harm Moscow's interests. If Russia continues on its way to democracy, Olechowski said, the "resistance against our membership" will fade. Otherwise the West will have to admit Poland into the defense alliance despite a Russian veto. There is "no alternative" to this, the Polish foreign minister stressed.
