I know that no prophet is welcome in his own house, but I must admit that I am surprised by the amount of hatred that spills forth upon each of my absences from the city. At the same time, the president of the republic and the people at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs understand this, they know exactly what I am doing, that I do not do anything privately. Dr. Zlatko Kramaric, the mayor of Osijek and the vice chairman of the Croatian Social-Liberal Party [HSLS], has been a focal point of interest by the Croatian political public for some time now. In recent weeks, however, this has been not because of his political virtues or shortcomings, his good or bad moves, but rather because he and his city government have been forced to move out of their previous office space in their own city. The conflict with the zupanija government, headed by Branimir Glavas, the zupan of Osijek-Baranja Zupanija, culminated in arbitration by the government of the Republic of Croatia, which ruled in favor of the zupanija government. In an interview which he himself called candid, he talks openly about this fight for office space for municipal authorities, but also about his frequent travels abroad, because of which he has often been targeted by no small number of critics from the ranks of the ruling party, and about the latest clashes within his own party. [Divjak] In the so-called fight with the zupanija government, you lost "on points," through the judge's decision. There was no knockout, but from the beginning you had little, practically no chance of winning. Why then did you even contest the issue? [Kramaric] I see this as a candid interview, where there is trust between us, and I believe in your good intentions, while I think that you believe in mine as well. You yourself have said that this was a so-called fight and I do not want to speak in terms of winners or losers. It even seems to me that if one analyzes some of my actions, I have continuously tried to avoid any conflict, because I am not a contentious person by nature, at least not in politics. No Cause for Feeling Triumphant If there was some program of mine as a person that characterized the elections in this region in 1993, it was a story of cooperation. And I think that I have consistently represented this story, not only during the elections, but also when we assumed power in May 1993; I continually spoke of patience because I wanted to reach an agreement that would satisfy both sides. If we examine the genesis of what happened 10 days ago, we arrive at a situation where we must reveal certain stories and certain details that should perhaps be forgotten. Quite simply, the situation is this. I felt that in a certain fight I did not have the necessary support that I should have received from certain institutions to keep from ending up in a position where someone, as you say, would be knocked out and someone else would triumph. I took one step that was by no means easy. I would call that the three hardest days of my life. I made a decision that can be called this or that, that can even be considered anti-city, that could go down as a bad decision, but that is a political assessment. I considered that I was not acting as poorly as some might interpret, and I wanted to create the preconditions for the city government to finally be able to do the things that it was entrusted to do in the elections. Nearly a year has passed since the elections, but the preconditions for achieving a real demarcation between the authorities and the competences of local self-rule, the zupanija and city governments, have not been created. There are plenty of these unclarified areas here, so to speak, and it is not easy to be prudent and rational. It could easily happen that if the next elections are won by some other party that has thwarted our efforts right now, it would then accuse us of not having fought for enough self-rule. That is politics. Time will tell whether I have made a mistake, but I think that no one has any cause for feeling triumphant. [Divjak] Nevertheless, the city government has been expelled from the center of the city, it has gone to the old heart of the city, which is the former heart, but today there is nothing left of that? [Kramaric] We can talk in terms of serious frivolity. For the city, it could seemingly turn out to be a bad move, it could turn out to be a good move. If we support the policentric development of Croatia, then there is no reason not to support the policentric development of Osijek. Perhaps our return to the old heart of the city, where city hall used to stand, will help to bridge the gap that exists between the three parts of Osijek. Perhaps that will not be so bad either, as it rightly appears today. [Divjak] What is Osijek actually--a city or the capital of a zupanija? [Kramaric] I always see Osijek as a city, and I am the spokesman for a certain civic element in this city. You have the impression that cities that are also zupanija capitals are in some sense also penalized, placed in a position where there are two powerful people acting in one place, if I may say that in this case. But I think that there is room for both and that time will tell in this regard as well. Everyone should deal with his own problems and accept the situation as it is. [Divjak] Of the two powerful people of whom you speak, one was not at all gentle in describing you, not choosing words.... [Kramaric] I will say this--my study of philosophy has taught me tranquility. I have always said, I love the media: If there are disagreements, then they are conceptual in nature, not personal. I can disagree with some concept, be opposed to it, but I cannot be against a person because my nature does not permit it. I am not structured for that and you cannot hear harsh words from me. [Divjak] Charges are often leveled concerning your travels. To what extent is there any real, general benefit from them, and to what extent is there personal benefit, as is charged? For example, you recently spent 10 days in the United States. Clinton's Invitation [Kramaric] Actually, I have sometimes wondered whence and for what reason such odium has arisen, even among the public, concerning each of my trips. I do travel on business, I do not ask anyone to invite me, and I do think that my activities before and during the war created a certain image of me, of the city, of the political option that I advocate, in the world at large. I think that the image that I have created and conveyed is never harmful to Croatia; on the contrary, that it displays certain other colors and most often that is the motivation behind certain invitations that I receive and that I often must carry out, around 80 percent of them. There really are a lot of them. But the invitation from the U.S. Congress and President Clinton, to attend a certain event that for us Europeans, and especially Croats, has an almost metaphysical appeal in the sense that you are attending a "national breakfast," a prayer meeting, which did not last only one day. Congressman Wolf says, "We want to hear your story too." This is an opportunity for you to meet with a number of very important and influential U.S. politicians, and if you want to change your image, then you must tell a story and someone must want to hear that story. It is better for us to talk than for there to exist an entire series of prejudices and stereotypes about us, which unfortunately do exist. We are a nation whose history has been disputed, about whose history others are unaware. If you get the opportunity to interpret this disputed history, to show our truth to those people who make the decisions, then that is a big thing. And Kramaric uses these trips precisely for that purpose. It is interesting that I have a much higher rating at the State Department, in Bonn, or elsewhere far beyond our borders, than I have at home. I know that no one is a prophet in his own house, but I must admit that I am surprised by the amount of hatred that spills forth upon each of my absences from the city. When it comes down to it, I could be very private and say that I have a son who is of the age when he requires his father's presence, that I have an obligation to him. It is clearly not simple. There you come into contact with people who are clearly not well-disposed toward us, who know how to raise very perverse questions, and you have to be very skillful to defend something known as Croatian politics and the Croatian situation. At the same time, the president of the republic and the people at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs understand this, they know exactly what I am doing, that I do not do anything privately. This is delicate work, which often lands you in delicate situations that it is definitely not easy to get out of, and it seems to me that I have done a good job. It is not up to me to make that assessment, but if you have direct contact with a man named Reismueller, who is a difficult person and does not talk to just anyone, if he wants to hear my assessments and is interested in what I think about the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and if I can express that opinion elsewhere as well, then you have to respect these in no sense easy efforts that you make up your mind to do as a person. [Divjak] During your trip, you met with James Baker, who today is increasingly feeling remorse for what the West has done in the former Yugoslavia. Does he really understand what he did in June 1991 in Belgrade? [Kramaric] You know, perhaps Baker has not evolved as much as we would like him to, and he still has a very negative attitude toward the Croatian position regarding Bosnia. I met with Baker together with, among others, representatives of Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. While the Bulgarians and Romanians were euphoric when discussing Baker's visits in 1990 and 1991, I had the good fortune to observe and say to him that we in Croatia do not share this enthusiasm and that in fact we regard his visit to Belgrade in June 1991 as a green light for all the horrors and calamities that happened after that. Naturally, no one said that he imagined that what he did at the time would have such consequences, but it did, and in any event Baker has heard that now. That much is clear to him now, but there is still an awareness that tries to equate the aggressor and the victim and that must be told that this is a classic imperialist, ideological, colonial war, a war for territory. Anything else is an effort to justify the moral bankruptcy of 1991 and 1992, when this could have been prevented. And everything is being repeated in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian entry into Sarajevo is the definitive fall of Yalta, with the West losing 400 km of its territory and the East gaining it. A weak Russia is dictating policy while the West is wavering again. This is an indiscretion, this failure to understand that the East is approaching by very quick steps is a grave danger. [Divjak] Let us return to the domestic scene. What is happening to you in your party, Mr. HSLS vice chairman? [Kramaric] In any party, especially a party that is on a certain upswing, that wants to capture as much political room as possible, it is inevitable that there will be certain disagreements. I am a linguist by profession, and one of the first rules of linguistics is that disagreement is a condition of reaching agreement. That is the context in which I consider the response to your question. There must be certain differences in order to achieve any agreement. [Divjak] What is the essence of the disagreement? [Kramaric] It is very hard to come from Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, Osijek, Cakovac, Varazdin, Koprivnica, Zadar, Sibenik; you do not have the same views on some problems. This war, the extremely motley quality of Croatia, heightened by these wartime events, has slowly clouded our views. Something seems completely normal from Zagreb's perspective, while from the perspective of Osijek or Zadar-Sibenik it has a different look to it. I think that fundamental disagreement should be sought here. Second, you have patient and impatient people in any party. A certain number of people in the HSLS may think that power comes rolling by and you only have to bend over and pick it up. I personally do not think that power is that weak, that it is served up on a platter. On the contrary, I would like for the political scene in Croatia to be stabilized and that one party no longer receive more than 50 percent of the votes, that a coalition-based, cooperative relationship be the foundation of the future Croatia, both in the Assembly and in the government, that we be forced to talk to each other and eliminate the amount of animosity that exists. Governmental authority must be a category of responsibility, not of strength. Sometimes my colleagues on the city council tell me that they have the impression that I am afraid of something, and I am in fact afraid because I make decisions that could hurt someone, but I do not want to hurt anyone. This principle of responsibility is my fundamental principle, which guides me when I make decisions. Liberal Consensus [Divjak] To what extent is that the majority principle in your party? [Kramaric] I hope that this will be well-emphasized here. Although I am vice chairman, I am not very involved in making important decisions on the party level. Are you commenting on my, shall we say, indecision about what to do in the future? I have not made being an Assembly deputy my profession, I have retained my faculty position, and ultimately I am the mayor. Although--and I can say this now--I grudgingly agreed to run for office. At first I did not expect to win, I thought I was lending my name to the liberals' impetus. But there was a big, I would even say excessive, victory by the HSLS on the city level, I succumbed to persuasion by people who said that I had to assume power, although even then I thought differently, and organize my life in the sense of working in the party, in the Assembly, and at the university. Thus, I am in a position to marginalize myself in relation to creating strategic projects in my own party, by my own will. But I am satisfied with the work of the Grand Council, where liberals from all over Croatia come together, and those differences that emerged previously now emerge only in public. And that does not have to be a bad thing. For now, it seems to me that for certain views there are mild misunderstandings. Second, many people forget the "S" in the name of the party, which has a Christian democratic connotation, which shows that the liberals are aware of the situation in which Croatia finds itself. Not only because of the war, but also because of the Bolshevik legacy that has left behind a number of social problems that we would like to solve in a liberal fashion, but with the very refined, Christian component of justice and awareness of all hardships. Some people might say that this is a contradiction, but I would say that it is an oxymoron, and I like oxymorons. [Divjak] Is it possible for us to speak of some leading faction in the party? Whose positions are the strongest? [Kramaric] I think that there is a general consensus among all so-called factions on key issues. I try to be a person who will be good with everyone and have understanding for everyone. If you really want to know, I am closest to the government of Gotovac, if I may say so and reveal that. There is a whole series of sensible people there with whom we mostly agree, from Budisa, Rados, and Granic to Butkovic.... [Divjak] You have listed almost everyone. With whom do you not agree? [Kramaric] I think that there are some, I might call them techno-managerial components of the liberals whom I personally feel are somewhat impatient and do not see the motley nature of Croatia.... [Divjak] Whom do you mean concretely, Fizulic? [Kramaric] Well, yes. Personally, I do not have poor relations with Mr. Fizulic, but a few times he has made some decisions--we said that we would be candid--that do not hold up. Let there be no misunderstanding--he does not have a bad concept, but he does not always do the best job in harmonizing this concept with every Croatian concept. That is my most precise response. President for 21st Century [Divjak] Could the same thing that happened to the IDS [Istrian Democratic Assembly] in Pula also happen to the HSLS in May at the electoral assembly in Osijek? [Kramaric] I think that we are in any event a serious party, and if such signs were to appear then we would know how to reach a gentlemen's agreement. To be precise, so you do not catch me, I think that it cannot happen, but if there were certain tendencies--and I say this only in the conditional--then we would know how to resolve them through a gentlemen's agreement, without amusing the Croatian public in that way. [Divjak] Is Drazen Budisa remaining at the head of the liberals? [Kramaric] I think that he is. I must repeat this--I welcome his candidacy as party chairman with sincere satisfaction. He is a person, politician, and friend for whom I feel exceptional esteem and with whom I have not had a single important disagreement thus far. He is necessary to both the liberals and Croatia, and he must complete the cycle that began with him. That is good, whereby we too are aware of what we have conditionally called the policy of a new course, that what applied yesterday does not apply today. That there will be adjustments in some of our positions toward current events, but there will be no abandonment of the fundamental premises. [Divjak] How then does this fit in with the appearance of Zlatko Kramaric in the post of HSLS chairman for the 21st century, and does he in fact want to be that? [Kramaric] That should not be ruled out either. It is possible that our turn will come in that regard if I continue to offer good answers, good solutions in the concrete situation. There is no reason for me not to assume that honor and obligation. I am not running away from that, but I think that this time, the 20th century and perhaps the 21st century as well, if it does not turn out that I am giving Budisa a short life span, must end with him. But anything is possible in the 21st century. [Divjak] Does that mean that your concept of understanding could have a place on the Croatian political scene? [Kramaric] Once this time of triumph and tragedy that has happened to us as a nation is over, people will have to start behaving reasonably. We have paid dearly for a big school, and we must draw some lessons from it. I think that the time is coming for rational behavior, for the concept of cooperation, a concept in which you do not regard political adversaries as enemies, that the time of hatred is over. Because this amount of hatred can be our undoing; I have always said that our political conception will be drawn into question when we respond to the hatred of others with hatred of our own. But unfortunately it seems to me that on the current Croatian political scene, now that we have lost our enemies, we are looking for new enemies, that we are looking for them in our very midst, and that is what distresses me very much and why I think that it is not good for the future of Croatia.
