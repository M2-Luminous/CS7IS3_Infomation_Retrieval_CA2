[Watanabe] Since we are sailing in the all-time furious storm, nothing is harder than the current situation. But the weather clears up after a storm. If Mr. Hata does his job by making good use of his characteristics of frankness, the people will understand him. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some say the way in which the group "Kaishin" was formed was coercive. [Watanabe] Shinseito's original view was that the ruling coalition parties should get united before the upper house election set for next year. We were thinking of the following procedure: at first, parties which have similar backgrounds, ideas, and policies come together, and then the realists of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] join the force. A hitch occurred when we did things very quickly. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Party members also expressed criticism. [Watanabe] Some members argue that there are no internal procedures in the party. Secretary General Ozawa briefed on the proceedings at a joint meeting of the standing secretaries council and the secretaries council, and they unanimously approved the idea about forming "Kaishin." Probably, some of those who are not party executives were not informed of it. However, we did not avoid democratic process, but we put things through based on decisions made at party bodies. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Shinseito's scenario for realignment of the political world has changed now that the coalition has become a minority? [Watanabe] We believe the trend will move toward the political system based on two major parties. However, as Mr. Takemura (Sakigake [Harbinger] representative Masayoshi Takemura) and others mentioned the force to be comprised of the "Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and liberals," now there is a move toward building the tripolar structure. Under the situation, there had been differences of opinion among the ruling coalition parties. Although I do not know whether this is a temporary trend, I am sure that the tripolar structure has become clear with the SDPJ's secession from the coalition. It is not easy to clearly say whether the current political structure will return to the bipolar system in preparation for introducing the electoral system for the House of Representatives combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration is said to be a "short-lived administration." [Watanabe] When we formed the Takeshita cabinet, we thought it would continue for at least four years. However, it lasted only one and one-half years. The Nakasone cabinet, which was said to be a short-lived administration at the beginning, lasted for a long time. Taking these cases into consideration, I do not care about this matter very much. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is Shinseito's basic strategy in the minority administration? [Watanabe] By proposing concrete policies on the tax system, diplomacy, and other issues which can be supported by the general public, we will make efforts to gain support for the Hata cabinet from Diet members who voted for "Tsutomu Hata" in the prime ministerial election. That is all about our strategy. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some talk about the possibility of the House of Representative being dissolved. What is the outlook? [Watanabe] The dissolution can be considered only when the budget bill or other important bills are rejected at the Diet, and when a no-confidence motion in the cabinet is approved. However, if a no-confidence motion in the cabinet is approved without any reason, the cabinet should not resign en masse tamely. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Did the resignation of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano give a blow to your party? [Watanabe] It was really regrettable. Giving consideration to the Asian people is Mr. Hata's basic policy. If a person whose ideas are totally different from those of the prime minister is asked to join the cabinet, he should not accept the offer. From the viewpoint of democracy, once a person joins the cabinet, he should follow the prime minister's ideas. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Shinseito has given a growing impression that it is a "hawkish" party. What do you think of it? [Watanabe] In the past, politicians who pushed forward the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China were called doves while those who expressed opposition were called hawks. We supported normalization when we were members of the former Tanaka faction of the LDP. We have the consistent belief that we are the doves within the conservative party. I deeply regret that people call us the hawks. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any gap between the image and the reality? [Watanabe] The image comes from our views on the Constitution. We do not say the Constitution should be revised soon. However, since the Constitution has provisions for its revision, it is inappropriate to think the discussion itself on revision of the Constitution leads to being hawks or ignoring the Constitution. Discussion on amendment of the Constitution should be taboo.
