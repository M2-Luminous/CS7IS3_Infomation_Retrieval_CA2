This was stated in greetings from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to those taking part in the Assembly of Peoples of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The once backward, distant, northern outpost of Russia was transformed by the persistent and concerted hard work of the Yakuts, Russians, and other peoples of Yakutia. Today, under the difficult conditions of the transition period, economic progress and political stability in the republic depend to a great extent on prosperity in the ethnic relations sphere. Success may be achieved only by overcoming territorial and national egoism and by demonstrating self possession, calm, mutual respect, and responsibility for the fate of our united fatherland -- the Russian Federation. Much has already been done toward creating conditions where there is a genuine equality of rights for the development of all of the peoples of Yakutia, the greetings state. Even more needs to be done. The small northern peoples -- the Evens, Evenkis, and Yukagirs demand particular concern from the republican authorities. The president congratulated the multi-ethnic people of Yakutia on their Day of the Republic.
