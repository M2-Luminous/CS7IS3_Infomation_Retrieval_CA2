We asked Mr. Mirko Marjanovic to give an exclusive statement on the occasion for the Radio and Television of Serbia. [Marjanovic] Well, this is as follows: The proposal of the law on the budget of the Republic of Serbia for 1994 was drafted in conformity with the basic program of monetary reconstruction and the strategy of economic development of the country, and particularly in conformity with the government program adopted at the latest session of the Serbian Assembly when the Government was approved. One should also stress here that, according to the proposal of the law on the budget for 1994, public spending in Serbia is lower by more than 30 percent compared to the planned level of public spending in the consolidated balance on the level of the country. Now here is what that means: That means that the planned deficit in the basic program has been reduced from 1.9 billion dinars to 780 million and we can claim with full confidence that we have completely realistic sources of income for covering this budget deficit. We can also claim with confidence that with this reduction of public spending by almost two-thirds we have established a basis for a normal program and for the realization of the program of economic recovery of the country. I can also stress here that the social program for Serbia was also included in the budget and that with the basic principles and strategy of the budget established in this way, we in fact enabled the further removal of the burden on the economy and citizens, which should also be pointed out.
