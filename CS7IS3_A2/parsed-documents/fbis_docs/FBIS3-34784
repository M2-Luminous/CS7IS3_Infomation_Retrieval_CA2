[passage omitted] He said that the Syrian forces operating in Lebanon "are playing a positive role in maintaining security." He revealed that "they recently contributed to the arrest of those accused of killing the Jordanian diplomat" Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah. He said that the solution in the region "will not be at Lebanon's expense," referring in this connection to assurances from U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He spoke of an agreement between Lebanon and Syria to sign the peace agreement together once it is achieved "because it is a matter of national security for both countries." Al-Hariri made these revelations on the evening of the day before yesterday during a "seminar on the issues of the hour" held at the central school attached to the Lebanese Maronite monastery in Juniyah. [passage omitted] Asked why the al-Ta'if agreement has not been implemented, particularly such matters as dissolution of all the militias, withdrawals of weapons, administrative decentralization, and formation of the economic and constitutional councils, al-Hariri said that "a decree will be issued about the Constitutional Council which has been formed after consultation with the Shura Council." He said that what was meant by decentralization under the al-Ta'if agreement was administrative not political decentralization. He said: "We are talking about Lebanon's unity. We cannot address that and at the same time speak of political decentralization. Lebanon is a small state. Should we divide it into many parts? That is out of the question." [passage omitted] He said: "I do not believe that there is a single Lebanese who would not condemn the execution which occurred in Ba'labakk. Nobody can defend that and we cannot accept it. The judicial authorities have moved to act in this connection." He stressed the importance "of consolidating the judicial authority and expediting its procedures" within the democratic system. Asked why the Syrian Army has not been redeployed in accordance with the al-Ta'if agreement, al-Hariri replied: "Under the agreement the Syrians are supposed to help the Lebanese state maintain security in the country." He spoke of promises of massive aid from abroad not honored except by three states, namely Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. "We just got advice from other states." He added that "the Army cannot be rebuilt with just words. It takes a major part of the budget, and that is our duty. We are engaged in negotiations with Israel and agreement on withdrawal may be achieved. We all know that one of the most important conditions for withdrawal is security. That is the duty of the Lebanese state. In other words, a major part of the Lebanese Army would go to the south to assume responsibility for security. Are we now able to maintain security in all parts of the Lebanese Republic or do we need some time and assistance? Some states sent us some aid for the Army, consisting of vehicles, trucks, light weapons, and many promises. In practical terms, we have not received aid that would enable our Army to maintain security in all parts of the Lebanese Republic. We should not hide behind our hands on this matter. Not long ago an official of the Jordanian Embassy was assassinated and the perpetrators were arrested. The truth is that the Syrians contributed to the apprehension of the culprits. Since I assumed my government post the Syrians, I can confirm, have been playing a positive role. We should all seek to strengthen the Army and the Internal Security Forces and in fact all the security authorities so that they can assume responsibility for security throughout the republic." Asked why there are still Syrian Army barriers in the streets and why the Internal Security Forces should not man these barriers, he replied: "We need the Syrian forces to maintain security. They are present at some barriers and not at others, according to need. These are military matters." Al-Hariri pointed out that "the position of the state and the government is that the solution in the Middle East will not be at Lebanon's expense. That is what the Americans assured us of in two messages from President Clinton and his secretary of state. Secretary Christopher assured me of this personally, directly after the Geneva summit. To say that the solution would be at Lebanon's expense is out of the question." [passage omitted] He was asked: If Israel told Lebanon that it was willing to withdraw from the occupied Lebanese territory, would the state accept such a withdrawal separately from Syria or would it await the results of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations? He replied: "Israel never said that it was willing to withdraw from Lebanon. It said it was willing to sign a peace agreement with Lebanon. If there is going to be a peace agreement, we and Syria should be together. Resolution 425 means unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. We demand that. When President Hafiz al-Asad met with President Clinton, he asked him openly to implement that resolution. Its implementation means Israel's withdrawal. So let it withdraw. We have no problem with that, nor has Syria, but when it comes to signing a peace agreement with Israel, we and Syria should be together. Why do we say this? Because the matter concerns our national security and Syria's national security." [passage omitted] He denied deep differences between the three leaders [the prime minister, the president, and the speaker of the chamber of deputies). He expressed the belief that time will correct the experiment. He said that it is inaccurate to use the word hegemony (of one authority over another). [passage omitted] Al-Hariri emphasized that "there will be no government changes or reshuffle for the time being." He said that the reason there is continuous talk about that "is that there are some who do not like the situation, and the best way of weakening the government is to say that it is on its way out." He said that, in his view, "the ministers act on the basis that the government will not change for the time being, but that does not mean it will be there forever. It would fall if the Chamber of Deputies withdrew confidence from it or if one third of the ministers resigned, or if the prime minister resigned. I have no intention of resigning at the present time." [passage omitted]
