Cuba's official news agency, PRENSA LATINA, said vice-president of the air charter company Pedro Manduley confirmed that the copilot of the plane chose not to return to Cuba and was detained by the Caribbean island immigration authorities. The DC-3, with 11 tourists aboard, flying the Havana-Great Cayman-Havana route, was bound for the capital during the next hours, said the Cuban official. After the incident occurred Tuesday [4 January], the captain of the aircraft and three crew members called the main offices of the Aerocaribbean Tuesday night to ask for authorized return flight. According to international rules, no aircraft can fly without a copilot. As a result, the return was postponed until today after another copilot was flown in a company plane to Great Cayman, said Manduley.
