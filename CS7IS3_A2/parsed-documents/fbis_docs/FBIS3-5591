The group was called the Southern Luzon Commission (SLC) which covered 15 provinces, 12 cities, and at least 140 municipalities. With the dismantling of the big rebel organization, its three regional party committees and six armed guerrilla fronts have to report directly to the 16-man national communist party central committee headed by self-exiled CPP Chairman Jose Ma. Sison. The dismantling of the SLC was revealed to newsmen by Brig. Gen. Regino Lacson, Southern Luzon Command (Solcom) officer-in-charge. In a report to Defense Secretary Renato de Villa, AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia, and Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, commanding general of the Army, Lacson said that the dismantling of the big rebel organization came about as a result of military-orchestrated events and tactical campaigns in the Southern Tagalog Region, and the Bicol Region. The campaigns, he said, left a big void in the rebel organization's leadership caused by mass defections and death in encounters of top NDF leaders, NPA field commanders and armed regulars. The Solcom chief reported that four armed terrorist groups -- the Apolonio Mendoza Agbay, and the "A-A" and "Daba" companies of the mobile regional guerrilla unit (MRGU) and the urban guerrilla command of the SLC -- were finally crushed by military intelligence operatives and field troops who waged relentless search-pursue-and-destroy operations. In Bicol, the NPA's Regional Operational Command (ROC), the Regional Educational and Cultural Committee, the Front Mass Action Committee, and the Revolutionary Agrarian Staff of the Camarines Sur West Guerrilla Front and the Regional NDF United Front Commission had been disbanded and dissolved, he said. Also dissolved were the Caltex Military Sector of the Quezon-Bicol Zone Front Committee and the Front Guerrilla Unit "Aguila" in Masbate, he said. The Quezon-Bicol Zone Front Committee, which used to have four district committees under it -- the Quirino, Onofre de Mesa, Mercedes and Guijo Committee -- now operates only in Camarines Norte, Lacson added.
