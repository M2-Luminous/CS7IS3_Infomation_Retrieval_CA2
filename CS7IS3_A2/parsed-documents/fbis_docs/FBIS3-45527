In order to ensure the smooth implementation of a number of important reform proposals and sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 1696 1660] development of the economy, the macroeconomic policies should focus on countering inflation. As an economic expert in close contact with decisionmakers, Sun Shangqing studied national economic performance and trends toward the end of 1992 and recommended that the macroeconomic management for 1993 should focus on preventing economic overheating. This assessment later commanded much attention from various quarters. Sun Shangqing believed that China's economy has entered a stage of rapid growth. The growth rate in 1994 will remain high, and any attempt to keep the growth rate unnaturally low will cause major fluctuations that will undermine national economic development. Considering that growth in 1994 will be based on the high rates of 1992 and 1993, it is appropriate to set the target growth rate at 9 percent. He said: We have a weak economic base. Speedy development is bound to create tension in various economic relationships and put a strain on energy, communication, important raw materials, currency, and financial expenditures. Under such circumstances, the important reform measures to be promulgated this year will probably all cause some shocks and lead to instability in the economy. Therefore, one should be both optimistic and cautious when analyzing the economic situation. It is necessary to fully consider the risks in the course of reform and prepare for possible trouble. Sun Shangqing pointed out: The most critical risk is probably inflation. China's economy is still quite vulnerable, as is the mentality of the general public. Development is unbalanced in different localities, and there are major discrepancies when it comes to personal incomes. We should be soberly aware of these facts and should not overestimate the society's threshold of tolerance for inflation. In 1993, the general retail price index went up 13 percent, and the cost of living in 35 large and medium cities increased by 20 percent. This "tailspin [qiao wei 5062 1442]" has constituted a great source of pressure this year. Therefore, special precautions should be taken against a possible increase in the inflation rate caused by the persistently large investment in fixed assets, the unification of exchange rates, and the price hikes of some energy and agricultural products, and efforts must be made to keep the inflation rate under 10 percent and prevent stagflation. Sun Shangqing maintained that what is important for 1994 is to properly handle the relationship between reform and development and that between speed and efficiency. Macroeconomic policies must be directed to specific issues, and the central bank must effectively control the money supply. The management of the national economy must achieve the following two changes: First, the quota supply system that used to be based on rare resources should be changed, and the predominance of supply-based management should be converted to demand-based management. On a microeconomic scale, production should be arranged according to market demand; on the macroeconomic scale, it is necessary to keep a close watch on overall demand trends and the demand structure. Second, attention should be given to the improvement of economic efficiency. It is necessary to seek the qualitative improvement and quantitative growth of the national economy in the context of optimized economic structure and overcome the tendency to place excessive emphasis on speed.
