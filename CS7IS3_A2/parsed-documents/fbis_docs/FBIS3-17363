Rumors have lately been circulating in Paldiski that the number in the stamp entered in documents during registration of the population denotes the order in which people will be deported from Estonia. In reality the numbers 1, 2 or 3 in the stamp indicate in which of the three registration stations in the town a person was registered. Olesk condemned the rumors as "utterly false" and blamed them on people's inner anxieties or misapprehensions. "The Estonian nation has never attempted to deport anyone, while we know very well how we were deported more than once," he said. "Since we know what deportation means, we never planned anything like that for others." Tikk voiced the opinion that the rumors were launched with a definite goal in view. "The number in the registration stamp has no ulterior meaning," he affirmed. "The documents of the Russian military, for example, are marked with a stamp bearing number 4. We have no intention of repeating what Russians, Germans or whoever did here in their time." On Wednesday [23 March], the second day of population registration in Paldiski, 906 people were registered. Tikk told BNS there were no incidents, except that some forged documents came to light. On Tuesday 689 residents were registered in Paldiski. Both Tikk and Olesk told BNS there's no particular opposition to registration in the town. "The residents of Paldiski themselves wish to be registered, since it will increase their security during the dismantling of the nuclear reactors when checks on people staying in the town are unavoidable," Olesk said. "The stamps allow people to move freely in Paldiski under the special regime." Registration of Paldiski residents ends on March 26.
