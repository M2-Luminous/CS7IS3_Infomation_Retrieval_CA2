Addressing the Wednesday sitting of the republic's Presidential Council, he underlined that introduction of a moratorium on acts of a political manner, proposed by the agreement, again postponed signing of the bilateral agreement between Russia and Bashkortostan for an indefinite time, Rakhimov noted that this is being done "at that very moment when all issues on this bilateral agreement have been coordinated in the course of years of difficult negotiations." Members of the council called on the head of the republic not to sign this document because it is "a chauvinist document infringing upon the rights of the constituent members." According to the council, in general the agreement reminds of a directive from Moscow sent to the regions without minding the interests of the republics within the Russian Federation.
