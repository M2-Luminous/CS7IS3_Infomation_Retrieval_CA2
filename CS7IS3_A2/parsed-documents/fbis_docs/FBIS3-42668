The substance of the new decree is quite simple. It formalizes the monopoly status of the Ministry of Defense in the foreign economic sphere, and it is made exempt (on top of that, retroactively to 1 June 1993) from paying customs duty of exported military property. In the past, the military had already been granted a number of preferences. In the president's edict "On the Procedures of Sale and Utilization of Surplus Military Property" dated 30 November 1992, the Ministry of Defense was given the status of the only middleman in selling military property outside of Russia and made exempt from paying tax on this income. Despite the fact that the government decree undoubtedly will help to raise the level of social benefits of military servicemen (the proceeds from the sales of property are to be used for construction and acquisition of housing), the ministry itself also will get the opportunity to improve its material situation. As a result of the central administration of material resources and foreign economic relations of the Ministry of Defense, whose responsibility it is to sell military property in foreign markets, being exempted from paying taxes and export duties, the administration will be able to dictate to military units wishing to sell such surplus goods its own terms and prices. Besides, like any foreign trade monopoly, the administration takes a commission which, even within a "reasonable" range, makes a substantial addition to budget financing. On the whole, monopolization of foreign trade in the military sphere shows the increasing trend toward pushing commercial structures and private individuals out of foreign economic activities. [Box, p 2] Privileges Granted to the Russian Ministry of Defense --Sales and utilization of surplus military property (except arms and munitions) may be performed only by Ministry of Defense structures. --The Ministry of Defense is exempted from paying all categories of taxes on the proceeds from sales of military property if these proceeds are directed at improving socioeconomic and housing conditions of servicemen. --The Ministry of Defense is exempted from paying customs duty on export of surplus military property.
