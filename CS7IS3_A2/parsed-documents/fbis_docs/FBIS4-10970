Ricupero believes the agreement will be indirectly instrumental in reaching an agreement with the IMF, which will in turn put an end to a crisis that has afflicted Brazil for 12 years. Ricupero said on 17 April that "the crisis that has erupted in the country since 1982 provoked uncertainties in the Brazilian economy and discouraged new investments." To demonstrate that the agreement signed in Washington on 15 April will have a positive impact on the lives of all Brazilians, Ricupero said the country now will be able to resume major short- and medium-term investments that will increase the number of jobs. He said: "To create more jobs is the main issue in Brazil." Ricupero said the agreement with the creditor banks represents a reduction of nearly 25 percent of the overall Brazilian foreign debt to private banks, which amounts to $51 billion. William Rhodes, Steering Committee chairman and Citibank vice president, said in the United States that the agreement is "historic for Brazil" and will open new fronts for the country. Ricupero noted that in the 1970's Brazil used to invest 25 percent of its GDP in the productive sector and today this percentage only totals 16 percent of the GDP. He said this situation could change as soon as economic growth is resumed thanks to the inflow of foreign resources into our economy. The minister said the country will get a new boost through the approval of Provisional Measure [MP] No. 457, which creates the Real Value Unit (URV). The MP already has been approved by a special congressional committee and probably will be voted on by the plenum on 20 April. Speaking to reporters outside his home, Ricupero said: "The MP's approval represents a guarantee for us that we are going to resolve the inflation problem, and the agreement's signing enables us to expect that the inflow of financial resources into the country will soon return to normal."
