FR940831-2-00150 FR940831-2-00106 In 1991, OPM directed Runzheimer to include catalog pricing (including applicable shipping costs) to reflect this common purchasing option in allowance areas. OPM identified items to survey based on comments received on the 1990 survey. Runzheimer identified items to survey that were either unavailable or difficult to find in each allowance area. Together, OPM and Runzheimer agreed to survey eight marketbasket items by catalog. In each allowance area Runzheimer generally requested three price quotes for each item (and sometimes more than three) from the local economy_one from each of three different outlets. 3.2␣Marketbasket Research 3.2.1␣Expenditure Research_Category Weightings Runzheimer tabulated the expense data from the 1988 Consumer Expenditure Survey according to the ten categories of goods and services. As in the component analysis, Runzheimer used the expense data from the seven most appropriate income ranges as input into a linear regression analysis. From that analysis, Runzheimer calculated the category weightings for each income level as listed below: Category Weightings Expressed as a Percentage 1Category 1Lower 1Middle 1Upper Food at Home 25.52 22.38 19.35 Food Away from Home 15.95 16.09 16.23 Tobacco 3.13 2.54 1.96 Alcohol 2.92 2.79 2.67 Furnishings & Hsld.

Logical groupings of family expenditures provided the basis for subcategory and item weights. Unlike category weightings, which vary by income level, subcategory and item weightings are computed from national aggregate expenditures only (i.e., all three income levels used the same set of subcategory and item weightings) as this approach is most common in similar private sector cost-of-living analyses. Runzheimer's expenditure research process included procedures to ensure that no marketbasket item had an overwhelmingly large or insignificantly small item weighing. 3.3␣Marketbasket Item Specifications From each logical expense grouping, Runzheimer selected one or more marketbasket items to represent all items in the grouping. When selecting specific items for the marketbasket, Runzheimer worked to satisfy these three criteria: •Items should be readily available in all locations if possible or should be items of local significance (e.g., snow blower). •Item price levels should logically represent the price levels of unselected items in the ``logical grouping.'' •Items should have the same or nearly the same application in all locations. Appendix 2 lists Runzheimer's marketbasket items. Once an item was selected, Runzheimer's research analysts identified the specific brand and/or model/size of each item available in all (or most) locations. For some items, this involved contacting manufacturers, trade associations, retail establishments, etc. For other items, isolating specifications was quite straight forward because of their nature (e.g., bread, sirloin steak, nonprescription pain reliever). Appendix 3 identifies changes in the current items selected for pricing in the Goods & Services, Miscellaneous Expense, and Housing Related categories, along with explanation for the changes.
