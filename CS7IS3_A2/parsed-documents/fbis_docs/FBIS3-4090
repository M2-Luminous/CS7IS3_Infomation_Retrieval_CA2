This article tends to make brief comments on the origin, progress, and characteristics of the new taxation system. Long Consideration, Aiming To Break Through The establishment of a taxation system and operational mechanism in conformity with the socialist market economic structure in China is not the result of subjective will at all, but has been considered over quite a long time. Where water flows, a channel is formed; this is inevitable. In the 30 years from the founding of New China to 1978, China, being influenced by a highly centralized planned economic structure, practiced the "unified collection and unified spending" financial taxation system. The system played a historic role in pooling financial resources and laying an economic foundation for socialist construction. However, it also has many negative effects. Therefore, after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the reform of the taxation system in China began to lay stress on arousing the enthusiasm of both the central and local governments and on handling the relationship between the state and enterprises. The reform began with the replacement of profits with taxes handed over to the state and developed gradually. Two steps have been taken in replacing profits with taxes handed over to the state. The first step (experiments were carried out in 1979 and the step was taken in January 1983): Instead of handing over a portion of their profits to the state, state-owned enterprises paid income tax. Many forms were adopted for the distribution between the state and enterprises, such as levying regulatory taxes on after-tax profits of enterprises. This move broke the long-standing fixed pattern of interest distribution, but the situation of the coexistence of taxation and the handing-over of profits began to take shape. The second step (in September 1984): The system of allowing state-owned enterprises to keep all the remaining profits after paying income tax enabled the enterprises to have greater power in carrying out operations independently and to assume greater responsibility for their profits and losses. It also created conditions for reforming and establishing a system for the management of the budget of the central and local governments. However, because things in the price system were not yet straightened out, its limitations were also very clear. Later, some corresponding readjustments were made in light of the implementation of the overall financial contract system and a complex taxation system with multiple categories of taxes, multiple links, multiple tiers, and with the turnover tax and the income tax as the main body and other auxiliary categories of taxes as a supplement began to take shape. Nevertheless, because the new taxation system has not yet been established, contradictions between, and problems in, the new and the old taxation systems tend to become even more conspicuous. They are mainly expressed in: The burden of taxation is not fairly shared, two separate taxation systems are used for domestic and foreign enterprises, and the burden of taxation for domestic enterprises differs greatly because of difference in ownership and localities; the relationship of distribution between the central and local governments and between the state and enterprises is jigsaw-like and is very irregular; the methods for tax collection and management are backward and full of loopholes, resulting in great losses; and the legal system is not sound, and a system in which the legislation, administration of justice, and law enforcement related to taxation are mutually independent and mutually conditioned has not been formed. The deep development of the market economy has called for deepening taxation reform. We must take big steps forward and make essential breakthroughs in the establishment of a new taxation system. Careful Planning, Clear Target Abolishing the old and establishing the new, formulating regulations and rules, and constantly perfecting them are difficult tasks to fulfill in financial and taxation reform in China. Regarding this, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has clearly put forward three focal points. The first is the replacement of the overall financial contract system with the tax-sharing system. The second is the reform and improvement of the tax collection system. The third is the improvement and standardization of the double budgetary system. As far as the establishment of the new taxation system is concerned, if we say the first and the third points are for creating necessary prerequisites and conditions, the second point is the main implication and key point in the establishment of the new taxation system. In essence, it is also to reform the industrial and commercial taxation systems. As viewed from the past two months, the Chinese Government has firmly grasped these vital points and is providing, and will continue to provide, guarantees by means of changing the structure to fundamentally solve this focal problem of interest distribution. The plan for the establishment of a new taxation system was promulgated a year ago and more than 60 supplementary policies have been implemented since 1 January. This shows the planning was well made and well publicized. Its guiding ideology, principles, contents, and key points can be generalized as "unifying taxation laws, fairly sharing the taxation burden, simplifying the taxation system, and rationally dividing power." "Unifying taxation laws" means the legislation of sound taxation laws and their relevant rules and regulations, putting all taxation activities on the orbit standardized by taxation laws, paying taxes according to law, and administering taxation according to law, so that the role of market mechanism for taxation activities will be in keeping with the strengthening of macroregulation and control. "Fairly sharing the taxation burden" means gradually resolving the issue of having different categories of taxes and different tax rates for enterprises of different kinds of ownership and in different localities and, through unifying the income tax of enterprises and improving the turnover tax, enabling a more or less fair taxation burden among different kinds of enterprises and creating conditions for competition on an equal basis. "Simplifying the taxation system" means adopting relatively standardized methods of taking international practices for reference, abolishing tax categories which do not conform with the development of the market economy, combining duplicate tax categories, and levying new categories of taxes which are really necessary in a bid to optimize the taxation structure and to make operation simple and easy. "Rationally dividing power" means putting in the hands of the central authorities tax categories which involve the macro policies and correspondingly centralizing the power of taxation for regulating production and product mix. Taxation power which is useful for local governments in regulating local economy and organizing income, the power to formulate procedures for tax collection and tax management, and the legislation power concerning the levying of a small number of local taxes, should be given to local governments. At present, China is smoothly carrying out reform of the taxation system in several major aspects in accordance with the above train of thought. The turnover tax, the main body of the new taxation system, is being extended universally to domestic- and foreign-invested enterprises. The practices of putting products under taxable items and separately fixing different interest rates have been abandoned. The new methods are: The value-added tax is universally levied in production and circulation and on this basis, and the sales tax is also levied on a selected small number of consumers' goods; the levying of business tax is maintained in providing labor service, the transfer of intangible assets, and the sales of fixed assets; the unified industrial and commercial tax for foreign-invested enterprises is abolished; and the product tax for agricultural, forestry, livestock, and aquatic products is replaced by the agricultural special product tax and butchering tax. The goal of unifying the income tax of enterprises will be realized in two steps. The first step is the institution of the unified domestic-invested enterprise income tax system, which is being implemented at present. As a result, the method of collecting income tax according to the ownership of enterprises has been abolished and state-owned enterprises will no longer use the method of handing over income tax to the state on a contract basis. The second step is the combination of the income tax of domestic- and foreign-invested enterprises as the occasion demands in a bid to eventually unify the taxation system. The basic purpose of levying and readjusting personal income tax is to levy tax on people with a relatively high income and to exempt or reduce such tax on people with intermediate-level income and low income so that the tax burden can be lowered to some extent and that some people can become rich earlier than others and the gap between the poor and the rich will not be too big. The value-added land tax, which has recently been levied, is aimed at levying tax on the added value of transferred real estate. Taxpayers, irrespective of their economic nature, whether they are domestic-funded or foreign-funded enterprises, and whether they are specialized or not, have to pay tax on the basis of the volume of added value. The general result will still be relatively high after-tax profits for real estate operators. To promote rational development and utilization of resources and to regulate differential incomes, necessary readjustments and reform of the resources have also been made. The scope of taxation includes all products of mineral resources and the tax to be collected is based on the category and quantity. Upper and lower limits are set, that is, the amount of tax on products of the same category may vary based on the conditions of the resources. It is learned that, following the current large-scale reform, the number of taxable items will be reduced from 32 to 18, the taxation structure will become more rational, and a highly efficient and simplified taxation system will be realized. Seeking Truth From Facts, Being Fair and Reasonable In establishing the new taxation system, from planning to implementation, China has always adhered to the principle of proceeding from the present reality of China and seeking truth from facts, and therefore, what has been done is fair and reasonable. Advancement as a whole and comprehensive supplementary moves have made it possible to make breakthroughs in the establishment of the new taxation system. The formulation and implementation of "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economy Structure" have undoubtedly provided favorable social conditions for the reform of the taxation system and have enabled the establishment of the new taxation system to enter a new historical stage of being more responsive and ready. Although reform of the financial and taxation system is the focus and most the important of four major reforms this year, the supplementary reforms of the banking, investment, and planned systems will be carried out simultaneously and they will all give powerful support to the financial and taxation reform. Even viewed from a smaller scope, reform of the taxation system and reform of the financial system have matched and integrated with each other and the target strategies, and the long- term, medium-term, and immediate results have all been repeatedly planned, expounded, and proved. The process of proceeding at a commanding height from the general to the local evidently shows a clearer goal and is more conducive to turning possibility into reality in the establishment of the new taxation system. Being geared to the future and paying attention to giving consideration to various aspects have provided a bridge for transition in the establishment of the new taxation system. The goal of the reform is clear and we are quite determined to carry it out. However, we have to do things step by step. It is precisely because of this that China has paid attention to adopting some transitional measures in the course of establishing a new taxation system. For example, the enterprise taxation system must be unified and this direction cannot be changed, but we are not impatient and will not try to hit the target in one try. Foreign-invested enterprises and foreign enterprises continue to pay the original income tax and preferential policies have remained temporarily unchanged. The additional portion of tax paid after the collection of the new turnover tax by foreign-invested enterprises set up before 1 January this year will be returned to them. The design of all important taxation items and categories involving the readjustment of interests has taken into consideration the circumstances and has given expression to firmness in achieving the goal of reform and to flexibility of a progressive transition. A careful and safe start will inevitably speed up the realization of the goal and the practice of establishing the new taxation system in China has proved, or continues to prove, the correctness of this conclusion. The integration of the will of the government and that of the masses of people and the conversion of such will into conscious action by the whole society have provided a deep and solid foundation for the establishment of the new taxation system. Since the latter half of last year, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Chinese Government has paid great attention to regarding the direct participation of the grass-roots level and the broad masses of the people as indispensable conditions for the establishment of the new taxation system. Therefore, it has issued "red-banner documents" to define policies and measures and has convened meetings for senior officials of departments in charge of relevant work to give explanations, to help overcome difficulties, or to run study sessions to pass on the essentials on operation. The radio, television, newspapers, magazines, and other mass media and tools for public opinion have all tried their best to publicize and promote reform of the taxation system. According to informed sources, in the course of the establishment of the new taxation system, efforts made by the government in organizing, leading, and publicizing the degree of concern and support of the masses of the people, and the stability of society have become the solid and firm social foundations for achieving comprehensive success in the new taxation system. Because of all these, we have full grounds to hope for a stronger fragrance from this wonderful blooming flower of the new taxation system in China and to invite all people of the industrial and commercial circles who want to display their skills in China to enjoy the fragrance to the full.
