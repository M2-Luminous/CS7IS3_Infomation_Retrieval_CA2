Eijiro Hata, head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), made the request in a meeting with leaders of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren). Noting that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has expressed concern over the lack of job opportunities for female graduates, Hata said his ministry seeks help from the Nikkeiren, the officials said. They quoted Takeshi Nagano, president of Nikkeiren, as saying that it is an important task and the organization will act in line with MITI's request. Nagano, however, offered no concrete proposals on the female employment issue, according to the officials. The current economic downturn, which started about two years ago, has prompted Japanese corporations to streamline their businesses and to cut down on employment. Surveys show that the number of job openings for new college graduates, both male and female, fell about 20 percent this spring and will further drop by around 25 percent in the spring of 1995 -- about a 40 percent fall from the latest peak in 1992. Nearly 13 percent of female students graduating from colleges, universities and vocational schools in March had not found jobs as of the end of February, a Labor Ministry survey found. A separate Labor Ministry survey last December found that more than 52 percent of the 1,000 or so firms responding said they were employing fewer women because more male students were seeking work. More than 30 percent of the companies said they were hiring fewer female graduates from two-year colleges and high schools because "women are working longer."
