After repeated denials of government and presidential spokesmen that the United States and NATO were applying pressure on Bulgaria to agree to opening corridors for the "Blue Helmets" on their way to Sarajevo, it was eventually requested by [U.S.] Ambassador Montgomery. Now Bulgaria is about to make a move in the diplomatic chess game. Its future existence as a sovereign state depends on this move. Every involvement in an international conflict begins in such an innocuous manner. Along the same route in 1914-15 military equipment for Turkey was transported by Germany and Austro-Hungary through the territories of the still neutral Romania and Bulgaria. In addition we received a loan from "Diskontogesellschaft," a small territorial concession from Turkey, and... we ended up in 1919 with Neuilly. Now history seems to be repeating itself not as a farce but as a new drama. This is so because if we give in to pressure, after NATO military equipment we will have to make the next logical step and allow Turkish "blue helmets" through our country on their way to Bosnia. Against the background of increasing pro-Turkish and Islamic propaganda in the mixed population regions in Bulgaria this would be like pouring oil on a fire. In its modern history, Bulgaria has suffered much from shortsighted or simply corrupt politicians. Today the issue of Bulgaria being dragged into an escalating military conflict in former Yugoslavia is again on the agenda. This would mean only one thing -- a new Balkan war. Montgomery's demand poses a test for our statesmen -- will they find the courage to sustain the principled policy of total noninterference in the conflict, or again jump on the bandwagon of the one that appears to be strong at the moment. Whether Bulgaria will remain a state or will become a "corridor" for everyone who cares to cross the country depends on the answer. For us Bulgarians, only one bitter consolation will be left: Namely, that whoever took us as an ally or as a Vilayet [Turkish province] did not prosper too much....
