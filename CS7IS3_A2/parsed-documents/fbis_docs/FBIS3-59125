He said today when presenting the 1994 annual economic report, which had been approved beforehand at a cabinet meeting chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that there would be no boom, but modest growth. The government is expecting the German economy to grow this year by 1-1.5 percent. It shrank by 1.3 percent in 1993. The major economic associations are skeptical as to whether the economic growth expected by the government can be achieved. The Federal Association of German Industry said there was no discernible sign yet of the rapid climb out of the economic trough which this would require. The German Association of Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) said the report featured a degree of confidence that was not yet reflected in corporate investment. The German Salaried Employee Union (DAG) said the government's savings policy was snuffing out the beginnings of economic recovery. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) accused the government of inactivity in the face of high unemployment. [passage omitted]
