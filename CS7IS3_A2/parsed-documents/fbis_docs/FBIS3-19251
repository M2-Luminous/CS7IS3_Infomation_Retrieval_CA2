The Greens' demand for a "political initiative for the disbandment of NATO" and for the abolishment of compulsory military service, as well as their assertion that all German nuclear power plants could be shut down within two years, would otherwise have prejudiced SPD Chairman Scharping's strategy for broadening the voter spectrum of the SPD with signals of domestic policy reliability and foreign policy continuity. The party congress of the Alliance 90/Greens does, however, provide him with a basis for defending, if it comes to that, the failure of red-green coalition negotiations following the Bundestag election against the left wing of the SPD, which wants "red-green." Following the conclusion of the party congress of the Alliance 90/Greens, SPD national business manager Verheugen called their resolutions "unrealistic dreams." "The Greens will find no partner for this platform." It is above all the resolution calling for the disbandment of NATO which is being opposed in the SPD. The remark by the chairman of the Young Socialists, Westphal, viz. that "we want to resolve something similar at our next party congress," is approved by only a minority even among SPD left-wingers. In disagreeing with this remark, Verheugen stated: "To demand NATO's disbandment at a time when the Central and East European countries would like nothing more than to join it is not only unrealistic, it is also intrinsically wrong." Of course, the SPD leadership does not already now want to rule out a red-green coalition following the Bundestag election. It is not sure if the party congress resolution of the Alliance 90/Greens on foreign policy will be made a condition in coalition negotiations. In this case, they assure us, the coalition talks would fail. If, on the other hand, Alliance 90/Greens were ready to compromise, the party would suffer a "credibility gap." In view of this, Verheugen termed their resolution "astonishing." The executive committee spokeswoman of Alliance 90/Greens, Birthler, sought to modify the consequences that the resolutions would have on coalition policies with the remark that no one had demanded "that NATO immediately vanish into thin air." She called attention to the formulation which called for NATO to be absorbed by a system of mutual security and a restored CSCE. That could create some leeway for negotiations. Verheugen said that, following the election, the SPD--assuming a favorable outcome of the election--would talk with all democratic parties, thereby excluding the Republikaner and the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] as conversational partners of the SPD. However, democratic parties, in Verheugen's opinion, are not to be excluded from the outset from talks for reasons of their platforms alone. The, at best, basic candor of the SPD leadership serves not only the purpose of winning over voters who in the event of a commitment to the Alliance 90/Greens might vote for the current coalition or--to assure their entry into the Bundestag--to the Alliance 90/Greens. It is also an expression of the tensions existing between proponents and opponents of a red-green coalition. The left wing of the SPD wants to give red-green cooperation "a solid programmatic foundation above and beyond the pure arithmetics of a coalition." It was in this vein that the chairman of the Young Socialists, Westphal, warned the SPD leadership against branding the Greens as "incapable of making politics." Standing on the other side is the labor union wing of the SPD. IG-Chemie Chairman Rappe advised the SPD leaders "to ignore the signals of the Greens and to stop striving for red-green coalitions." Otherwise, the competence of the SPD in the economic and foreign policy arenas will be jeopardized. Rappe outlined his preferences last week in the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG: "Given a choice, I view red-green as the worst possible of all conceivable coalitions. In that case, I would prefer the FDP [Free Democratic Party] or the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] every time."
