U.S. officials have thus had a pragmatic change on the most-favored-nation [MFN] question. This change is related to the idea within U.S. financial and political circles which favors separating the human rights issue from the MFN question. The United States' foreign policy today pays more and more attention to developing its economic interests. Today, as Asia has become the world's fastest growing economic region, the United States is attaching still more importance to participating in Asia's economic activities. China is the largest market in Asia as well as the country with the fastest growing economy. U.S. businessmen have always been opposed to lumping the human rights issue with granting MFN to China. If China's MFN status is canceled, U.S. businessmen will lose the large market of China. U.S. policy appears to be very contradictory. The United States hopes to gain China's markets while wanting to force China to make concessions on the human rights issue so that the political changes it desires will occur in China. It hopes that China's economy will continuously develop so China can import more U.S. merchandise, while fearing the rise of a powerful China. Under the control of this contradictory psychology, the United States vacillates in its policy, does not know whether it is appropriate to advance or retreat, and has incorrectly judged and handled the situation of Sino-U.S. relations. Prior to every June, the United States would, as a rule, use the MFN question as a big stick to threaten China with. However, the United States would convince itself that China had already met its requirements and that it had conformed to the conditions for granting MFN trading status. There are two weaknesses in repeating this practice every year. First, the world sees from this that the United States does not have a standard for human rights. The fact that the United States never uses human rights diplomacy against U.S.-sponsored dictatorships reflects that this practice is merely a means of power politics. Second, when it is repeated many times, this means of blackmail becomes ineffective. Therefore, even Washington officials and Congressmen do not feel it is advantageous to repeat the MFN question every year. Some suggest settling the MFN question once and for all, because if this question remains unsettled for a single day, it will be impossible for U.S. businesses to make large-scale investments in China, and this will ultimately harm long-term U.S. interests gained by opening up China's market. U.S. Secretary of State Christopher recently wrote an article in THE WASHINGTON POST in which he defended U.S. policy readjustments and refuted hawks who demanded he cancel his scheduled 11-14 March visit to China. Christopher stated: "The visit is a must for our decision on whether or not to renew China's MFN status before 3 June." He noted that China has already made some progress with regard to the human rights issue. The executive order issued by Clinton last year on extending China's MFN status was aimed at resolving two major problems: banning the export of prison labor products to the United States, and lifting emigration restrictions. He contended that he had scored achievements on both issues during his recent visit to China. Assistant Secretary of State Lord had previously advocated a tough stance on the human rights issue. However, at a recent congressional hearing, he appeared optimistic about the issue, saying that he believed China "absolutely has the ability and measures to win" MFN status. He emphasized that China had already done an excellent job in putting an end to exports of prison labor products and lifting emigration restrictions. He proposed that China should try to "make significant progress" in five aspects, saying: So long as China makes continued efforts in this connection, the United States will be ready to establish more constructive relations with China at any time. The United States hopes that MFN will soon cease to be a controversial issue affecting the U.S. policy toward China. To gradually disentangle the human rights issue from the central theme of MFN is no doubt a pragmatic move. As the United States has time and again emphasized that it has no intention whatsoever to introduce changes to Chinese society or impose its own political standards on China, to force China to knuckle under with high-handed measures would certainly run counter to this. Along with continued economic growth, China will be able to build a better material basis upon which human rights can be improved and will be able to quicken the pace of improving human rights as well. Nonetheless, China will never barter away its principles. The history of Sino-U.S. relations contains both successful experiences and negative lessons. The United States knows all too well that interference in China's internal affairs only adversely affects Sino-U.S. relations. China and the United States are two big countries that have shared common interests. Just as Christopher pointed out, China and the United States have a basis for cooperation on issues like international affairs and regional security. For example, China and the United States need to strengthen bilateral cooperation on issues like safeguarding stability and security in Asia, ensuring that the Korean peninsular remains a nuclear-free zone, and so on, as well as on international issues like narcotics control, immigration, smuggling, and environmental protection. Regarding economic cooperation, Christopher called for expanding the U.S. share of the Chinese market. The United States has gradually realized that the development of Sino-U.S. relations will provide it with more advantages than disadvantages. It is precisely for this reason that those forces which treasure Sino-U.S. economic cooperation have now gained ground. According to a report carried by THE NEW YORK TIMES, the U.S. president's economic experts group has already reached a consensus: It is no longer appropriate to link the human rights issue with MFN status. Eventually, the U.S. Congress will also consider measures to remove the annual threat of economic sanctions. If all this is true, we will certainly embrace this trend. China bases itself on seeking cooperation and improving relations with the United States and adopts a positive approach to the development of Sino-U.S. relations. However, China has also prepared itself for any bad news and is not afraid of losing MFN status.
