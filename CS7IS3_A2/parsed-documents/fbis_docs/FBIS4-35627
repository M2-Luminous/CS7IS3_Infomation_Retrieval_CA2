Referring to the concern of the brothers and friends, as well as their calls for halting the fighting, he wondered: On what basis do they call for a cease-fire, and what are the guarantees that the rebels would resort to the constitutional legitimacy and its institutions, which were established as a result of the general elections that were held on 27 April 1993 and that were (?defined) by everybody. The deputy prime minister reiterated our country's rejection of any interference in its domestic affairs by the Security Council or any other side, stressing that what is taking place in the Republic of Yemen is an internal affair. He also voiced his surprise at some brothers' insistence on the need for the Security Council to issue a resolution on a cease-fire, although they know that the issue belongs to the Yemeni people alone. Such a resolution, he added, will lead to more fighting, which is sought by those who want such a resolution. This came during a news conference he gave at the Prime Ministry today. Several representatives of local, Arab, and international television networks, radio stations, and press in Sanaa attended. It was also attended by 'Abd-al-Rahman Zaydan, director of the prime minister's office, and [name indistinct], under secretary of the Ministry of Information.
