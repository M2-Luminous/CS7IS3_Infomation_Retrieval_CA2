Australian civil servant John Hamilton is taking part in a far-reaching overhaul of the bureaucracy. His arrival comes as a battle rages between Britain and China over the loyalty of the territory's 180,000 civil servants in the runup to China's takeover in 1997. The overhaul, known as the Public Sector Reform (PSR) program, will particularly affect civil servants with the calibre to rise to the top of the service. The government's top brass is said to be anxious that mainland ethics and practices could become influential in the civil service and take the place of the administrative culture that is being built up to carry on after 1997. The government has confirmed Mr Hamilton's appointment. Before beginning his 13-month secondment on 10 January, Mr Hamilton was assistant commissioner of the Australian Public Service Commission for human resources management. A government spokesman said Mr Hamilton was responsible for "developing a systematic approach to performance appraisal, training and career development" within the civil service and was seconded for his solid human resource management background. "Staff of the Civil Service Branch have previously visited the Australian Public Service Commission," he said. "(It was) considered the Australian experience in human resource management would be a useful reference for Hong Kong in the implementation of the PSR program." A theme of the PSR is to recommend a civil service mechanism that would uphold "human rights, openness and fairness". A distinctive difference between Australia's public service and that in Britain and Hong Kong is that in Australia, top policy secretaries are employed on five-year contracts. The [preceding word as published] enables them to forcefully confront outside political pressure. The Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong said its diplomats here were aware of Mr Hamilton's secondment, but its press officer said she was unable to provide The Hongkong Standard with further information. The Australia Public Service Commission said simply that Mr Hamilton's assignment was to look at Hong Kong's public service. The Secretary for the Civil Service Michael Sze returned from a two-week visit to Australia on Sunday. A local political columnist quoted sources as saying that he had focused on how "fairness" was upheld in Australia's civil service. The theme of openness and fairness had been emphasised by Governor Chris Patten in his rows with China. A British parliamentary report recently called on the government to form a human rights commission to keep a permanent watch on human rights in the territory. Beijing is worried Britain may use human rights to internationalise Hong Kong after 1997. Members of the Preliminary Working Committee sounded just such a warning on Monday. The territory's government vehemently denied the present promotion mechanism in the civil service is unfair despite the fact that Mr Hamilton has been asked to carry out a review. A civil service spokesman also rejected the idea that personal influence dominates the civil service promotion system. He said there were clear guidelines including promotion criteria specified in the civil service regulation which promotion boards had to follow. He said the boards comprised enough members from different ranks to ensure that they fully understood the job requirement and the candidates performance. In cases within the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, the boards recommendations had to be referred to the commission for advice before they could be approved, he added. "The system is a fair one and has adequate checks and balances," the spokesman said. He said the PSR program was aimed at improving the civil service's efficiency and quality.
