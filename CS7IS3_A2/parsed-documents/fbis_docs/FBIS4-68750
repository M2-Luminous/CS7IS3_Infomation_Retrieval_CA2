Although there is no shortage of both sets of "champions, and we are guaranteed more futile verbal battles between them and the continuation of the endless Ukrainian serial of "A Madman at the Microphone," that is not the point. A diverse and motley centrism has entered the arena of Ukrainian politics, the most controversial current of which is represented by the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc, popularly known as the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR]. The fate of this entity is very important for Ukraine. The original version of the political orientation of the MBR was quite simple. In economic terms, this meant "moderate" reforms modeled on Chernomyrdin's the the Civic Union's -- a script for building an amorphous state capitalism for the "parties of moneybags" controlling the cleaned-up Communist Party treasury and for "unaccountable owners" --the nomenklatura and the corps of directors. In the sphere of statehood, the MBR was openly heading towards federation and crawling to Moscow, back to the familiar system of ideas and concepts. These were the declared principles. But reality has taken a different turn. The MBR set out on the election marathon armed with such popular slogans in the East as Russian as an official language, federation, ties with the CIS and, above all, Russia, and economic reforms. This enabled it to effortlessly "beat" all the national-democrats. However, having been put together in haste, haphazardly, and without much thought, the Hrynyov-Kuchma team that was elected to parliament proved to be unusually heterogeneous. The seed of discord was already present in the leaders. L. Kuchma, ex-party organizer, ex-director, and ex-prime minister, relied on the only support available to him -- the directorial structures of the defense industry that he himself comes from. He was, is, and will be the spokesman for their interests, expressed by a formula as simple as H[.sub]2[/]O: state paternalism, a vertical structure, a state feeding trough, no worries, and a single [economic] space with the maternal teat of the Russian defense industry and the industry of polluting smokestacks and eternal nonliquidity. On the other hand, Hrynyov and his team represent the money of the Party nomenklatura that has been laundered through mixed ventures [MP], joint ventures [SP], limited liability companies [LTD], etc.; they specialize in castles in the air and rosy clouds. This group is interested in eternal chaos and fears a strong government, which could put an end to their boisterous activity. The only common denominator between the two groups is their orientation towards Moscow. In addition, both these "leaders" have huge ambitions and a minimum of political culture. The election results did not improve the situation. The MBR leaders in Dnipropetrovsk, Balashov and Co., suffered a devastating defeat because of unanimous opposition to Kuchma by practically the entire monolith of local directors and the party of power, headed by Pustovoytenko, whose favorite financial corns Mr. Kuchma had trimmed in the fight for the "market." They opposed Balashov as Kuchma's protege, even though essentially he is closer to Hrynyov's branch of the MBR than Kuchma's. As a result, the "disaffected" are inclined to blame Leonid Danylovych personally for this outcome. Things went even more badly in Zaporizhzhya and Kremenchuk, where the directors will not forgive Kuchma "until their dying day" for the case involving oil, the raids by law enforcement organs, and the formal terror they were subjected to during the MBR leader's tenure as prime minister. Things were very difficult in the South, especially in Odessa, where Kuchma encountered something he had not anticipated -- he was forced to support Hurwits and his team because the local Russian-speaking niche is firmly occupied by Forum, which is both anti-Hrynyov and anti-Kuchma. And so he put together an absolutely incongruous hotchpotch made up of Hurvits, the Communist Bodelan, and Rychahov, the vociferous Russian chauvinist from the Social-Democratic Party of Ukraine [SDPU]. Included on this same quasi-MBR slate were Mr. Shyshkin (the former procurator) and Mr. Yevdokymov (Union of Lawyers). In other regions, they took what they could, as long as they were Russian-speaking and not from Kravchuk's party of power. These two qualifications were decisive. They did not stop to think that these two categories cover a political spectrum as wide as the Black Sea. As a result, a very heterogenous bunch of people rode into parliament on the shoulders of the MBR. Most of this crowd is of the already fairly well established species of regional business leader and much more rarely administrative and scientific origin. Their worldview is based on pure pragmatism. Building the state means building the economy. Most are young people without any ideological complexes, whose ideal is to live as the West lives. For this camp, Moscow is a point to push away from rather than a point of attraction. This youthful, Russian-speaking crowd fosters liberalism in sensu stricto [i.e., in a narrow sense]. They are very far from Kuchma's economic and Hrynyov's geopolitical orientations, because in their defense of "their earthly interests and the native Ukrainian feeding trough" they will prove even more aggressive supporters of statehood than all the national-democrats put together. The political membrane that separates them from the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine [PDVU], Rukh, and the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] is very thin and will give way in two or three months' time. They will consolidate not in the direction of the MBR, but in the direction of the spectrum named above. This camp's disillusionment with Kuchma was already in evidence at the congress of the USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs]. Meanwhile, twenty-four hours later, an event took place in a cosy and comfortable hall near the Ministry of Justice that defined the process quite clearly: the founding congress of the thirty-third party to register --the Human Rights Party [partiya "Prav lyudyny"]. To sum up this event very briefly, this was a very small and harmless meeting of liberal-democratic lawyers, headed by Mr. Onopenko, the minister of justice. The views of this esteemed company were one hundred percent identical to the views of businessmen and economists of similar orientation, only focused on legal issues -- balancing the rights of the individual and the state, limiting state paternalism, "inherent rights," and other such liberal European classic concepts. Among the founders of this new party are Shyshkin, Musiyaka (Kharkiv), and Sherepil (Sevastopol). As late as the eve of the congress, two of them were counted as members of the MBR. Taking into account that Shyshkin nd the other lawyers from the South ran as a united front, it is not difficult to predict that they will group together in parliament. On the other hand, there is no hope whatsoever that this moderate centrist team comprised of national-democrats, the more sober segment of the party of power, and liberals will support Mr. Kuchma or Mr. Hrynyov in their "revolutionary plans." The Human Rights party will foster a market economy "like theirs" with the same enthusiasm as the liberal economists and work to evolve a legal system based on Western models. In the heat of battle, the MBR rashly pulled through the remnants of the PDVU under its banners, losing Volodymyr Filenko, the politician most loyal to Hrynyov in this party, along the way. In contrast, most of those from this party who won seats cannot imagine themselves in the same team with Hrynyov in their worst nightmares. Thus, in parliament, a large segment of the MBR will wander over towards the party of power and the national-democrats. There will also be a flight to the left. The reddish spectrum, which Kuchma gathered together across the land under the single slogan of "Down with Kravchuk!", will not long remain under this partocrat's control. And so, such figures as Bodelan and Rychahov and Co., whom Kuchma supported, will move to take their place under the banners of familiar color and join the more congenial company of Petro Symonenko and Oleksandr Moroz. Others will head for the party of power, which they left for the duration of the elections for purely tactical reasons. The prognosis regarding the fate of the MBR is evident from what has been said above. This heterogeneous group will unravel, causing the groups to which it gives political voice to do the same. The liberal-democrats will unite with the more sober circles of national-democrats and will most likely abandon Kuchma. The Reds and reddish elements will support any leader from the ranks of the CPU, who has rid himself of all semicapitalist fancies. Consequentely, they, too, will no longer need Kuchma. Hrynyov's moneybags will continue pursuing their own goals and will remain a separate group that has clashed with Kuchma's group. And the corps of directors and their party of power in the central industrial region will fight Kuchma as an enemy of their lobby interests. In these circumstances, Leonid Danylovych may end up with very few supporters and lose a significant portion of the electorate in the South and East. Even now, their number is not very large in Right-Bank Ukraine. Thus the parliamentary faction of the MBR may become a political myth.
