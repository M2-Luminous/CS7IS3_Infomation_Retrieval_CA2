Kuznechikov, LESNAYA GAZETA correspondent: "The Ukrainian Government Is Threatened With... Legal Action"] [Text] It is not the first time that the Cabinet of Ministers of the republic has declined a Trade Union Federation offer to work together to summarize the results of last year's pay rate agreement. The Cabinet has cleverly unloaded this work onto its commission, which has not been given any authority. It is easy to understand this trick: Many of the provisions of the agreement have not been honored yet. Among other things, double pay for working overtime has not yet been introduced. It is true that this issue is not particularly critical for people employed by woodworking plants, as they are either idle now or working shorter hours. But the fact remains. The mechanism for adjusting the minimum pay (which is ridiculously low in Ukraine--just 60,000 karbovantsi, which is the price of one kilo of bologna-type sausage) and pensions to the price index has not been introduced either. Last year prices grew by a factor of 60, but salaries only 24. Neither was any mutual decision made concerning regulation of consumption funds. The Government of Ukraine also failed to honor other obligations stipulated in the General Agreement on pay rates. It does not wish to sign a new agreement for 1994 either, thus practically paralyzing the work of local trade union organizations. This is the reason leaders of associations of trade unions representing the timber industry, railroads, Armed Forces, Academy of Sciences, and others decided to conduct, together with the Cabinet of Ministers, immediate confirmation of the agreement results. If the government declines their proposal once again, the trade unions will initiate two parallel legal actions against it: for failure to implement the agreement and for evading a discussion of its results. They will also appeal to the International Labor Organization to analyze the actions of the Ukrainian Government.
