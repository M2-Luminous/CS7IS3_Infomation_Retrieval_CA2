FR940119-1-00043 FR940119-1-00011 For this series of questions, operators are requested to provide data only on hazardous liquid pipelines which have leak detection systems installed, since the study concluded RCVs are effective only on hazardous liquid pipelines with leak detection systems. Question 9: How many locations have valves installed to comply with 49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f)? XXXX 9.1␣How many locations have two block valves installed? XXXX 9.2␣How many locations have one block valve and one check valve installed? XXXX 9.3␣How many locations have two block valves and one check valve installed? XXXX 9.4␣Are any of the block valves RCVs (Y/N)? XXXX 9.4.1␣If ``yes'', how many locations reported in 9.1 are RCVs? XXXX 9.4.2␣If ``yes'', how many locations reported in 9.2 are RCVs? XXXX 9.5␣How many block valves which are not RCVs are installed to comply with 49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f)? XXXX Question 10: Estimated cost data to convert the block valves reported in 9.4 to RCVs is requested. Report data to questions 10.1&hyph;10.3 for each valve size (diameter) in your pipeline system: 10.1␣What valve diameter does this series of questions pertain (in.)? XXXX 10.2␣How many block valves are installed of this diameter? XXXX 10.3␣What is the total estimated cost to convert all of these valves to RCVs? XXXX 10.3.1␣Installation cost (material & labor) $ XXXX 10.3.2␣Communication system cost $ XXXX 10.3.3␣Other installation costs (specify) $ XXXX 10.3.4␣Total installation cost $ XXXX 10.3.5␣Annual operating cost $ XXXX 10.3.6␣Annual maintenance cost $ XXXX 10.3.7␣Other annual costs (specify) $ XXXX 10.3.8␣Total annual costs $ XXXX Question 11: Estimated cost data for installing new RCVs on your pipeline system is requested. Report data to questions 11.1&hyph;11.6 for each valve size (diameter) in your pipeline system: 11.1␣What valve diameter does this series of questions pertain (in.)? XXXX 11.2␣Cost of a manually operated block valve $ XXXX 11.3␣Cost of an equivalent RCV $ XXXX 11.4␣Communication cost $ XXXX 11.5␣Other installation costs (specify) $ XXXX 11.6␣Total installation costs $ XXXX Question 12: What factors should the RSPA use in determining when a manually operated valve should be converted to a RCV in order to reduce the effects to bodies of water in case of a release? XXXX Locations Affected by Commodity Release Question 13: Would a release from your pipeline affect the following locations (answer ``yes'' or ``no'' and provide rationale for your answer)? 13.1␣Wetlands as defined in 40 CFR 230.3? 12 XXXX 12 40 CFR 230.3(t) states: The term wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 13.2␣Critical habitat for endangered/threatened species? XXXX 13.3␣National/State parks? XXXX 13.4␣Marine sanctuaries? XXXX 13.5␣Federal wilderness areas? XXXX 13.6␣Coastal Zone Management Act designated areas? XXXX 13.7␣National monuments? XXXX 13.8␣National seashore/lakeshore recreational areas? XXXX 13.9␣National preserves? XXXX 13.10␣National wildlife refuges? XXXX
