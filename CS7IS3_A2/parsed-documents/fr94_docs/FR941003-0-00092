FR941003-0-00092 FR941003-0-00015 The FAA estimates the development and certification costs per new rotorcraft certification will be $36,000. Most of these costs are for testing, analysis, and documentation. The primary testing required by the rule is a test of each fuel tank to show no loss of fuel under specified crash conditions. This can be accomplished by a simple, inexpensive drop test. There will be increased production costs associated with fuel tanks, fittings, and flexible fuel lines. The incremental cost of a fuel tank meeting the requirements of the rule is estimated to be $30 per gallon of tank capacity. Part 27 rotorcraft are assumed to have 50-gallon tanks that will cost $1,500 more as a result of this rule; part 29 rotorcraft are assumed to have 200-gallon tanks costing $6,000 more. The FAA estimates that the cost per frangible, self-sealing fitting is $60; that a typical part 27 rotorcraft will require 8 fittings, totaling $480; and that a typical part 29 rotorcraft will require 10 fittings, totaling $600. Flexible fuel line sections are expected to add about $100 to the cost of a fuel system for a part 27 rotorcraft and about $150 for a part 29 rotorcraft. The estimated total incremental production costs are $2,080 per part 27 rotorcraft and $6,750 per part 29 rotorcraft. The FAA estimates that the rule will increase the weight of a part 27 rotorcraft by 9.5 pounds and a part 29 rotorcraft by 33 pounds, and that each extra pound of weight increases average annual fuel consumption by 3.8 gallons per part 27 rotorcraft and 6.2 gallons per part 29 rotorcraft. Applying fuel prices of $1.87 per gallon for part 27 rotorcraft and $1.78 for part 29 rotorcraft, the estimated increase in average annual operating costs is $68 ($1.87 × 3.8 gals. × 9.5 lbs.) per part 27 rotorcraft and $364 ($1.78 × 6.2 gals. × 33 lbs.) per part 29 rotorcraft. Assuming 15 years operating lives, the total incremental development, certification, production, and operating costs when discounted are $1,426 per part 27 rotorcraft and $4,617 per part 29 rotorcraft. Benefit/Costs Comparison Benefits exceed costs for both parts 27 and 29 rotorcraft. The net present value (discounted benefits minus discounted costs) is $1,677 per part 27 rotorcraft and $6,368 per part 29 rotorcraft. The rule will be cost beneficial even if it is only 50 percent effective in eliminating PCF fatalities and injuries. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a rule is expected to have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, prescribes standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. The FAA does not expect the rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small manufacturers or operators. Trade Impact Assessment The rule will have no impact on trade for either U.S. firms doing business in foreign markets or foreign firms doing business in the United States. In the United States, foreign manufacturers must meet U.S. requirements, and thus will gain no competitive advantage. In foreign countries, U.S. manufacturers are not bound by parts 27 and 29 requirements and can choose whether or not to implement the provisions of this rule on the basis of competitive and other considerations. Also, the Joint Airworthiness Authority (JAA) and Transport Canada are both in the process of adopting this rule. Federalism Implications The regulations herein do not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this amendment does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the Trade Impact Assessment, the FAA has determined that these amendments are not major under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that these amendments do not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. These amendments are considered nonsignificant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). A regulatory evaluation of the amendments, including a Regulatory Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.

The Amendment Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR pats 27 and 29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 27_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: NORMAL CATEGORY ROTORCRAFT 1. The authority citation for part 27 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 1344, 1354(a), 1355, 1421, 1423, 1425, 1428, 1429, 1430; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g). 2. Section 27.561 is amended by adding a new paragraph (d) to read as follows: §27.561 General. * * * * * (d) Any fuselage structure in the area of internal fuel tanks below the passenger floor level must be designed to resist the following ultimate inertial factors and loads and to protect the fuel tanks from rupture when those loads are applied to that area: (i) Upward_1.5g. (ii) Forward_4.0g. (iii) Sideward_2.0g. (iv) Downward_4.0g. 3. A new §27.952 is added to read as follows: §27.952 Fuel system crash resistance. Unless other means acceptable to the Administrator are employed to minimize the hazard of fuel fires to occupants following an otherwise survivable impact (crash landing), the fuel systems must incorporate the design features of this section. These systems must be shown to be capable of sustaining the static and dynamic deceleration loads of this section, considered as ultimate loads acting alone, measured at the system component's center of gravity, without structural damage to system components, fuel tanks, or their attachments that would leak fuel to an ignition source. (a) Drop test requirements. Each tank, or the most critical tank, must be drop-tested as follows: (1) The drop height must be at least 50 feet. (2) The drop impact surface must be nondeforming.
