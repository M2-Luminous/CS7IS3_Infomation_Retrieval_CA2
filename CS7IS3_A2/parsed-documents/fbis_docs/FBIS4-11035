FBIS4-11035 "drlat077_k_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Argentina, Israel May Cooperate in Technology Transfer Argentina, Israel May Cooperate in Technology Transfer PY2104022694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1629 GMT 20 Apr 94 PY2104022694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Jerusalem, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Antonio Erman Gonzalez -- Justicialist Party deputy and former Argentine defense minister -- said on 20 April that Argentina and Israel may cooperate in the reconversion of modern military technology, including car manufacturing. Asked about the visit he made to Israeli military industries this week, Gonzalez said in a news conference: "We will undertake feasibility studies to apply military technology to civilian life." Gonzalez, who is making a seven-day official visit to Israel, arrived here on 17 April accompanied by Justicialist Party Deputy Ana Raquel de Kessler, who was the No. 2 person in the defense portfolio. Gonzalez categorically denied they were interested in the purchase of weapons from Israel. He stated that the longstanding border disputes between Argentina and its neighbors are on the verge of being settled, "and from a hypothesis of conflict we have now come to a hypothesis of cooperation." The Argentine deputies invited General Dan Shomron [name as received], the director of Israeli Military Industry (IMI), to visit Argentina, where the government has not yet privatized small-scale military hardware manufacturing companies, which may be recycled with Israeli technology into mixed corporations. Commenting on the possibility of manufacturing car components, Gonzalez stated: "The proposal to establish mixed corporations has been well received." He added that Argentine car manufacturing companies currently turn out 350,000 cars annually and this requires a comparable expansion of accessory industries. Israeli military industries have been forced to lay off thousands of engineers and workers on account of the world crisis. It has had experience in adapting military technology to civilian uses in East Europe. After visits to Aeronautic Industries and the IMI, "we agreed to exchange information on an ongoing basis about operational manufacturing companies in both countries. Personal knowledge will come in a third stage," he said. Gonzalez noted: "Israel is neither an underdeveloped country nor is it counted as a highly industrial one; therefore, it can understand better than others our need for investments and technology transfer." In response to a question of whether richer countries will transfer their leading-edge technology to less-developed countries, Kessler asserted that "major countries will have to do so and will charge for that, but it is what they will be able to sell in the next century." Kessler, who sits on the Defense Committee with Gonzalez, noted that "Israel is in an excellent condition to do so and forestall other countries in this area." She added that Argentina also may benefit from its economic relations with Israel since through these mixed corporations it will have access to the EU, of which Israel is an associate member, and the United States, with which Israel enjoys free trade. Gonzalez reported that today, he and Bank of Israel Governor Ya'aqov Frenkel analyzed the influence of major economic blocs and the danger of their adopting a protectionist policy to the detriment of others. The Argentine deputies also learned about Israeli labor legislation and the working of Parliament. Tomorrow, they will sign a cooperation agreement with Ben Gurion University -- located in Be'er Sheva,' capital of the Negev desert -- on research and exploitation of arid areas in Argentina's central and northwestern regions.
