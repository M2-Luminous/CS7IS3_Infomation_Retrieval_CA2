In an exclusive interview with AKHIR KHABAR, Nazzal said Hamas reiterated its rejection of self-rule and the agreement which paved the road for it. He said: This stand does not contradict the movement's stand welcoming the return of the Palestinian police. He said: We consider the police to be part of our Palestinian people and call on them to safeguard the unity of the people, not to crush them or confiscate their freedom. He said: We will not clash with them. Nazzal denied reports that Hamas has asked the PLO to mediate with Israeli authorities to release Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. He said this issue cannot be used as bargaining card to pressure the movement, saying Shaykh Yasin himself rejects this. He said: No contacts to this effect have been made with the PLO. Muhammad Nazzal reiterated Hamas' rejection of recent developments, noting that the refusal of national figures respected by Palestinians to participate in the national authority shows the recent agreement has blatantly bypassed the rights of the Palestinian people.
