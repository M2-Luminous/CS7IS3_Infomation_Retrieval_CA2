In a message sent to the summit, Li Peng said the birth of new South Africa signified the victory accomplished by the OAU and all African people in the political field. But Li also expressed the concern over the on-going conflicts in some African countries, in particular Rwanda. "Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in Rwanda in particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the international community," said Li. "We firmly support the OAU in its vigorous efforts to mediate in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain political and social stability in African countries," he added. While wishing the summit a complete success, the premier said to enhance friendly relations and cooperation with Africa "has all along been part and parcel of the foreign policy of the Chinese Government."
