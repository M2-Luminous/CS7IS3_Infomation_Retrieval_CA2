In the interview, the place and date of which are not given, Stefko blames the government's interference in Slovak Radio's commercial activities for the institution's difficult economic situation. In his initial reply, Stefko discusses Slovak Radio's past efforts to reduce its dependence on the state budget by developing its own commercial activities. In this context, he says: "In 1992, for example, Slovak Radio's economic result was 41.5 million korunas better than projected. Last year, the situation changed dramatically for the worse, owing mainly to state interference. The state reduced the majority of Slovak Radio's commercial activities. At the same time, it halted the state subsidy, in contravention of National Council of the Slovak Republic Law Number 14. This was done by the same bodies that in December 1991 called on Slovak Radio to step up its commercial activities in order to ease the burden on the state budget and that promised us the retention of the improved economic result (that is, 41.5 million korunas) to cover parts of the budget that the state was unable to fund. Slovak Radio was deprived of about 80 million korunas in this way, and, in 1993, for the first time in its history, it ended the year with debts. The bulk of them are owed to Slovak Telecommunications, of which Slovak Radio is one of the main customers." Whereas, in the past, Slovak Radio had three different sources of revenue, Stefko says--subscription fees, state subsidies, and income from commercial activities--now it must make do with subscription fees, which are constantly declining. In this context, he notes that, even though there are 1.9 million households with at least one radio set in Slovakia, according to official statistics, Slovak Radio receives fees from only 1,000,016 subscribers. Stefko attributes the decline to the deteriorating social situation of households and to loopholes in the legislation, which do not make it possible to track down and fine nonpayers. Citing a specific example of "interference" in Slovak Radio's commercial activities, Stefko mentions the decision of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to ban broadcasts by the Austrian-owned Radio CD International from Slovak territory. According to Stefko, the cooperation agreement with the Austrian partner guaranteed Slovak Radio an annual income of 52 million Slovak korunas. He points out that "depriving Slovak Radio of money" was the sole aim of this ban, which, he says, "also met with a very negative response on the Austrian political scene." Further on, Stefko explains the "austerity measures" being applied by Slovak Radio as of 17 January, in connection with the introduction of a new programming structure, which include a reduction in the number of radio stations to three. In spite of these austerity measures, Stefko says, Slovak Radio's costs will exceed its revenues by 84 million korunas this year. He warns that the "intervention against the radio undermines the foundations of Slovak culture" because cultural and educational programs are affected most severely of all. He mentions, for example, that Slovak Radio may be forced to give up its orchestra, which costs 18 million korunas a year and earns only about 5 million korunas. Stefko also points to Slovak Radio's ambivalent legal status, which makes it possible for the government to treat it the way it does. He says: "Law number 255 states that Slovak Radio is managed as a subsidized organization. At the same time, according to the same law, it can be entered in the company register and has the right to engage in entrepreneurial activity. Hence, we are controlled like a subsidized organization, but, on the other hand, we are not being provided with financial resources like a subsidized organization. Everybody uses this [ambivalence] the way it suits him."
