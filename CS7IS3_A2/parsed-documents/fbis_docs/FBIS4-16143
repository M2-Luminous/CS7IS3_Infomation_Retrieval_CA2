Now, they will serve in a newly formed division of naval border guard ships belonging to the Ukrainian Navy. Apart from the newcomers, the new division of the Ukrainian Navy includes the entire 46th Hydro-Region, consisting of two hydrographers, eight boats, a radio-technical unit and auxiliary services. This is presumed to be the result of a recent incident involving the "Cheleken" hydrographer, which was barred from leaving the sea port of Odessa. Commander of the Western Naval Region of the Ukrainian Navy, Captain First rank Dmitriy Ukrainets, told a correspondent of the UKRINFORM news agency that the main cause of the incident in Odessa was an attempt to rob the ship. "The problem of the division of the fleet, its property and equipment has not been finally resolved yet, and some `anxious servicemen' are trying to grab as much as possible" Ukrainets said.
