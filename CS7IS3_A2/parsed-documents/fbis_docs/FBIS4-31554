But both of us were so absorbed in conversation that it took 25 minutes longer than scheduled. While the interview we publish is fairly extensive, it actually represents only a fraction of the comprehensive debate with this experienced 61-year-old member of the government, who has been active in diplomacy and in the foreign service since 1957. [Loerincz] It is being said that the key to solving the crisis in the Yugoslav space lies in Serb-Croat relations. Does the opening of a Yugoslav representative office in Zagreb and of a Croatian representative office in Belgrade herald the coming of better days? Or are those who believe that overly optimistic because far more serious problems in these relations are waiting for a solution? [Jovanovic] It is the first step toward the normalization of relations. As far as we are concerned, we are interested in this process [of normalization] taking place as fast as possible. We are prepared even now to recognize Croatia in the borders that it controls, on the understanding that the question of the Serbian Krajina would be put aside for the time being, until Zagreb and Knin (main center of the republic Serbian Krajina -- editor's note) find in mutual negotiations a final political solution to their relations. This is in keeping with the plan of Cyrus Vance, which emphasizes its own temporary nature and does not prejudice any future political solution. Theoretically, this does not rule out the possibility of the expansion of the recognition of Croatia from the viewpoint of borders in the future. Croatia evidently approaches the question of normalization of relations with us differently and understands it as a means toward its recognition in its former borders as established by the Antifascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ, that is, the borders as they emerged from the national liberation struggle during World War II). However, for us this would mean defiance of the will of the population of Serbian Krajina. Only they are entitled to decide on their future, not we. For the time being, however, we could develop mutually advantageous relations in other areas, without allowing the disputed Krajina issue to complicate them. [Loerincz] But at least two partners are needed for such relations to be developed.... [Jovanovic] It seems that Croatia is not prepared for this, as it is trying right from the beginning to politicize the process of normalization of relations with the Krajina. The final political solution must be achieved in the third and final phase of the whole process. Precisely because this phase will be the most important and the most sensitive one, it must be preceded by phase one and phase two: an end to hostility and normalization of economic relations. These two phases must establish good conditions for the successful start and, I hope, also a successful conclusion of the aforementioned third phase. [Loernicz] Some analysts believe that the issue of Kosovo in the south of Serbia, which is inhabited largely by Albanians, could be tackled in some analogous way. In other words, if Serbian Krajina seceded from Croatia, would Kosovo also secede from Serbia? [Jovanovic] Kosovo should not be mixed up with the elements of the Yugoslav crisis because it is not a constituent element of this crisis. It is a typical example of the separatism of one ethnic minority and this problem arose many years before the Yugoslav crisis even broke out. In the Yugoslav crisis one has to address the problems bequeathed by the breaking away of four republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina). Krajina is one of these problems -- it arose as a result of the one-sided breaking away of Croatia from Yugoslavia and of the denial of the Serbs' constitutional rights in Croatia. [Loerincz] In your opinion, the problems of Kosovo should thus be dealt with exclusively as an internal Yugoslav issue, so to speak? [Jovanovic] Kosovo has always been an organic part of Serbia, it is actually the cradle of Serbian statehood, church, and literature. It has never been part of any Albanian state. Therefore, there does not exist any historical or moral reason to consider Kosovo's secession and possible annexation to Albania. Also, there is no method of carrying this out, except by declaring war on the whole Serbian nation.... We respect our Albanian fellow citizens and apply toward them the same equal attitude as in relation to all citizens of Yugoslavia. The Serbian Constitution is based on the civic principle and defines Serbia as a state of equal nations, not as the state of the Serbian nation. When our Albanians rid themselves of the spell of separatism and start exercising the rights they have, they can, within 24 hours, become active in democratic institutions and realize their rights through them. [Loerincz] You mentioned that the Constitution defines Serbia as a state of citizens, which is surely positive. However, the more than 60,000 Slovaks in Vojvodina, for example, who had settled there 250 years ago and who made their contribution to the creation of Yugoslavia, are being confronted with acts of extremists who tell them: "Go back where you came from." [Jovanovic] What you are saying is the work of extremist right-wing and nationalist groups. These things used to happen, in particular, at the time when the Yugoslav crisis broke out and when the war in the Krajina and in Bosnia had exceptionally dramatic dimensions. Many frustrated and embittered refugees came to Serbia, among whom feelings of revenge and retribution became manifest. They received support also from individuals and groups in Serbia but this was marginal and ran counter to our policy. The threats you mention, which were addressed not only to Slovaks but also to Hungarians, are absolutely inadmissible and we have taken steps against them. But they need not be generalized. We regard Slovaks as loyal and hard-working people who mean much for the cultural wealth of our community. [Loerincz] Do you think that the proposal for the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina, under which the Muslim-Croat federation is to receive 51 percent and Bosnian Serbs 49 percent [of territory], is a good and just solution? Is the coexistence of Serbs, Muslims, and Croats even still possible? [Jovanovic] You know, the Serbs, Muslims, and Croats come essentially from one nation and speak the same language. We are people of the same blood and have the same merits and the same weaknesses. Unfortunately, the virus of nationalism incited from abroad managed to destroy coexistence in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The fratricidal war has brought new divisions, reopened wounds from the last, far more drastic war, and opened new wounds. Much effort will therefore be needed both in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself and from us beyond its borders in order to create foundations for the renewal of coexistence. We will always remain brothers regardless of past and present fighting there, regardless of how much hatred there is. I believe that foreign interests have caused much evil and are the main reason for there still being no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Forces from outside Europe, in particular, want this continent to be weakened by the prolongation of the crisis and the continuation of sanctions. Let us not forget that while the Serbs in Bosnia supported the plan of the European Union, this plan was rejected by the Muslim side, after it received signals from the Americans, Turkey, and other Islamic countries. [Loerincz] The leading representative of Bosnian Muslims, Alija Izetbegovic, has repeatedly called for the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a multinational and multicultural state. [Jovanovic] Mr. Izetbegovic is a well-known Islamic fundamentalist. In December 1991, still before the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he declared on television that he was ready to sacrifice peace for the sake of Bosnia-Herzegovina's independence. Politicians who say things like that are usually taken to a psychiatric ward. But the world did not react at that time. Izetbegovic has now again said something scandalous. Supposedly, the Serbs can never kill as many Muslims as Muslim mothers and fathers will beget. This is typical fundamentalist thinking and reminds me of Khomeyni, who used to send children into war in the awareness that they would perish. [Loerincz] What then is the way out of this war? Could a solution lie in the aforementioned partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina in a ratio of 51 to 49? [Jovanovic] It is not the best solution in all its parts but the Bosnian Serbs have accepted it and I would like to draw attention to the fact that at one time, at the talks on the Invincible aircraft carrier in the Adriatic, it had also been accepted by the Muslims and Croats, Yugoslavia, and the European Union. Personally, I do not think that percentages are the most important thing but, rather, the readiness and goodwill to achieve a reasonable compromise. The Bosnian Serbs have been prepared for it for two years, ever since they offered territory for peace sometime in June or July 1992, which they confirmed in written form to Lord Carrington. The offer, which concerned the exchange of 20 percent of the territory under their control for peace, is still valid today. [Loerincz] Extensive sanctions against Yugoslavia have been applied for two years now. One of the arguments for their introduction and tightening was that Yugoslavia had its troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This turned out not to be true, however. What then is the aim of the sanctions? [Jovanovic] Germany and the then European Community introduced the sanctions eight months before the war in Bosnia with the aim of forcing the rest of Yugoslavia to dissolve itself. All parts of Yugoslavia were to accept this, establish new states, and request international recognition. This part (Serbia and Montenegro), which represents one-half of former Yugoslavia, did not agree to that. It said: "You cannot deprive us of our homeland. This is our state. True, it has been reduced in size by the others' departure, but it is still our state." It is for this reason that we were punished by sanctions. We made ourselves guilty by refusing to renounce our own country, by not being willing to disintegrate, which was needed, in particular, by Germany. [Loerincz] After Germany's unification? [Jovanovic] Yes. It quickly started to carry out its political and economic expansion, particularly in those directions, in which it previously tried to expand by military means. It forced its position on the then European Community. New sanctions, or their expansion and tightening, were then justified by the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for which we are supposedly responsible. Yet it is the coalition of Bosnian Muslims and Croats that bears responsibility for the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was this coalition that violated the constitution of this republic in the parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina and deprived the Serbs of the right to constitutionality [ustavotvornost] and the right to consensus. The referendum that took place on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina's independence was based on the majority principle, which runs counter to the principle of consensus. This meant the trampling underfoot of the Constitution and of the Serbs' rights. Western countries then very quickly recognized the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although the declaration of independence did not have the support of one-third of the population. That led to civil war, for which it was necessary to find a scapegoat. [Loerincz] Are you suggesting that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has become this scapegoat? [Jovanovic] Exactly, although it was precisely Yugoslavia that accepted all the four major peace plans for a solution to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Serbs have accepted three of them, rejecting only the Vance-Owen plan for the cantonization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Izetbegovic has accepted only one of them, precisely the one that was rejected by the Bosnian Serbs. He apparently did so for tactical reasons. Croatia had its regular troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which were involved in fighting there. But no one called Croatia to account and no one punished it because of this. This is a case of double standards, which are practiced also by Turkey, which finances, arms, and incites Bosnian Muslims, or Iran, which violates the embargo on supplies of weapons to Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Loerincz] Is a certain one-sidedness on the part of some media, which sees all evil on the Serbian side, not part of the policy of sanctions? [Jovanovic] The media blockade against the Serbian nation had been organized even before the Yugoslav crisis broke out, by separatists and their foreign helpers, who at that time came mostly from the German-speaking bloc and from the Vatican. They systematically created an inaccurate and extremely biased image of Yugoslavia where, supposedly, democracy is possible only when support is given to the breaking away of some republics. According to this image, Serbia, Montenegro, and the Serbian nation are by their very nature negative, conservative, demagogic, narrow-minded in their ideology, and seeking hegemony over others. Sympathy for Slovenia and Croatia and antipathy for Serbs were being built on this [image]. We underestimated this because we believed that Yugoslavia would exist forever. Following these preparations, the separatists went on the offensive against Yugoslavia at a time when the cold war ended and the Soviet Union fell apart. It was a "blitzkrieg," in which they broke up one country. [Loerincz] Relations between our states and between Slovaks and Serbs, Montenegrins, and the other Yugoslav nations have a long tradition. They were close and multifaceted already in the 19th century. How do you view the present and prospects of relations between Slovakia and Yugoslavia? [Jovanovic] This traditional friendship, forged frequently in critical moments of history, lives in our memories and hearts. I am thinking here of both the Czech and the Slovak people. In 1938 my brother, like many others, volunteered to go and defend then Czechoslovakia. Slovakia is perhaps even closer to us, which is surely true geographically and linguistically. We have similar geostrategic experience. We are Danube nations and have many reasons to develop friendship and cooperation. That is why, immediately after the declaration of Slovakia's independence, we proposed opening an embassy in your country -- your embassy in Belgrade operates already. However, we have not yet received your government's agreement. It would be in the interest of our nations and of peace and stability in this part of Europe. It would also be in the interest of greater mutual understanding, for there is not enough of this after everything that has happened in our region.
