TV journalists from Moscow were not admitted. The explanation: "It is just an ordinary nuclear waste dump of which there are quite a few in Russia." Yet its main danger lies precisely in its ordinariness. Especially since people here avoid even mentioning the "Andreyevka." But all secrets come out eventually, and so.... Instead of the statutory 300 people supposed to ensure the burial of spent nuclear fuel rods, only 100 work here. They are all military men, but they include a lot of unskilled people. Elementary protective clothing is in short supply. Officers are letting sailors have their suits. There is not even a suggestion of safety equipment. Heroic feats are accomplished here if not daily, then once every three months. This is the interval at which the freight -- spent fuel rods from reactors of nuclear submarines -- is delivered. According to an officer who works at "Andreyevka" the method of unloading them corresponds to the pre-revolutionary level of metal processing. An officer lies on his back to monitor the position of the reactor roof [kryshka reactora]. If it shifts even by a millimeter, he shouts "Stop!" Should he make a mistake, a thermal explosion would occur, i.e. a situation similar to Chernobyl.
