Political observers say that there is renewed energy in the party ranks and its mayoral candidates are conducting a very successful campaign with the assistance and support of the security forces in the region. They say that the MHP is being used as a shield against the terrorist activities of the PKK (outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party) in the Southeast. Observers predict that successful MHP candidates at the local elections will be open targets for the PKK. Opinion polls show that the MHP will do very well in the 27 March mayoral elections in at least two provinces and a number of districts and townships in the Southeast. MHP candidates for Sirnak and Bingol provinces are regarded as certain to win and party officials have intensified their campaign for Diyarbakir, the biggest province in the region. Political observers say that MHP campaigns in the region have the active support of the security forces and make the observation that MHP candidates are protected by the security forces, consisting of police, special teams, village guards and the clans who support the government. Furthermore, these groups are able to convey the MHP's message to sections of the community which are out of reach of the political parties. Military personnel are not involved in the campaign but some are reported to be encouraging people to vote for the MHP. Observers also point out that the turnout of voters in the region will be relatively low and this will benefit the MHP. They believe that those who had intended to vote for the Democracy Party (DEP) will not vote for any other party now that the DEP has withdrawn from the elections. Many voters take the threats by the PKK very seriously and will not risk voting for another party. Voters will also experience difficulties in reaching polling stations due to unfavorable weather conditions. Added to this is the number of people who have moved away from the area since they were registered on the electoral roll. These factors will result in a low turnout which will be to the MHP's advantage. Based on the belief that MHP supporters are actively engaged in warfare with PKK terrorists, commentators say that the MHP and its young nationalist members are being set up for a bloody confrontation with the PKK. Chairman of MHP, Alpaslan Turkes, is reported to have said that his party was very reluctant to have anything to do with an outlawed group such as the PKK which worked against the state. Turkes also said that it was the government's responsibility to take the necessary measures otherwise any act by the MHP might be regarded as provocation. Observers also believe that the supporters of the MHP are inadvertently pushing the party into the eye of the storm, into open clashes with PKK terrorists. "Let us assume that MHP candidates are successful in some of the provinces" observers say, "The PKK will definitely kill these candidates, even though there is no active anti-PKK campaign in the region. They will owe their success to the support of the armed forces once they are elected. In the event that the PKK does kill the MHP candidates, not only will they succeed in causing havoc in the region, they will draw the members of the MHP into the centre of the Kurdish problem. The irony of the situation is that the PKK will finally set the MHP against itself even though the MHP has always succeeded in avoiding a confrontation with the PKK." The MHP is well known for its willingness to be actively involved in the Azeri-Armenian and Bosnian conflicts, but does not want to have any dealings with the PKK. They may not be able to avoid the consequences of the recent political developments in the region.
