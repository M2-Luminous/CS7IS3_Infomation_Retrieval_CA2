The two leaders are satisfied with the result and are stating openly that they will form an autonomous group in parliament with the task of providing "an effective opposition." To Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] and the other allies they are proposing solely a consultation pact. When all is said and done they have won their battle, and are now ready to gather in fruits aimed at "visibility" and "diversity," setting them apart from the progressive chorus defending Prime Minister Ciampi. In order to mark this diversity, the neo-communists in parliament and in the Senate will be acting as a separate group. Because, Bertinotti explains, pouring everyone into one melting pot would represent a diminution of the plurality and the richness of the political scene to the Left. And then because unity must be constructed from the bottom up, paying attention to and building on the concerns and sensitivities of progressive voters. If not, it would be like trying to build a house starting with the roof and not the foundation. For this reason Bertinotti and Cossutta are proposing the consultation pact between all elected progressives as a way of "reaching agreement on the battles which must be fought jointly inside and outside parliament," and of "remedying the deficit of unity during the election campaign" and of recovering the collegial spirit which has not worked in recent months. A pact which, they continue to underline, should start with the needs of people and with real problems, and which therefore requires a clear opposition, the renewal of social conflict as the only way of regaining the consensus of the popular masses. Also because the Right, Bertinotti says, "is a Right which constitutes a very serious threat to the country's social model," a threat which also manifests itself "as a new form of dorotheism [former Christian Democratic faction]." Hence the need to prepare for opposition, also because Cossutta does not believe in the breaking up of the pole of the Right. Even if there were the possibility of creating a left-center government, with a [Northern League Secretary] Bossi landing in the opposing camp, Communist Renewal would be opposed. Bertinotti does not wish to talk of rumors which say that Occhetto's future is in question within the PDS. And to those who remind him that, ultimately, Occhetto is the progressives' leader, he replies that "Renewal has never recognized leadership" within the grouping. Cossuta, on the other hand, opened the question of the forthcoming institutional appointments, pointing out that, since 1976, there has been "the practice of entrusting these delicate tasks" to persons who are not necessarily members of the majority but who enjoy "prestige and recognized competence." But, for Renewal's chairman, this too is open to discussion. The serious political problem, on the other hand, is the chairmanship of the committees, in particular the bicameral ones entrusted with investigation and oversight. And here Cossuta proposes that "following the practice in many Western countries" the chairmanship be entrusted to the opposition. In this way the Renewal's leader has excluded the possibility of examining at this point in time the topic of the presidency of the Republic. "The legitimacy of President Scalfaro should not be questioned," Cossuta said, even if he recalled that in his party "considerable criticism has been expressed recently of certain choices made by the head of state."
