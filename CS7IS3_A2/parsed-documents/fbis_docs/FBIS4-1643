FBIS4-1643 "drchi063_d_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Northeast Asia ROK Says Security Council Statement `Appropriate' ROK Says Security Council Statement `Appropriate' OW0104082394 Beijing XINHUA in English 0801 GMT 1 Apr 94 OW0104082394 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 1 (XINHUA) -- South Korea said today that the statement of the United Nations Security Council on Pyongyang's nuclear issue is "an appropriate action". Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement, "the (South Korean) Government urges North Korea to take due note of such concern and will of the international community and come forth positively on the terms of the presidential statement." On Thursday, president of the U.N. Security Council Jean-Bernard Merimee issued a statement in New York, urging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete its inspection of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities. The 15-member U.N. Security Council adopted the statement by consensus without a vote. The statement is not legally binding and does not carry the same weight as a resolution which requires a vote. "The council has decided to remain actively interested in the matter and further Security Council consideration will take place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation of the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement," the spokesman said. He also said that South Korea "plans to continue with all possible efforts for an early solution to the North Korean nuclear issue through peaceful means in concert with all nations seeking nuclear non-proliferation." The IAEA and the DPRK have been engaged in a row recently over the inspection of the latter's nuclear sites. The Vienna-based IAEA claimed that Pyongyang rejected full inspection while the DPRK said that it met the IAEA's demands. On March 21, the IAEA's board of governors adopted a resolution referring the DPRK's nuclear dispute to the U.N. Security Council.
