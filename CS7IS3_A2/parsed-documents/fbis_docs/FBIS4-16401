Russia will take measures of its own in response to Kiev's actions, Pavel Grachev asserted. The Russian defense minister also voiced his opinion about replacing Russia's peacekeeping forces with UN units in CIS hotspots. He considers that this cannot be done since the UN does not have the money for this, they are unlikely to find anyone willing to go these hotspots and, furthermore, the CIS heads want to see on their territories only units of the Russian Armed Forces.
