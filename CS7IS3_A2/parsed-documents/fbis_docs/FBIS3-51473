The lack or absence of basic products and services and the excess of currency, among other problems, affected the people and boosted black market activities, discouraged people from going to work, and created an overall high degree of social indiscipline. As a result of this and other problems, by mid 1993 the difficulties worsened and crime, in all its forms, increased, as did enemy activities and vandalism. In light of this situation, the mechanisms of the Sole Surveillance and Revolutionary Combativeness System were reactivated at all levels. In Havana, where more than 30 percent of the crime occurs, more than 2,700 citizens were arrested, representing more than 84 percent of the cases brought to trial. One of the most frequent crimes that affected the people the most was the stealing of bicycles. The number of these crimes has dropped significantly, especially in Havana Province, City of Havana Province, Sancti Spiritus Province, and Matanzas Province. According to specialists of the National Revolutionary Police General Directorate, the number of crimes, such as assaults, forceful entry, and cattle rustling, and other economic crimes, has dropped. Likewise, homicide and assaults have decreased. Although, after analyzing some of the statistics resulting from the work done by the Sole Surveillance System with the support of the people, we cannot say that there has been a decrease in crime, I do agree with the specialists that criminal activity has been curbed and that the people are more secure. We are beginning 1994, a year in which the causes for crime will continue. Therefore, it has become necessary that in addition to the preventive and coercive measures being implemented, the causes for crimes be pinpointed and alleviated so that the revolutionary and hard working Cuban people will remain secure, something to which they have been accustomed for the past 30 years.
