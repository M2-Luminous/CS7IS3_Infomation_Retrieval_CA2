On 18 February Tea Chamrat, Yu Hokkri, and Khan Savoeun -- Army offciers of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and co-ministers of national defense and security of the two-headed government -- led hundreds of soldiers and policemen with many tanks and armored vehicles and many large and small weapons to attack and burn 400 houses of other FUNCINPEC soldiers and their families and of other Para [troops of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front] soldiers in Stoeng Meanchey, Chaomchau [Phnom Penh suburb]. Fifteeen soldiers and their families died and over 30 were wounded; 60 were arrested. 2. The above savage and brutal act has caused all FUNCINPEC and other Para [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] soldiers to go through the roof with their anger. This represents FUNCINPEC Army officers and officials killing their men with their own hands. None of us ever thought this would happen. What is the status of our chiefs now? Are they betraying their men? Are they colluding with the Hun Sen-Chea Sim group, lackeys of communist Vietnam? Can we remain with these chiefs? What should we do to stay alive? FUNCINPEC chiefs rounded us up to fight with no salary. Many of us died with no one caring for us. We starved and were very poor to the point of almost begging to stay alive. Our wives and children have been raped, oppressed, and exploited like animals. Land and houses have been plundered by our chiefs and we have practically nothing left. Our lives are constantly in the death pit. We asked for a salary, but were refused. We asked for a plot of land, but were also refused. They instead forced us to fight and die in great numbers, leaving our wives and children behind. There is no justice. They have been killing us. If puppets of communist Vietnam kill the nation and the people and plunder land and other property of the nation and people, they voice their support for this. What should we do? We should fight back. We should flee and return to the farms, till the land, and grow crops to live as dignified persons. We should not be lackeys and allow ourselves to be killed at will. For the commands of Divisions 9, 3, 11, 7, 8, 12, and 5 of ANKI [National Army of Independent Camabodia -- FUNCINPEC troops]. [Dated] 19 February 1994
