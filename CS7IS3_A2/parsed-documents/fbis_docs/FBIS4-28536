"North Korea, taking it seriously that the international community will possibly take concerted sanction measures, is sending the message that it could accept (nuclear) inspections," Kakizawa told an interpellation session at the House of Councillors Budget Committee. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, also speaking before the committe, reiterated that Japan would join the United States and South Korea in economic support to the North provided Pyongyang accepts full inspections of the country's nuclear facilities. Hata also indicated that the ruling coalition would back military measures within a framework of "universal security." But he added, "of course we cannot participate in military measures involving use of weapons, which is prohibited by Article 9 of the Constitution." Japan's pacifist postwar Constitution states in the article, "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." Legislator Makoto Taneda of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), however, urged the government to clarify from which article in the Constitution it draws its support for collective defense. Takao Ode, head of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, acknowledged that the Constitution does not incorporate "a concrete article" on the issue. But, he said, Japan's connection with collective defense arises "from our joining the U.N. Charter." The interpellation session will be carried over to Monday as Taneda was not satisfied with the government's answers.
