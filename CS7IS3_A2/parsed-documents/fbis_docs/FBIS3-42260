Thai police received information from Washington that Mir Aimal Kansi, 30, slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide in the network of guerrilla and criminal gangs operating here, according to the source, a senior member of the special branch who spoke on condition of anonymity. Kansi was suspected of killing two employees of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Virginia on January 25, 1993. He was also suspected of operating in the same gang as Muhammad Farooq and Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, suspects in the Febuary 26, 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade Center. Although Thai police have not received information on Farooq's or Yousef's whereabouts, they have circulated wanted posters for all three men in Thai tourist resorts. The posters offer a US$2 million reward in exchange for information leading to their arrest. The source said Thai police had sent three teams to search for Kansi in the tourist resorts of Pattaya, Phuket and Hat Yai, one to northern Thailand and two to the Muslim-dominated provinces of Pattani and Narathiwat. "But so far there is no clue leading to the suspect," he said. "We believe he has had cosmetic surgery done to his face, is carrying false travelling documents and is associating with international gangsters." At least a dozen members of international criminal gangs and guerrilla networks, especially from the Islamic countries of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Syria, are operating in Bangkok, the source said.
