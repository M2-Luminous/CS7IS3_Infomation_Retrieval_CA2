We are talking about freedom of speech in Cuba, today being international freedom of speech day. Luis, I believe every time someone talks about freedom of speech, people think about the media, and we as a medium have the right to refer to that today, taking advantage of the fact that today the media belongs to us and the people. And I believe that we need to point out that the media in Cuba are in favor of the people and that the work we do is in favor of the people and national interests. I believe it is important to define it like this, in discussing this topic, because many times, people talk about freedom of the press and freedom of the press understood in traditional terms, where freedom of speech is to be able to use the media to oppose the decisions of the government. Well, we would also have to look at up to what point they oppose government decisions and how many interests are combined for those decisions and that opposition. In Cuba, we have followed a policy, which I support and believe should be eternal as long as we have such a strong enemy like the United States, and it is that the media does not allow nor give any space for a criteria that goes against the popular majority and against the people, and against the government approved by the people. [Sexto] The famous freedom of the press is one of the forms of freedom of speech. Sometimes freedom of speech is confused with the famous freedom of the press, and I believe that is not the way it should be. Freedom of the press, or the media, is one of the channels for the people to express themselves. Seconds ago, we referred to how, in Cuba, there are a series of mechanisms to facilitate and channel freedom of speech. [Rodriguez] Do do consider yourself a free reporter? [Sexto] I consider myself a free reporter to the point that I am not capable of writing or talking about something I am not convinced of. And I believe I have the right to tell the director of the magazine, when I am ordered to write a commentary on something I do not feel comfortable with, to get someone else to do it. That has been my norm as a professional during twenty years as a reporter. [Rodriguez] That does not mean that there are some reporters who have written things they have not agreed with. [Sexto] No, just like there are people who go to meetings and do not say everything they believe because they are cowards. [Rodriguez] Just like there are people who have said something on the street and have been censured by someone... [Sexto interrupting] By some citizen. [Rodriguez] Yes, by a citizen, who has censured him and has even denied him his right to have a different point of view. [Sexto] Yes, he has been reprimanded verbally, right? He has responded to a determined expression. Now, getting back to the media, the same happens with freedom of speech. The media cannot be separated from society. Freedom of the press cannot be separated from the determined society, from the classical structure of a determined society. The media is an instrument of the majority. No one should think that the media is a fourth power, as many have said and as many continue to believe. That is absurd. The media is always subordinate to the dominant interests in a society. But in our country, the media, which has its defects and problems, is subordinate to the interests of the nation, the interests of the people. That is the way it is. Do you think it would be wise to give room for ideas of annexation in our media? Don't you think it would be suicidal to allow those who favor annexation to defend their point in our newspapers, especially during these difficult times that our country is facing? [Rodriguez] I agree. I believe the opposition cannot have a voice in our media because the opposition already has a voice in the media of our enemies.
