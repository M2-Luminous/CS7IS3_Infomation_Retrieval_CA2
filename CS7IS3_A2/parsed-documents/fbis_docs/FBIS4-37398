The power station was the target of a treacherous, cowardly raid by the treasonous, agent secessionist gang's aircraft. Fire and security men exerted great and continuous efforts for 26 hours with unparalleled zeal and vigor to save this important, vital installation, which was built with the blood and sweat of our militant Yemeni people. A vile clique from the secessionist, apostate gang is trying to destroy such installations, in keeping with its ignoble habit of sowing death and destroying economic and vital installations. The brother Ta'izz governor directly supervised the progress of rescuing and evacuating the dead and wounded workers, children, and women to hospitals. The brother governor also directly supervised the fire fighting process until the fire was brought under control, with the support of God and the efforts of the efficient fire and security men.
