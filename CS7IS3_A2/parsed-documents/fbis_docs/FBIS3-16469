The Russian minister told journalists he wanted to discuss with his opposite number from the United States the situation in Bosnia, Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace programme, joint peacekeeping, the problem of nuclear arms, including their withdrawal from Ukraine and a wide range of problems relating to better relations between the military authorities of the two countries. Also today, William Perry is due to meet First Russian Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin and Chief of Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov. According to American sources, Perry, 66, is a true professional with deep knowledge and extensive experience.
