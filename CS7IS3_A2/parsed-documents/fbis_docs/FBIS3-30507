At the same time, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said during a trip to Athens that the facility must be opened within a month. Leotard briefed Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin and Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Mikhail Kolesnikov on the idea of "air strikes at close intervals" so humanitarian aid could be brought in to suffering civilians, but the Russians remained "very cautious," Leotard told a news conference. However Leotard added that he believed despite "differences in analysing the situation and on what action to take... we are not very far apart." [passage omitted] The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) last month reaffirmed the principle of using air strikes to reopen the airport, if necessary. Since then, Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs, has come out against the idea. France thinks "there must be air cover and that if air raids are ever carried out, they must be for protection, not aggression," the defense minister said, but "The Russians think such action could cause a slide into war." The Russians, who "undoubtedly" have influence over the Serbs, "are very cautious at the moment," he added, but "talks must be continued with them." Leotard is on a three-day official visit to Russia. Meanwhile Juppe, on a visit to Athens, set a deadline of about "a month" to reopen Tuzla airport. During an official 24-hour visit, he said that both that operation and NATO's decision to relieve Canadian UN peacekeepers in the eastern town of Srebrenica, where Serb forces are preventing them from leaving, must "be implemented as quickly as possible." He said he did not want to name a date because "this would sound like an ultimatum" but that it should be "on the order of a month," adding, "things should move quickly now." Juppe added, "that's what we're going to try to do Monday" during a meeting of European Community foreign ministers in Brussels. "If within a month or two," he added, "things have not moved on the diplomatic level, we must really draw conclusions." Juppe said the belligerents should be given "one last chance to (reach) a political settlement" which could only be based on a peace plan proposed by the European Community, bringing in more directly the United States and Russia. Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias said he "agreed entirely" with the idea of carrying out air strikes, but only to bring in aid. Earlier, international peace negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg during a visit to Bucharest expressed "full support" for air strikes to protect UN peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
