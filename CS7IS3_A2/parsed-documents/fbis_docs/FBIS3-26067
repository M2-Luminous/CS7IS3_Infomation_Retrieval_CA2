[XINHUA] Many measures will be taken this year. What are the key ones? [Hong Hu] There are two key points in reform this year. One is to deepen the reform of the enterprise structure and to carry out experiments on the establishment of a modern enterprise system. The other is to promote the reform of the macroregulation and macrocontrol structure and, at the same time, to carry out as a supplement the building of the market system with the essentials market as the dominant factor and to speed up the progress in the reforms of the social security and housing systems. [Du Yali] In October 1993, GUANGMING RIBAO published a report which stated that losses of state assets were serious, totaling 100 million yuan a day. This attracted the attention of the readers. Please tell us whether or not the rate of such losses has been curbed. Is the situation improving? [Hong] This issue has attracted great attention in the State Council and measures are being taken. In the course of carrying out modern enterprise system reform and of reorganizing property rights this year, how to avoid the loss of state assets is an issue especially worthy of our attention. Hong Hu disclosed after analyzing several causes of the losses of state assets at present: The work of formulating the "Regulations on Supervision and Control Over State Assets" has been completed. At present, some technical problems are being handled and the regulations will soon be promulgated. The regulations explicitly state the responsibility of government investment organs in supervising and controlling state assets. The promulgation of the regulations will effectively curb the rate of losses of state assets. [LIEN HO PAO] The reorganization of property rights will inevitably result in unemployment for some people. Is the living standards of these people secured? [Hong] Both the reorganization of property rights and the readjustment of the enterprise organization structure involve the issue of arrangements for the placement of staff members and workers. The state has always attached great importance to this. In May last year, the State Council issued documents clearly stating the arrangements for staff members and workers of state enterprises who are awaiting jobs and departments concerned have, in accordance with the number of people and a certain percentage, established insurance funds for those awaiting jobs. According to relevant documents issued by the state, the living standards of the staff members and workers in bankrupt enterprises are secured. Liu Zhifeng said, in reply to a question on housing reform raised by RENMIN RIBAO: On 31 December 1993, the State Council issued a circular on resolutely stopping sales of houses at low prices. Some people mistakenly thought that housing reform would stop. As a matter of fact, stopping the sales of houses at low prices is precisely to better promote housing reform. This is because the sales of houses at low prices will easily lead to unfair distribution once again, which is harmful to long-term housing reform. The State Council will soon promulgate a decision on speeding up the residential housing system reform in towns and cities. Selling houses will be the dominant factor and selling, renting, and building houses will be carried out at the same time. Various departments should energetically and safely promote the sales of houses strictly in accordance with the method for fixing prices stipulated by the State Council.
