These Muslim infantry attacks have been repelled. The Serbian army fighters are firmly holding their positions on the right bank of the Drina River and are saying they will launch a counterattack if the Muslims do not stop their attacks. The Muslim forces have been noticed carrying out fresh regrouping on the elevations of Gradina, Olujaca, and Trebecevo. A high-ranking officer from the command of the Serbian army told us that they had intercepted a radio message from the Muslims that U.S. aircraft will attack Serbian territories again today. At the same time, the command of the Herzegovina Corps confirmed that despite the constant lies by Muslim radio [Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina], the Serbian units are not in Gorazde, nor are the fighters of the Serbian army attacking the town. What was it like during the air attack by the U.S. aircraft? You can hear this from the following conversation between my colleague Milenko Draskovic with Ljubisa Borovcanin, deputy commander of a unit at the front. [Borovcanin] I must admit that I had the opportunity for the first time to watch live how the U.S. Air Force supported the Turks, whose spirits were raised, especially when they saw that the U.S. aircraft were accurately pinpointing vehicles with Red Cross markings. I do not know where they trained and whose orders they were carrying out, but this was (?indeed) a morale booster for us. We waited for the order from our command, we were even ready to shoot at these aircraft. However, considering that the army has its hierarchy, we did not want to act on our own. I can convey you the feelings of the soldiers -- who were not frightened, which is shown and confirmed by the fact that we have retained the newly taken positions -- that next time the air force is used, it will be met with fire, according to our capabilities. [Draskovic] According to what you know, since you are in visual contact and listen to their radio stations, it appears that they knew precisely when the attack was going to take place. [Borovcanin] I can tell you that at the time when the aircraft were coming, we were observing the town of Gorazde. I personally was looking at it together with my fighters and my commander, who was here before me on the front line. At the time when the aircraft were overflying, a large number of citizens of Gorazde came out in the streets with binoculars, which clearly showed that they knew when the aircraft were going to come. They wanted to watch a great miracle that did not happen after all. [Draskovic] You also intercepted a radio message? [Borovcanin] We heard a conversation. We were threatened. The Turks threatened us that at 1500 the Phantoms would wreak havoc. It actually happened at 1445. So, this was a coordinated attack. [Draskovic] The moment when they starting shooting, when they dropped the bombs, must have been horrific. What was it like? [Borovcanin] Believe me, it was not horrific. It looked like a war game that we used to play on computer. We survived it and so did the attackers, unfortunately. The question is whether they will survive it next time.
