Before leaving Sanaa International Airport, he made the following statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA': Entrusted by the Presidential Council and the Council of Ministers, I will represent the Republic of Yemen in the UN Security Council [UNSC] deliberations, which were requested by certain states. In this regard, we are interested in explaining the facts as they are to the UN Security Council to ensure that the results of these deliberations will be in harmony with the hopes of our people to preserve the country's unity and democratic march in the face of the conspiracy and malicious attack against unity and democracy by the secessionist elements in the Socialist Party leadership. These elements are trying to reverse history by insisting on returning to the pre-22 May 1990 situation. We will also brief the UN Security Council on the truth about what is happening in our country. It is an armed rebellion against constitutional legitimacy and a violation of the Constitution and a flagrant attack against citizens and their security and stability. The legitimate agencies' fulfillment of their tasks in the face of the armed rebellion reflect their national and constitutional responsibility to protect the sovereignty and stability of the homeland; it is also an internal affair and no one should interfere in it.
