While progress has been made in the promotion of dialogue on South-North relations, there is totally no prospect of resumption of Japan-DPRK negotiations on normalizing diplomatic relations. While welcoming the start of upcoming inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Japanese Government has indicated its stand that "it will be the best for the DPRK too" to rejoin the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and to win understanding and cooperation from the international community. Since last year, Japan has tried several times in Beijing and other places to urge the DPRK to resume the preparatory meetings on the talks for normalizing bilateral ties. However, there have been no responses so far. It is believed that "for the DPRK, that attaches the greatest importance to the talks with the United States, the issue of normalizing diplomatic relations with Japan is of low priority," (according to a Foreign Ministry source).
