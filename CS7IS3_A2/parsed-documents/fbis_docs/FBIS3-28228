The insurance market worldwide is full of regulations in the context of protecting policyholders, and the framework talks in this field focus on what is possible to deregulate, the official said, requesting anonymity. Checking the progress of deregulation should be the criteria which Japan and the U.S. are to set up under the framework agreement reached in July, the official said. In this sense, the insurance field is different from, for example, the relatively regulation-free automobile field, the official said, indicating the framework yardsticks could vary for each field. Nevertheless, he criticized the U.S. for demanding quantitative benchmarks in the overall framework talks, saying that private- sector market share is determined by business efforts and strategies. Under the July agreement, the two nations are to establish "objective criteria" of a qualitative or quantitative nature, or both if appropriate. The official said the two sides would have to make further efforts to narrow the gap over the criteria issue at scheduled meetings led by subcabinet-level talks next week before the February 11 talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton in Washington. An agreement is targeted by then in three priority fields -- insurance, automobile and auto parts, and government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment. Asked about the chances of postponing the summit because of the political turmoil over the tax issue in Japan, the official said the government is determined to keep the schedule. The two leaders are also slated to discuss their respective macroeconomic measures as the framework agreement calls for the U.S. to take deficit-cutting measures and Japan to boost domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus. The deadlocked tax issue is delaying Japan's announcement of its stimulus package, including tax cuts, and compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget -- the two major actions which Hosokawa plans to take before going to Washington. The official said macroeconomic issues are for reporting and not for negotiations. The U.S. side recognizes this, too, he said.
