A seven-member inspection team arrived in Pyongyang on 1 March afternoon. The targets of its inspection are 16 nuclear facilities, including an experimental atomic reactor and critical facilities [imgye sisol], a nuclear fuel rod manufacturing plant and storage facilities, a uranium mine and uranium smelting plant, and two atomic power stations. However, North Korea refused an ad hoc ordinary [imsi tongsang] inspection by putting forward its specific position in which its withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] is being withheld. As a result, the IAEA team's inspection will be conducted in such a manner as to only confirm whether the nuclear material is diverted for military purpose. Therefore, during the forthcoming inspections, examination of the equipment and work log, and confirmation of the status of the seals will be conducted in seven major facilities out of 16 declared facilities, including an experimental atomic reactor, critical and semi-critical facilities, a nuclear fuel rod manufacturing plant, a nuclear fuel storage facility, a 5-megawatt atomic reactor, and a radiochemical laboratory. North Korea ratified the Nuclear Safeguards Accord in April 1992, and following this, it forwarded for the first time a list of 16 nuclear facilities to the IAEA on 4 May. North Korea then reported to IAEA in 1992 that it extracted 90 grams of plutonium. However, the result of the inspection revealed that North Korea seemed to have extracted more, possibly several kilograms, thus showing a discrepancy. In a bid to inquire into this discrepancy, the IAEA demanded a special inspection of two sites in Yongbyon, which have been suspected of being nuclear waste storage facilities. However, North Korea rejected the demand, and declared its withdrawal from the NPT in 1993. Thus, the North Korean nuclear issue became an international problem.
