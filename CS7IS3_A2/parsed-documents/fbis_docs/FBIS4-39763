"We have lost too much in this sphere and we must restore our positions step by step," he underlined. Soskovets reminded that in the time of the USSR the Soviet arms export was 30 percent of the world one and the share of the United States was 35 percent. The situation has radically changed now. As of today, the share of the Russian Federation in arms export is five percent and the United States controls almost 65 percent of the world market. Addressing the sitting of the Cabinet, Soskovets was critical of several leaders of federal ministries and departments due to a low executive discipline and weak control over the situation in some concrete branches of industry. In particular, the question concerns the Russian Federation committee on Machine- Building and Atomic Energy Ministry.
