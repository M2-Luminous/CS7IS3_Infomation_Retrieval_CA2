The PGR also revealed that it will hold meetings and sign agreements and treaties with Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, Peru, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and South Africa pertaining to bilateral operations for fighting the drug traffic. According to the institution, special attention is being given to cooperation with the Central American nations, since, in the Mexican Government's strategy, that region's geopolitical situation ranks it as a priority territory. It declared that the entry and passage of narcotics and psychotropic substances in that area must be prevented. The office gave a reminder that last year Mexico's cooperation with Central America was part of our country's general plans for international cooperation, and it was guided by specific considerations of a geopolitical and strategic nature. The PGR noted that Mexico's action for drug control with the nations of that region was aimed, in particular, at collaborating with the international counternarcotics effort, especially that intended to prevent the entry of narcotics or their passage to the northern part of the area. To reinforce this action, legal advice has been offered for many years to prepare Articles of Agreement that would create the Central American Standing Committee for the Eradication of Production, Trafficking, Consumption, and Illicit Use of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. Similarly, since July 1993, the Attorney General's Office has directed efforts toward intensifying and defining the methods for cooperation with the Central American nations, including bilateral action in the endeavors with the region as a whole. The agency explained that, following the discoveries made on working visits paid to each of the Central American countries between July and August 1993, a document was prepared proposing Mexico's strategy for legal cooperation and joint drug control with Central America. It stressed that, on this basis, interinstitutional consultations were held on a national scale, obtaining the support of the departments involved in the matter, including the Foreign Ministry. As for the bilateral relations with the United States to combat drugs, the PGR proposed for this year a reinforcement of the negotiations on the extradition treaty. The aim is to leave the prohibition on border kidnappings explicitly established, and to reinforce this cooperation by placing emphasis on the common battle against organized crime and money laundering. It is intended to continue holding semiannual technical work sessions on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, and to seek new means of cooperation to deal with the problems of violence on the border. Among other things, it is also planned to study the feasibility of obtaining a six-month permit for the Citation aircraft to overfly and land during their maintenance trips to the United States.
