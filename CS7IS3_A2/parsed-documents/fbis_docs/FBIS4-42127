An Islamic organization placed three powerful time-bomb devices, which fortunately were discovered and dismantled. The Greek Government reacted strongly through its spokesman. Commenting on the placement of the three bombs at the Ecumenical Patriarchate and Ankara's claims about the so-called training of PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members in Greece, Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said that the Greek Government is following the continuing Turkish tension and provocations with self-restraint. Especially on the latter issue, Venizelos stressed that Turkey's claims are close to being ridiculous, and called on the Turkish Government to stop exporting, as he put it, its political problems and respect the rules of Western civilization and international law. New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert, who is touring Pieria, said that he does not consider the planting of bombs at the Ecumenical Patriarchate a serious issue, but described the statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman that Greece is training PKK members as suspicious. Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras today said that the Turkish Government has an obligation to take all necessary measures for the protection of the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate at Fanari. The knowledge that the Orthodoxy's unity is symbolized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate leads to extremist statements, along with the Kurdish issue which is dividing Turkey, Samaras stressed.
