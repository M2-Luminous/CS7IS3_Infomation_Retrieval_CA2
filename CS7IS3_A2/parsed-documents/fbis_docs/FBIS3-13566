AL-THAWRAH says: Iraqis have endured American arrogance and tyranny and they have watched while the Americans tried to destroy every symbol of civilization in their country, and yet they held their ground. Over the past four years, Iraq has handled the unfair UN Security Council resolutions with a sense of responsibility and commitment, while the UN Special Commission has been shuttling back and forth between New York and Baghdad. In the meantime, Iraq has had its weapons and factories destroyed, met its obligations, and opened its facilities for future inspection, as well as acceding to demands that it is certain are unfair. Having gone through this bitter, long, and arduous experience, the Iraqi people and Government are convinced that the page of procrastination and prevarication of the sly fox must be closed. Having seen the results of an unprecedented military aggression and realized that the Iraqi people are not easy prey, the fox has tried prevarication to sap the strength of the Iraqis to make it easier to break their will and destroy their sovereignty. The paper adds: Iraq is taking on a conspiracy whose weapons are sanctions and no-fly zones imposed under the cover of UN resolutions. But thanks to the genius and wisdom of its historic leader, Iraq has taken a well-considered stand that robs its enemies of all pretexts, especially since Iraq has carried out its obligations and shown every cooperation. Regional and world developments have exposed America's double standard toward Bosnia and the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. In the latter case, the United States has been blocking the UN Security Council from passing a resolution condemning the massacre. The paper stresses that all peoples and governments, including [word indistinct] states, are now facing their basic responsibility to address the faults that have been observed in the UN Security Council's view and stands since the outburst of U.S. tyranny and its adoption of the evils of the new world (?order). The paper notes that the use of the UN Security Council and the UN flag by the U.S. pirates, who inherited all the evils of the old colonialism, not only threatens Iraq's bread and sovereignty, but also the sovereignty and dignity of all states in the world and all peoples aspiring to achieve sovereignty, progress, stability, and the supremacy of justice and fairness in international relations. AL-THAWRAH said that what is at stake now is the integrity and reputation of the Security Council. The paper stressed that the council should uphold justice and fairness and fulfill its obligations by ending injustice and lifting the sanctions, or else Iraq and its leadership will legitimately choose a new road, a road different from the one it has followed for the past four years, in terms of its approach to resolutions and committees. Iraq has a legitimate and crystal clear demand: An end to the sanctions and the no-fly zones by the permanent Security Council members, which are required by the council's resolutions to ensure Iraq's sovereignty. The paper adds: If the evildoers think that Iraq has no other options or that it is incapable of rejecting the injustice that is concealed under the guise of UN resolutions with colonialist interpretations, then they are mistaken. Iraq, with its free will, is living in the age of its historic leader, the victorious knight Saddam Husayn. The years of al-Qadisiyah and the Mother of Battles, as well as the years of the unjust blockade, is sufficient evidence that Iraq is capable of surviving and that it has never lost its choice of options to reach its legitimate, noble goals -- sovereignty, dignity, and full rights. AL-QADISIYAH writes: His Excellency President Saddam Husayn's speech was open and echoed the soul and conscience of the people. It is the last chance for the Security Council to lift the sanctions without delay or conditions. The people of Iraq and Saddam Husayn speak with one voice and endure the same tribulations. Under his mujahid leadership, Iraqis vie among themselves to see who will sacrifice the most. We have come safely through difficulties and taken off, and with the benefit of our leader Saddam Husayn's resolve and the brilliance of his strategic intellect, we will stay the course.
