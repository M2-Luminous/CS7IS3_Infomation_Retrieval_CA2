Metaoui: "Security: The Foreign Women's Tragedy"] [Text] The International Committee To Support Algerian Intellectuals (CISIA) set up in Berlin, Germany, intends to start, next March, an awareness campaign on the serious situation existing in Algeria. The committee was set up a few days after Smail Yefsah's assassination, last October; in addition to its normal activities, it has been concerned for some time by the flow of foreign families residing in Algeria who return to their native country. According to Mr. Sadek Kebir, a member of the German CISIA, the situation is dramatic. "Recently, we were contacted by foreign women married to Algerians and who lived in our country for a long time, among the working class. Since armed groups started attacking foreigners, they left Algeria, against their will. All of a sudden, they find themselves in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Poland, or in Russia, where they have practically no family," Mr. Kebir observed; he believes that these women discover that their countries are totally different, and therefore have problems adjusting. "The entire world is looking at us." "We must study the situation of these foreign women. If someone is to be murdered because of who he is, we might perhaps understand that, but attacking innocent individuals because they don't look like Algerians, shooting at them, that is racism or even fascism," he said, adding that these women are sounding the alarm bell. "If we let that happen, neither the world nor history will forgive us," he said gravely. For Sadek Kebir, it becomes imperative to appeal to the people to make them understand that these foreigners "must enjoy every protection." In support of his position, he pointed out that in Germany, as everywhere else in Europe, the Algerian people enjoy a good reputation for their sense of hospitality. "Distrust of foreigners must disappear." "The women who contacted us said that they want to live in Algeria but are afraid of terrorism," Mr. Kebir stated, adding that the FLN [National Liberation Front] regime did a lot of damage in that it consistently denied Algerian citizenship to foreigners who applied for it. "The women who called on us came back with their children. Before leaving with their mothers, these children attended Algerian state schools. What are we going to do with these children who, until proven otherwise, are Algerians?" Faced with these many problems, the CISIA is creating a European association to support these families in distress, help them get through these bad times, and show "our full solidarity." "For us, the essential is to publicize the problem and inform public opinion." In addition, Mr. Kebir stated that applications for political asylum in Germany are not as numerous as is generally thought. "People must know that applications for asylum are not processed at state level. German law gives German institutions full latitude to decide on such demands. It is a mere problem of legality, not high-level politics," he said, indicating that the CISIA is attempting by all means to inform the Germans as to the situation that prevails in the country. "We would like to make them aware of the violence. If Algeria must face this phenomenon today, the entire Maghreb will be affected tomorrow, although the Europeans have begun to grasp what is at stake since the Yugoslav conflict broke out." Mr. Kebir denies the fact that Germany is used as a rear base by Islamist fundamentalists. "Although it is true that the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] is known in this country, nevertheless Germany has self-respecting institutions. The State is far from supporting any form of activism," he indicated. In closing we should note that the CISIA will soon have representatives in Amsterdam, Holland.
