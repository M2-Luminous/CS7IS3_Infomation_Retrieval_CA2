These issues are: Relations with Jordan; the stumbling negotiations with the Israelis; and the internal Palestinian course. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive Committee, spoke to AKHIR KHABAR following the meetings, which ended Monday [3 January] afternoon. Regarding relations with Jordan, 'Abd-Rabbuh said: The Jordanian and Palestinian sides agreed, during the meeting between His Majesty King Husayn and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat on Thursday, to activate the joint coordination committees and to instruct these committees to be practical in their deliberations and to directly deal with the major issues that must be viewed as priorities. He added: Despite the delay in the work of the committees, we believe that it is not too late and that there is a possibility for avoiding such a shortcoming. 'Abd-Rabbuh said: It is obvious that the problem on our part does not lie in our hesitation in or refrain from reaching the highest level of coordination, but in the lack of progress in the talks to end the Israeli occupation of even a part of the Palestinian territory. Any agreement with sisterly Jordan will be useless and cannot be practically applied without ending the occupation. We reached an understanding with our brothers in Jordan that discussing future relations, particularly on the political level, depends on the establishment of a Palestinian entity on Palestinian land and on ending the Israeli occupation. He said: The relationship should be established between two independent entities on an equal footing. He added that the same thing applies to the economic and security issues. [passage omitted]
