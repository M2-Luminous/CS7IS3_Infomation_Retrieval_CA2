FBIS4-35448 "drnes105_l_94016" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 27 May 1994 ISRAEL Likud MK's, Ministers React to Sharon Announcement Likud MK's, Ministers React to Sharon Announcement TA2705115294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1100 GMT 27 May 94 TA2705115294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Excerpts] Most Likud leaders oppose Ari'el Sharon's plans to run for the premiership in the next elections. [passage omitted] Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Knesset Member [MK] Yitzhaq Shamir said MK Sharon had better find other occupations more beneficial to the national interests rather than go on with his conspiracies to become the Likud's candidate for the premiership. Shamir added that the actions of Sharon, who always conspired against his superiors, harm the Likud and delight the left-wing camp. Likud chairman Moshe Qatzav opposes the demand to oust Sharon from the Likud. MK Qatzav told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that he supports Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu, but proposes to him to establish a joint leadership made up of figures such as Ari'el Sharon and David Levi. Likud secretariat chairman Yehoshu'a Matza said that through his announcement Sharon had ousted himself from the Likud's ranks. According to Matza, Sharon sows dissent and because of him the Likud was forced out of power. MK Dan Meridor said Sharon's action was a grave mistake. The Likud has procedures, he said, and there can be no constant rivalry. Moledet leader Rehav'am Ze'evi said that in order to save Eretz Yisra'el from the PLO's claws the national camp must present one candidate only: the man elected by the Likud. MK Ze'evi called on Sharon to put aside his personal ambition for the sake of Eretz Yisra'el, seeing that he has no chances of winning and that only the left-wing will profit by the split in the right-wing camp. National Religious Party leader Zvulun Hammer said the squabbling in the Likud has the left-wing camp gloating this morning. Every possible effort must be made to attain a dialogue within the nationalist camp, he added. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 27 May adds: "Minister 'Uzi Bar'am said that to date the Likud had only one candidate unfit to be prime minister, and that from now Likud voters will have two of them. ["Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that one must not forget that 12 years ago Sharon led the country to the Lebanon war, and that we paid a high price for this adventure."]
