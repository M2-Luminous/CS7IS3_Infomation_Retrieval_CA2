In an interview with today's AL-JUMHURIYAH, al-Alfi noted that public opinion has exposed the terrorists for what they really are -- outlaws who have nothing to do with religion and whose goal is to terrorize the people, spread panic, and disrupt stability. Consequently, he added, the public now sympathizes with the state in its efforts to eliminate terrorism. Minister al-Alfi pointed out that through cooperation with Arab and Asian states, Egypt has repatriated 29 fugitives from abroad. More is to come. He noted that coordination is now under way among all the ministries and competent authorities as part of the overall confrontation. He stressed that everybody is in the same boat in the face of terrorism. The interior minister urged the public to report any deviation or shortcomings. He said that corruption is as serious as terrorism, because they are two sides of the same coin and both must be confronted. Al-Alfi described the terrorists as outlaws who promote ideas that incite the overthrow of the regime by force; these are the same ideas that they use to penetrate the youth's minds. He emphasized that contacts exist among the various terrorist organizations, as evidenced by the terrorists' confessions. Their objective, he added, is to destabilize the regime and embarrass the government. Toward that end, they came up with new ideas, such as striking at tourist and economic installations, he added. The minister noted that cooperation exists among the Arab interior ministers to confront the misleading ideologies as well as the groups preaching such ideologies, because most of the Arab states have started to realize the gravity of the ideas of these gangs, which have become a threat to their regimes. These groups use the same slogans, training methods, and even the same instructors, he added. Proof of this is that bombs used in Tunis, for instance, were made up of the same substances and components as those used in Egypt, he added. Al-Alfi expressed his belief that brainwashing of those who join these organizations explains why particular individuals carry out suicide operations. He noted that these organizations receive continuing and considerable financial support. He said that $15,000 and 20,000 pounds were seized from one of these terrorist groups. Asked about the possibility of initiating a dialogue with these groups, al-Alfi asked: With whom will we hold a dialogue? With a group of killers who use arms to promote ideological and religious terrorism? He pointed out that holding a dialogue with these groups would mean that their Islam is true and ours is false. Al-Alfi pointed out that Egypt is a state of institutions and has its laws and Constitution. He said dialogue can be held with legal and recognized organizations in accordance with the Constitution. Otherwise, the result would be chaos and confusion. If anyone wants to be active he can join any legal organization. He said: Those in charge of security want a national dialogue to inform them of every legitimate view through the constitutionally acknowledged organizations, noting that there should be a bold comprehensive confrontation of terrorism for the sake of Egypt. Al-Alfi stressed that arms licenses must be restricted to a minimum and be in accordance with the law. He said there should be ample justification for carrying arms so as to prevent arms from reaching terrorists. He noted that most arms being used by terrorists are either brought in from abroad or left over from the wars in Sinai. He noted that depots housing tons of TNT were seized because there are some nomads who collect arms and explosives from private depots to sell to anyone who pays. On the role of art in the confrontation of terrorism, al-Alfi stressed that art plays a major and important role because it influences the literate and illiterate masses through a quick and facile presentation of facts.
