The recommendation is not designed to make changes to the frequently discussed Procedural Code but to the Penal Code. [begin recording] Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez: What is obvious is that the sentences need to be significantly harsher, and there are several reasons for this. I believe that current sentences should be at least doubled. [end recording] Justice Minister Gonzalez said that for the government's policy to be successful, stronger sentences for drug traffickers must be accompanied by appropriate interpretations of the system used to reduce sentences. [begin recording] Gonzalez: I believe there are many loopholes certain lawyers use to get sentences reduced. These loopholes are not included in the law. [end recording] It is very clear to the government that some of the guidelines established in light of the internal unrest and former state of siege gave the drug traffickers too many advantages, and, in turn, these advantages resulted in absurd sentences.
