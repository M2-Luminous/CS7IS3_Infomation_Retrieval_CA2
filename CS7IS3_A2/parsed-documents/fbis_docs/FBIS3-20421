At the 14th symposium on China's entering the GATT held in May of this year, China made an announcement regarding agricultural policy. China announced that it would no longer seek special exceptions for agriculture, and would implement its agricultural development policy within the scope of current GATT regulations, and would actively participate in the Uruguay Round negotiations on agricultural product concessions. I. Principal Affects 1. Improved capability of earning foreign exchange for the state to help to expand cereals, oils, and food exports. China is a major agricultural country and from the founding of the country, cereals, oils, and food have always been major exports. With China's industrial development and the constant improvement in the mix of export products, the share of cereals, oils, and food in China's exports has constantly fallen, but the total value of these exports has risen from year to year. For example, China's food exports had an average annual increase of 10.5 percent from 1980 through 1988. Its share of the total value of world food exports rose from 1.5 percent in 1980 to 2.5 percent in 1989. In 1992 cereals, oils, and food exports made up 12.4 percent of the total value of national exports. The natural component in China's cereals, oils, and food production is great, contamination is great, and the prices are low, and they have a certain competitiveness on the international market. The foreign price for wheat is 52 percent higher than the domestic price and that of polished round-grained nonglutinous rice is 16 percent higher, live hogs are 56 percent higher, eggs are 27 percent higher, and corn is 39.6 percent higher. After the GATT agreement on agricultural products is reached, with reduction of various countries' domestic production supports, further curtailment of export competition measures, improvement in market entry conditions, and environmental and hygienic standards, huge subsidies of various nations that lead to distorted prices in international agricultural product trade will be further rectified. Reform of the foreign trade policy of major agricultural product and trading nations, especially the United States, Japan, and the European Community, could cause a general rise in world agricultural product prices. The prices of such agricultural products as rice, sugar, corn, wheat, pork, and beef will more than double. In another respect, after developed countries eliminate some domestic agricultural production supports, because domestic production costs will increase and the volume will decrease, exports will decrease and imports will increase, thereby conceding some of the international market and the domestic market. With China's "reentry into GATT," discriminatory anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits encountered in cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports will be eliminated as demanded by GATT regulations. This is an excellent opportunity for China to expand it cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports and will help to further stabilize and develop the cereals, oils, and foodstuffs export market that we already have and continuously open new markets, increasing foreign exchange earned from exports and improving the ability to compete. 2. Numerous cereals, oils, and foodstuffs markets will suffer impact. China's agricultural businesses will implement the system of contracted household responsibility linked to output, a high degree of business diversification, a rather low level of productivity, and state investment in and subsidization of agriculture far short of developed countries. These characteristics have determined that China's agriculture is comparatively fragile and unable to endure the impact of liberalized trade in agricultural products. After "reentry into GATT," while being able to use tariff reductions and exemptions and elimination of nontariff barriers to increase cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports, China also must use the same conditions to permit the entry of foreign cereals, oils, and foodstuffs products. Despite the fact that China presently has some cereals, oils, and foodstuffs for which they have certain price advantages or other advantages on the international market, there also are a great many cereals, oils, and foodstuffs where they are clearly inferior in such respects as quality, variety, and designs and colors, as well as transportation conditions, production costs, packaging, and storage. Not only will it be difficult for these products to capture the international market, but their domestic market also will be impacted to various degrees. 3. State foreign trade companies specializing in cereals, oils, and foodstuffs import and export trade will be totally oriented to the market. After "reentering GATT," China first must trim tariffs and reduce nontariff restrictive measures. Not only is China's current average tariff higher than developed countries, it is also higher than developing countries. A large-scale lowering of tariffs cannot be avoided. In addition, some Chinese nontariff restrictive measures are contrary to GATT regulations and nontariff restrictive measures must be reduced or even eliminated. The licensing system especially must be gradually eliminated, and complicated administrative revision and approval procedures must be reduced. This means that the market will be further opened and enterprises will lose government protection. The legal monopolies and privileges that state foreign trade companies engaged in specialized cereals, oils, and foodstuffs import and export trade are granted will be limited or even eliminated. Faced with the challenge of competition and selection, they must seek their own survival and development. Such situations as "multiple external relations, forcing up prices and rushing to purchase, lowering prices and competing for sales, and killing each other off," currently present in cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports, will shortly become more serious. II. Initial Impact of "Reentry Into Gatt" on Various Major Types of Chinese Cereals, Oils, and Foodstuffs Import and Export Trade 1. Cereals. Generally speaking, in the initial stage "reentry into GATT" will not have too great an impact. But it could have a different impact on different varieties at different times. As regards exports, it will help rice, corn, soybeans, and some other small grains to further expand exports. As regards imports, if the developed countries, mainly the United States, trim their subsidies of export cereals or further lower the foreign exchange rate, the prices of imported cereals, especially wheat, will surely rise. If the rise of domestic grain prices is higher than import prices, it could stimulate excessive grain imports, impacting the domestic market. 2. Vegetable oil. In recent years, Chinese imports have been greater than exports and the scope of imports has been very great, seriously impacting the domestic market. After "reentry into GATT," imported oil with price, variety, and quality advantages will have an even greater impact on the domestic market. For China's traditional export products, such as tung oil, peanuts, and sesame, because they have a resource advantage and comparatively low domestic prices, "reentry into GATT" will help to expand exports and further open foreign markets. 3. Meats. This situation involves three issues: (1) permission to enter the market; (2) elimination of subsidies; and (3) health and quarantine standards. China is the world's largest meat and egg producing nation. Pork and beef are traditional Chinese bulk export commodities. Supplies are ample, prices are cheap, and the export potential is very great, but actual exports are limited, and they still have not penetrated the markets of such developed countries as the United States, Japan, Korea, and the European Community. The reason is that they are restricted by various countries' health and quarantine standards. In regard to chicken, in recent years the European Community has eliminated subsidies to the chicken industry and European Community countries one after another are turning to China to buy chicken, but exports are affected by excessive drug residue in chicken meat. China's leading export to the European Community, frozen rabbit meat, also had pesticide residue in the feed leading to a sudden decline in exports. GATT signatories could unify the health and quarantine standards stipulated for these commodities. After "reentry into GATT," linking up with international standards will help China's meat exports. 4. Canned goods. Canned goods are an important foreign exchange earning commodity for China. Western nations, especially the European Community, all have a growing demand for such Chinese canned goods as asparagus and mushrooms. But some Western countries have implemented nontariff barriers against China's canned goods exports. The domestic production price of galvanized tin used in canned goods packaging is high, largely relying on imports. After "reentry into GATT," GATT signatories must remove nontariff barriers against China, which will help to expand the volume of Chinese canned goods exports. 5. Sugar. International sugar production has increased very rapidly, but consumption growth has slowed. World sugar reserves have increased and sugar prices have fallen. A number of countries with lower sugar production costs than China have adopted high tariffs or quantitative restrictions toward imported sugar and have subsidized the price of domestically produced sugar to protect their own country's sugar market. After "reentry into GATT," if China does not adopt protective measures, it will seriously impact the domestic market. 6. Aquatic products. In 1992 China's total aquatic product output was 13 million tons, becoming the world's largest fishing nation. China's aquatic products have a certain competitiveness on the international market because of cheap prices. Because they lack special new varieties and profound processing technology to keep them alive and fresh, the added value of the products is low. 7. Fruits and vegetables. If the quality of China's fruit does not remarkably improve, after "reentry into GATT," fruit exports still will not sharply improve and high quality foreign fruits will constantly flow into China's coastal cities. China has ample vegetable resources and the prices are cheap. After "reentry into GATT," it will be helpful to expand exports to neighboring countries. 8. Alcoholic beverages. After "reentry into GATT," it will be helpful to the export of alcoholic beverages produced in China, but foreign alcoholic beverages will have an even greater impact on the domestic market. China has a single variety of beverages and the quality is not stable. It is very hard to compete with foreign beverages. After "reentry into GATT," foreign beverages could seriously impact the domestic market. III. Grasp Opportunities, Meet Challenges, and Accelerate the Development of China's Cereals, Oils, and Foodstuffs Import and Export Trade 1. Further accelerate the commercialization, grouping, and internationalization of cereals, oils, and foodstuffs import and export trade companies. The expansion of China's cereals, oils, and foodstuffs import and export trade is based on the formation and growth of multinational companies. At the same time, because much of international cereals, oils, and foodstuffs trade is large-scale primary product trade, wholesale markets, futures markets, and commodity exchanges occupy a major position in large-scale primary products and their trade. China must accelerate the development of high-quality markets---wholesale markets, futures markets, and commodity exchanges and related markets, and link up with world markets. 2. Fully utilize the advantage of China's agricultural resources and improve production, processing, and sales of traditional cereals, oils, and foodstuffs. We should strive to tap the demands of the international market and strive to expand the foreign market for traditional products most appropriate to the export products that China produces (such as medicinal foods). We should actively develop high production value agriculture, for example, by exploiting coastal and inland aquatic resources and expanding the export of seawater products; fully utilizing agricultural and pastoral region resources to develop livestock product exports; and concentrate on the vegetable and fruits requirements of neighboring countries to develop garden crops. In the future, cereals and oils trade should have imports and exports and in ordinary years cereals and oils import and export values should maintain an overall balance. Utilizing the low grain prices on the international market in recent years, we should appropriately import some to make up for grain and oil deficits that can be brought on by adjustments in the structure of the domestic market. At the same time, we should gradually establish a cereals, oils, and foodstuffs reserve system capable of adjusting the domestic market so that we will not have any regrets when international trade competition intensifies. 3. Diversify the cereals, oils, and foodstuffs export market; utilize the opportunities conferred by GATT and promptly exploit international markets and make an all out effort to expand exports. We should fully utilize the advantage of low labor costs and fully utilize favorable conditions conferred by being a signatory to GATT, speed up entry into signatory markets and turn around unreasonable market structures as much as possible to make for diversified and multilateral export product sales markets. At the same time, we should participate extensively in domestic market competition and further expand domestic markets. 4. Diversify means of competing. At the current stage, Chinese cereals, oils, and foodstuffs export products basically use price competition, that is, they compete for markets by commodity price concessions. Because international market competition is becoming ever more intense, non-price competition is currently the main means of competition on the international market. After "reentering GATT, China should take the use of nonprice competition seriously and gradually make thoroughly processed cereals, oils, and foodstuffs the main objective, while enhancing product advertising and improving product quality, including varieties, standards, and external design and packaging and strive "to succeed by quality." We should change our orientation from mainly price competition to mainly nonprice competition. 5. Avoid forcing down prices to compete for sales and reduce transshipment trade. China is a vast country and after "reentry into GATT," the same types of cereals, oils, and foodstuffs products will be exported by numerous companies and numerous ports. If all the companies and all the ports, to increase the foreign exchange earned from exports, adopt the method of forcing down prices to compete for foreign sales, it will become ever more intense. We must strengthen controls and insure that the "profits" do not run off. In the 1980s, one third or more of Chinese cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports were made through transshipment channels. According to international market price calculations, this made China lose 30 percent to 50 percent of the profits. "Reentry into GATT" will facilitate the development of direct trade. 6. Become proficient at using GATT provisions to enhance self-protection. We should increase investment in agriculture and expand supports to cereals, oils, and foodstuffs exports. GATT has a number of types of preferential treatment for developing countries. Various types of direct supports for agriculture by developing countries are permitted. But in name the supports are to increase agricultural productivity and improve farmers' livelihood, and it should not in name support earning foreign exchange from exports to avoid producing the suspicion of direct export subsidies. Becoming proficient in using some GATT preferential treatment regulations for developing countries can become an efficient instrument in China's developing cereals, oils, and foodstuffs import and export trade. In addition, for the easily impacted varieties where China does not have the ability to compete internationally, in accordance with GATT exceptional provisions, we can demand that the government give the necessary protection.
