These sources said that a committee chaired by Abu-Nizar has been formed and comprises eight members, including Fatah Central Committee member 'Abbas Zaki and Fatah Revolutionary Council members. These sources stated that many PLO leaders, cadres, and members will move to the temporary self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho in the next stage. They noted that this issue was recently discussed at a Fatah Central Committee meeting and that it was decided that the families of Palestinian fighters and civilians would enter Gaza and Jericho. The sources said that 'Arafat notified the Palestinian leadership that the national authority would establish schools, hospitals, and other vital utilities in the Jericho area because it is sparsely populated and lacks such services. This is a sign that there is an intention to let the families of most Palestinian fighters who will work in the police force enter Jericho.
