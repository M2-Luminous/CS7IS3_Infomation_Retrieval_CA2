The following is a summary of the interview: [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Four more legislators have quit the JPN. What is your opinion? Matsuoka: The JNP by nature is a political group formed by Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa, who has a strong sense of mission and people with differing political beliefs. It has been difficult to keep the JPN together. The JNP has played the role of coordinator between Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Komeito [Clean Government Party], and the SDPJ when they have discussed policies. Those legislators who have broken away from our party advocated that the JNP must forge an alliance with the SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and cut off its alliance with Shinseito and the Komeito. I believe it would have been better if they had remained in our party and played a pivotal role in realigning the established political parties instead of quitting our party. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Those breakaway legislators bitterly complained that Mr. Hosokawa and the JPN leadership were excessively dependent on Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary of the Komeito. What do you think? Matsuoka: Mr. Hosokawa had difficulty running the coalition government because it was formed by seven parties and one parliamentary group. Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura needed to take a low profile as coordinator of the coalition partners, but he played into the hands of the news media which criticized "Mr. Ichiro Ozawa as a villain." As a result, Mr. Hosokawa stepped down as prime minister. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] A majority of JNP members favor breaking up the unified parliamentary group "Kaishin." What do you think? Matsuoka: Even if the unified parliamentary group is dissolved, the SDPJ cannot return to the coalition government at the present stage. No decision has been made about the appointment of major posts in the parliamentary group. The parliamentary group is inconsequential. Our party cannot make any moves under present circumstances. Our party has no choice but to take a wait-and-see attitude. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] If the JNP asks the breakaway legislators and the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition, what sort of political tactics is your party going to employ? Matsuoka: I do not like the words political tactics, but what is important is purpose. As for the political tactics, the breakaway legislators and the SDPJ should have vigorously argued while remaining in the ruling coalition instead of complaining like defeatists. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The SDPJ is indicating that it would return to the ruling coalition on the premise that the Hata cabinet resigns en masse. What is your comment? Matsuoka: We intend to sincerely apologize the SDPJ for our impoliteness. An SDPJ leader has made ambivalent remarks that can be interpreted to mean either the SDPJ hopes for a dissolution of the House of Representatives or the SDPJ hopes for a general resignation of the Hata cabinet. The SDPJ leader, however, has proposed re- examining the framework of the coalition and his proposal is worthy of welcome. We are in contact with the SDPJ and we have a channel for the contact. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The JNP is strengthening its ties with the DSP. Matsuoka: The JNP and the DSP share almost the same political beliefs and policies. They are friendly toward each other, and they are in almost the same position. The two parties began their policy discussion from this week. I do not know whether the two parties will be merged into a new party. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] It has been decided that Masatoshi Miyama, Mr. Hosokawa's former secretary, will testify in the Diet. What is your opinion? Matsuoka: Directors of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives have decided to demand his testimony in the Diet. They have decided to make that demand after concluding that they can no longer delay the passage of the 1994 budget bill in the Diet. It is arrogant to use the parliamentary majority to force Mr. Miyama to testify in the Diet. They have set a bad precedent. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Mr. Hosokawa is expected to be unable to avoid testifying in the Diet. Matsuoka: Mr. Hosokawa took full responsibility by resigning as prime minister. Thanks to Mr. Hosokawa, the rule of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has collapsed and the coalition government has come into being. In retaliation, the LDP is waging a campaign aimed at crushing the JNP and Mr. Hosokawa.
