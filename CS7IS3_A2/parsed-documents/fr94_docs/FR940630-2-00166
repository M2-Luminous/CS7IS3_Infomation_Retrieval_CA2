After selection for funding but prior to award, each applicant must submit a certification from an Independent Public Accountant or the cognizant government auditor, stating that the financial management system employed by the applicant meets prescribed standards for fund control and accountability required by OMB Circular A&hyph;110 for Institutions of Higher Education and other Non-Profit Institutions, OMB Circular A&hyph;133 for other non-profit organizations, or 24 CFR part 85 for States and local governments, or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (for all other applicants). The information should include the name and telephone number of the independent auditor, cognizant Federal auditor, or other audit agency as applicable. (7) Demand/Response Delivery System. All awardees must operate within the structure of the demand/response system described in this section. They must coordinate their plans with, and operate under the direction of, each HUD Field Office within whose jurisdictions they are operating. When so directed by a Field Office, they will coordinate their activities instead through a lead TA provider or other organization designated by the Field Office. If selected as the lead TA provider in any Field Office jurisdiction, the awardee must coordinate the activities of other TA providers selected under this NOFA under the direction of the HUD Field Office. Joint activities by TA providers may be required. Under the demand/response system, TA providers will be required to: (a) Market the availability of their services to existing and potential clients. (b) Respond to requests for assistance from the HUD Field Office(s) with oversight of the geographic service area for which the technical assistance will be delivered. CHDOs, HOME PJs, CDBG and Supportive Housing grantees may request assistance from the TA provider directly, but such requests must be approved by the local HUD Field Office. (c) Advise grantees of their responsibility to provide economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons under new regulations to be issued in 24 CFR part 135 implementing section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. TA providers are encouraged to make program grantees and TA recipients aware of the existence of the new section 3 regulations and their responsibilities under these regulations. Since section 3 applies to many of the program areas for which TA services are being provided, TA providers should encourage TA recipients to facilitate the employment of, and award of contracts to, low- and very low-income persons. Section 3 applies to housing construction, housing rehabilitation and other public construction activities. The new section 3 regulations issued under 24 CFR part 135 are expected to be published in the Federal Register on or about June 30, 1994.
