FBIS4-28424 "dreas112_c_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 North Korea `False Charge' Alleged `False Charge' Alleged SK0806070494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0533 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806070494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Provokers Must Stop Acting Rashly" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese police raided the Kyoto Prefectural headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on June 6 on the false charge of violation of the "land act" and, at the same time, searched 27 places including houses of Chongnyon officials under the headquarters. A NODONG SINMUN analyst today condemns such surprise raid and search of Japanese police against the Chongnyon organization and officials as an unjustifiable, illegal fascist outrage and an act of political suppression. This is part of the hostile campaign for stifling the DPRK which the Japanese authorities have stepped up maliciously through collusion and tieup with the United States and the South Korean puppets, and a deliberate and premeditated criminal act to destroy the Chongnyon organization and block its patriotic activities, the news analyst says. Recalling that the Japanese authorities have launched into a heinous anti-Chongnyon campaign whenever the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and the South Korean puppets got hysteric, he goes on: The Japanese authorities have intensified crackdown on Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, motivated by their hostile policy towards the DPRK, joining the United States and the South Korean puppets in their clamor about "nuclear suspicion against the North" and crying for "sanctions". Nothing can justify the Japanese authorities' crackdown on Chongnyon, an authoritative and dignified organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK which enjoys unanimous support of the world people including broad sections of the Japanese. We will surely call the Japanese authorities to account for their criminal acts in intensifying crackdown on Chongnyon by taking advantage of the United States and South Korean puppets' moves to stifle the DPRK. Nobody can go scotfree after provoking Chongnyon, a dignified organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Koreans in Japan. The Japanese authorities must ponder over the consequences to be entailed by their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and stop it at once and apologize for all the criminal acts they have committed hitherto.
