The Food Agency says there is no need to worry about the pace of shipments of foreign rice, but traders say the agency is too optimistic. "It might be difficult to secure necessary amounts of U.S. and Chinese rice next month, so domestic and Thai rice will be used to make up for them," one rice trader said. The agency has said it plans to import 70 percent of total rice consumption for table use for the March-June period -- 20 percent each from Thailand, China and the U.S., and 10 percent from Australia. Japan's monthly rice consumption for table use is some 500,000 tons, meaning that the agency has to import 350,000 tons of rice a month. But Japan has imported only 200,000 tons so far for March supply, making it necessary to import 150,000 tons by the end of this month as it usually takes at least a month to place rice for sale on shelves after importation. "The pace of rice imports (from China and the U.S.) has been picking up since the second half of February, so there is no concern," a Food Agency official said. But rice traders said both the U.S. and China face problems exporting rice smoothly. "A ship must often wait a long time at a (Chinese) port for rice to be loaded, in part because they have no experience in exporting and importing rice," said an official at one rice importer. As for Californian rice, traders pointed to time-consuming sanitary inspections at U.S. ports. "It will be necessary to raise the portion of domestic and long- grain Thai rice which has been imported smoothly," said an official at Beikoku Data Bank, a rice market research agency.
