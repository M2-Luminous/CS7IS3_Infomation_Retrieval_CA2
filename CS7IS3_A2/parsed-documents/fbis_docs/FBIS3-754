Mr Botha, accompanied by senior African National Congress negotiator and Transitional Executive Council (TEC) member Mac Maharaj, told Mr Mangope he could not continue as head of the Bophuthatswana government. In a statement sent to SAPA early Sunday morning, Mr Botha said the SA Ambassador to the homeland, Prof Tjaart van der Walt, had as an interim measure been placed in charged of the administration of the territory. This would be until the SA Government and the TEC had agreed on "an appropriate form of government" and until elections had led to new government structures being established. Referring to the number of wounded and killed in the homeland this week and the looting which has taken place, Mr Botha said it was clear Mr Mangope was no longer in control. The situation was in danger of deteriorating into anarchy and the lives and property of South African citizens were threatened. "The time has now arrived to take steps to ensure law and order as well as the free and peaceful participation of the people of Bophuthatswana in the election process," he said. Accompanied by SA Defence Force Chief Gen George Meiring, Mr Maharaj and National Party and TEC representative S.S. van der Merwe, Mr Botha had in this light "personally informed President Mangope...that his presidency was no longer recognised by the SA Government and the TEC, and that in the circumstances he could not continue as head of the government of Bophuthatswana." SA and Bop security forces would continue to jointly maintain law and order, said Mr Botha. Bop civil servants, including those recently dismissed, should be assured their pensions, salaries and positions would not be detrimentally affected. The historic move to dismiss Mr Mangope follows an earlier call by the African National Congress for the TEC to replace the homeland leader with an interim SA Government/TEC Administration. It also follows on an appearance by the Bop leader on National Television on Saturday, during which he said he and his government were "undoubtedly" still in charge of the homeland.
