The United Arab Emirates was the largest crude supplier with shipments of 383.78 million barrels, up 4.1 percent. It was followed by Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Iran. Middle East nations accounted for 76.3 percent of Japan's total crude oil imports. Imports of fuel oil dropped 13.8 percent to 178.26 million barrels and exports of it grew 20.9 percent to 96.55 million barrels. Domestic sales of fuel oil slipped 0.8 percent to 1,420.60 million barrels, posting an annual decline for the first time in eight years, the ministry said. The downswing was attributed to sluggish demand for fuel oil C, reflecting lower demand for thermal power due to the cool summer and factory closures amid the economic slump. Production of fuel oil came to 1,360.53 million barrels, up 3.0 percent for the sixth straight yearly rise. The ministry said Japan's imports of crude oil in December fell 9.1 percent from a year before to 137.37 million barrels, marking the fifth successive month of year-on-year drops.
