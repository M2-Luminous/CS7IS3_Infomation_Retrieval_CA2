If UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali needs troops again soon for anywhere, for example Bosnia, then the defense minister will politely request that he look elsewhere. The enthusiasm in the Army for UN operations is at an absolute low. Just as the prestige of the United Nations itself is declining at a rapid rate. Things sometimes turn out strangely. It was these very UN operations which were to have given the reformed Belgian professional Army the opportunity to demonstrate its usefulness. It now appears that these UN activities are not as innocent as they seem and that the world is more gruesome, cruel, and dangerous than people liked to think at one time. Therefore, there will be no new UN adventures, at least not in the near future, in order to have some time to recover. That is wise and logical. Also because a de facto full military base remains in Kenya, should the situation in Burundi also completely derail. In the meantime, the costs are mounting up. Soon we will be talking about 1 billion [Belgian francs] or more. Those calling for a permanent and strong military presence in Central Africa would do well to make these financial calculations as well. Can the Belgian Government, very short of money, find this amount every year? The enormous evacuation operation from Rwanda was a success, not only due to the deployment of the paratroopers, but also thanks to many other soldiers. The Army worked and achieved very respectable results. That is not as self-evident as it appears. Many people, including MP's, believe that in order to solve matters quickly it is enough to call out the Army, drastically reduced in size and continually subjected to rounds of cuts. It is not that simple and that is why the Rwandan operation was an outstanding performance. The military also had enough sense to not deal with the media as troublesome insects so that the Rwandan operation received extensive attention. Attention which the Army can well use in these uncertain times. Because with the abolition of obligatory national service, with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, armed forces, even on a small scale, are no longer really necessary in the eyes of many people, including MP's. Moreover, defense always emerges as an opportunity to save money while the same people find it simply normal that the army is able to intervene in unexpected crisis situations as a perfectly oiled and trained machine. Something is wrong here. Of course, money can be saved in the defense budget. It is rather obvious that the times of the Cold War are behind us. But even the little army which remains demands some attention if it is to maintain a minimum of usefulness. The soldiers who went to Rwanda did not go with the best equipment, modern facilities, and in optimum condition. In some cases, it was about making do. And that brings risks. A small, mobile, and deployable professional army is affordable but not completely free of charge. Transport, effective weaponry, appropriate personal equipment, logistics, modern radio equipment, and training are required. The operation in Rwanda once again made it clear what the considerably reduced army needs most to be able to do what is asked of it. And that is not the very latest fighter aircraft.
