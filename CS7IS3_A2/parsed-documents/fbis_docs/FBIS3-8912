Their presence underscores the determination of United Nations commander Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose to lift the nine-month siege. Surrounded by Serb artillery and mortars, the 20,000 inhabitants have been surviving on airdropped food in appalling conditions. The last convoy to reach Maglaj was in October. UN relief officials who visited the area in January reported "larders bare and children nothing more than skin and bones." Lt. Gen. Rose, who has spent much of his Army career with the SAS, plans to open the enclave to aid convoys preferably with Serb consent but using a more muscular approach if necessary. With most of Bosnia quiet under two cease-fires, the Serbs are being pressured by the international community -- including their traditional ally Russia -- to halt attacks on the town. Lt. Gen. Rose dropped several teams of armed British soldiers into the Muslim enclave earlier this week to assess the situation. The Ministry of Defence in London maintained its usual "no comment" on special forces operations. However, trained to operate in small self-sufficient patrol teams of as few as four men, the SAS are the ideal reconnaissance troops to feed back information on frontline positions, weapons and conditions in the area. They will report back directly to the headquarters of Lt. Gen. Rose, who undoubtedly made the request for their assistance. Although the use of SAS-type units in a UN peacekeeping operation is unusual it is not unique. American Delta Force troops were sent to Somalia last year in an abortive attempt to capture the warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid.
