This was said by Genadz Karpenka, candidate for the post of the first Belarusian president, at a news conference held on 19 April. Among the primary problems Karpenka singled out that will have to be resolved if he were to be elected were housing construction, the transformation of plants and factories into joint-stock enterprises, and the development of economic ties with all the CIS states including our close neighbors. For the first time ever, the candidate presented his viewpoint on the agricultural sector. He spoke skeptically about the treaty on unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. In his opinion, the current quite difficult situation should be resolved by economic measures, rather than by joining the ruble zone. Karpenka added that the main task is to make plants work, while money is only a by-product.
