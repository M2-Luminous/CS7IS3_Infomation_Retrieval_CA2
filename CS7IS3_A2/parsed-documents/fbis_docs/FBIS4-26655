The draft law is to specify the position and responsibilities of the People's Bank as the central bank, and uphold the authority of monetary policies, Zhou Chenggui told a press conference on the upcoming Eighth Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee. The new law will also be "necessary for supervision and control over China's financial industry, and the establishment of the macro adjustment system with the central bank as the core," he said. In the eight-day meeting ending July 5, the draft arbitration law and the draft auditing law will also be submitted to the legislators for review. The formulation of the arbitration law aims at improving China's arbitration system, better solving economic disputes and maintaining social economic order, Zhou claimed. "It will help to develop China's socialist market economy, and promote international economic and trade exchanges and cooperation," he said. The legislature will continue its review of the draft securities law, which has already been deliberated in two sessions. Zhou disclosed that there are some "major changes" to the previous version of the draft law this time, based on the reviews by the lawmakers and opinions of people from all walks of life. He said the NPC Standing Committee session will also deliberate the Draft Labor Law, the Draft Urban Real Estate Law and the Draft Regulation on Punishing Copyright Violators. These were submitted to the legislature in the previous two sessions. Also included on the agenda are the examination of the 1993 final state accounts, a review of the State Council reports on China's forestry industry and NPC special committees' reports on the implementation of the statistics law and the teachers law.
