The appeal for jihad, or holy war, was made in a statement distributed after prayers marking Saturday's [21 May] feast of 'Id al-Adha in the southern Egyptian provinces of Bani Suwayf, al-Minya and Asyut. A high police presence in Asyut meant the statement was not as widely distributed. "You young people of Islam, what are you waiting for to join the march of the jihad, which will never cease," the leaflet asked. "The blood (of Islamists) is still flowing in prisons," it added referring to the death of the "martyr" 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, an Islamic defence lawyer who died in police custody. Initial autopsy reports said he had died from being tortured, but a later statement from the Interior Ministry said he had suffered an asthma attack. The al-Jama'ah has waged a two-year campaign to overthrow the government in which nearly 400 people have been killed. The al-Jama'ah also denounced the Israel-PLO autonomy accord which launched Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. In another statement it said the accord signed on May 4 in Cairo aimed to "wipe out the Islamic movement and give up the Al-Aqsa Mosque" in Jerusalem, one of the holiest sites in Islam. The Muslim Brotherhood, tolerated as a religious organisation, also denounced the self-rule deal accusing PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat of giving in while praising the radical Hamas movement, saying "as long as people fight back, there is hope."
