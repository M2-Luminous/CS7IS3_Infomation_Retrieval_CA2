"I am definitely warning the Salvadoran people because we cannot trust the left-wing," asserted the presidential candidate. At the same time, Escobar Garcia also denounced the left-wing's pressures on the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], both internally and externally. He mentioned that the Electoral Code was reformed because of those left-wing pressures to allow them to enter Departmental and Municipal Electoral Boards in a proportion that does not correspond to them. Furthermore, because of those same left-wing pressures, other provisions and mechanisms of the Electoral Code have been revised. According to the candidate, that is a form of blocking and disparaging the electoral process "with easily discernible intentions." According to the politician, the TSE "prefers to please the leftists in an effort to maintain the prestige of the Salvadoran electoral process." He advised, however, that as the left-wing begins to feel defeated and realizes it has no support, it will attack the electoral system for any reason, real or imagined. He added that the pressures "are fabricated here and bolstered abroad. Later, the conditions, specially from the United States and Europe, come to El Salvador." He regretted this fact, and reiterated that the left-wing immediately goes abroad to complain to the U.S. Government or the Europeans about any little thing that could be solved here. In this regard, Escobar Garcia asked the left-wing to show "more loyalty for the electoral process, for democracy, and for the Salvadoran people. This is no way to collaborate with democracy, but it is a way to destroy it," he said. In spite of everything, he continued, "the people must not be skeptical or pessimistic because the Salvadoran right-wing clearly understands the FMLN's strategy." Furthermore, he asserted that "the PCN is willing to defend the system and fight within the law so our rights and those of the citizens are guaranteed." Colonel Escobar Garcia stated this shortly after receiving the general secretariat of the PCN from Hernan Contreras, whom he said had done "an excellent job." He used the same general terms to describe the work of the TSE, whose work has been recognized nationally and abroad, and also "by Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, chief of ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador] himself." He also said other organizations have claimed that the TSE has a very reliable electoral process, something which other countries that claim their democratic system is more advanced wished they had.
