Presiding judge Salah al-Fahd said the court decided to recall the chief prosecution witness, Kuwaiti intelligence officer 'Abd-'al Samad al-Shatti, at a session set for February 5. Al-Shatti would be called on to "clarify the roles of the accused," al-Fahd said. The verdict in the trial, which opened on June 5, was originally due to be issued on Saturday, having already been postponed from the end of October. In June prosecutor general Badr Mas'ad demanded the death penalty for all 11 Iraqis and one of the Kuwaitis, and 10-year prison terms for the other two Kuwaitis. Of the 14 defendants only two Iraqis -- Ra'd 'Abd-al-Amir al-Asadi and Wali 'Abd-al Hadi al-Ghazali -- have acknowledged links with the Iraqi intelligence service. Another defendant confessed to having transported explosives into Kuwaiti territory, but said he did not know about any plot to assassinate Bush. All the rest denied any involvement in the plot or links with Iraq. [passage omitted]
