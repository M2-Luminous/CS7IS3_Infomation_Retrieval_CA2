(c) Any such determination shall be based on the sales of cut flowers and greens by the person or facility during the most recently-completed calendar year, except that in the case of a new business or other operation for which complete data on sales during all or part of the most recently-completed calendar year are not available to the Council, the determination may be made using an alternative time period or other alternative procedures as the Council may find appropriate. In making such determinations, the Council is authorized to make attributions in accordance with the following rules and for the purpose of determining the annual sales volume of a person or a separate facility of a person, sales attributable to a person shall include: (1) In the case of an individual, sales attributable to the spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents of the person; (2) In the case of a partnership or member of a partnership, sales attributable to the partnership and other partners of the partnership; (3) In the case of an individual or a partnership, sales attributable to any corporation or other entity in which the individual or partnership owns more than 50 percent of the stock or (if the entity is not a corporation) that the individual or partnership controls; and (4) In the case of a corporation, sales attributable to any corporate subsidiary or other corporation or entity in which the corporation owns more than 50 percent of the stock or (if the entity is not a corporation) that the corporation controls. (d) The Council is also authorized to attribute any stock ownership interest as may be required to carry out this subpart. In doing so a stock ownership interest in the entity that is owned by the spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, or partners of an individual, or by a partnership in which a person is a partner, or by a corporation more than 50 percent of the stock of which is owned by a person, shall be treated as owned by the individual or person. (e) For the purpose of this subpart, the Council, with the approval of the Secretary, may require a person who sells cut flowers and greens to retailers to submit reports to the Council on annual sales by the person and on stock ownership.

If the Secretary finds that this subpart, or any provision of this subpart, obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the policy of the Act, the Secretary shall terminate or suspend the operation of this subpart or the provision of this subpart under such terms as the Secretary determines are appropriate.
