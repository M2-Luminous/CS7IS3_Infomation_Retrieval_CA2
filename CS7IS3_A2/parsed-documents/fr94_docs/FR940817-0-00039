FR940817-0-00039 FR940817-0-00015 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 285 [I.D. 081194E] Atlantic Tuna Fisheries; Bluefin Tuna AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure of the General category fishery. SUMMARY: NMFS has determined that the 1994 General category quota, minus a 65 metric tons (mt) set aside for a late season fishery beginning September 15th, will be taken by August 14, 1994. Therefore, the General category fishery will be closed effective at 0001 hours on Monday, August 15, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this fishery while providing an opportunity for areas that have not yet had an ample opportunity to harvest a fair share of the quota beginning September 15, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0001 hours on August 15, 1994, through September 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Kelly, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347, or Raymond E. Baglin, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9140. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations implemented under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 et seq .) governing the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found at 50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas recommended U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories. Implementing regulations for the Atlantic Tuna Fisheries at 50 CFR 285.22(a) provide for an annual quota of 531 mt of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the General category. Of this amount, 65 mt are set aside for a late season fishery beginning September 15. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, is required under ยง285.20(b)(1) to monitor the catch and landing statistics and, on the basis of these statistics, to project a date when the catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna will equal the annual quota minus 65 mt, and to publish a Federal Register document stating that fishing for, retaining, possessing, or landing Atlantic bluefin tuna under the early-season quota must cease on that date at a specified hour, and not recommence until September 15th, whereupon a quota equal to the difference between the annual quota and the estimated catch prior to September 15th will become available. The General category has taken approximately 364 mt of its 531 mt quota as of August 10, 1994. While NMFS had calculated an average catch in August of 12 mt per day, industry contacts have informed NMFS that catch per day has increased to 17 mt per day or more. Atlantic bluefin tuna are still abundant off of Maine and Massachusetts, the primary commercial fishing grounds, and have not migrated offshore and further south. Effort by General category vessels remains high. Based on the landing reports, it is projected that the quota of Atlantic bluefin tuna allocated for the General category, minus a 65 mt set aside amount for the late season fishery will be reached by August 14, 1994. Fishing for, retention of, possessing, or landing large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna by vessels in the General category must cease by 0001 hours August 15, 1994. The intent of this action is to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this fishery while helping continue traditional late summer and early fall fisheries and providing a fishing opportunity in areas that have not yet had an ample opportunity to harvest a fair share of the quota. Beginning September 15, 1994, in areas to be described and under conditions to be specified in a future document to be filed with the Office of the Federal Register, vessels permitted in the General category may resume fishing for Atlantic bluefin tuna at a catch rate of one large medium or giant bluefin tuna per day per vessel, until the set aside allocation has been taken. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 285.20(b) and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq . Dated: August 11, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
