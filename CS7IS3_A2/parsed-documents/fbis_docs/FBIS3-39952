Excluded from the last round in this very tough election campaign without even having been able to size up their adversary. [Pact for Italy leader] Mariotto Segni is paying a higher price than some. His list, the Pact for Italy, is absent from several electoral constituencies. There are a few problems (fewer than before) for [Radical leader] Marco Pannella, and a few difficulties (more than expected) for the Democratic Alliance, the Greens, and Rete. It is the fault, so to speak, of the new electoral law, of its least well-known rule, which requires for the presentation of each list the signatures of no less than 4,000 citizens (and no more than 4,500) for each of the 26 proportional constituencies into which Italy is divided. And of 500 signatures to support the candidates in the single-candidate constituencies. In this election, however, these figures have been reduced by decree to half, since it is taking place early. This was not the case before. All the parties represented in parliament by at least one deputy were exempted from having to gather signatures. Now no such allowances apply to anyone. As expected, this penalizes most the less well-structured groups with the least well-established support throughout Italy. There have been no problems for the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], the League, or the National Alliance. Forza Italia (which was able to count on the League in the North and on the organized strength of many faction leaders of the former four-party alliance in the South) found things harder than expected. Be that as it may, there has been no confirmation (or denial) of any difficulties from its headquarters at Arcore. However, there was confirmation from Segni's headquarters on largo del Nazareno: The Pact's list -- which is separate from that of Martinazzoli's Popular Party -- will definitely not be presented in Basilicata, Abruzzi, Trentino, and Lombardy 3. There are also fears for the future of the Pact in the Lazio 2, Piedmont, and Veneto constituencies. So Segni, who holds the record for gathering signatures (he made his involvement conditional on gathering a million signatures in support of his policy line) is suffering the shame of seeing his group excluded from many cities in both the North and the South of the country, as a result of his movement's still weak organization. The Democratic Alliance has also emerged battered from the chase for signatures. The numbers achieved mean that Adornato and Bordon are being forced to relinquish their candidacies in Abruzzo, Basilicata, and in Lombardy 2 and Veneto 2. There are major anxieties about the findings of the local courts of appeal in Friuli and Marches. Lucania has treated the Greens badly, too. They are bowing out of Lombardy 3 and Lazio 2. Rete is having to leave Friuli and Veneto 2. However, Marco Pannella's list was again able to benefit from his long experience of organizing referendums. The Radicals managed to limit the damage, though Pannella's list was not successful in Basilicata and Marches. The figures for Trentino and Umbria have still to be confirmed. It was Pannella who sounded the warning. Beware, he said: we need thousands of signatures to back our lists on the electoral registers. People do not realize this, he shouted; the press and television stations are saying nothing about it. Suddenly all the minor groupings -- which have been busy for weeks recruiting, shifting, or turning down candidates -- realized that he was right. Only last Thursday [17 February] (the Pact finalized its lists late Friday morning) did they turn their attention to signatures. The law requires that the gathering of signatures follow the choice of candidates; that the signatories all be residents of the constituencies in which the candidates are standing; and, moreover, that each signature be accompanied by an electoral certificate. In some cases, that really proved too much.
