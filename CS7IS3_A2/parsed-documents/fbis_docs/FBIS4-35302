He will convey a message from Lieutenant General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, to his brother President Husni Mubarak about relations between the two brotherly countries and Yemeni developments. Basindwah will also lead our country's delegation to meetings of foreign ministers of the Nonaligned Movement, set to convene in Cairo from 30 May to 4 June. Before leaving Sanaa, the foreign minister told SABA' he will take the opportunity of his presence in the Egyptian capital and his attendance at the nonaligned conference to convey a true picture of what is going on in Yemen to as many ministers as possible. He will make the point that no one is out to force unity on others, because unity has been in place for four years. It must be made clear to the world that there is an attempt to force secession on the country and that some quarters try to misrepresent the situation. The foreign minister hoped the nonaligned conference will produce beneficial decisions for the peoples of the movement. The Yemeni delegation to the conference includes the under secretary for political affairs at the Foreign Ministry, and other ministry officials.
