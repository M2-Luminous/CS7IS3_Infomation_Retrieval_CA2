FR=Pump flow rate (L/min) MFA=Microscope count field area (mm2). This is 0.00785 mm2 for a Walton-Beckett Graticule. T=Sample collection time (min) 1,000=Conversion of L to cc Note: The collection area of a filter is seldom equal to 385 mm2. It is appropriate for laboratories to routinely monitor the exact diameter using an inside micrometer. The collection area is calculated according to the formula: Area= p (d/2)2 7.2. Short-cut Calculation Since a given analyst always has the same interpupillary distance, the number of fields per filter for a particular analyst will remain constant for a given size filter. The field size for that analyst is constant (i.e. the analyst is using an assigned microscope and is not changing the reticle). For example, if the exposed area of the filter is always 385 mm2 and the size of the field is always 0.00785 mm2, the number of fields per filter will always be 49,000. In addition it is necessary to convert liters of air to cc. These three constants can then be combined such that ECA/(1,000 X MFA)=49. The previous equation simplifies to: E:GRAPHICSER10AU94.001 7.3. Recount Calculations As mentioned in step 13 of Section 6.6.2., a ``blind recount'' of 10% of the slides is performed. In all cases, differences will be observed between the first and second counts of the same filter wedge. Most of these differences will be due to chance alone, that is, due to the random variability (precision) of the count method. Statistical recount criteria enables one to decide whether observed differences can be explained due to chance alone or are probably due to systematic differences between analysts, microscopes, or other biasing factors. The following recount criterion is for a pair of counts that estimate AC in fibers/cc. The criterion is given at the type-I error level. That is, there is 5% maximum risk that we will reject a pair of counts for the reason that one might be biased, when the large observed difference is really due to chance. Reject a pair of counts if: E:GRAPHICSER10AU94.002 Where: AC1=lower estimated airborne fiber concentration AC2=higher estimated airborne fiber concentration ACavg=average of the two concentration estimates CV FB =CV for the average of the two concentration estimates If a pair of counts are rejected by this criterion then, recount the rest of the filters in the submitted set. Apply the test and reject any other pairs failing the test. Rejection shall include a memo to the industrial hygienist stating that the sample failed a statistical test for homogeneity and the true air concentration may be significantly different than the reported value. 7.4. Reporting Results Report results to the industrial hygienist as fibers/cc. Use two significant figures. If multiple analyses are performed on a sample, an average of the results is to be reported unless any of the results can be rejected for cause. 8. References
