After the meeting Grachev told journalists that he intends to file a similar request to the opposing side in the conflict in the near future. He expressed the hope that it might become an efficient step in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. Grachev also said that at the meeting with Guliyev the two sides agreed in principle on the problem of a missile attack warning station in Gabala.
