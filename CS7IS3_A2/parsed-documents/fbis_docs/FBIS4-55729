The road to his country from Greece tells the story. It is a super-highway built as the main opening to the Aegean by Tito's Yugoslavia. Today, you have the road to yourself. Since Greece imposed its unilateral embargo against the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" over its claim to use the name of Macedonia, the fledgling state has been cut off from Thessaloniki, the main port for its trade. As I approached the Macedonian border the eerie silence was shattered by rifle shots. Could this be it, I wondered -- the start of the next widely-predicted Balkan war in which the Macedonian state's predatory neighbours, Albania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece, and even Nato itself, are likely to become embroiled? In the event it turned out to be a Macedonian border guard whiling away the time by using a metal advertisement as target practice. Apart from that, the only sound on a sunny afternoon was the swishing of the wings of house martins which had built their nests in the eaves of the huge Customs shed. In the two hours I waited for transport at the border only one vehicle, a Danish refrigerated truck, appeared. Yet, as President Gligorov pointed out in an interview in his Skopje office, this is one of the European Union's [EU] borders. Greece is a member of the EU, and in the single market uniform rules are supposed to apply at all the EU's borders. He is a quietly spoken grey-haired man in a brown suit. The large new blood-red flag behind him with its gold Sun of Vergina, which is such a red rag to Greece, seems inappropriately flamboyant for such an apparently unassuming man. Yet Gligorov's voice rises in passion as he outlines the desperate risks his country now faces. Much of his anger is reserved for the EU, which he believes has yet another potentially disastrous failure in the former Yugoslavia on its hands. From his point of view it is all the more galling because Greece is an EU member, and should therefore be held accountable for its action by the other members, or suffer the consequences. When Greece unilaterally imposed a blockade on Macedonia on 14 February following U.S. recognition of the state, an outraged European Commission took Athens to the European Court. Since then, nothing has happened. Gligorov said: "This is the first major infringement of the Maastricht treaty: the border between Macedonia and Greece is not only a national border but a border with the European Union. If this precedent is tolerated, it will have consequences for the future of the Union." But legal action alone is not enough he says. "More efficient measures could be taken to force Greece to lift the embargo. The EU has the means and mechanisms. Since it allocates a large amount of funds to support Greece it would be logical to expect it to withdraw some of those funds." Neither is he satisfied with the European Court's handling of the case. The reason for the delay, he believes, is that the court is waiting for the end of the Greek presidency of the EU on 30 June before making a pronouncement, so as to avoid censuring an EU country while it holds the presidency. It is normal for legal processes to take a long time, I suggested. "True," he replied. "But we were first told by the EU that they expected a concrete decision in two to three weeks. It has now been three months. If by the end of June a temporary decision is reached on lifting the embargo then we will be all right. However, if the court then decides to undertake a full legal process it could take two years or more. "Then if the embargo caused the destabilisation of this region, what use would it be to us if we were to receive compensation or some other help later on?" He said that he had been told informally that the court would make its position known soon after the end of June. "But if the court process is prolonged we will have a situation in which the EW can wash its hands and say it did all it could in this matter." With industries being forced to close and living standards plummetting, the burden which ordinary people have to bear is heavy, he said. "There is a great danger of a rise in social tension, and the continuation of the present situation with Greece could feed the appetites of our other neighbours," he added. "This situation does not contribute to the stability and peace of the region." The row with Greece is over four points: the name Macedonia, which Greece claims as its own; the flag with the Sun of Vergina, the emblem of Philip of Macedonia, Alexander the Great's father; the Macedonian constitution, which Greece says betrays expansionist aims; and what Greece considers to be anti-Greek propaganda. Mediation efforts by Cyrus Vance for the UN, and by the US special envoy, Matthew Nimetz, have so far got nowhere. Gligorov said: "We are convinced that no settlement can be reached unless there is a willingness by both sides to make compromises. I believe the embargo cannot be linked with this process, and should be lifted immediately. Without the lifting of the embargo we will not sign any settlement." If there is no settlement, one unexpected result of the Greek embargo could be the construction of a combined east-west rail and road corridor linking Albania to Turkey, and traversing Macedonia and Bulgaria. Paradoxically, the new project would isolate Greece. The so-called "east-west corridor" has been placed at the top of the European agenda for new communications since Greece declared its embargo. Then there are the international sanctions against Serbia, with whom Macedonia conducted 57 per cent of its trade. The Sanctions Committee of the UN visited Skopje to assess the damages of the previous two years and came up with the figure of over $3 billion. On top of this has come the Greek embargo. "So far we have succeeded in maintaining our peace and stability. But, and I say this with great regret, despite all the sympathy and the moral support we have been getting from the EU, we have received no substantial financial support which would enable us to be more calm until the situation improves." And how much had his country received from the EU since the current Greek embargo began? "Nothing," he replied. It was the only word he uttered in English.
