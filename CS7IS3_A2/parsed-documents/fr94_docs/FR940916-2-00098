FR940916-2-00098 FR940916-2-00080 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;266 and 50&hyph;301] Wisconsin Electric Power Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;24 and DPR&hyph;27, issued to Wisconsin Electric Power Company (the licensee), for operation of Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification (TS) Section 15.4.2, ``In-Service Inspection of Safety Class Components,'' by incorporating the use of acceptance criteria to allow sleeved tubes with certain upper sleeve parent tube indications to remain in service as described in Westinghouse Electric Corporation's report, WCAP&hyph;14157, ``Technical Evaluation of Hybrid Expansion Joint (HEJ) Sleeved Tubes With Indications Within the Upper Joint Zone.'' The basis for TS Section 15.4.2 would also be revised to support the above changes. WCAP&hyph;14157 documents the technical justification and outlines the particular aspects of proposed criteria to support the continued safe operation of sleeved tubes with circumferential indications of up to 360 ○ in the HEJ hardroll lower transition region of HEJ sleeved tubes. The criteria limit the end of cycle (EOC) crack angles existing within the lower transition to 224 ○, as measured using a motorized rotating pancake coil (MRPC) probe. The criteria include an allowance for postulated steam line break primary-to-secondary leakage for each sleeved tube which is permitted to remain in operation due to application of the criteria. The proposed criteria also redefine the portion of the parent tube considered to be part of the pressure boundary. The portion of the parent tube below the bottom of the HEJ hardroll lower transition would no longer be considered to be within the scope of the primary pressure boundary. The criteria would be implemented in concert with an operational leakage limit of 150 gallons per day and enhanced inspection criteria designed to quantify the size and location of potential crack-like indications. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. By October 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714, which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Joseph P. Mann Library, 1516 Sixteenth Street, Two Rivers, Wisconsin 54241. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition, and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendments under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
