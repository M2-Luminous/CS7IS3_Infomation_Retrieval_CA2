At the beginning of a Bundestag debate on the latest spring report by the economic research institutes on Thursday [28 April], the finance minister rejected, however, the institutes' demand for a real easing of the tax burden on the companies to support economic growth. Such pre-financing models are out of the question, the finance minister said. There will not be any tax reductions "on tick." However, the corporate tax reform and the easing of the burden on families must not be postponed, Waigel announced. This will be financed by the reduction of possibilities for tax write-offs. Pointing to the latest discussions of the industrial countries in Washington, the deliberations of the East Europe Bank in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the German-British summit, Waigel stressed that it is internationally recognized that Germany, like Japan, has achieved the greatest success in reducing the structural deficits. Thus, the FRG will also fulfill the criteria for entering the third stage of the European Monetary Union with a common currency in time. Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag group, on the other hand, stated that the economic engine is "still just crawling ahead." The structural problems of the country have not changed. The report confirms the "chancellor's failure" in shaping the economy and in reducing the high unemployment. The growth for all of Germany of 1.5 percent, which the institutes mentioned, is a swallow, but one swallow does not make a spring. Klose called for a supplementary tax that spares the lower income groups, as well as for renouncing the solidarity surcharge for all people eligible to pay tax.
