FR941212-0-00106 FR941212-0-00019 (i) Notification to claimant of action on claim. (1) The filing of an administrative claim and its denial are prerequisite to filing suit. Any suit must be filed not later than 6 months after notification by certified or registered mail of the denial of the administrative claim. Failure of a settlement authority to take final action on a properly filed claim within 6 months may be treated by the claimant as a final denial for the purposes of filing suit. If the claimant has provided insufficient documentation to permit evaluation of the claim, written notice should be given to this effect. Since administrative settlements are a voluntary process, the preferred method of negotiating is to attempt to exchange information on an open basis. (2) Upon final denial of a claim, or upon rejection by claimant of a partial allowance, if further efforts to reach a settlement are not considered feasible (§536.21(b)(1)), the settlement authority will inform the claimant of the action on his or her claim by certified or registered mail. Notification will be made as set forth in §536.37(b). A copy of this notification will be furnished to Litigation Division, OTJAG, and the Commander, USARCS. In all medical malpractice cases, a copy will be furnished to the Consultation Case Review Branch (CCRB), Office of the Surgeon Command and the SJA, Health Services Command. (3) If a claim has been presented to the DA and, also, to other Federal agencies, without any notification to the DA of this fact, final action taken by the DA prior to that of any other agency is conclusive on a claim presented to other agencies unless another agency decides to take further action to settle the claim. Such agency may treat the matter as a reconsideration under 28 CFR 14.9(b) unless suit has been filed. (See §536.82.) The foregoing applies likewise to Army claims in which another Federal Agency has taken final action. (4) If, after final denial by another agency, a claim is filed with the Army, the new submission will not toll the 6 months limitation for filing suit unless the DA treats the second submission as a request for reconsideration under §536.82. (5) In those cases where claimants exercise their option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) and file suit after six months but before final agency action, a formal denial notice will be sent to the claimant promptly upon notification of the suit unless the Assistant United States Attorney responsible for litigation of the suit expressly requests that such action not be taken. §536.78 Payment of claims. (a) Awards of $2,500 or less. Awards of $2,500 or less are paid from the claims appropriation. For procedures, see §§536.32 through 536.35. An explanation of various claims appropriations to be used is in §536.34. (b) Awards in excess of $2,500. Payment of awards in excess of $2,500 will be accomplished by forwarding the documents listed in §536.35(b) to the Claims Division, GAO, 441 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20548. When an award is in excess of $25,000, evidence that the award has been approved by the Attorney General or designee is also required. (For procedures, see §§536.32 through 536.35.) (c) Attorney as payee. If a claimant is represented by an attorney, both the claimant and the attorney will be designated as ``payees'' on the voucher (SF 1145) and the check will be delivered to the attorney whose address appears on the voucher. (d) Broker as payee. If the settlement requires the purchase of an annuity and establishment of a reversionary trust, the broker may be named as payee and required to dispose of the amount paid as set forth in the settlement agreement. (e) Attorneys fees. Attorneys' fees are limited by 28 U.S.C. 2678 to not more than 20 percent of any award, compromise, or settlement. §536.79 Acceptance of award. The acceptance by the claimant of an award, compromise, or settlement made pursuant to this subpart will be final and conclusive for all purposes and will constitute a complete release of any claim against the United States and against the military or civilian personnel of the DA, or civilian employees of the DOD whose act or omission gave rise to the claim by reasons of the same subject matter. (See §536.32 on preparing a settlement agreement.) §536.80 Delegation of authority. (a) Settlement authority. (1) Subject to the approval of the Attorney General for payments in excess of $200,000 in a single claim or where the total value of all claims and potential claims arising out of a single incident exceeds $200,000 or as otherwise required (see §536.81), the following are delegated authority to settle (i.e. pay in full, pay in part or deny) and make final offers on claims under this subpart: (i) TJAG. (ii) TAJAG. (iii) The Commander, USARCS or designees. (2) Unless the Commander, USARCS alters the delegation, heads of area claims offices or their designated claims Judge Advocates/claims attorneys are delegated authority to approve and pay in full or in part, to disapprove, and to make final offers on claims presented for $25,000 or less. These offices are also authorized to approve and pay, regardless of the amount claimed, an agreed award of $25,000 or less, provided that the total value of all claims and potential claims arising out of a single incident does not exceed $50,000. (3) Notice of disapproval or final offer issued by an authority listed in paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section will be in accordance with §§536.5(f) and 536.37 and must be accompanied by an explanation that the claimant may submit a written request for reconsideration (§536.82), in lieu of filing suit, to the Commander, USARCS (through the office issuing the disapproval or final offer) provided that the request is received prior to the expiration of the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Once received, the claimant will be advised in writing that the request will suspend the option to bring suit under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) for 6 months from the date the request was received. (4) Heads of claims processing offices with approval authority are delegated authority to approve and pay, in full or in part, claims presented for $5,000 or less and to compromise and pay, regardless of the amount claimed, an agreed award of $5,000 or less, provided that the total value of all claims and potential claims arising out of a single incident does not exceed $25,000 and that the claimant agrees to accept the award in full satisfaction of the claim. (b) Office code. Authority delegated by this paragraph will not be exercised unless the claims settlement or approval authority has been assigned an office code. §536.81 Consultation with the Department of Justice. (a) Consultation with the Department of Justice is required when, in the opinion of the Federal agency_ (1) A new precedent or a new point of law is involved; (2) A question of policy is or may be involved; (3) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or contribution from a third party, and the agency is unable to adjust the third party claim; (4) The total amount to be paid in all claims or potential claims arising out of the same transaction will or may exceed $200,000; (5) For any reason, the compromise of a particular claim, as a practical matter, will control the disposition of actual or potential claims arising out of a single incident in which the amount to be paid may exceed $25,000 to $200,000; or (6) Where the United States, an employee, agent, or cost-plus contractor is involved in litigation based on a claim arising out of the same transaction.
