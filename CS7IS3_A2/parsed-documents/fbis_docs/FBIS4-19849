In an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, Naumann said the conceptual guidelines for the future of the armed forces are also supported by the military leadership. Those who bury the concept ignore the facts: With the armed forces' present budget of 47.5 billion German marks, 370,000 men cannot be financed. "Those who claim the contrary lose their credibility," Naumann said. According to the key features that have become known so far, the Bundeswehr is to be reduced from 370,000 to 320,000 or 340,000 men, and military service is to be reduced by two months to 10 months. Naumann said the objective is to achieve a consensus among the parties on the mandate, the defense system, and the finances of the Army and to give the armed forces a rough structure before the Bundestag election. Now, the point is not to hold a discussion on positions. These details of the Bundeswehr planning can only be defined by next spring when the cornerstones of the concept are accepted, he said. Since the turn of the year, Naumann has prepared the defense policy guidelines "in close cooperation" with Ruehe, as he said. He stressed that the concept will also be supported by the military leadership if two conditions are fulfilled: the service compensation time for draftees -- the compensation of overtime by time off, which is regulated by law -- has to be discontinued because otherwise, useful military training cannot be ensured any longer in 10 months. Moreover, the money saved by the new organization must be preserved for the defense budget, "otherwise the problem of an insufficiently financed Bundeswehr that devours itself by its operations will be repeated." If this condition were fulfilled, the investment share in the budget could be increased to about 28 percent by 1990. Naumann affirmed that he is looking for a way "to show the troop again the light at the end of the tunnel." If a troop strength of 370,000 men is fixed with the present budget, the situation will no longer be tolerable. He is sure that the troop will also support the changes "because everyone knows that things cannot go on like this." A "hollow" Bundeswehr with 370,000 men who neither have modern equipment nor challenging training is not the political instrument that is needed for the security of the country, he said. According to Naumann, political will has to be shown to discontinue the service compensation time for draftees. Only in this way can a service of 10 months be justified. He is convinced that the military quality of training will not suffer if the service lasts 10 months. Rather, the draftee will be challenged during the whole of his service, it will be possible to organize the training better in all military services, and their efficiency might even be increased. However, details sill have to be intensively examined, he said.
