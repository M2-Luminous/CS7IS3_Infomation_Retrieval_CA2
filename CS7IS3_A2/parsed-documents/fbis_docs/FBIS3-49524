Mr. Wagner, Tudjman described the Petersberg talks as useful yesterday. Has it become clear what he meant by that? [Wagner] No. One cannot really say that things have become clearer. Quite the contrary. This news conference has confirmed an old truth -- that the more interesting pieces of news become usually known before, after, or on the sidelines of news conferences. One such news item that has leaked from the surroundings of the delegation is that the 16-page confederation document with 16 articles, presented by President Tudjman, was primarily a tactical paper, a tactical paper designed to tell the world: Look, the Muslims are not pursuing any consistent policy at all in Bosnia. They are simply interested in conquering territory in central Bosnia at the expense of the Croats. Look, we Croats are developing ideas about the political future, as to how Muslims and Croats might live together in the near future. Yet this was a tactical move. At the same time, however, Tudjman is serious about the confederation proposal, even though the chances of its implementation may lie in the distant future. Generally, Tudjman repeated what he declared yesterday evening. He expressed moderate satisfaction, but made very vague statements. Thus, all kinds if interpretation are possible. [Beindorf] What controversial issues were discussed? What about Mostar or access to the Adriatic Sea for the Muslims? [Wagner] It was difficult to find that out. The following became known: Croatia wants to keep Mostar, Tudjman stated. The reason he gave was that Mostar is the only large town that the Bosnian Croats control in Bosnia -- even though not entirely at the moment. The Muslims, however, largely control Sarajevo, Senica, and Tuzla. The Croats need Mostar as an administrative center for the state of Herceg-Bosnia that they proclaimed unilaterally. Tudjman also stressed that the proportional representation of the ethnic groups has changed at the expense of the Croatians since the beginning of the war. It is very difficult to verify that at the moment because, as we know, tens of thousands of Muslims are living in a kind of ghetto in the eastern part of the town at present. Nobody knows exactly how many there are. The only thing that is certain is that the number of Muslims and Croats was about the same in this town before the war. As far as access to the Adriatic Sea is concerned, Tudjman made it clear that Neum, the 10-km-wide strip that belonged to Bosnia in the old Yugoslavia, will be taboo for the Bosnian Muslims. It should only be used touristically. Thus, the old proposal continues to be valid: A free port in Ploce, and a small inland port on the Neretva river, which flows into the Adriatic Sea about 10 km north of Ploce. Yet the river is not navigable at present. That would require difficult construction measures. This is all that has become known concerning Mostar and access to the Adriatic Sea. [Beindorf] Mr. Wagner, let me ask you a brief final question. After yesterday's joint talks, Alija Izetbegovic was expected to participate in the news conference. Do you know the reasons for his absence? [Wagner] Well, one can only speculate. It is known that the German Government, the Foreign Ministry, declared its readiness to arrange a joint news conference if agreement is reached during the talks. This means that a joint news conference was only planned in the event of a positive outcome. However, this is not the case. No positive or specific result has been achieved. Izetbegovic departed for Sarajevo this morning, and he may present his report to the press there today. Franjo Tudjman gave a news conference here at 1100. It has also become known that a quarrel erupted behind the scenes between the delegations of the Muslims and the Croats and the Foreign Ministry because no joint news conference was arranged.
