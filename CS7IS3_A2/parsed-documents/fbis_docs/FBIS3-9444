He was received at Rinas airport by Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi. The chief of Belgian diplomacy told the reporters that the aim of his visit is the establishment of a continuous political dialogue for the interests of both countries. As topics in the Albanian-Belgian talks he considered bilateral cooperation as well as the situation in our region. After arriving at the Foreign Ministry, the two delegations led by Serreqi and Claes started talks. Regarding bilateral cooperation, the talks focused on the possibilities of institutionalizing the consultations between the two respective Foreign Ministries. Regarding economics, the Albanian side paid attention to starting cooperation in the mining, energy, tourism, agriculture, and textile industries. Minister Serreqi presented the desire that Belgian investors be present in Albania, assuring the necessary judicial cadre. They also expressed opinions on cooperation in the fields of defense and public order. Another topic in the talks between the Belgian and Albanian delegations was the situation in the region. The main protagonists at the meeting supported the U.S. initiative to create a Croat-Bosnian federation and Claes stressed the need to find proper ways to do so. For this, he continued, it is necessary for the Serbian side to contribute as well. The Belgian foreign minister considered the problem of Kosova as part of the general Yugoslav crisis and tied the abolishment of sanctions to the solution of all aspects of the crisis, including Kosova. Our foreign minister was of the opinion that Kosova should not be treated as a part of Serbia.
