Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, recently visited the United States, where he held talks with top U.S. personalities -- President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, the secretary of state, his assistants, and U.S. congressmen. Can you please inform our viewers about your trip and assess the talks you held there? [Rugova] My visit to the United States was very successful. As you know, we have had continuous contacts with the United States, the U.S. Congress, the Senate, and the State Department. We had the honor and special pleasure to meet President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and their wives. President Clinton personally expressed special gratitude to our peaceful movement and the contribution that we have made to the stability in the region, as well as continued support of the United States on the Kosova issue and the Albanian question. Vice President Al Gore, who was already familiar with the Kosova question, also expressed his own support to the Kosova issue and a peaceful solution to this question. It was a special honor to attend the international prayer, which has been held for more than 30 years in the United States, where Mother Teresa was one of the central figures concerning the Albanian question. Our presence at the morning prayer was marked as an Albanian day in Washington and an affirmation of our people. It was these particular moments that made the visit a very successful and important one, particularly the meeting with the U.S. President. [Kelmendi] During the talks you held with high-level U.S. personalities, you informed them about the grave situation in Kosova, especially the repression and violence of the Serbian occupying power, the economic situation, the humanitarian question, and human rights and freedoms. What do the U.S. officials think about these problems? [Rugova] The United States, the U.S. Congress, and the State Department know the situation in Kosova quite well. As you know, they publish annual reports on Kosova, particularly the State Department, on human rights. The last report was published recently, and we received a copy while we were there. The attitude is to support and assist Kosova in the future. Several aid supplies administered by the U.S. Congress two years ago and last year have arrived in Kosova this year, and they amount to several million dollars. This was the concrete assistance that has arrived in Kosova. Of course, I can also mention the political and diplomatic assistance that will be extended to Kosova in the future, as well as the good disposition on the Kosova issue that has existed in U.S. state institutions for years. [Kelmendi] President Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher have several times asserted that they will not allow the war to spread to Kosova, i.e., to the south front. At the same time, the congressmen with whom you talked declared that they will draft new resolutions on the question of Kosova and they will support Kosova. How do you assess these stands, and what do you expect in the near future in this direction? [Rugova] The U.S. officials asserted that what President Clinton and Mr. Christopher have said are serious statements, so we will continue to wait for all these institutions to move ahead on the Kosova question. [Kelmendi] Mr. Chairman, let us go back to the end of last year. You conducted a long tour of some European countries. You were received by foreign ministers of those countries and state ministers as well. This was, undoubtedly, a recognition of Kosova's subjectivity and your legitimacy as president of the republic of Kosova. After the talks with European and U.S. personalities, how do you assess the situation in Kosova? What do you expect this year? Is this a further acceleration toward a peaceful solution of the Kosova question? [Rugova] This is an increasingly great affirmation. As you know, the tour I conducted at the end of last year in Europe and this one in the United States is an increasingly great affirmation of the Kosova issue and an international subjectiveness or an international element of Kosova and its further legitimacy. As you know and as we have often said, these questions make up a process; thus, we should be organized, have more contacts, and especially arrange a better organization in Kosova. All these would be a contribution for the solution of the Kosova question through peaceful and political means. To tell the truth, everyone is concerned that no conflict or new tragedy occurs in Kosova. That is why preventive measures should be taken to avoid the worse, which would be very tragic for the region and Kosova itself. [Kelmendi] It is assessed that further sanctions against Serbia will be one of the elements that will help to solve the crisis in Kosova, and perhaps to stop the war in Bosnia. Did you talk about the continuation of the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, and are they in a way connected to the situation in Kosova? [Rugova] Concretely, in the United States we asserted that these sanctions will not be abolished, but may be further intensified. They are a means to exert pressure on Serbia, with regard not only to other issues such as Bosnia and Croatia in former Yugoslavia, but also to Kosova, because Kosova as well is included in these conditions for the abolishment of sanctions. For the moment we cannot talk about the abolishment of sanctions, which certainly will be intensified. [Kelmendi] Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg have summoned a conference in Geneva today with the participation of the neighboring countries of former Yugoslavia; they have called it a consultative conference. What do you think, will this conference discuss the question of Kosova? Will this be a further step forward toward the solution of the Kosova problem, especially when President Berisha declared that without solving the Kosova issue there cannot be a solution of the Balkan problems? [Rugova] I agree with President Berisha's statement and I consider this conference or this consultative meeting as a consultation about the issues in former Yugoslavia which, of course, the neighboring countries are interested in as well. As you know, the neighboring countries were present at the London conference. However, this was more an international meeting where they had no possibility to tell their viewpoints so openly, as far as I can remember. For us it is important because Albania is there and of course, Albania will put forward the question of Kosova and that of the Albanians living in their ethnic territories. That is, this is important. It is a bit early to say that this will be a step forward or a more positive step. However, as a consultation it should be greeted. Of course, even a solution to this problem will not be successful without the neighboring countries and a global approach to all the problems in former Yugoslavia, because this was one of the central states of the Balkans. [Kelmendi] We hope that the affirmation of Kosova in the international relations will soon bring Kosova to the table for talks at the required level as you have always demanded, as one of the ex-units of former Yugoslavia, where a solution will be found in conformity with the people's will expressed in a referendum. [Rugova] We hope and we are working in this direction. As for a peaceful and political solution, of course we have thought about it. We have requested international protection, a system of civil protectorate that is more advanced, so as to normalize life and institutions and then we can talk about the question of Kosova. As we have mentioned several times, this is an idea and question that is transmitted with interest by all institutions, be they European, U.S., or international ones. [Kelmendi] Mr. President, your meeting with President Clinton is the first meeting of a Kosova president or a Kosova representative with the U.S. President. This occasion reminds us of the commitment of the former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Can you tell us something for our viewers, how did this meeting pass and in what atmosphere? [Rugova] It was the first time that Kosova was accepted at this level and the contact and talks were recognized. I can personally say that it was a warm meeting with a great human empathy on the part of President Clinton, which I had the occasion to see directly. He had a great understanding on the question of Kosova. Concerning the relation to President Wilson, both are Democrats. However, this is not of great importance, but I can say that the President of that time, President Wilson, was a great man who managed to put the question of Albania outside the question of the Adriatic, which meant the partition of the Albanian question. I can say that his well-known 14 Points, a program for the security of democracy in the world, were followed by President Bush with the collapse of communism in the East. And today we find the same vocabulary in President Clinton's policy, so as to promote a world security or in this case, a European security, for the development of democracy, which is very important. As a matter of fact, President Clinton is a man of peace, understanding, and democracy. I had the occasion to see this in my personal meeting with him which was, I can say once again, a special honor to me and the people of Kosova and the Albanians. I thank you very much, greeting the viewers of this television satellite program as well. [Kelmendi] Thank you.
