The "Outline" is an important document guiding our country's work in making industrial policy, as well as a major policy basis for readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure at present and for some time to come. Earnestly fulfilling the demands outlined in the document will play a very important role in promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy national development. Industrial policy is an important means by which the state tightens and improves macroeconomic regulation and control, readjusts and optimizes the industrial structure, brings about qualitative improvements in industry, and rationally distributes resources over the long term. The State Council promulgated the "Decision of the State Council on the Gist of Current Industrial Policy" in March of 1989. The "Decision" played a positive role in controlling inflation, in establishing a normal industrial development order, and in increasing the supply of essential goods. Our country's reform, opening up, and modernization have entered a new stage of vigorous development since the beginning of the nineties, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping delivered his important talks in early 1992 and the 14th CPC National Congress. Our national economy has grown rapidly, and both the pattern of domestic demand and the international economic environment have undergone significant changes. To meet the requirements of economic development in the new situation, the State Council formulated the "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the Nineties," in which it clearly specified the major principles for readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure, priorities in industrial development, and the safeguard policies to be implemented in coordination, with a view to effectively steering our national economy toward realizing the second-step strategic objective of national economic and social development. Our country is currently in a crucial period of accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. During the process of establishing a new structure, the market should be allowed to play a fundamental role in distributing resources while the state should tighten macroeconomic regulation and control and provide guidance for the rational distribution of resources over the long term. Industrial policy is at the core of long-term development policy. The tangible achievements scored by the economically developed countries in the world, especially by a great many Asian countries and regions, have corroborated the important role played by industrial policy. Our country is establishing a socialist market economic structure as its industrial structure is undergoing significant changes. This requires the government to formulate rational and farsighted structural policy and to guide economic development on its own initiative so as to avert haphazard production and investment activities and improve macroeconomic returns and economic performance. Based on an in-depth analysis of the trends of change in our country's industrial structure, in accordance with the objective laws governing the process of industrialization and modernization, the "Outline" clearly specifies the main direction and aspects of our country's industrial restructuring during the nineties; that is, continuously strengthening the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, developing the rural economy in an all-around way, vigorously beefing up basic industries, striving to relieve the strain posed by the slow development of basic industries and infrastructure, accelerating the development of mainstay industries to promote overall national economic development, rationally restructuring foreign trade, sharpening the competitive edge of our industries in the international market, quickening the pace of developing industries using new and high technology, supporting the development of new industries and products, and continuing to develop tertiary industry energetically. Moreover, efforts should be made to optimize the industrial organizational structure and to improve industrial technological levels so as to render the industrial pattern more rational. All in all, the "Outline" fully outlines the general trend and pattern of our country's industrial development and clearly sets forth the major principles and policies for readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure. The "Outline," a document providing guidance on industrial policy work, sets forth general requirements which must be fulfilled one by one through specific policies. So far, the State Council has promulgated the "Industrial Policy for the Car Industry," which specifically sets the goal of developing this key industry and explains its industrial organization, technology, distribution, and foreign investment and trade policies. This specific industrial policy has begun to be implemented. The State Council has also promulgated criteria of economic scale for investment and construction on a number of important products to achieve economies of scale in these industries and increase their competitiveness. Pursuant to the requirements of the "Outline," the State Council will formulate one by one additional specific industrial policies on transport, telecommunications, construction, electronics, machine-building, petrochemical, foreign investment, trade, technology, and industrial reorganization to fulfill what is required in the "Outline." The "Outline" also specifies procedures for formulating industrial policy and the method of implementing it. This provides an important guarantee ensuring that industrial policy is scientific, authoritative, and effective in implementation and helps move the work of formulating industrial policy closer to standardization and establishing it on an institutional and legal basis. The "Outline" specifically calls for the establishment of systems of decisionmaking, work procedures, examination and approval, logistic support, supervision and inspection, and evaluation of the state's industrial policy. These systems, which will be established in line with the usual practice of a market economy, with due attention to bringing into play the initiatives of all quarters, will greatly raise the government's work efficiency in formulating and implementing industrial policy. Once state industrial policy is formulated, the important thing is implementation. From our countries' experience in formulating industrial policy, and in light of the fairly successful foreign practice in implementing industrial policy, it is crucial that the following four links be grasped well for the implementation of the "Outline": First, all departments and localities must organize a drive to earnestly study and publicize the "Outline" so that state industrial policy is extensively understood and recognized. It is necessary to study and understand what the "Outline" requires and enhance our consciousness in implementing it from the perspective of quickly and successfully pushing forward the development of the entire economy and establishing a socialist market economic structure. Second, it is necessary to stress coordination and consistency between state industrial policies and other economic policies. Effective implementation of industrial policies requires effective coordination of other economic policies, particularly on financial, banking, taxation, price, foreign trade, and foreign investment. Departments of planning, finance, banking, taxation, customs, stock supervision, administration for industry and commerce, and state-owned property management, as well as relevant specialized departments and local governments should appropriately adjust their policy measures within their jurisdiction and implement effective logistic support systems in accordance with the general requirements of the "Outline" to ensure their coordinated functioning in line with the state's general industrial policy. Third, it is necessary to handle well the relationship between implementing state industrial policy and bringing into play the market mechanism. In implementing industrial policy, it is necessary to pay attention to bringing into play the role of market mechanism and, under the state's macroeconomic regulation and control, bring into full play the basic role of the market in the allocation of resources to ensure the realization of the goal of structural adjustment. It is necessary to use economic means and legal measures to provide guidance and carry out coordination. Fourth, it is necessary to handle well the relationship between partial and overall interests. The "Outline" requires that local governments at the provincial level specifically study the formulation of implementing measures in light of local realities. In enacting implementation measures, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should stress bringing into play their relative strong points while taking into consideration the state's overall interests and avoid the tendency to consider partial interests alone to the neglect of overall interests. In developing local economies, governments at all levels should earnestly and consciously implement state industrial policy. In the case of industries supported by state industrial policy, they can develop them in light of local realities and in line with national distribution arrangements. In the case of industries incompatible with state industrial policies, they should consciously follow state industrial policy and refrain from violating them; otherwise, they will affect national economic development and at the same time cause economic losses to the localities. Only by so doing can we promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy which, in the final analysis, will help bring about effective growth of the local economy.
