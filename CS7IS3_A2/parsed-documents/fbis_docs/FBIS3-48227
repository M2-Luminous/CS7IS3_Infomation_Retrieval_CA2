The prediction is based on the facts that Korean shipbuilders can undercut Japanese-built ship prices while they can compete against the Japanese in quality and marketing, according to a report issued Thursday by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economy and Trade. The report said the general technological level of Korean shipbuilders is below that of the Japanese, but the quality of products, marketing and after-sales service are almost on a par with the Japanese. In price competition, however, Korean yards are far ahead of the Japanese, offsetting their weak points, it said. Especially because of the rising value of the yen from last year, their competitive power has continued to rise. As a result, Korean shipbuilders are expected to maintain their edge over their Japanese counterparts as long as the foreign exchange trend keeps up, it said. Against Chinese shipbuilders, meanwhile, the Koreans lag slightly behind in price competitiveness but Korea far outpaces China in all other aspects including technology, marketing, financing, after- sales service and marketing, it said. Compared with European shipyards, it said, Korean shipbuilders are far ahead. In other aspects, they are either on a par or slightly ahead of European builders, it added.
