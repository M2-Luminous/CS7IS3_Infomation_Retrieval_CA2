Instead, in conversation with journalists he said that the military department has examined the issue of the expediency of continuing to preserve the present antiaircraft defense structure. In Grachev's opinion, under current conditions there is no need for antiaircraft defense forces to cover all sites. Therefore a decision has been taken on protecting only main sites, in particular nuclear and hydroelectric power stations, defense industry factories, and state institutions throughout Russia. Grachev also reported that the military department intends to get rid of antiquated antiaircraft defense systems.
