The Front stressed that France had been involved in this conflict for three years through giving weapons to some parties in the conflict and this added to the massacres among the ranks of the Rwandan people. The UN secretary general called for preparing a huge UN military force to send to Rwanda, which is witnessing a party and tribal conflict. The JANA African affairs editor commented on this by saying: Western states are the ones that fabricate incidents and problems in many parts of the world with the aim of achieving a military intervention in those regions. The editor wondered why international forces did not stop the racial and religious conflict in Bosnia and said that the dubious role of these forces in Somalia was known to all.
