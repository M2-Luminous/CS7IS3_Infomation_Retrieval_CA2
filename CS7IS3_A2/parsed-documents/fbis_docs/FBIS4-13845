"The United States introduced the Russian trump card exactly at the juncture when the world public opinion demanded UN-NATO action to end Serbian aggression against Bosnia," wrote "TEHRAN TIMES" in its editorial. The United States and its allies, said the article, insist that there can be no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the Russians are allowed to participate in NATO's plants to end the Serbs atrocities. The West had to find a way of wiggling out this mess without accepting any blame and this was where the Russian factor came into play, noted the paper. The daily wrote that the U.S. intended to show that Russia was an important military power deserving of being included in resolving the global conflicts. However, added the paper, when the U.S.-led UN forces attacked the Iraqi Army, the opposition of the all powerful Soviet Union was totally ignored by the U.S. and its allies. Russia, for its domestic reasons, needed to pretend that it was still the same "menacing bear" it used to be before its disintegration, said the daily. It added that the Russian officials should realize that by promoting the Serbian cause they are playing into the hands of the Western "political puppeteers" who plan to sit this war out and blame their inaction on Russia's opposition to the use of force against the Serbs. The paper noted in conclusion that Russia should realize that if it continued playing the role of an excuse for the West, it would face "irreparable" damages in its relations with Muslim countries and their more than one billion collective population.
