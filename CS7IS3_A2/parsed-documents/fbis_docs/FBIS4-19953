In 1999, Europe will "not yet be ready for a common currency," Major said in an interview in the news magazine DER SPIEGEL. This view was "not a piece of British chauvinism, but an economic assessment." The prime minister stressed his skepticism was due to the "anticipated economic repercussions." If Europe had a common currency in 1997, 1998, or 1999 as planned and it was to succeed, then "all European economic cycles would have to have become closer to each other and be working efficiently." Major added: "I know no one who says this can be anything like achieved. There will therefore be no monetary union." Meanwhile Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) announced that he wanted to reduce the German contributions to the European Union (EU) in the long term. The Federal Government was taking all promising steps to improve the German situation, Waigel told the B.Z. [BERLINER ZEITUNG]. It was "entirely indisputable that an imbalance in burden-sharing has arisen." This was all the truer since "Germany is now only in seventh place in the EU prosperity stakes following unification." Waigel pointed out that the German net contribution was around 25 billion German marks [DM] this year. Germany was therefore covering around 70 percent of the net transfer between the member states. In 1994, Germany would pay out around DM44 billion to the EU. Some of this would flow back in the form of payments to German agriculture or as support for eastern Germany, for example. But Germany's direct EU expenditure was further augmented by its contribution to ease the burden on the second largest net contributor, Great Britain. This cost another DM1.2 to 1.5 billion. Major conveyed his irritation at the criticism expressed by the EU parters of his stance on the dispute over blocking minorities and veto rights in the EU Council of Ministers and accused them of applying double standards. If necessary, Germany and France as well as Spain or Italy would defend "everything they perceive as questions of national interest." But no one accused them of being anti-European for that.
