"We used to depend on farming alone, and our lives improved only slowly," said Shen, secretary of the township committee of the Communist Party. Encouraged by the government, the township has set up 160 enterprises in the fields of leather, light and textile industries, hardware and machinery, and building materials in addition to food-processing, chemicals and electronics over the past decade. As a result, the township's industrial output value rose from 180 million yuan in 1991 to 260 million yuan in 1992, and to 508 million yuan last year, Shen said. While boosting rural industry, the local government has encouraged farmers to arrange agricultural production and diversify the economy in line with market demands. According to the latest statistics, Xinjiang turns out between 8,000 tons and 10,000 tons of grain a year. Last year its gross output value reached 565 million yuan, sales income 910 million yuan, profits and taxes 59.34 million yuan and financial revenue 12.75 million yuan last year -- all records. Its farmers' incomes averaged 2,060 yuan per capita in 1993, also a record. With more money in hand, farmers have built two- and three-story buildings to replace their single-story houses. Most farmers have equipped their households with color televisions, refrigerators and cassette recorders, and some have even bought hi-fi sound systems and motorcycles. Many of them have a considerable amount of savings deposits in banks. A provincial official in charge of agriculture said Xinjiang township is a typical example of townships across the province, which is leading farmers toward a comfortable life. According to a rural development plan, the annual income of farmers in the province will reach 1,600 yuan per capita by the end of 1995, and 2,200 yuan by the end of this century. The provincial government has conferred the title "townships with strong economic development" on 103 townships including Xinjiang. Experts in rural development agree that the purpose of the rural economic reform is to promote the development of the rural commodity economy and gradually replace the traditional self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy with modern farming. According to statistics, the past five years were a high point for the overall development of Zhejiang's rural economy. Zhejiang's gross output value of farm, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery products last year reached 39.36 billion yuan, an increase of 18.7 percent over 1988. Its rural industrial output value rose from 54.275 billion yuan in 1988 to 255.2 billion yuan last year, accounting for two-thirds of the gross provincial industrial output value. Farmers' incomes climbed from 1,000 yuan per capita in 1990 to 1,590 yuan last year. Economists here analyzed that the increase comes mainly from the diversified economy instead of only from growing grain.
