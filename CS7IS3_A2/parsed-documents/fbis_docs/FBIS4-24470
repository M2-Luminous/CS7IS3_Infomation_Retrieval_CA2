Up to 200 Tibetans joined a crowd in the Tibetan capital on Friday [27 May] protesting against tax increases. The demonstrators were rallying against recent increases of more than 20 per cent in taxes on shopkeepers. But the incident, which fell close to two sensitive anniversaries, could have a concealed political agenda. Last Monday marked the 33rd anniversary of the Tibetans' formal surrender to the Chinese in the "17 Point Agreement" of 1951, and Tuesday was the anniversary of a major protest in 1993 which began as a complaint about prices but turned into a pro-independence rally. Friday's protest began around 2 pm when traders in the Barkor, the main shopping street in the Tibetan quarter of the city, closed their shops, apparently in protest at the tax increase. Between 100 and 200 people gathered in front of the offices of the Lhasa "Chengguanqu", the inner city government, in Dekyi Shar Lam (Beijing Dong Lu), and shouted slogans against taxation. The protesters were joined by about 100 onlookers who also began shouting, one report said. At about 5 pm riot police carrying shields marked "gong an" (police) took up positions along Dekyi Lam and sealed off the area around the inner city government offices. A number of demonstrators were beaten and five people were believed to have been arrested, according to an unconfirmed report. A platoon of armed police was moved by truck into the area at around 7.30 pm, by which time the crowd had dispersed. Police confiscated the passports of three tourists staying at the Banakshol Hotel, opposite the government offices, who had witnessed the protest. Watching disturbances is illegal for foreigners in Tibet, according to local laws. This is the second incident to have been reported in Lhasa in the past week. Last Tuesday, four monks were said to have been arrested after they began a pro-independence protest near the Jokhang Temple in the Barkor area, according to a report yesterday by the KYODO News Agency in Tokyo, citing unnamed foreign tourists. The four monks were detained by police after shouting pro-independence slogans, and some of the monks were knocked to the ground by the police before being led away. Meanwhile in neighbouring Nepal, fears that Tibetans might demonstrate to mark the anniversary of the "17 Point Agreement" led to a wave of random arrests of Tibetans in Kathmandu. In a well co-ordinated security operation, an estimated 70 Tibetans were imprisoned for eight hours in police quarters in the Nepalese capital, according to one detainee. "We were held from 10 in the morning until six o'clock that evening. We had no food or water and were escorted by police even to go to the toilet," said the detainee, who had been picked up by police for no apparent reason while he was on his way to collect a visa from the Chinese' Embassy in Kathmandu.
