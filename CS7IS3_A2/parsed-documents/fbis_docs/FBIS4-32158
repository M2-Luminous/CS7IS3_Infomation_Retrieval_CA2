FBIS4-32158 "dreeu119__a94010" FBIS-EEU-94-119-A Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Official Challenges Data on Arms Exports Official Challenges Data on Arms Exports AU1706202694 Prague CTK in English 1755 GMT 17 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1706202694 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague/Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- The information that the Czech Republic ranks sixth in international trade in arms was challenged by Kamil Cermak, press spokesman for the Trade and Industry Ministry, today. He called incorrect the data by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), according to which the Czech Republic had made a profit of DM800 million [German marks] from military equipment exports last year, the sixth largest in the world. Cermak said that the Ministry had turned to SIPRI to explain from where it had drawn the data on Czech arms exports and to rectify the matter. He said that in 1993 the Czech Republic had exported $167 million worth of weapons. In 1992, the last year of the Czechoslovak Federation, the exports amounted to about $150 million, particularly thanks to exports of Slovak-made tanks and heavy weaponry. About 80 percent of Czech exports is constituted by L-39 Albatross jet planes made by the Aero company. The rest are artillery, hunting, and short fire arms, Cermak said. Czech weapons are exported especially to third world countries which comply with the legal terms of arms exports. Reacting to the news about the Czech Republic's alleged sixth position among arms exporters, Eva Slavkovska, deputy chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS), said today that the armament industry conversion in Czechoslovakia affected only Slovakia, but "came" to the country from the Czech Republic. Because the Slovaks had got caught by the Czechs' goal-orientated game, the Czech Republic has now been profiting from arms exports, she said. Slavkovska pointed out that under the federation, when a substantial part of the armament industry was concentrated in Slovakia, Czechoslovakia had ranked seventh among world arms exporters. The SNS was a coalition partner of the former government of Vladimir Meciar.
