FR940318-0-00185 FR940318-0-00023 If it is likely that exposures may exceed 30 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA), proper protective gear should be worn. To determine proper respiratory protection, the user should consult the manufacturer of the product for any specific recommendations governing respirator use in the particular end-use. HCFC&hyph;123, which is the major component of this blend has an ODP of 0.02, which is the lowest ODP of all the HCFCs proposed as halon substitutes, and its 100-year GWP of 90 is lower than that of other proposed HCFC substitutes. Although this agent contains a very small percentage of PFC, which has a long atmospheric lifetime and which could potentially contribute to global climate change, EPA believes that the quantities of PFC likely to be emitted are small, and that availability of this blend is an important aid in the transition away from ozone-depleting substances. As with any chemical replacement to halon, EPA recommends that unnecessary emissions be controlled by minimizing training and by the use of recycling during maintenance. As discussed in the section on HCFCs generally, this agent is regulated under section 610(d). Consistent with the intent of section 610(d), EPA intends to publish a proposed rulemaking that will ban the use of this agent in residential applications. (c) (Surfactant blend) A. (Surfactant blend) A is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. This product is a mixture of organic surfactants and water. In use, this concentrated mixture is diluted to strengths of 1&hyph;10 percent with available water. The surfactants appear to enhance the heat absorbing capacity of the water. (Surfactant Blend) A acts on oil, gasoline, and petroleum based liquid fires (Class B fires) by encapsulating the fuel, thus removing the fuel source from the fire. This encapsulating feature prevents flame propagation and reduces the possibility of reignition. This blend was designed for use on Class B oil and gasoline fires, but can be used on all Class A and Class B fires, as well as Class D fires. The agent has passed Underwriters' Laboratories (UL) certification for Class A, B, and D fires, and UL testing for Class C fires is underway. This extinguishant is a blend of complex alcohols, lipids, and proteins, which are diluted in large volumes of water to the final commercial preparation. Each of the substances is biodegradable and in its shipping state the product has been assigned a hazardous materials identification system (HMIS) rating of 0&hyph;0&hyph;0 for health hazard, reactivity, and flammability, respectively. The HMIS rating was developed by the National Paint and Coatings Association (NPCA) to indicate the hazard potential of chemical substances, with zero representing the lowest hazard potential. Initial data provided by the manufacturer indicate some ocular irritation in rabbits, and thus EPA is recommending that the manufacturer label the product with a caution about possible eye irritation. (d) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. Carbon dioxide can be used as a direct substitute for Halon 1211 in specified applications. Carbon dioxide systems are not rated for Class A fires and so must be used in conjunction with another type of extinguisher to ensure that all possible fires can be extinguished. In addition, discharge of carbon dioxide into confined spaces may result in CO 2 concentrations above the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level. Areas into which carbon dioxide is discharged should be immediately evacuated and ventilated. Carbon dioxide extinguishers should be used only in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines and applicable NFPA standards. (e) Dry chemical. Dry chemical extinguishers are acceptable as Halon 1211 substitutes. Dry chemical extinguishers can be used as a substitute for Halon 1211 in most residential applications. While dry chemical extinguishers can be used on Class A, B, or C fires depending upon the type of powder used, they do not always penetrate well around obstacles, they do not inhibit re-ignition of fires, they do not cool surfaces, they can cause secondary damage, and discharge in confined spaces can result in temporary loss of visibility. Dry chemical extinguishers should be used only in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines and with relevant NFPA standards. (f) Water. Water is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. Users should be aware, however, that water extinguishers cannot act as a substitute for Halon 1211 in all applications. Water is primarily a Class A fire extinguishant. It can be used on de-energized Class C fires, but should not be used with Class B fires. Water may damage objects onto which it is discharged. Water extinguishers should be used only in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines and with applicable NFPA standards.
