FR940711-2-00124 FR940711-2-00050 NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION Notice of Transfer of Function to NTIS In the spirit of the National Performance Review, the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service (NTIS) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) will team up to demonstrate how government can operate more effectively. The National Audiovisual Center at NARA will be transferred to NTIS under an agreement which will consolidate much of the Federal government's capability for audio, visual, and multimedia materials production and dissemination. At a time when NARA has developed a strategic vision of its future calling for a sharpening of its focus on the archival aspects of its programs, the need for service support for audiovisual and multimedia across government is rapidly increasing. Merging the complimentary strengths of the NARA National Audiovisual Center with the existing NTIS which has been congressionally mandated to collect and disseminate scientific and technical information will result in better services to agencies and the public. The new National Audiovisual Center at NTIS will be ideally positioned to serve as a hub for access to Federally developed media and training materials. By combining resources with the NARA center, NTIS will now be able to provide Federal training technology transfer services to both the public and private sectors. The transfer of the National Audiovisual Center from NARA to NTIS will be effective October 1, 1994. Written questions regarding this functional transfer may be sent to Charles W. Bender, Deputy Assistant Archivist for Public Programs (NE), National Archives, 7th & Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20408. Dated: June 30, 1994. Trudy Huskamp Peterson, Acting Archivist of the United States. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16655 Filed 7&hyph;8&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7515&hyph;01&hyph;M
