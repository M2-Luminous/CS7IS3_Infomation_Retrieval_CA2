The visits stopped in 1984 after the then Labor Party Government in New Zealand banned nuclear armed and nuclear propelled vessels from entering its waters. Speaking in London, Mr. Bolger said the British prime minister, John Major, had told him New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy had ceased to be an obstacle because British surface vessels no longer carry nuclear weapons. Mr. Bolger said it was likely a British warship would visit New Zealand this year or early next year. He said he hoped the United States would also reconsider its policy of not sending naval vessels to New Zealand.
