In an exclusive interview with AL-BILAD, Yahya said Iran had recently concluded a deal with Sanaa to provide it with Sukhoi planes. The planes arrived aboard a Yemeni-flagged commercial ship, which unloaded its shipment in the port of al-Hudaydah. Yahya also said Sanaa was receiving Sudanese air assistance. He noted that Iraqi military experts are doing their bit in overseeing battles from an operations room that was created in the southern region of Abyan, under the control of northern forces. Anis Yahya denied reports about Saudi and Kuwaiti military support for the southern forces, saying: What has been rumored about a Saudi military buildup on the southern Yemeni border represents northern allegations and fabrications. He said the weapons that arrived during the battles to southern Yemen from Asian and east European nations are part of a previous program to arm the southern army. On the Sudanese and Iraqi prisoners which Aden said it had captured during the battles with the northern forces, the speaker of the southern parliament said: We are keeping them in a safe place, and we will show them at the right time to the international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi or any other envoy from the Arab League or the Islamic Conference Organization. He said the southern forces have seven non-Yemeni officer and soldier prisoners, five of them Iraqis, one Eritrean, and one Sudanese. He said the prisoners made full confessions about the presence of Iraqi forces and Sudanese and Eritrean volunteers with the northern forces. On the course of battles in Yemen and the possibility of the northern forces breaking into Aden, Yahya said: There are 50,000 southern fighters, supported by 30,000 tribal fighters to defend Aden by all means. There will be massacres if the northern troops enter Aden. He noted that more than 3,000 people have been either killed or injured in Aden alone since the battles erupted. Anis Yahya visited Cairo heading a southern parliamentary delegation that includes four deputies as part of an Arab and international tour. A rumor spread within the circles of Yemenis living in Cairo that the speaker of the southern parliament fled to Cairo after the northern leadership had sanctioned his killing, along with 13 others of the leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party. Yahya replied to the rumors by saying: It is a northern rumor launched by the supporters of the northern General People's Congress who live in Cairo. I arrived in Cairo alone. My children are still living in the south. We are on a mission to expose the reasons that prompt Sanaa to continue the fighting. [Al-Jawjari] In your opinion, what are the reasons? [Yahya] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the "northern" parliament, the ally of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, wants to control the oil sources and refineries in the south to establish a state that will dominate the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, and that will enter into an alliance with Sudan and Iraq to form an axis that threatens the security of the Gulf countries and Egypt. [Al-Jawjari] If such a plan is real and not the figment of imagination, then when did you discover it? [Yahya] Iraq was the first country to support unity. It gave united Yemen financial and material assistance. We used to believe that they were doing this because of their Ba'thist ideology. But, we found out that Presidents Saddam and Salih had made a deal under which Saddam would support Yemeni unity and Salih the Iraqi entry into Kuwait. This is what took place. [Al-Jawjari] This means that the present conflict in Yemen is one of the chapters of the Gulf crisis? [Yahya] Yes. We are now reaping the fruits of the policy of hegemony and imposition of influence under the pretext of unity. [Al-Jawjari] But many in the Arab homeland do not believe that such a plan exists? [Yahya] And who thought Iraq would enter Kuwait? We are living in an era where secret schemes suddenly materialize. [Al-Jawjari] President Salih says that the YSP leaders are the ones who violate the cease-fire decisions? [Al-Jawjari] Our reply is simply to refer to facts. President Salih exploited the cease-fire to bring in reinforcements to the battlefronts from the tribes and the Presidential Guard totalling some 100,000 troops over the past weeks. The northern forces received weapons and spare parts from Iran, Iraq, and Sudan to upgrade the effiency of the war machine on all fronts. From our side, we are eager to cease fire to reoperate the water and power plants in Aden which faces an environmental disaster. [Al-Jawjari] There are reports that a vessel from Pakistan has recently unloaded its cargo in the southern Al-Mukalla Port. The cargo comprises 40 Russian tanks and 100 missiles. The question is from where have these come and who paid for them? [Yahya] I was in Cairo when this report was published. I can neither confirm nor deny it. However, what I can say is that there are arms deals we have contracted a while ago. As you know, weapons are not delivered on the day the contract is signed, but later. Thus, I can affirm that no one finances arms deals for the south. [Al-Jawjari] President Salih invited you five times to hold a dialogue. Why did you turn down the invitations? [Yahya] Because there were conditions attached. Sanaa proposed certain names, and the nature of the topics to be discussed was still a subject of dispute. [Al-Jawjari] Will you please give us some details? [Yahya] Sanaa rejects the participation of 13 members of the YSP Political Bureau, including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, al-'Attas, the defense minister, myself, and others, in the dialogue. This is an unacceptable condition. Sanaa also set a condition that the dialogue be held within the framework of unity and the so-called constitutional legitimacy. This is rejected too because we represent an independent state and we are not part of the Republic of Yemen. [Al-Jawjari] Your decision to secede was not supported by any state. [Yahya] This is a question of time, and most probably 12 Arab and non-Arab countries will support a decision to establish the Democratic Republic of Yemen when circumstances are appropriate. [Al-Jawjari] Including the United States? [Yahya] No comment. [Al-Jawjari] And including the Gulf states, except Qatar? [Yahya] No comment. [Al-Jawjari] But Egypt voices its support for unity on condition that it is not imposed by force. [Yahya] We, in the south, respect the role and the position of the Egyptian leadership. [Al-Jawjari] Jordan also supports unity and calls for a cease- fire. [Yahya] His Majesty King Husayn exerted extraordinary effort to prevent the conflict and infighting but the president and his allies have foiled Jordan's reconciliatory initiative. Jordanian military experts, who took part in the military committee, also say that it is the northern leaders who have aborted attempts to solve the problem. [Al-Jawjari] You too aborted these efforts by insisting on the withdrawal of the northern forces from the south and the withdrawal of the southern forces from the north. This meant division. [Yahya] We knew the dimensions of a plot to relocate certain units, which were outside the agreement and which could easily be struck if war erupted. This is what exactly happened when the 5th Infantry Brigade and the 3rd Brigade in 'Imran were destroyed and when the Ba Suhayb Brigade was besieged, after which war erupted. [Al-Jawjari] What is the solution? [Yahya] Cease-fire, disengagement of forces, and recognition of the independent southern state. [Al-Jawjari] Sanaa's support for the secession seems to be impossible. [Yahya] The continuation of unity in the previous way is also impossible.
