Relating to Specialist Concentration September 26, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, 2 notice is hereby given that on August 30, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'`) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange seeks to obtain accelerated effectiveness as to a one-year extension of the Specialist Concentration Policy pilot program. 3 This will continue to permit the Exchange's Executive Committee to review proposed combinations that, in the Exchange's view, may lead to undue concentration within the specialist community. The Exchange therefore requests the Commission to find good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication in the Federal Register . Accelerated approval is hereby granted for the reasons stated below. 3 On February 7, 1990, the Commission approved, on a six-month pilot basis ending August 7, 1990, a proposed rule change by the BSE to establish procedures for reviewing proposed combinations among specialist units on the Exchange. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27684 (February 7, 1990), 55 FR 5527 (approving File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;89&hyph;05). The Commission later approved the renewal of the pilot program for additional one-year periods ending August 1, 1991, August 13, 1992, August 13, 1993, and August 13, 1994. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 28327 (August 10, 1990), 55 FR 33794 (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;90&hyph;11); 29551 (August 13, 1991), 56 FR 41380 (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;91&hyph;06); 31037 (August 13, 1992), 57 FR 37854 (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;92&hyph;08); and 32753 (August 16, 1993), 58 FR 44707 (File No.SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;15). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The purpose of the proposed rule change is to extend the concentration policy pilot program, which establishes certain standards based on Consolidated Tape Association (``CTA'') ranking 4 of specialist stocks for reviewing certain proposed mergers, acquisitions and other combinations between or among specialist units. The proposed policy would authorize the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors to review proposed combinations that, in the Exchange's view, may lead to undue concentration within the specialist community. 4 In March 1973, the CTA was formed and the consolidated tape was established to disseminate last sale transaction information for trades executed on any of the participant exchanges or through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (``NASDAQ'') system. The current CTA participants include the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), American Stock Exchange (``Amex''), Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX''), Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``Phlx''), Pacific Stock Exchange (``PSE''), BSE, Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE''), Cincinnati Stock Exchange (``CSE''), and the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD''). Each specialist stock is ranked according to the number of CTA trades in such stock. The ranking is based upon an average for the past four quarters. The Executive Committee will review any arrangement where previously separate specialist organizations would be operating under common control and would comprise: (a) 15% or more of the 100 most actively traded CTA stocks; or, (b) 15% or more of the second 100 most actively traded CTA stocks; or, (c) 20% or more of the third 100 most actively traded CTA stocks; or,
