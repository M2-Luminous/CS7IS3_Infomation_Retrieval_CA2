All parliamentary groups called for preventing, if possible, the completion of the Czech nuclear power plant in Temelin; the Greens called for more activities by Austria. Chancellor Vranitzky stressed that government members will present the Austrian position in the United States. Deputy Anschober of the Greens accused the government of acting against Temelin only half-heartedly. He described the special threat to Austria's security by the Temelin nuclear power plant. Anschober sees definite chances to prevent the completion of Temelin. In the Czech Republic rejection of the nuclear power plant is growing and the financing by the United States is hanging "on a silk thread." This is why Austria should massively intervene in the last stage of decisionmaking by the U.S. Congress on financial guarantees and environmental compatibility. At the hearing by the U.S. Congress Banking Committee, which is scheduled for 23 February, Austria should be represented by the chancellor and an expert committee. Chancellor Vranitzky stressed that Austria will "urge a thorough and comprehensive examination of the project's ecological compatibility." There are indications that approval "would certainly not be a matter of course." At the government level Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina will discuss the matter with his U.S. counterpart. Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer will make use of parliamentary contacts in the United States. There is no reason for discouragement or panic-mongering, nor can "one speak of a lack of dedication at all." The chancellor pointed out that the Austrian Government has repeatedly expressed its concern about Temelin to the Czech Republic. Also a paper on energy supply has been presented, and it has been pointed out that the completion of Temelin as a gas-steam power plant would be more sensible also from the economic point of view. According to Vranitzky, a position paper on Temelin, which was drawn up by the Chancellor's Office, was sent both to the Eximbank as well as to the responsible committee chairmen of the Senate and the House of Representatives last September. In addition, last year Health Minister Michael Ausserwinkler, who is responsible for radiation protection, represented Austria's interests in the United States. Generally, Vranitzky pointed to Austria's intensive activities for years, involving the promotion of closing down, alternatives, and reequipment of nuclear power plants both by arguments as well as by industrial, technical, and financial cooperation. He is aware of the fact that his concept of a nuclear-power-plant-free Central Europe cannot be implemented overnight, he said. However, Vranitzky expressed the conviction that this is "more than the hobby of an Austrian head of government; it is the defense of vital Austrian interests." [passage omitted]
