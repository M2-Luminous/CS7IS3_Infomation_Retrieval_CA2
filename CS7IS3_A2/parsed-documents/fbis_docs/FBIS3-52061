The office, led by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, indicates that the various resolutions issued by this parallel office cannot in any way contribute to the solution to the crisis. The office advises the concerned parties that any act emerging from those sessions, which are considered illegal, can compromise the parliamentary institution. The Senate office invites the 18 January elected to regain their self-control, to respect their identities, and to let the senators' assembly work on the burning issues of the moment.
