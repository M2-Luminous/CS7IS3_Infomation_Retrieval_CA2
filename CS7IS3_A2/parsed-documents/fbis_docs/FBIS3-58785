Juppe said he was "offering in the coming hours and days to make new contact with our American, Russian and European partners to proceed with this overhaul." "We can no longer watch on the one hand the different parties negotiate in Geneva, and on the ground watch an escalation of the conflict," said Juppe in a statement for the French Assembly's foreign affairs committee. He spoke as the European parliament in Strasbourg called for the replacement of David Owen as European Community negotiator in the Bosnian negotiations in a resolution that criticized the strategy of EC and United Nations negotiators "who have achieved no results and who persist in wanting to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina, though a member of the United Nations, along ethnic lines." Hans van den Broek, the European commissioner for external relations, meanwhile, suggested Thursday in Stasbourg that the EC should perhaps consider suspending its mediation efforts "until the three parties (in Bosnia) are ready to accept a durable solution." But he said it was "unfair" to blame Owen, since he was acting on a mandate from the EC. Two days of talks on Bosnia in Geneva collapsed Wednesday with the Bosnian Moslems, Croats and Serbs still deadlocked, as international mediators held out scant hope for progress when talks reconvene in three weeks.
