It alleged that Russia has dropped its objections to the French draft of a UN Security Council resolution on a settlement of the situation around Sarajevo. The newspaper claimed that Russia was threatening to use its right of veto when the draft comes to a vote. But after France sent a high-ranking envoy to Moscow, Russia agreed to support this resolution with minor changes. Voting on the issue is due to take place at the United Nations on Friday. Moscow, 4 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- "Things are not quite like that," a Russian Foreign Ministry senior official said when asked by ITAR- TASS to comment on the U.S. newspaper report. "First, we have never been against the resolution, as such. We favor a settlement of the situation around Sarajevo and regard it as one of the priority areas in the general process of moving toward peace in Bosnia. When the French were here on Wednesday evening, we managed to agree almost everything with them. However, in the light of yesterday's events in New York the situation has changed somewhat. So, at the present time, work on the text is continuing."
