"That is what is natural," Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said. If it is at all possible, she will this week call a meeting of party leaders and representatives of No to the EU and of the Europe Movement to discuss the matter. "I will of course listen to what they have to say about the date for a Norwegian referendum. But for me it is natural that our referendum should come after the referendum Sweden will hold on 13 November." Brundtland pointed to the fact that the government has long held the view that the referendum should be held around six months after the membership agreement is finalized and has been debated by the European Parliament. Strasbourg's scrutiny of the agreement is planned to be complete by 4 May. What is most likely is that the Norwegian referendum will come one or at most two weeks after the Swedish referendum. A later date would be difficult if the timetable of Norwegian membership from 1 January 1995 is to be met, because the Storting needs time for the necessary ratification of the agreement after the referendum has been held. Brundtland justified her view of the order of the referendums with the argument that Norway applied for membership after Sweden and Finland, and that the decision for a Norwegian membership application was to a large extent reached as a result of the fact that Norway's two Nordic neighbors had applied for membership. She therefore takes the view that it is natural for Norwegian voters also to know the outcome of the referendums in the other Nordic applicant countries before they make up their minds about Norwegian membership. Finland will probably hold its referendum in September. The annual general meeting of the Rogaland Labor Party did not reach any decision about a date for a referendum, while the Hordaland Labor Party yesterday voted to back a referendum after the Swedes and the Finns have voted. Hordaland Labor Party attaches importance to the significance the result in Sweden will have for many Norwegian voters. After the prime minister has heard the views of parties and organizations on the date for a referendum, the government will be swift to recommend a date. The prime minister announced that this recommendation will be made public before the draft bill for a referendum is completed. This will be submitted to the Storting in the course of its spring session. The government already has a majority in the Storting backing the proposal for a Norwegian referendum after the Swedish referendum. The prime minister told the annual general meeting of the Rogaland Labor Party yesterday about how she herself overcame her doubts and said yes in 1972 [year of Norway's previous referendum on EC/EU membership]. She reached her final decision at a gathering at which each of the guests had to outline their views. "One of the contributions made a strong impression on me and finally helped me to reach a decision. The person in question said that he was against membership, because otherwise we could run the risk of bumping into Germans and Italians when hiking on the Hardanger mountain plateau. Then I realized that I would have to think about the future, about the fact that we also have to embrace people from other countries, and that you cannot simply build socialism Norwegian-style. The Nordic countries must make their contribution when it comes to creating peace and security in Europe. In the next round it is the former communist countries in East Europe that are knocking on the door to ensure a better future for their children," Brundtland said. In the same way that her doubts finally ended in a yes in 1972, several central elected officials in Rogaland Labor Party have now overcome their doubts and are saying their yes to Norwegian membership. The majority in favor of Norwegian membership is now very solid in this local party. It is hinted that around 80 percent of those taking part in the annual general meeting have ended up in the yes camp. For those who are still in doubt and who fear for the future if EU policy were to change and come into conflict with Norwegian interests, the prime minister had the following comfort: "If we get into a situation in which we no longer feel welcome in the EU, we can say `Thank you and good-bye.' If there are attempts by the rest of the Union to steamroller central national interests -- something that in principle cannot happen under the terms of the agreement that has now been entered into at the highest political level -- there can be no doubt that we will reach our own conclusions. The EU is an association of independent nations. It makes no difference what the other countries do. It is the Norwegian Storting that in the final analysis decides whether we enter the EU -- or leave it."
