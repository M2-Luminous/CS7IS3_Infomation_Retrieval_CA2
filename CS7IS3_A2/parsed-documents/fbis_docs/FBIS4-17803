Russian Head of Government Viktor Chernomyrdin did not agree today with the demands by several deputies to dismiss Viktor Yerin, the minister of internal affairs. The correspondent learned this from participants in the closed sitting of the State Duma which is debating the circumstances and consequences of the murder of the deputy Ayzderdzis. An interval in the sitting has now been announced. The journalists managed to find out that Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke at the sitting, reading out a message by the Russian president to the Duma in connection with the deputy's murder, and also answering questions from those present. In particular, reacting to the demand for Viktor Yerin's dismissal, the head of the cabinet said that he was not in favor of shuffling the cards. During the interval, the factions will discuss a draft decision of the Duma on yesterday's crime. For the time being it is hard to predict how events will develop. In the view of Vladimir Lysenko, a representative of the Yabloko faction, in addition to the fate of the minister of internal affairs, the issue of the prospects for the signing of the treaty on public accord will inevitably come up during the debate. The deputy believes that under the present circumstances, the treaty has little chance of being signed. As reported, the signing was planned for tomorrow.
