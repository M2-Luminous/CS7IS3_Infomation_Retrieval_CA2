He said: [Begin Chaleun Yiapaoheu recording] Beloved listeners, at 0855 today, high-level assembly delegations of Laos and Philippines held official talks at the National Assembly Hall in Vientiane. The talks proceeded in an atmosphere of close friendship and mutual understanding. In the talks, first and foremost, H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the LPDR National Assembly, on behalf of the National Assembly and the multiethnic Lao people, gave his wholehearted greetings to the high-level delegation of the Philippine House of Representatives on its official visit led by H.E. Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House and concurrently chairman of the ASEAN Parliamentary Federation, which has brought to the Lao people the affection and friendship of the Philippine people. He highly valued this visit and noted that it as a new milestone in the friendly relations and cooperation between Laos and the Philippines. He also highly assessed the success achieved by the Philippine people in developing the country, and hailed the significant contribution made by the Philippines to the Lao people as well as to this region and the world. On this occasion, Saman Vi-gnaket briefed the Philippine delegation on our initial achievements in implementing the state's restructuring policy. He particularly pointed out to the Philippine delegation that, following the implementation of the political and economic restructuring plans, tranquillity has been maintained, the economy and society have been developed, the people's living conditions have been improved with each passing day, the multiethnic people have enjoyed solidarity and harmony, and the country has maintained peace and stability in all respects. Saman Vi-gnaket also informed the guests of the National Assembly's domestic and foreign activities. He recalled the significant roles and responsibilities of the first and the second Supreme People's assemblies and then noted the roles and responsibilities of the third National Assembly. Regarding this, he informed the Philippine delegation of the organizational activities of the third National Assembly, in particular its contribution to establishing laws and the constitution and its activities in following up and controlling the implementation of the constitution and the laws. For the Philippine side, H.E. Jose de Venecia expressed his profound thanks to H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket and the Lao delegation for inviting him to pay the official visit to the LPDR and for the warm, friendly welcome accorded him and his delegation. He informed our Lao side that this visit to Laos was taking place following his visits to the PRC and Thailand. He said: This visit is outstanding and very significant not only for the assemblies of the two countries, but also for ASEAN as a whole. This is because Laos, in the eyes of ASEAN and the Philippines, has maintained a significant role in this region. He further noted that democracy is now being practiced in the LPDR, and that in this regard, the National Assembly has played a significant role in promoting and encouraging the practice of the democratic system. Understanding this fact, H.E. Jose de Venecia has agreed to encourage the Philippine side to set up an embassy in Vientiane at an early date. He said he will present a report to the Philippine House of Representatives and urge the House to endorse funds for the building of the Philippine Embassy in Vientiane. H.E. Jose de Venecia has also invited a delegation of the LPDR National Assembly to attend the ASEAN parliamentary meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Manila, capital of the Philippines, from 16 to 24 September of this year. In addition to the members of the ASEAN group, representatives from the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and India will also attend the meeting. In addition, H.E. Jose de Venecia hailed the Lao leaders for effectively promoting and expanding their roles and responsibilities. As a result, the political status of Laos has been raised to an ever higher level both at home and abroad. Laos' economic foundation has been also increasingly developed to the extent that it can enter the international arena. He hailed the courage, talents, and quickness of the Lao leaders in striving to improve the economy. As a result of the effort, inflation has dropped from 60 percent in previous years to 8 percent this year. This is considered as a success in the economic field. It can be also considered as a significant success for the political agenda, which has brought about the maintenance of the roles and influences of the Lao leaders and the implementation of the popular democratic system in Laos. He also appraised Laos' success in enforcing the constitution and a number of laws which have created the conditions for foreign countries to invest in the LPDR. H.E. Jose de Venecia also gave his views on increasing the relations and cooperation between the LPDR and the Philippines following this visit. On this, he believed particularly that trade exchanges between the two countries should be promoted and that investment should be made directly in the LPDR by the private sector in the form of private businesses or partnerships. In addition, he noted the promotion and expansion of the bilateral trade relations, saying this work is seen as a significant issue for Laos and the Philippines. He recalled that in the history of Laos and the Philippines, the peoples of the two countries have maintained good relations with each other. The Philippines has in the past set up 12 hospitals in Laos. It brought more than 1,000 (?technicians, nurses), and physicians to work in aid projects in Laos. Now, the aid can be increased. In addition, he promised to encourage the Philippine Government, through the House, to grant technical assistance to Laos. [words indistinct] He also pointed out that in the Philippines, there is a project to build some three million living quarters, and said timber is needed for use in building the houses. For this reason, it is likely that Laos and the Philippines will engage in trading timber to serve the said construction work. In addition, he noted that, regarding the promotion and expansion of the relations between the assemblies of the two countries, an association of friendship between the assemblies of Laos and the Philippines may be established, or cooperation and exchange of experiences in the legislative and legal affairs may be carried out. In conclusion, H.E. Jose de Venecia has invited H.E. Saman Vi- gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly of the LPDR, to pay a visit to the Republic of Philippines at an appropriate time. H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket highly apprised and expressed satisfaction with the views of H.E. the speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, and was pleased to accept the invitation for a visit. The Philippine side would later be informed of appropriate time and dates of the visit through diplomatic channels. H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket welcomed the creative views of H.E. Jose de Venecia on issues concerning the promotion and expansion of the Laos- Philippines relations and cooperation in the next stage. This is the successful outcome of the talks held between the two sides in Vientiane this morning. Thank you. [end recording]
