The programme, drafted by the State Planning Commission, involves importing advanced technology and equipment valued at some $30 billion. A large part of the new technology will be used to develop 24 key agricultural projects during the 1994-2000 period. However, the $30 billion buying list also covers other sectors, including energy, machinery and electronics, chemicals, transportation, metallurgy and post and telecommunications. The money to support the immense purchase will come mainly from State foreign exchange reserves and the financial coffers of relevant departments and local governments -- in addition to overseas commercial credits and soft loans from foreign governments and international financial institutions, government officials said. The agricultural technology and equipment will be used for projects across China, including Guangdong, Hainan, Fujian, Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hebei, Liaoning and Gansu Provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The key agricultural projects will focus on integrating farming, animal husbandry, fisheries and forestry with processing and environmental protection in the grain-rich Henan, Sichuan, Fujian, Hainan, Jilin Provinces and the Liaohe River region of Liaoning Province. Also high on the agenda are vital irrigation projects such as the delta projects for the Yellow River, Huaihe and Haihe Rivers; the irrigation programme of the southen Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; the Tongyu River irrigation engineering project in Jiangsu Province; and the farmland irrigation project in Hubei and Hunan provinces. The imported technology will also be introduced to help State farms in Guangdong Province develop tropical crops. The Bohai Bay aquaculture project and the national agricultural-technology popularization programme are also targeted for imports. Other recipients will include the compound-fodder project; the grain storage, transportation and market development project; and the second-stage afforestation project. Additionally, the programme covers the ongoing Taihu Lake flood-protection project in Jiangsu Province; the second-stage red-soil development project in South China; and the Loess Plateau soil-erosion protection and agricultural development project of Northwest China. Finally, part of the imported techniques and equipment will be used for the nationwide seed-breeding development project; agricultural development along the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province; and poverty alleviation programmes in Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
