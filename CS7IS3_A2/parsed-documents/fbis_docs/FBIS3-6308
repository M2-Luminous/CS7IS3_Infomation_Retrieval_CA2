Ramos with domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila--live, italicized passages in Tagalog] [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Sir, in all your past foreign visits, the thrust was to attract investors to invest in the Philippines. In your forthcoming visit to Vietnam, what would be the thrust considering that the Vietnamese are not in a position to invest here in the Philippines? [Ramos] Why, am I going to Vietnam? [laughter] Anyway, seriously speaking, Ellen, in all of our trips, trade promotion was just one of the major goals. But the paramount goal in all of those trips was the improvement of bilateral relations, and that is very important for the Philippines which is in the center of Asia and the Pacific rim. And I think we accomplished those objectives in 1992 and 1993. Another major mission aside from trade promotion, investment promotion, tourism promotion, and improvement of bilateral relations is enhancing our regional stability, security, and cooperation. And this is where such networks and organizations as ASEAN, APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation], EAGA [East ASEAN Growth Area], and now the newly formed ARF which is the ASEAN Regional Forum which includes the dialogue partners of ASEAN participating in the discussion now of defense and security matters which is unprecedented in the more than 25 years of the existence of ASEAN, are matters of extreme importance to the Philippines. Now, of course, it is always nice if you can bring in investments. But in the case of Vietnam, which is the example that you are citing, we must make sure that our bilateral issues pertaining to the restoration of our very close cooperation and goodwill are restored. I think I can safely say that among the countries in ASEAN, it was the Philippines that had very close relations with the Indo-Chinese states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. And this dates back to the early 50s during the time of President Ramon Magsaysay. And that is why the name Filipino in Vietnam, for instance, is associated with being number one. You ask (Percy Picardo) there who was in Vietnam with me. What they said in Vietnam is Filotan number one. Filotan means Filipino. And it's not only because of that assistance that was given by President Magsaysay, but also the initiatives of our socio-civic and veterans organizations. The likes of the Freedom Company; the (Instance) Construction; the OB, or Operations for Brotherhood, still are highly regarded institutions there. So, this is something that we want to renew and certainly enhance. Now, another important reason is we are all neighbors, claimants in a certain area of the South China Sea, collectively now called the Spratlys. I think it is important to pursue again the commitments to the peaceful, joint development, and exploration of the Spratlys. For your information, among the claimants there, it is the Philippines and the Vietnamese that are in closest contact. It's just almost as close as from here to Makati [Philippines' financial district]; the islands that we are occupying are very near. So it's important to make sure that the commitments made in the Manila Declaration of July 1992, which was the foreign ministerial meeting that we hosted at that time and in which the dialogue partners also made similar commitments, be strengthened by these visits. You should also realize that we have hosted tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Vietnamese refugees -- the so-called boat people -- in Palawan, in Morong, Paranaque, and other places. And again, there must be some kind of a dialogue that should take place as to the future of these Vietnamese nationals. There is the matter also of complimentation of our products and raw materials. While generally it is true that we have a similar kind of economy with Vietnam, similar products, and agricultural and mineral resources, there is complimentation that could take place, meaning cooperation to the mutual benefit of both. Inasmuch as right now we are at a higher developmental stage, if you are looking at the entire spectrum of human skills, education, health and medical services, management, banking, and financial services, as well as infrastructure for transportation, communications, etcetera. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Sir, the Thai foreign minister when he was here about a week ago, mentioned about the possibility of getting together the leaders of ASEAN and the Indo-Chinese states? [Ramos] Minister Prasong? [Correspondent] Yes, Sir. [Ramos] Well, as you may recall, I said that already in my speech last May, in the PBEC -- Pacific Basin Economic Council in Seoul -- which was hosted by Korea. Prime Minister Mahathir and I in fact spoke from the same platform on the same morning, and that was the thrust of my message. The CAN concept -- C-A-N, Community of Asian Nations -- was officially proposed by me. And this one is a follow-up of that, this one of Foreign Minister Prasong. [Correspondent] Sir, will this not be a block within, say, APEC? [Ramos] I'll just give you a copy of that speech last May because it's all described there. [Correspondent] Sir, thank you.
