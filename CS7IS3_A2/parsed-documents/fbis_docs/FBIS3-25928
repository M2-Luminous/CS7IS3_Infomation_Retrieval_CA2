The "Resolution on Carrying on the Struggle Against Corruption Further in Depth Across the Province" adopted at a meeting of the Eighth Guangdong Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee this morning pointed out bluntly the seriousness of some corrupt social phenomena. The resolution said: "Some corrupt phenomena in state organs have aroused strong grievances among the public. If these corrupt phenomena are allowed to spread unchecked, they will one day ruin our people's regime." It is disclosed that recently some 23,000 cadres at and above the county and office level in Guangdong underwent a self-examination process, and some 16 percent of these cadres admitted that their behavior in certain aspects did not fully meet the standards as prescribed by the "five rules" set by the central authorities on honesty and self-discipline. This resolution by the provincial people's congress demands that people's congresses at all levels in Guangdong Province take the struggle against corruption as an important part of their supervisory duty and strengthen supervision over the operation of the government, the people's courts, and the people's procuratorates, as well as grass-roots organizations in townships and towns. The ongoing meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth Guangdong Provincial People's Congress has heard reports by departments concerned on recent progress in the anticorruption operation. Some ugly social phenomena and some issues of corruption among some government staff have drawn great attention from members of the people's congress standing committee. Standing committee member Rao Fanzi held that the main reason for worsening corruption is not the lack of applicable laws, but the failure to observe laws. A small number of individuals just fail to rule according to law, and some of those who enforce the law violate the law themselves or engage in illegal activities. Standing committee member Liu Wenqiao noted that practicing extravagance in ceremonies and festivities, vacationing at public expense, and rush purchasing of luxury cars are very common and have become serious problems in Guangdong nowadays. These practices should be checked and redressed.
