On the agricultural issue, Governor Chen stressed: The province's goal of striving for 76 million mu of land sown to grain crops and a total grain output of over 50 billion jin for this year must be attained. We should strive for 6 million dan of cotton. While doing a good job of production, all localities must attach importance to grain and cotton purchases. While doing a good job of grain and cotton production, they must pay keen attention to readjusting the structure of agricultural production, further develop the secondary and tertiary industries in the rural areas, and ensure that all peasants will have an additional income of 100 yuan this year. The governor also urged that banks in all localities should put stress on deposits and continue to rectify the financial order. Financial departments should open more sources of revenue and pay close attention to revenues, and all localities should work hard to develop the "shopping market" and "rice bag" projects in the urban areas and the supply of capital goods in the rural areas, and stabilize the market and commodity prices. At the meeting, Yang Zhengwu, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered an important report on the issues of social and political stability and structural reform.
