Existing DOE procedures for public participation in power rate adjustments (10 CFR Part 903) became effective on September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37835). These power rates are established pursuant to section 302(a) of the DOE Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7152(a), through which the power marketing functions of the Secretary of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) under the Reclamation Act of 1902, 43 U.S.C. 371 et seq. , as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments; particularly section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, 43 U.S.C. 485h(c); and other acts specifically applicable to the project system involved, were transferred to and vested in the Secretary. The main issues raised at public meetings and in written comments included (1) cost projections used in the Power Repayment Study (PRS), (2) water depletion schedules assumed for future power projections, and (3) estimated future prices for purchased power. Western has considered all comments in preparation of the provisional rates. Rate Order No. WAPA&hyph;63, confirming, approving, and placing the proposed Integrated Projects rate adjustment into effect on an interim basis, is issued, and the new Rate Schedule SLIP&hyph;F5 will be promptly submitted to FERC for confirmation and approval on a final basis. Issued in Washington, D.C. October 24, 1994. William H. White, Deputy Secretary.
