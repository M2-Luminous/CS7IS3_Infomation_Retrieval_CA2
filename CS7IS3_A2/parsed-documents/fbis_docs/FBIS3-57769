Embassy under secretary Ali Koprulu evaluating the incidents said Turkish citizens should be calm against provocations. Koprulu said he talked to Belgian Foreign Ministry officials and wanted them to put an end to the outlawed separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's activities in this country. Ten Turkish citizens and five Belgian policemen were wounded in a clash in Brussels on Saturday when Turkish citizens were protesting the outlawed separatist terrorist PKK organization's meeting. Turkish citizens were trying to prevent a meeting of between 150 and 200 terrorists from taking place in a hall in the Saint-Josse area of north Brussels. Turkish citizens became angry when the terrorists attempted to hang a flag outside over the balcony. Police intervened later and dispersed the crowd with a water cannon shortly after midnight. Police officials said many Turkish citizens were taken into custody and several windows and car windscreens were broken. PKK terrorists were taken from the spot in small groups.
