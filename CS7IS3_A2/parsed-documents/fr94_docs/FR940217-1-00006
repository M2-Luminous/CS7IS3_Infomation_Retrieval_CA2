FR940217-1-00006 FR940217-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;61&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives: Piper Aircraft Corporation PA24, PA28R, PA30, PA32R, PA32RT, PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA39, and PA44 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently became aware of an incident in England where the left main landing gear (MLG) collapsed on a Piper Aircraft Corporation (Piper) Model PA34&hyph;200T airplane because of swivel pin failure. At that time, the FAA found no service difficulty reports on airplanes of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. The FAA has since reviewed service difficulty reports of all Piper airplanes that have retractable MLG with the swivel pin configuration (certain PA24, PA28R, PA30, PA32R, PA32RT, PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA39, and PA44 series airplanes), and found two incidents of cracked swivel pins. The purpose of this advance notice is to seek comments from interested persons regarding the best action (if any) to take in order to correct any possible problems with retractable MLG swivel pins. All comments and ideas will be evaluated by the FAA and the FAA will research the situation to decide whether rulemaking is needed. DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;61&hyph;AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted.

Discussion The FAA is currently investigating a possible unsafe condition on Piper PA24, PA28R, PA30, PA32R, PA32RT, PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA39, and PA44 series airplanes that have retractable main landing gear (MLG) with a swivel pin configuration. The MLG collapsed on a Piper Model PA34&hyph;200T airplane that is certificated for operation in England because of MLG swivel pin failure. At that time, the FAA found no service difficulty reports of this type on airplanes of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. The FAA has since reviewed service difficulty reports of all Piper airplanes that have retractable MLG with the swivel pin configuration (certain PA24, PA28R, PA30, PA32R, PA32RT, PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA39, and PA44 series airplanes), and found two incidents of swivel pin failure.
