Stihl praised the chancellor for showing, over the past few years, how important he considers Germany's foreign trade interests, not least during his visits abroad. Stihl said he sees no point in calling for more state involvement in times of difficult economic conditions, but he expects politics not to make life unnecessarily difficult for industry. This should start at home. Good framework conditions in Germany are the best promotion of foreign trade, the DIHT president said. The FRG has made good progress in this respect lately. The economy is gradually recovering. This is partly due to the corporation tax reform, this year's moderate wage agreements, and the enormous amount of rationalization and restructuring carried out by companies. Yet, one must not forget that Germany as a business location has to cope with permanent structural challenges, Stihl said, directing his words in Kohl's direction. In Stihl's view, markets will interlink at an increasing speed due to the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and the successful conclusion of GATT. It is important now that GATT is put into practice as quickly as possible. Free world trade must not be threatened by new criteria, such as environment and social standards. In front of the 700 participants of the DIHT event entitled "Out of Dullness, Fit for the World Market" Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl called on the EU to conduct an internationally open trade policy and advocated basic international employees' protection rights to be more widely observed. This must, however, not serve as a pretext for new protectionism, the chancellor added. Increasing integration of the Central and East European states in the big market of the European Economic Area is a foreign-policy aim of the German EU presidency that starts on 1 July 1994. Kohl decisively rejected calls for direct export and investment subsidies. In the chancellor's view, protectionism and trade barriers in view of ever increasing international competition are short-sighted measures. First, free world trade is essential for an export-oriented country such as Germany, and second, an upswing of the economies of Germany's eastern neighbors means political stability and an insurance against relapses and old contrasts, Kohl said. Stihl announced that German industry will open new delegates' offices in Shanghai, Singapore, and Hanoi. The Warsaw and Ankara offices are to be upgraded to Foreign Trade Chambers.
