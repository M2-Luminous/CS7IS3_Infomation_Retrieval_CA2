The domestic demand in the current year is likely to touch 15.4 million tonnes--slightly higher than last year's 15.25 million tonnes (much below the projected demand) as against the projected demand of 17.3 million tonnes. In the coming year, while the projected demand has been put at 18.5 million tonnes, the planning commission and sail have estimated it to be around 16 million tonnes. In fact, the planned production for next year is likely to be around 16 million tonnes against the domestic capacity of about 22 million tonnes leaving about 6 million tonnes of idle capacity. According to industry sources, the stagnation in demand is mainly due to the recession in the steel consuming sectors like heavy industry, engineering and processing industry as very few new projects require substantial quantities of steel. There has also been a heavy drop in expenditure by the government departments including railways which reduced its steel procurement during the year by 20 percent. PTI
