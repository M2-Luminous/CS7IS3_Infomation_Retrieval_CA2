FBIS4-45164 "jptdd023__l94008" JPRS-TDD-94-023-L JPRS Narcotics 14 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Deputy Warns of Possibility of `Unbridled Reactions' to Coca Deputy Warns of Possibility of `Unbridled Reactions' to Coca Decree PY2405152794 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 14 May 94 p A2 PY2405152794 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS Spanish BFN [Text] La Paz, 13 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, of the Pachacuti Axis Movement, has said that the supreme decree authorizing the industrialization of coca leaves is further evidence of the government's inopportune actions, as it breaks all existing laws by penalizing the use of this product. He added critically that "this decree proves that the only thing the government wanted in the negotiations (with the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation]) was to delay the resolution of this central problem. It is a deliberate lie, because when the lifting of the highway blockade was conditioned on the issuance of the decree, it was said that the text of the decree would be the one that was drawn up with the peasants, who honestly and loyally lifted the blockade. The peasants believed the government's word, but the government has now done exactly the opposite." He went on to say that this decree penalizes coca leaves and goes far beyond Law 1008, because while this law made no provisions on the subject, such provisions have now been made. We can see that the agreement that was reached with the peasants was ignored, based on a decision by the U.S. Embassy which said that it would not permit implementation of a different policy for coca, and this is what we are now seeing. He said that "this is an unbelievable provocation, because the government could have said this before. Instead, it has deceived peasants with a decree that despite enforcing the regulations that were agreed upon, has also penalized coca." To justify his assertion, Barrenechea mentioned Article 2 of the decree, which reads: "The regulations approved by this decree apply to legal coca, and do not entail the legalization of coca. Specific quantities of coca leaves should be industrialized in the traditional zones that are described in Article 9 of Law 1008." The government should have been more sincere, and should have said that it did not need to debate with peasants, as there is an order that must be fulfilled no matter the agreements we may have reached, Barrenechea said. He added: "This decree will probably cause a wave of unbridled reactions by peasants, because maintaining that a government position can be negotiated is very different from accepting a proposal, finding consensus on it, and then doing exactly the opposite. It is like a hidden dagger carried by those who are not sure even of their own program."
