Albinas Visockas, chairman of the new party, said its creation is "an expression of people's despair." In his words, the Socialist Party is "inseparable from the scientific theory of Karl Marx." The socialists condemn anti-communism as "a means to destroy ideological opponents politically and morally. In our view, to compare communism with brutal fascism is nothing but criminal populism and incitement of low instincts of a crowd." The congress adopted a resolution, under the headline "Anti-communism-a source of confusion and global instability," which will reportedly be sent to the United Nations and the Pope. According to the resolution, time has come to evaluate "objectively and honestly" the doctrine of communism on an international level. The socialists regret that the word "communist" has become a synonym of "evildoer and criminal," and anti-communism has turned into a state policy in Lithuania. In another resolution, the socialists said the ban imposed on activities of the communist party in Lithuania was an "antidemocratic act" and a "general political amnesty" should be declared. The communist party was outlawed in Lithuania after a failed Soviet coup attempt in January 1991. Visockas, a Vilnius bakery worker, intends to run for a vacant seat in the parliament, which appeared after Algirdas Brazauskas, former leader of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], was elected as president. Representatives of the LDDP, the reorganized Lithuanian communist party, welcomed the appearance of a new party calling the socialists "dear comrades." The socialists held their congress at the LDDP headquarters in Vilnius. People aged between 30 and 50 with secondary education made up a greater part of the delegates, who reportedly represented 429 party members. Workers make up the nucleus of the new party, which also has several farmers and jobless people among its members.
