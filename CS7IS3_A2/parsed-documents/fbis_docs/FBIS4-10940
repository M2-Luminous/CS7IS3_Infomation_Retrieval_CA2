Would you like to clarify whether the telephones [of ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora] were tapped and also discuss the Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise] telephone bills. The entire country is listening. Go ahead. [Quiroga] Thank you. Good evening, Father. What I showed on national television last night was a request made by the narcotics prosecutor to Entel and Entel's answer on the telephone bills. What we have are the Entel bills, both of the telephones of [drug trafficker] [Isaac] Chavarria at his property in Las Maras, Santa Cruz Department, and his house in Irpavi. Therefore, there was no violation of any constitutional regulation. We had no access to any kind of conversation and this was clarified last night. All we did was to get the Entel bills on the calls made, and this was made through a request by the prosecutor. All the information including the telephone bills will be submitted today to the Controlled Substances Court and a legalized copy to the Constitutional and Chamber of Deputies Judicial Police Committee, where the investigation is being carried out. [Perez] I have a cable from the ERBOL [Bolivian radio schools] news agency on your interview by reporter Carlos Mesa Guisbert last night on state television. Were the telephone calls made only from 1990 to 1991; were there any calls after 1991, in 1992 or 1993? [Quiroga] The telephone calls were from 1989 to 1993. There are also two telephone bills after the presidential term, in September 1993. [Perez] In other words, the telephone contacts between Isaac Chavarria and ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora were before, during, and after his presidential term. [Quiroga] What can really be proven through the prosecutor's request is that El Picacho's [Paz Zamora's house] telephone was called from Chavarria's telephone 10 times from 1989 to 1993. [Perez] You clearly said there was communication between the two telephones and obviously due to Article 20 of the Constitution it was not possible to know who talked on the phones. [Quiroga] It cannot be established who talked from on each end of the telephones. The only thing that can be established is that the two telephones were in contact. It also can be established through the telephone bills how long the calls were because the bills show the time and the amount. But it will be impossible to establish who spoke on the phone. [passage omitted] [Perez] As government minister you are the top political authority in the country and must enforce the Constitution on behalf of the president. Can you guarantee the entire country that in Bolivia no telephones are tapped by anyone and under no circumstances? [Quiroga] By anyone and under no circumstances from the ethical and legal point of view. And also from the technical point of view, we cannot do it because we do not have the equipment in the ministry to do it. I invite you and the media to visit the intelligence services to see that technically we cannot do it. But we would not do it either because of legal and ethical principles. [passage omitted]
