The Hong Kong government has proposed that China lobby more than 70 countries for the permanent abolition of visa requirements for holders of the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BNO) passport and the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) travel document. But a senior government official has revealed that Beijing has shown reluctance to hold talks with other governments on the issue. Beijing has yet to discuss SAR passports, despite numerous requests for talks on the matter by Britain over the past 12 months. And approaches by the British government have been met with silence. But the Hong Kong government fears that China's indifference to the latest request for co-operation could result in future difficulties for Hong Kong people. At present, 71 countries waive visa requirements for BNO passport holders. However, there is no guarantee that the arrangement will continue beyond 1997 as Hong Kong people will be regarded as Chinese nationals and may hold both passports. "The British side's proposal is based on goodwill, aiming to secure freedom of travel for the people of Hong Kong, which is enshrined in the Joint Declaration and essential for Hong Kong's continuous prosperity in future," said a government official. However, a Chinese official said Beijing was unlikely to cooperate with the request because China viewed visa abolition agreements with foreign governments for SAR passport holders as an issue to be dealt with exclusively by Hong Kong's future sovereign power. China has not yet made any unilateral efforts to hold talks with foreign governments on recognition of SAR passports or visa arrangements. But it is understood that Western governments could categorise the SAR passports in the same manner as normal passports issued by Beijing. Among the countries that currently waive entry visas for short stays for BNO passport holders, only Thailand, South Africa and Poland have formal written agreements with the Hong Kong government. Another 10 countries that have visa abolition agreements do so as an extension of similar agreements with Britain. It is still not clear whether such agreements will remain in place after 1997. The ten countries are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Iceland, San Marino, Argentina, and Liechtenstein. The issue will be discussed again at a meeting of team experts of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group at the end of the month, but arrangements will not be made without Beijing's co-operation.
