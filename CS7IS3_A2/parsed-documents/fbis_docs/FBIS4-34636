Dr. Nunez proposes that no relative -- fourth degree of consanguinity and second of affinity -- of the president, vice president, or National Assembly president be appointed Armed Forces chief. Dr. Nunez stated that "to keep civilian and military power from being concentrated in one family, we recommend adoption of the exclusions we just mentioned." The Cenidh representative expressed her concern over "the broad and ambiguous" responsibilities given to the Army with the purpose of "maintaining institutional stability," responsibilities which clearly belong to the police. Nunez expressed her opposition to Army involvement in actions to "reestablish order" as relates to labor or social conflicts. As an example, she pointed to the Sebaco events when several casualties resulted from the Armed Forces' methods. "In no case can the president of the Republic declare an incident to be a mutiny, coup, or so forth and then proceed to mobilize the Army. That is a power of the judicial branch," Nunez warned. With respect to the president's power to order Nicaraguan troops to leave the country or to allow foreign troops to enter national territory, Dr. Nunez recalled the mercenaries going through Puerto Cabezas on their way to the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba. The code must be modified so the president proposes but the National Assembly authorizes. On this issue, Dr. Nunez agrees with other experts who believe the Constitution should have been reformed first and the Military Code approved afterward. The Cenidh also expressed opposition to including the Information Directorate for the Defense (DID) as part of the Armed Forces' structure. Nunez warned that such actions "grant the Armed Forces a level of authority that is not theirs and which is contrary to their very nature. It encroaches upon the authority of the police force as the institution responsible for crime prevention and institutionalizes espionage to a dangerous degree." In the area of penal jurisdiction, the Cenidh is opposed to placing the military justice structure under the chief judge advocate, as that office is subordinate to the Army General Command. The attorney said that "it must be immediately established that all Armed Forces members charged of committing a common crime are to be turned over to the civilian justice system." Regarding social provisions, the Cenidh says this must be accomplished "in accordance with the Constitution and the laws governing the state's administrative functions." The Cenidh proposed drafting a regulatory system for providing social security benefits to Armed Forces members and their families. Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar and Deputy Police Chief Eduardo Cuadra also appeared before the commission. The extent of their participation regarding military justice was to request that the police be allowed to go before the judge advocate to have that person decide what justice system should handle specific crimes committed by policemen. During the hearings, about 200 Liberal Constitutionalist Party activists protested outside the National Assembly building to demand that the Military Code be rejected.
