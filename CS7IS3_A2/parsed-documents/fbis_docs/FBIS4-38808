Nine Azerbaijani troops were wounded and four others were killed in the incident. Gasan Gasanov described the Armenian Armed Forces' attack as an act of banditry. He said: The military operation has taken place in a locality which is very far from Daghlyk Karabakh. It occurred while Azerbaijan strictly adheres to the agreement on the imposition of a cease-fire. Consequently, it conflicts with the talks that are held within the CSCE framework, in which resolutions are drawn up and adopted for a political solution to the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Gasan Gasanov urged the UN, the CSCE, and other international organizations to condemn the Armenian militarists' aggressive activities and take measures to obstruct Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan.
