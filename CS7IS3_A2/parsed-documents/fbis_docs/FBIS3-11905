The actions carried out by Indonesia in the NAM presidency, dashed the doubts on the movement's validity following the end of the East-West confrontation, Eumelio Caballero, chief of the Cuban Foreign Ministry Multilateral Affairs Directorate, told PRENSA LATINA. The diplomat pointed out that there is an increasing awareness of the revitalization of the NAM and of the need for those countries -- which represent four-fifths of the people in the world -- to continue their efforts to attain space in the new world order. He highlighted the active participation of the NAM countries in the United Nations and underscored that the movement participates in every UN group working to revitalize and democratize that important world organization. After a period of inactivity during Yugoslavia's presidency (1989-1992), the interests of the NAM countries reappears at a time when a unipolar world is trying to ignore the rights of Third World countries, he added. Although the East-West confrontation has disappeared, Caballero said, the movement has its own agenda which includes both the promotion of North-South economic talks and the reduction of political conflicts. The ministers meeting in Cairo has on its agenda a [word indistinct] summit in Jakarta, held in September 1992, and will decide the city where the next NAM summit is to be held. Nicaragua had requested to organize the 11th summit but, at the meeting in the Indonesian capital, pleaded economic and political problems and still has to confirm whether it maintains those plans. Regarding the next NAM headquarters, Caballero said it was important to elect a president that is able to continue the active and efficient work done by Indonesia. The Cuban diplomat also referred to the meeting of the so-called group of the president's friends, which was held in Jakarta last February. This initiative had positive results, because it allowed an important number of NAM member countries to exchange ideas on problems that will be broached at the ministers meeting in Cairo, he said.
