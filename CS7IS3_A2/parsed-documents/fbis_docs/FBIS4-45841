Four strains of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi were isolated from viscera of rats and trombiculid mites. At the same time, the antibody against Rickettsia tsutsugamushi was assayed in the sera of the local people and the wild rats. The positive rates were 15.2 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively. The above results showed that a natural epidemic focus of scrub typhus exists in Hunchun area.
