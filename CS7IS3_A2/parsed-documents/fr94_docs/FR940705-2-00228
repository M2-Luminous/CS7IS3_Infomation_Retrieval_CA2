FR940705-2-00228 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Personnel shall be required to read and follow instructions on BL2&hyph;P practices and procedures. All procedures shall be conducted in accordance with accepted greenhouse practices that are appropriate to the experimental organisms. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;b. Records (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1). A record shall be kept of experimental plants, microorganisms, or small animals that are brought into or removed from the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2). A record shall be kept of experiments currently in progress in the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(3). The Principal Investigator shall report any greenhouse accident involving the inadvertent release or spill of microorganisms to the Greenhouse Director, Institutional Biosafety Committee, NIH/ORDA and other appropriate authorities immediately (if applicable). Reports to the NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Documentation of any such accident shall be prepared and maintained. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;c. Decontamination and Inactivation (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;c&hyph;(1). Experimental organisms shall be rendered biologically inactive by appropriate methods before disposal outside of the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;c&hyph;(2). Decontamination of run-off water is not necessarily required. If part of the greenhouse is composed of gravel or similar material, appropriate treatments should be made periodically to eliminate, or render inactive, any organisms potentially entrapped by the gravel. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;d. Control of Undesired Species and Motile Macroorganisms (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;d&hyph;(1). A program shall be implemented to control undesired species (e.g., weed, rodent, or arthropod pests and pathogens) by methods appropriate to the organisms and in accordance with applicable state and Federal laws. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;d&hyph;(2). Arthropods and other motile macroorganisms shall be housed in appropriate cages. If macroorganisms (e.g., flying arthropods or nematodes) are released within the greenhouse, precautions shall be taken to minimize escape from the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;e. Concurrent Experiments Conducted in the Greenhouse (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;e&hyph;(1). Experiments involving other organisms that require a containment level lower than BL2&hyph;P may be conducted in the greenhouse concurrently with experiments that require BL2&hyph;P containment provided that all work is conducted in accordance with BL2&hyph;P greenhouse practices. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;f. Signs (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;f&hyph;(1). A sign shall be posted indicating that a restricted experiment is in progress. The sign shall indicate the following: (i) the name of the responsible individual, (ii) the plants in use, and (iii) any special requirements for using the area. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;f&hyph;(2). If organisms are used that have a recognized potential for causing serious detrimental impacts on managed or natural ecosystems, their presence shall be indicated on a sign posted on the greenhouse access doors. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;f&hyph;(3). If there is a risk to human health, a sign shall be posted incorporating the universal biosafety symbol.
