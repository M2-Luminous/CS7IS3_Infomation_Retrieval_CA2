It adds that the visit also carries an implicit message, addressed to the Syrians and Palestinians in particular, that Israel can compete for their strategic ally if it wishes. In Saturday's editorial, AL-AHRAM says during his visit Rabin convinced the Russians to agree to mediate with Syria on searching for missing Israelis from previous wars. In addition there are reports that Russian officials have promised Rabin that, for the time being, they will refrain from selling any advanced aircraft to Syria. The editorial, however, doubts that Russia will honor its promise because of its economic situation, which makes it willing to sell weapons to any buyer. The paper expresses its belief that, despite several technical agreements signed between the two countries, there are factors that will limit the advancement of Russian-Israeli relations and their talks on cooperation in the armament sector. AL-AHRAM notes that current Russian policy has revised its retreat from and strong stands against Arab causes that were adopted at the end of Gorbachev's term and right after the Soviet Union's collapse. Furthermore, the paper says, Israel has no major interest in having Russia participate forcefully in the region's peace process.
