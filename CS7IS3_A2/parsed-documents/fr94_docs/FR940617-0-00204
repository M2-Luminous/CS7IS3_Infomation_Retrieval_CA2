(6) Good engineering practice requires that the cause for any discrepancy greater than # 2 percent must be found and corrected. §89.423&hyph;96 CVS calibration frequency. The CVS positive displacement pump or critical flow venturi shall be calibrated following initial installation, major maintenance or as necessary when indicated by the CVS system verification (described in §89.352&hyph;96(e)). §89.424&hyph;96 Dilute emission sampling calculations. (a) The final reported emission test results are computed by use of the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.024 Where: A wm = Weighted mass emission level (HC, CO, CO 2 , or NO X ) in grams per kilowatt-hour. g i = Mass emission level in grams, measured during the mode. WF i = Effective weighing factor. kW-hr i = Total kilowatt-hours (kilowatts integrated over time) for the mode. (b) The mass of each pollutant for each mode for bag measurements and diesel heat exchanger system measurements is determined from the following equations: (1) Hydrocarbon mass: HC mass = V mix × Density HC × (HC conc /10 6 ) (2) Oxides of nitrogen mass: NO Xmass = V mix × Density NO2 × KH × (NO Xconc /10 6 ) (3) Carbon monoxide mass: CO mass = V mix × Density CO × (CO conc /10 6 ) (4) Carbon dioxide mass: CO 2mass = V mix × Density CO2 × (CO 2conc /10 2 ) (c) The mass of each pollutant for the mode for flow compensated sample systems is determined from the following equations: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.025 E:GRAPHICSer17jn94.026 (d) Meaning of symbols: (1) For hydrocarbon equations: HC mass = Hydrocarbon emissions, in grams per test mode. Density HC = Density of hydrocarbons is (.5800 kg/m 3 ) for # 1 diesel, and (0.5746 kg/m 3 ) for # 2 diesel, assuming an average carbon to hydrogen ratio of 1:1.93 for # 1 diesel, and 1:1.80 for # 2 diesel at 20 ○C and 101.3 kPa pressure. HC conc = Hydrocarbon concentration of the dilute exhaust sample corrected for background, in ppm carbon equivalent (that is, equivalent propane times 3). E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.027 Where: HC e = Hydrocarbon concentration of the dilute exhaust bag sample or, for diesel heat exchanger systems, average hydrocarbon concentration of the dilute exhaust sample as calculated from the integrated HC traces, in ppm carbon equivalent. For flow compensated sample systems ( HC e ) i is the instantaneous concentration. HC d = Hydrocarbon concentration of the dilution air as measured, in ppm carbon equivalent. (2) For oxides of nitrogen equations: NO Xmass = Oxides of nitrogen emissions, in grams per test mode. Density NO 2 = Density of oxides of nitrogen is 1.913 kg/m 3 , assuming they are in the form of nitrogen dioxide, at 20 ○C and 101.3 kPa pressure. NO Xconc = Oxides of nitrogen concentration of the dilute exhaust sample corrected for background, in ppm: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.028 Where: NO Xe = Oxides of nitrogen concentration of the dilute exhaust bag sample as measured, in ppm. For flow compensated sample systems ( NO Xe ) i is the instantaneous concentration. NO Xd = Oxides of nitrogen concentration of the dilute air as measured, in ppm. (3) For carbon monoxide equations:
