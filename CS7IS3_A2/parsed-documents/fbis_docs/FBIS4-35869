Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that two explosive devices were hurled at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] patrol last night, but nobody was hurt. Disturbances broke out a short time ago in Ramallah. A soldier sustained light wounds from a stone and glass splinters when a military vehicle was stoned in the center of town. One of the soldiers opened fire to extricate the vehicle from the stone throwers. Border police forces restored order with tear gas and rubber bullets. There have so far been four people lightly wounded and they were transferred to Ramallah hospital. The IDF this morning prevented a group of Jordan Rift Valley settlers from entering Jericho in a convoy bearing Israeli flags thereby protesting the fact that at the weekend the IDF prevented one of the settlers from passing through Jericho with an Israeli flag. Earlier, there was a clash between Israeli policemen and the demonstrators when the former tried to prevent Palestinian vehicles from traveling with PLO flags along roads in the Jordan Rift Valley.
