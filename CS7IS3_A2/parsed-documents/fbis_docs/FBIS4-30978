The Air Force brigade has thus received its fourth aircraft in a little over a month. On 27 April the unit received three ZLIN 242 sport planes. The purchase of these aircraft was agreed upon approved by the former defense minister. The LET-410 plane arrived in Brnik at 1200 on Wednesday. In addition to helicopters, the Air Force brigade is equipped with seven aircraft: three antiquated UTVA 75's, three ZLIN 242's, and the new LET-410. We could not find out the price of the new two-engine, high-wing, light transport-passenger plane. However, we have learned unofficially that the aircraft manufacturer, Narodni Podnik of Kunovice, demanded about $800,000. We doubt very much that the final price amounted to much more than $500,000. The Czech manufacturer used to build these aircraft mostly for the Soviet Union and therefore had a surplus stock as a result of the Soviet Union's collapse. [passage omitted]
