Good evening. [Falandysz] Good evening to you [addressing Skowronski], and to you, Ladies and Gentlemen. [Skowronski] What will be the consequences of the parliament's rejection today of the president's constitutional initiative? [Falandysz] It would be hard to predict all the consequences, but it is not true what Sejm Speaker Oleksy says when he talks about rejection of initiatives being a routine type of measure by the parliament, and that it happens often. The truth is that as far as I can recall, it has never happened that a presidential initiative would have been rejected. The point is that a presidential initiative comes from an organ of state power which is elected in popular elections, so it is not just an ordinary legislative initiative but quite a special one. Naturally, the rejection....[Falandysz pauses] The parliament and the majority there can do anything it wants to that is completely legal, except that, in my view, it is quite incomprehensible and also unreasonable, and quite arrogant, when you think about it. That is because I cannot think of a reason for having done such a thing--that in effect amounted to prohibiting the president from joining the debate on what he had proposed. After all, the situation was that the debate was cut off and the initiative was not forwarded to the appropriate Sejm commission. So by doing this, the parliamentary majority demonstrated it does not want to conduct a dialogue with the president on constitutional issues--and that is exactly what is painful. [Skowronski] And what will be the consequences of that? [Falandysz] Well [words indistinct] [Skowronski, interrupting] What kind of conclusions will the president draw from that? [Falandysz] What I think is that questions must be asked about the future of the president's cooperation with the National Assembly's Constitutional Commission, if constitutional issues are what we are talking about here. Well, it so happened that yesterday, Sejm Deputy Jaskiernia very strongly emphasized that the president will be coresponsible for the Constitution since, after all, he is participating in designing the document. Well, the point is he does not have to participate. Of course, the president has not made a decision on that yet, but he is empowered to discontinue his participation in the Assembly's Constitutional Commission; he can withdraw his representative there--that is myself. I will then have less work to do. He is also empowered not to put forward any initiative or to withdraw the one he had submitted.... [Skowronski, interrupting] And what will that mean in turn? I mean what if the president decides to withdraw your participation from the proceedings of the.... [Falandysz, interrupting] Well, that will mean that the constitution will be designed without the president's participation. Perhaps Mr. Kwasniewski will be happy with that, and perhaps he will say: Who needs the president anyway? At least nobody will get in our way. We will manage without him. But that will be a significant event. I think the president is fully empowered to act this way because the Sejm acted in quite a determinant way--let me put it this way--and they refused to talk to him. And with the Sejm additionally not making it easier to submit other extraparliamentary initiatives. By the way, both Mr. Oleksy and Mr. Kwasniewski had said that as far as constitutional issues are concerned, there should be compromise, national consensus, and joint work. Forgive me, but how is one supposed to view today's decision by the Sejm in the light of those declarations? [Skowronski] Yes, but it so happens that Sejm Speaker Oleksy and Aleksander Kwasniewski voted in favor. How did it happen that the leaders voted in favor whereas all the other Sejm deputies for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] voted against? [Falandysz] You know, I do not know why. That is their secret. You should ask them first of all. They are bound to know what happened. [Skowronski] But it was a strange situation. [Falandysz] Well, if you allow me to speculate a bit here--I am not saying that this is what really happened--there are just two possibilities: Either the gentlemen, all the SLD leaders--I mean the elites, the deputies club's leaders, there is a whole elite there--voted in favor of the president, which would be very nice. The only problem is that either the elites' views are different than the rest of the deputies club, or its big majority, and that is of course a bad thing to happen since it means they have no control over the deputies club. The other possibility is that they have conspired in a cunning and Machiavellian way, along the lines of: Gentlemen, it wouldn't look good if we were to vote against, so we will vote in favor, but you, gentlemen, should vote against and this way we will save face and it will look like we of course love the president. Except that is not only a fraud, but it is also a kind of cowardly behavior since one is afraid to declare one's views publicly. So either way, there is a pathology involved in this. [Skowronski] Does today's vote and the rejection [of the president's initiative] mean a substantially new situation on the political scene? [Falandysz] I do not think so. As I said, the president will think about whether to cooperate with the Constitutional Commission. It is an open question as to how the other parties will act--I mean the parties outside of the circles of the governing coalition or the Union of Labor [UP], I mean those parties whose votes indicated that they were kind of willing to support the president's initiative. Despite their criticism--the Democratic Union [UD] is especially characteristic in that regard--they were all very critical but they were all almost unanimously in favor of at least debating the initiative and of sending it to the appropriate Sejm commission. After all, that would not amount to enacting it into law. One must also consider whether these parties should also [hesitating] not do some thinking about their role in the drafting of the constitution since the role is indeed marginal. The parties are dominated by a huge majority, so their coauthorship is nonexistent. In that sense, this may bring about some additional consequences. [Skowronski] Perhaps we should try to explain what the president's initiative was all about. [Falandysz] In essence, the initiative was quite straightforward. It was initiated with the idea in mind that under the concept of direct democracy, the president will have his contribution. Well, it is not the president but UP that began tinkering with a law on the procedures for enacting and preparing a constitution, which had been enacted some time in the past. They also proposed a preconstitutional referendum. The president said: All right, a referendum is a form of direct democracy, but there is another form as well, which is less well known and applied less frequently; it is called Citizens' Legislative Initiative; in this case it would apply to the constitution. According to the initiative, a group of 100,000 citizens--it could be bigger than that, it does not matter, but it would have to be some organized centers outside of the parliament--could submit their constitutional drafts to the Sejm commission and they would have their representative on the commission whose rights would be the same as those of the president's, the government's, or the Constitutional Tribunal's representatives. To my amazement, yesterday everyone said of that initiative: Of course, we are in favor of democracy, and so forth. But what they did not like a lot was the second .... [Skowronski, interrupting] You mean item number two [words indistinct] [Falandysz] Exactly. Of course, that is also a debatable issue. But the debate was cut off extremely quickly, as if they were afraid to continue with it. Namely, the president used to say: Under a situation where [hesitating] it is the parliament that is kind of responsible for the constitution--or to be more exact, the significant constitutional majority in the parliament, since it is only they that enact a constitution--then in that case, if the referendum's outcome is negative for them, then they should be dissolved by force of law. Of course, that situation [of the Sejm's dissolution] may happen anyway, because if the Constitutional Commission and the governing coalition are left completely on their own with the constitution, that is if the others decide to leave, and if they lead to a referendum, which, it is true, would be a very good referendum from their standpoint since....[Falandysz pauses] Perhaps they will get rid of referenda now, I do not know. So even if they lose the referendum, that would not mean anything to them, they will be able to continue with the proceedings as if nothing happened: We lost a referendum and so what? A constitution is the basis for all laws, it is a country's fundamental law. And if the Sejm is not capable of [hesitating] recommending--let me put it this way--such a law to the nation, then I have no idea how the Sejm should be capable of enacting laws of lesser importance. It is a very comfortable situation [for the Sejm majority] since most probably, the goal is to survive [hesitating] for four years at any cost. Four years is the magical number in this case. [Skowronski] Yesterday, the president visited the parliament to take part in the constitutional debate. He had not been there for three months, I think. Was that the president's last visit to the parliament? [Falandysz] You know, it would be hard to say no, at least under that kind of situation [laughing]. As you know, I have no intention of making jokes on this, of course. There are history books where one can read about that. But as far as the [hesitating] normal type of situation is concerned, I mean when a president comes to visit a friendly parliament. By the way, Speaker Oleksy gave the president a very warm reception there and he said: As you can see, Mr. President, we decided to deal with all of your initiatives as absolute priorities. We are very much in a hurry. [Skowronski] We are dealing with them, and then they go to the waste basket? [Falandysz] Exactly. So that is interesting, and Mr. Oleksy no longer smiled at today's press conference. It is not a good situation because there are signs that our prominent SLD leaders are kind of losing touch; they seem to have such a good presence and be so European, but it does not quite work for them. [Skowronski] What do you mean when you say the SLD leaders are losing touch? [Falandysz] You know, I would put it this way: Mr. Kwasniewski for instance seems to think that the internal coalition agreements are more important than the president's constitutional powers. He often says: The coalition decided on this, or that, and the president is supposed to follow what the coalition has decided. My question is: How on earth did he figure that out? You know why I am amazed? Because this is an example of the old Marxist thesis on the supremacy of politics over law. Kwasniewski learned about that at some point, and he continues to have it in his mind, to the effect that once the coalition decided something, that is the way it has to be. But I am saying: That was the situation under the Polish People's Republic [PRL]. As regards the Sejm's role, the situation in the times of PRL was that the Sejm was the organ of supreme authority, and that provision was included in the Constitution. Now Sejm Speaker Oleksy seems to be beginning to believe that he is the organ of supreme authority. My answer is: There is no such thing as the organ of supreme authority. We have a division of powers in effect in Poland; there are three kinds of powers and one must gradually get used to that. I hope this is just a temporary forgetfulness on his part. [Skowronski] And what if it is not? [Falandysz] If it is not, then I suppose the education process would have to be extended. After all, we are all learning democracy. I am not saying that I or anybody like me already knows everything there is to know about democracy. Of course, people make mistakes, but you know, when an individual makes a mistake, even if he is the president, that is very human because an individual is entitled to make a mistake. But when you have the case of a body of people making mistakes and acting like [hesitating] someone malicious or envious, that is a bad thing to happen, I mean when a majority makes unreasonable decisions. I remember that in the period of martial law, I think it was Professor Lopatka [a male] who was running around the Sejm saying: The Sejm can do anything, it can even pass a law which would say that I am a female. Now what I say is: Of course it can do that, but it would make no sense at all. The Sejm is empowered to reject a presidential initiative and that is a legal thing to do, except that it makes no sense at all. [Skowronski] How will one live in a country where the president has disputes with the parliament? The president will fail to show up in the parliament and all the governing coalition will think about is how to eliminate him. [Falandysz] You know, there is nothing bad about it. There is a rule in effect in many democracies, that the president does not enter the parliament at all and does not pay visits there. In Poland, under some remnants of the previous system, the president used to pay visits to the parliament, and he even enjoyed it and felt comfortable. But after the most recent incident, I think he will not enjoy it as much. But let us not overreact when it comes to having disputes. In my view, these are the usual symptoms of political competition. You know, here is how I would reflect on this: Perhaps this [hesitating] whole sudden measure by the Sejm....[Falandysz pauses] What did it prevent, for instance? Well, it prevented, for instance, the National Commission of Solidarity--which had established an alternative constitutional commission of its own--from taking a serious measure. The trade union can easily gather 500,000 signatures under a constitutional draft, if the draft is of a specified, easily propagatable nature. I do not suppose that was the goal, but there will be more political events in Poland in that regard, and unfortunately one must remember that President Walesa is not any kind of friend either to Mr. Oleksy, or to Mr. Kwasniewski, or to the people associated with the two of them. Historically speaking, they were always on opposite sides, and right now it is precisely that group which makes all that happen. I mean the people who feel very self-confident because of their gigantic majority. [Skowronski] So are you saying the old divisions are coming back now? Or are these old divisions under new labels? [Falandysz] I do not know that. I think that it just so happens in life that people who used to be in power, want to be back in power. I am not saying that....[Falandysz pauses] You know, I do not use terms like postcommunists or communists--these are misleading labels. But the fact is that they want to be back in power under a different situation, and they are fully entitled to that, since we are in a democracy. But if it is their plan for instance to [hesitating] eliminate President Walesa--I mean eliminate in legal and constitutional terms--then to be honest, that is not a nice intention to have. [Skowronski] Do you think such an idea has emerged? [Falandysz] I do not know that. You would have to ask those gentlemen who keep smiling. But of course, they will not tell you. They will smile and say: But Mr. President, that is absolutely not true; we would do anything for you. But they do something different behind his back. That unfortunately is also a certain trait that is inherent in politics. We will see as time goes by--perhaps there will be better times. [Skowronski] Today, Aleksander Kwasniewski said, in the aftermath of statements by [presidential spokesman] Drzycimski, or by the president, that things are no longer merry and funny, they are scary now. What is the scary part about, according to Aleksander Kwasniewski? [Falandysz] I do not know; you must ask him about that, too. I do not know what he got scared of. Perhaps he got scared of his own courage and of the discipline in his own deputies club? I just do not know. [Skowronski] We will talk about all that during the breakfast show. Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski will be here, and also you [addressing Falandysz] will be here, so we will have a chance to talk about all that. [Falandysz] I hope so. [Skowronski] So we will talk about that at more length, and right now, I thank you for the conversation. [Falandysz] Thank you very much. [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today has been Professor Lech Falandysz, minister of state in the President's Office.
