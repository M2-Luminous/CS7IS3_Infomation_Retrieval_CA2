FR940830-1-00039 FR940830-1-00005 ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Boeing: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 767 series airplanes equipped with off-wing escape slides, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly jeopardize successful emergency evacuation of an airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 18 months after November 25, 1992 (the effective date of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327), inspect the off-wing escape slide door opening/snubbing actuators in accordance with OEA Service Bulletin 3092100&hyph;25&hyph;002, dated July 26, 1991. Repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 20 months until the replacement required by paragraph (c) is accomplished. For operators that have previously accomplished this inspection in accordance with AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17: This paragraph requires that the next scheduled inspection be performed within 20 months after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. (b) Within 18 months after November 25, 1992 (the effective date of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327), inspect and modify the escape slide compartment door latching mechanism in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25A0174, dated August 15, 1991. Accomplishment of the actions required by this paragraph prior to the effective date of this AD terminates the actions required by paragraph (b)(2) of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. (c) Within 2 years after the effective date of this AD, replace the currently installed door opening actuator of the emergency off-wing escape system with a new, improved actuator, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25&hyph;0216, dated February 3, 1994. Accomplishment of this replacement terminates the repetitive inspection requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD. (d) As of 2 years after the effective date of this AD, only door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system having OEA part number 5262100 (Boeing part number 5416T208&hyph;12) shall be installed on any airplane. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on August 23, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
