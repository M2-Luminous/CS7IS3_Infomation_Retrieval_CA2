A united European social democracy has a different view of the Maastricht treaty from that of the Social Democrats Against the European Union (SME), according to the Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland in this interview with ARBEIDERBLADET. The fight over Norwegian membership in the European Union [EU] is in full swing. Many think it will be decided by the labor movement. Within the Labor Party there are broad differences in the point of view of the party leadership and the Social Democrats against the EU, where Hallvard Bakke is a well-known figure. VG [VERDENS GANG] hinted last week that the Labor Party's patience with SME soon ought to be over. Jagland disagrees with the advice: "The nonsocialists are asking with increasing loudness when my patience with the SME will be at an end -- in the hope that it will come to an end.... They hope that this matter will create problems for us by dividing us. ``However, there is no end to my patience. We have to live with this kind of tension; it is part of life. We are going through a dramatic transition period, and it would be artificial if we were in total agreement on these questions. It would be strange if it was not difficult for the Labor Party to accept Bakke's point of view. On the other hand, it is strange that there are no people visibly in favor of the EU in the SV [Socialist Left Party], and that is their problem right now.'' Thinks Alike [Jagland] When it comes right down to it, the difference between me and Bakke is not so great. We think alike in many ways. [Johnsen] In other words, Bakke will be a good man to bring into the EU? [Jagland] Yes, it will be good to have Hallvard with us because of his critical view of the conservatives' way of dealing with unemployment issues. [Johnsen] Do you think the SME should have unlimited freedom in the Storting group also? [Jagland] With respect to the referendum and our work in the time prior to that, we need complete freedom. However, in the Storting group normal rules of play must be in effect. In the Storting chamber there is the usual party discipline; that question has been decided. Moreover, we do not view the SME as a part of the party organization, but as a "no" organization in which party members participate. Within the party there is nothing called the SME. Different View [Johnsen] SME thinks that the EU embodies a liberal market policy. How can you advocate membership in the EU if this is correct? [Jagland] As far as I understand, the SME thinks that it is the objectives of the Maastricht treaty concerning a low increase in prices, reduced budget deficits, and the foreign exchange policy that will prevent us from carrying out an active employment strategy. The united social democrats in West Europe hold a totally different view in this matter from that of the SME. We think that those objectives are a precondition for having a more active employment policy. We cannot solve employment problems by promoting growth driven by inflation. Demand-driven growth is a classic example of private demand being inflated in order to increase employment. This period in our history is over. It is contrary to any sensible environmental policies. On the contrary, we should promote growth driven by investments; growth resulting from goal-oriented focusing on objectives that will create jobs while at the same time improving the environment. Just think of the enormous amounts of money the EU is currently investing in improvements of the energy network in Europe. This will create growth and jobs, while at the same time improving the environment because energy will be used more effectively. As in Norway [Jagland] As far as the budget deficit is concerned, the Maastricht treaty subscribes to more or less the same policy we have had in Norway that aims to reduce the deficit in combination with actively focusing on promoting employment. We have to squeeze the government money out of entitlements and into active employment initiatives. But if we have gotten no further than thinking that the rich countries in the world should continue to finance their own welfare by more and more borrowing, we really are in a crisis situation. It is a fact that when we have these big budget deficits we borrow for our own welfare. If our goal is not for the rich countries to finance their own budgets, at least we should quit talking about the environment and about solidarity with the poor countries. In that case what we have is pure egoism; egoism that involves continued borrowing by the rich countries to the detriment of the poor. Short-Term Thinking [Jagland] As to the third item, foreign exchange policy, the SME talks about us relinquishing our right to devalue our currency. However, what happened in the 1980's showed what the result of fluctuations in the exchange rates led to. It resulted in all decisions, whether taken by business leaders or politicians, being based on short-term considerations. Nothing was being considered besides the exchange rates on the following day, and the fact that all decisions were based on short-term considerations was one of the main reasons why unemployment grew. And nothing can be more capitalistic and market oriented than watching the exchange rates and then raking in the profits from that. New Liberalism [Johnsen] What you are saying now in fact, is that the SME arguments concerning a more relaxed attitude toward inflation, deficit, and exchange rates in reality is more typical of market-driven liberalism than the Maastricht treaty? [Jagland] Yes, in my opinion that is just what it is. First, one is talking about an old-fashioned policy of growth; with demand that ruins the environment without solving unemployment problems. And at the same time one allows currency speculators to run a good part of the world's economy. If one quits using slogans, one will see that market liberalism gained a foothold for two reasons. One was the fact that foreign exchange rates began fluctuating, the other that movement of capital was freed up. These two things taken together are what we in a nutshell call neoliberalism. If we want to get rid of neoliberalism we shall have to deal with both these things. Not Radical [Johnsen] But the SME's point of view is uniting many among the Labor Party extremists. How does this fit in with what you are saying about liberalism? [Jagland] You must ask the SME about what is so radical about having a high rate of inflation with ensuing high interest rates, and a high deficit that undermines the national economy while at the same time strengthening the private economy. If one wants government control, one must talk on this level and try to create stability. Only then one will be able to govern. I will also mention how we were able to govern during the period we often call the golden age of social democracy, which covers the period from just after the war up through the 1970's. We call this the golden age mainly because we had progress every year. The government had much direct control, but the main reason was that it was possible to plan for the long run. Einar Gerhardsen [Norwegian prime minister] knew what the krone was worth year by year, inflation was 2-3 percent and interest rates were correspondingly low. Then both the government and business could plan for the long run. That is how we had stability, and that was called control. We must return to such stable conditions. We are trying to do this through the Maastricht treaty's economic and monetary union. We adhere to the fact that stable prices and the attendant low interest rates are necessary -- and this will lead to a smaller deficit. Common Interests [Johnsen] You say that in reality the Maastricht treaty has more room for the social democracy's policy of control than for liberal policies? [Jagland] That is my clear understanding. But the union is a framework that all responsible powers can use. In today's Europe the labor movement and industrial capitalists have common interests directed against speculators who constitute a threat against both parties. One has tried to unite these common interest groups in the treaty. Those are the groups with broad, social interests, those who think long-term, and who are not just considering short-term profit. Misunderstanding [Johnsen] The SME maintains that the EU has decided to let market forces solve the problems connected with unemployment. Is this correct, and how does this agree with your view of the EU? [Jagland] No, that is a fundamental misunderstanding. In this case policies carried out by each individual country have been confused with what the EU stands for. When looking at the actions of the EU, there have been several attempts on the part of the European Commission to achieve a more active employment strategy. Jacques Delors has proposed a massive increase in the EU's budget with a view to increasing investments and initiatives that would lower unemployment. But this has met with no response from the conservative governments in West Europe. In other words one must determine what is what. One item is the employment policy of the conservative governments. Another item is the white paper from the commission, which was an important step in the right direction. It did not include everything and we disagreed with some of it. But it did include much of the program submitted by the social democrats for putting Europe to work again. The white paper was diluted by the EU's ministers of finance, and we are dissatisfied with the result, but that too is a step in the right direction. Friedman's Thoughts [Johnsen] What about the SME's contention that unemployment was caused to a great extent by the EU's anti-inflationary policy? [Jagland] There are two important reasons why unemployment in Europe increased. One is the short-term view we talked about. The other is because most welfare states maneuver themselves into a tight spot because of deficit spending. There was no money with which to fight unemployment. The conservative governments let things slide. They did not even attempt to regain stability by resorting to changing foreign exchange policies. Milton Friedman was the most important monetaristic thinker and his ideas received priority: Currency rates should float completely freely. What also should have been done was to actively use public budgets to fight unemployment. Instead, budgets were cut back. Unemployment rose and so also the budget deficits. Active Policy [Johnsen] But the Maastricht treaty provides no guidance for direct, active measures against unemployment. Can one achieve results without that? [Jagland] As social democrats we want active employment policies, and we think the Maastricht treaty should have a supplementary policy that includes this. In this instance SME and we agree. The social democrats agree on the treaty's objectives. [Johnsen] Well, the SME is really also against the Maastricht treaty's objectives.... [Jagland] Yes, but I really do not understand that. The treaty's objective is a premise for an active policy against unemployment. [Johnsen] How can the social democrats create a more active employment policy in the EU when the conservatives are holding back? [Jagland] If the Nordic countries join, the picture will be different, especially if there is a political change in Germany. It is quite possible that there will be a social democratic government in Sweden this fall; this is already the case in Denmark, and some time in the future, there is a possibility in Great Britain also. Even in the short run many things might happen. Moreover, it is a misunderstanding to think that the social democrats were alone in creating the welfare states in Europe. In Europe there is a cultural and historical basis for a broad front of social democrats and a nonsocialist center against uninhibited capitalism. The social democrats are an important factor, but they could not have done the job without help from the nonsocialist center. Restrictive Measures [Johnsen] Speculators constitute a big problem for currency stability. What would you do about them? [Jagland] It is possible to implement restrictive measures, but one country cannot do it alone. I do not think one can say that free movement of capital is here forever. We must see if it is possible to initiate restrictive measures on an international scale. The best remedy, however, would be to return to the situation we had after the war when exchange rates did not fluctuate so much. We came close to having a form of common exchange. The dollar was set, and everybody tied their exchange rate to it. ECU Is Good [Johnsen] In other words: You think that the controversial common currency -- the ECU -- would benefit the states in their fight against speculators? [Jagland] Yes, that is my understanding. We have reached a historical point when we must ask ourselves if we should not do what was done a couple of hundred years ago when it was determined that a meter was a meter and a kilogram a kilogram. The way it is now, having technology that enables us to transfer billions across the borders within a second, we must have some bold objectives where foreign exchange is concerned: To decide that a krone is a krone. The most important realization today is the fact that the amount of capital is so huge and unconstrainable by borders that no country can do anything alone. We must coordinate exchange rate policies by regions. If the EU creates stability in Europe, the EU can also spearhead a movement of recreating a system of global stability, which can regain national financial power from the speculators.
