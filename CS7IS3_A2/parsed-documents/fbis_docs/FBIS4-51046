The Amur is a river on the Sino-Russian border, and Khabarovsk City is located on the northern bank on the middle reaches of the river. During the years when relations between the two countries were tense, this was the frontier of military confrontation filled with the smoke of gunpowder. Today, border trade and various forms of economic cooperation have replaced conflicts, turning the Amur River into a river of friendship that links the feelings of the two peoples. The Khabarovsk border region is graced with enchanting sights, covers an area of 824 square kms, and has a population of more than 2 million, 80 percent of which lives in the city proper. Densely forested, the area abounds in such resources as coal, zinc, and gold. Its industry is dominated by metallurgy, machine-building, aircraft manufacturing, electric cable production, petroleum refining, and woodworking, while fishery, deer-raising, and commercial hunting are also booming sectors. On top of the fairly developed shipping and air transportation services, the trunk line of the celebrated Trans-Siberian Railway crisscrosses the southern part of the region. Khabarovsk, with a population of 600,000, is the capital of the border region, as well as the largest industrial city and one of the transportation hubs in the Far East. In Russia's drive for economic reform, the Amur River has taken the lead in opening up to the outside world. Pisarenko [name as received], deputy director of the region's Foreign Economic Liaison Bureau, told us: The Khabarovsk border region has established economic cooperation and trade with 42 countries and regions, of which China is the largest economic and trade partner. Pisarenko said exuberantly: The trade volume between the Khabarovsk border region and China accounted for 45 percent of the region's total foreign trade volume in 1993, rising by 340 percent from $115 million in 1992 to $391 million in 1993. The trade structures of the two sides complement each other, with the border region primarily exporting steel products, plants and equipment, nonferrous metals, and timber to China, and importing daily necessities and food from the latter. The female deputy director said: Following the termination of the border region's traditional economic ties with western Russia and the CIS countries, rail freight has risen steadily, rendering the region's economic relations and trade with China increasingly important in the absence of self-sufficiency in industrial and agricultural production. What we witnessed here is not only the conduct of barter trade with China, but also a growing interest on both sides in the establishment of joint ventures. By January this year, 199 Chinese-funded enterprises had been established in the border region, accounting for 45 percent of the total number of foreign-funded enterprises. Of these, 144 are joint ventures, and 55 are wholly Chinese-owned. Registered assets total $11 million, or 10 percent of the region's total foreign registered assets. Moreover, experienced Chinese vegetable growers and construction workers have begun to demonstrate their skills in the Khabarovsk border region. The reporters visited the largest country market in Khabarovsk City. Several thousand stalls were neatly arrayed in this market covering an area of some 20,000 square meters, where vendors hawked their wares incessantly and customers jostled each other. Most of the goods were clothing and other daily necessities. In addition to local people, stall proprietors included Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian nationals. The local official accompanying us on the trip said: High-quality and inexpensive daily necessities and food produced by China have greatly enriched the border region's market; however, the reputation of Chinese goods has also been sullied by some poor-quality commodities. The local government official said: Most of the Chinese-funded enterprises in the region carry out trading activities, and the number of enterprises engaged in commodity production is too small. Quoting Peter the Great during an interview with these reporters, the Russian presidential representative in the Khabarovsk border region, said: "The more a country conducts foreign trade, the better its people's lives will become." He expressed the hope that people on both sides of the river, who have a century-old history of border trade, would further expand mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade. With the clouds illuminated by the setting sun, the picturesque Amur River seemed to be singing the song of long-running friendship between people on both sides of the river.
