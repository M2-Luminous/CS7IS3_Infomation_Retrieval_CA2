New Mexico Principal Meridian T. 14 N., R. 13 E., Sec. 5, lots 3, 4, S1/2NW1/4, and SW1/4; Sec. 6, lots 1 to 5, inclusive, SE1/4NW1/4, and S1/2NE1/4. The area described contains 618.30 acres. In exchange for these lands, the United States will acquire the following described private lands in Taos County from Edward and Mary Gavin of Santa Fe, New Mexico. New Mexico Principal Meridian T. 29 N., R. 11 E., Sec. 2, SE1/4; Sec. 11, E1/2E1/2, E1/2W1/2NE1/4, NE1/4NW1/4SE1/4. The area described contains 370.00 acres. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 19, 1994. The public land has been identified for disposal in the Taos Resource Area Management Framework Plan and the private land is located within an area identified for retention and consolidation. The public land is surrounded by private land and receives little use except for grazing by the Gavins who will relinquish their grazing permit prior to completion of this exchange. The private lands provide habitat for deer and antelope and a winter area for elk. The exchange will not impact any local or Federal planning. The lands to be exchanged are approximately equal in value, however, upon completion of the final appraisal any difference in value will either be compensated for by acreage adjustments, payment of money or by other arrangements that would be in the public interest. Lands to be transferred from the United States will be subject to the following terms, conditions and reservations: 1. All minerals shall be reserved to the United States, together with the right to prospect for, mine and remove the minerals. 2. A right-of-way for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United States Act of August 30, 1890 (26 Stat. 391, 43 U.S.C. 945). 3. The right of the United States, its contractors and assigns, including the New Mexico State Historical Preservation Officer (SHPO) to require that the patentees conduct mitigation measures on the identified culture sites prior to any surface disturbance of said sites. Publication of this notice segregates the public land from the operation of the public laws, including the general mining laws, but not the mineral leasing laws, for a period of 2 years from the date of publication or upon issuance of a patent whichever occurs first. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Detailed information concerning the exchange and land report is available for review at the Taos Resource Area Office, 224 Cruz Alta Road, Taos, New Mexico 87571, phone (505) 758&hyph;8851.
