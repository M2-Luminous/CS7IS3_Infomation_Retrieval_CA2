The meeting was attended by representatives of the United States, Russia, Japan, the European Union, Israel, and the state of Palestine. The conferees discussed ways to provide financial and material aid to help the Palestinian police perform their duty in the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. They also discussed ways to make the donor states speed up the provision of the assistance they have promised and to encourage other states to help the Palestinian police. Rami Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the meeting, told MENA that the conferees also discussed the equipment and supplies the Palestinian security forces need to do their job. High among these needs, he said, is money to pay the policemen, provide transport, and buy fuel, communications equipment, and accommodation for the force. Mr. Rami Sha'th said that in the first year alone, the Palestinian police force needs about $180 million to do its job. He said the amount promised by the donor states is much less than that needed by the force. He said a three-phased program for the work of the Palestinian police has been drafted. The first program, he explained, began early this month and will continue until mid-June. The second phase extends from mid-June to next May; and the third begins in May 1995 and ends one year later. He said the aim of these phases is to enable the Palestinian police and security forces to perform all their duties in Gaza and Jericho. The Palestinian official said the Palestinians have so far received 200 American vehicles and technical assistance from Saudi Arabia in transporting soldiers from several Arab countries to Gaza and Jericho. It was agreed with the Germans to hold a bilateral meeting to discuss German assistance, which is motorbikes for the police, Sha'th said. He said another meeting will be held with the Spanish side, which will donate vehicles and communications equipment. He added that the European Union promised to provide 10 million European Currency Units (about $12 million), 5 millions in cash and the other 5 millions in equipment and supplies.
