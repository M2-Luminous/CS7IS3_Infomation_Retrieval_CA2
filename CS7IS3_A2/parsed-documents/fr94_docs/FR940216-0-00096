FR940216-0-00096 FR940216-0-00010 A party presumed liable may establish an affirmative defense by showing that it did not cause the violation, that the party's product transfer documents were proper, and that the party carried out a quality assurance program to monitor the per-gallon minimum and maximum standards of the gasoline under the party's control. A more detailed description of the liability and defense provisions relating to carriers is included below. The final rule specifies the manner in which penalties will be determined for violations of the final rule. These penalty provisions include calculations of the number of days of violation, and presumptions regarding the properties of gasoline. The remainder of Section V of the preamble discusses major changes from the enforcement provisions that were proposed in the supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking published at 58 FR 11722 (February 26, 1993). The following portion of this section also responds to a number of significant public comments on the enforcement provisions contained in the 1993 proposal. Responses to other significant comments EPA received are contained in a separate ``response to comments'' document that has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. A. California Enforcement Exemption In the February 26, 1993, notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA proposed to exempt refiners, importers and blenders of ``California gasoline'' from certain enforcement provisions in the proposed federal reformulated gasoline regulations. The Agency generally proposed that ``California gasoline'' would mean gasoline subject to the State of California's reformulated gasoline regulations that was either produced within the State or imported into the State from outside the United States. The proposed California enforcement exemptions were based on the Agency's comparison of the estimated emission reduction benefits of California's Phase 2 reformulated gasoline program with those anticipated from the federal phase I reformulated gasoline program, using the federal complex model proposed in the NPRM. The California Phase 2 program establishes standards for eight gasoline characteristics_sulfur, benzene, olefin, aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygen, RVP, T50 and T90_applicable starting March 1, 1996. EPA's analysis indicated that California Phase 2 gasoline will have a greater emission reduction benefit than federal reformulated gasoline. This analysis also indicated that, in the case of VOC, toxic and NO X emissions performance, California Phase 2 gasoline has a greater emissions performance reduction than federal phase I gasoline, compared to Clean Air Act base gasoline. EPA's review also indicated that the California oxygen ``flat limit'' of 1.8 to 2.2% will in practice be equivalent to the 2.0% minimum oxygen content required by the Act. See 58 FR 11746&hyph;7 (February 26, 1993). The Agency proposed that, effective with the start of California's Phase 2 program, regulated parties would be exempt from meeting the enforcement requirements dealing with compliance surveys (section 80.69), independent sampling and testing (section 80.70(c)), designation of gasoline (section 80.70(d)), marking of conventional gasoline (section 80.70(g)), downstream oxygenate blending (section 80.72), record keeping (section 80.74), reporting (section 80.75), product transfer documents (section 80.77), and antidumping record keeping (section 80.105) and reporting (section 80.106). 42 Between the January 1, 1995, start of the federal program and the March 1, 1996, start of the California Phase 2 program, EPA proposed a more limited set of exemptions from federal enforcement requirements, specifically the compliance survey and independent sampling and testing requirements (sections 80.69 and 80.70(c), respectively). 42 The numbering of many provisions in the proposed regulations has been changed in the final rules. For example, proposed §80.69 is now §80.68, proposed §80.70(c) is now §80.65(f), proposed §80.70(d) is now §80.65(d), proposed §80.70(g) is now §80.65(g), and proposed §80.72 is now §80.69. Cross-references in the final California enforcement exemption regulation have been revised to reflect these and other numbering changes in the final reformulated gasoline regulations. The Agency also proposed a number of restrictions on the applicability of the California enforcement exemptions. First, the exemptions would not apply to gasoline sold in California and produced at a refinery located within the United States but outside California. Similarly, the exemptions would not apply to gasoline produced in California but sold outside that State. Second, the exemptions would not apply to gasoline produced under a two-year (March 1, 1996, through February 29, 1996) extension granted to small refiners under the California regulations. Third, the exemptions would become null and void (i.e., they would not apply to any California regulated party) if any gasoline formulation certified by the State using a predictive model or vehicle testing does not comply with the federal reformulated gasoline standards. Fourth, the enforcement exemptions would cease to apply to a party granted a variance by California unless EPA granted relief for extraordinary circumstances under section 80.73 of the federal regulations. Fifth, a regulated party that is assessed a penalty for a violation of either the California or federal reformulated gasoline requirements would lose its enforcement exemptions. (Such a party could petition the Agency for relief from this result, for good cause.) Sixth, the California enforcement exemptions would apply only during the time that the federal phase I program remains in effect (i.e., until the year 2000), subject to extension in a later rulemaking. The February 26, 1993, NPRM contains a more detailed discussion of the California reformulated gasoline program, the Agency's comparison of the emission reduction benefits of the California and federal programs, and the proposed California enforcement exemption provisions. That notice also includes a detailed rationale for the proposed exemptions and restrictions. See 58 FR 11747&hyph;11750.
