The decision to hold the meeting is included as a special point in the final declaration of the fourth ministerial meeting between the Rio Group and the EU that was made public this evening, despite the meeting lasting until 23 April. The ministerial meeting, the fourth since the talks between the Rio Group and the EU were institutionalized through the Declaration of Rome in 1990, is taking place in the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) headquarters in this city, with the participation of all the Rio Group foreign ministers. The trade meeting should take place before the end of the year with the participation of the vice ministers of foreign trade of the 13 member countries of the Rio Group -- the main Latin American political and economic forum -- and the 12 EU countries. When expressing their interest in holding a new meeting among economic and trade experts from the two blocs, the participants at the fourth ministerial meeting said this kind of "specialized forum of continuous dialogue has been very useful in exchanging ideas about current affairs and matters of common interest." The trade meeting's main objective will be to determine the new context of international trade after the signature on 15 April in Marrakech of the GATT pacts and the creation of the World Trade Organization. The effects of the European market's unification process on Latin American exports also will be analyzed at the trade meeting. The Rio Group asked for more trade meetings between the two blocs because after two meetings of foreign trade vice ministers in Brussels they had not defined an agenda for more similar meetings. The Latin American countries said the meetings were useful to "study the effects of the unified European market and the future expansion of the EU, as well as the regional integration programs and free trade zones of Latin America."
