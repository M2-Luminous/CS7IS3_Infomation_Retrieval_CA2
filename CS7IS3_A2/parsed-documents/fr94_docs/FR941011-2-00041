Texas Gas and Unocal propose to abandon an interruptible exchange service, pursuant to an exchange agreement dated November 5, 1985 (Agreement), of up to 15,000 Mcf per month of natural gas. Texas Gas states that under the Agreement it delivered up to 15,000 Mcf per month to a location at or near Unocal's Bayou Pigeon Meter Station located in Iberia Parish, Louisiana and received equivalent quantities of gas from Unocal at the Bayou Pigeon delivery point, at a delivery point in the Lake Pagie Field, or at other mutually agreeable locations. Texas Gas also states that the term of its Agreement coincided with the term of a gas purchase contract, with Unocal, involving gas reserves in the Bayou Pigeon Field. Texas Gas asserts the gas purchase contract expired on November 1, 1993, and thus the Agreement also terminated on this same date. Texas Gas and Unocal state there is no abandonment of any facilities pursuant to the instant application. Comment date: October 21, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. CNG Transmission Corp.

CNG states that NFG Supply currently transports local production gas to its affiliate, National Fuel Gas Distribution (NFG Distribution), for distribution of approximately 325 consumers in the Village of Wilcox, in Jones Township, Elk County, Pennsylvania. CNG further states that NFG Supply serves these consumers by utilizing CNG's B&hyph;5 and B&hyph;M7 lines. Because of the age and condition of these lines, and a declining supply, NFG Supply desires to retire these lines. CNG proposes to construct a four-inch tap, measuring and regulation station and add approximately 150 feet of 4-inch connecting line from CNG's pipeline system near the Village of Wilcox. This would replace the gas supply delivering it through the new facilities to NFG Supply so that NFG Distribution could continue serving its consumers in Wilcox and vicinity. CNG states that the estimated cost of the construction is $124,596.00, and that NFG Supply has agreed to reimburse CNG. Comment date: November 14, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 3. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.
