It damaged the establishment and adjoining buildings. According to reports by neighbors, the attack is said to be the result of a "trade war" between companies engaged in the same trade. One of the company managers, Antonio Gomez Dolzer, said: "We have received telephone threats for a long time. Some shots were even fired at the front of the building four months ago." For reasons of jurisdiction, police Precinct No. 12 is conducting an inquest into this case. Federal Police bomb squad personnel were called when the explosion occurred.
