The international environment organisation said yesterday substitutes for ozone-depleting CFCs, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), were themselves harmful to the global environment. HCFCs, used as substitutes for CFCs in producing foam insulation for household refrigerators and in commercial refrigeration, destroy stratospheric ozone. The chemicals are subject to phase-out by the year 2030 in industrialised nations. Greenpeace said HCFCs produced now would add to ozone layer depletion in the next 10 to 20 years and claimed that any additional use of these substances is environmentally irresponsible. HFCs, promoted as alternatives to CFCs, cause global warming. According to Greenpeace one kilogramme of HFC134a has the global warming potential of 3,200 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas. It said environmentally safe alternatives, which exist, should be preferred as substitutes for CFCs over these ``interim'' substitutes. Greenpeace yesterday claimed that parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer were falling back on their commitment to protect the ozone layer. ``Despite some progress made on funding for ozone-friendly technology transfer and development in developing nations, the parties appear to be backsliding on their most fundamental objective -- phasing out all ozone-depleting chemicals and bringing on line environmentally-sound technology as rapidly as possible,'' said Michael Affleck, Greenpeace International ozone coordinator. Mr. Affleck said efforts to establish firm criteria for adopting permanent, ozone-friendly alternatives rather than interim chemical substances that have adverse environmental impact might have been blocked in some developing countries which were able to secure renewed and increased funding for technological transfer to phase-out CFCs. He said it was developed nations which would benefit from the transfer of technology. These countries, mainly the producers of the interim substitutes and exporters of the technology, would be able to take back their money contributed to the Multilateral Fund through the selling of the interim chemicals and the technology to developing nations. He questioned why parties to the Montreal Protocol did not begin to use environmentally sound alternatives now instead of waiting until 1995 when a review is scheduled of control measures applicable to the developing countries with respect to HCFCs, HBCFs and Methyl Bromide. Greenpeace's arguments about action to reduce ozone-depleting substances came at a time when the fifth meeting of parties to the Montreal Protocol is being held in Bangkok by the United Nations Environment Programme. Kamal Nath, India's minister of the environment and forests and president of the fourth meeting of parties to the protocol, earlier told a press conference that the protocol was on the way to successful implementation, although some countries have yet to join and the Copenhagen Amendment, which agreed environmentally safe alternatives should replace the interim substitutes, has yet to be ratified. Mr. Nath, however, said that even though there was a need to phase out CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances, industries could not switch overnight and the protocol should not adversely affect industrial strategies of developing countries.
