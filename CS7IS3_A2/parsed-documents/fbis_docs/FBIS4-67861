The senior Chinese official said there would be no nuclear war nor armaments on the Korean peninsula at a lunch meeting with National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop. ``China is strongly opposed to it (North Korea's nuclear weapons development),'' he was quoted as saying. He stressed a peaceful solution to the problem while acknowledging the difficulties ahead. Speaker Yi, saying China's growing economy would be affected if war erupted on the Korean peninsula, reiterated Seoul's call for Beijing to play a greater role in persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program. Wu was invited to a dinner banquet later by ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil to meet more DLP members.
