ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board) is publishing proposed regulations governing retirement benefits court orders. The proposed regulations contain a number of procedural changes which reflect the Board's experience in processing retirement benefits court orders, as well as changes in Federal tax law. The proposed regulations will establish a new Part in the Code of Federal Regulations replacing existing regulations regarding court orders. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to: Michelle C. Malis, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 1250 H Street NW., Washington, DC 20005. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michelle C. Malis (202) 942&hyph;1658. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Board administers the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), which was established by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), Pub. L. 99&hyph;335. The provisions governing the TSP are codified primarily in subchapters III and VII of Chapter 84 of Title 5, United States Code. The TSP is a tax-deferred retirement savings plan for Federal employees that is similar to cash or deferred arrangements established under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Sums in a TSP participant's account are held in trust for that participant. 5 U.S.C. 8437(g). Under 5 U.S.C. 8467(a), payments from the TSP that would otherwise be made to a TSP participant shall be paid ``to another person if and to the extent that the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment or legal separation, or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation expressly provide.'' A related provision, 5 U.S.C. 8435(d), states that an election or change of election of TSP benefits shall not be effective to the extent that it would conflict with ``a court decree of divorce, annulment or legal separation *␣*␣* or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree *␣*␣*.'' The TSP need only honor court orders or decrees meeting the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 8467(a) and 8435(d) if the Executive Director receives proper notice of the order before disbursement of the participant's account. These proposed regulations address only court orders and decrees described in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467. Such orders and decrees are referred to in the proposed regulations as ``retirement benefits court orders.'' These are to be distinguished from ``alimony and child support orders,'' which are governed by 5 U.S.C. 8437(e)(3). Proposed regulations governing alimony and child support orders will be promulgated in a separate subpart of Part 1653. The current proposed regulations, when effective, will supersede the interim regulations presently found at 5 CFR 1650.27 to 1650.43. Section by Section Analysis Section 1653.1 states the purpose of the proposed regulations. The procedures set forth in the regulations will be applied in determining whether the Board must honor orders purporting to constitute retirement benefits court orders described in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467. The regulations also establish procedures for calculation and payment of awards pursuant to qualifying retirement benefits court orders. Section 1653.2(a) sets forth the general rule that only ``qualifying'' retirement benefits court orders will be honored. If an order is determined not to be qualifying, it will not affect the participant's account. TSP participants involved in divorce proceedings, and their representatives, are encouraged to read the TSP publication, ``Information About Court Orders,'' to obtain useful information for drafting and submitting court orders that will be deemed qualifying under the regulations.
