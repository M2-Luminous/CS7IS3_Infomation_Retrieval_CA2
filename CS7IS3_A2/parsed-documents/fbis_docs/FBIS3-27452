A senior government official from the Guangxi Autonomous Region told this newspaper that the explosion took place at 8:35 yesterday morning in the rain shelter outside Nanning Railway Station, and that the man involved was Liu Yong, a 44-year old native of Jiangsu. He wanted to buy a ticket to return to Jiangsu that day but failed to get one and thus became depressed. With the very crowded conditions of Nanning Railway Station, he became very annoyed, subsequently "lost control of his faculties," and ignited a grenade which he had been carrying with him, injuring 23 individuals and himself. A witness on the scene, Wei Yanhua, a cleaning woman working for the train station, was quoted as saying that, before the explosion, she saw Liu Yong take a rusty grenade out of his brown bag and begin to play with it, and she approached him to ask him to stop. Liu Yong said that it was only a toy and would not explode. As Wei Yanhua was on her way to report the case to the police, the grenade exploded. According to the Nanning police, they still have no idea as to where Liu Yong got the grenade. Liu Yong himself was hurt rather seriously but all the others suffered only minor or slight injuries. Nanning police said that Liu Yong was a "person who had sneaked in from outside," who "might suffered from mental illness." The senior official from the Guangxi Autonomous Region Government said that, after the incident took place, the Liuzhou Railway Station Public Security Department and the relevant departments of Guangxi Region and Nanning City have already strengthened the measures to divert passengers in the big railway stations such as Nanning and Liuzhou. At present, Liuzhou and Nanning Railway Stations are very crowded. These railways are the only travel option for the "Sichuan army," "Guizhou army," and "Yunnan army" as they flock to Guangdong and Guangxi to "work." More than 10,000 passengers currently depart from Nanning Railway Station every day. In addition, the regional transportation department organizes buses to help divert the passengers. The senior official said that, since the spring festival, passenger trains coming in and out of Guangxi have been seriously overloaded. A great number of workers have traveled a great distance, and compartments which according to the regulations can only accommodate 200 people have often squeezed in 500-600. This has made the air inside the compartment very dirty, to the extent that some passengers have became distraught and some have even jumped out of the train in order to breathe. (According to statistics, from 1 to 6 February, 19 passengers in Guangxi became distraught, three passengers died, one passenger was injured, and five passengers disappeared. It is believed that the number of passengers who became distraught at other times but failed to be counted would exceed this number.) This leading official also said that they have heard nothing about the tragedy in Hunan's Hengyang Railway Station, in which people were trampled to death on the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, and that they have not received any circulars from the relevant quarter.
