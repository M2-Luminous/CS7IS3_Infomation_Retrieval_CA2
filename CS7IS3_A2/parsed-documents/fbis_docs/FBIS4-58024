The JANA international affairs editor commented on this, saying: This campaign is merely a repeated attempt on the part of Britain to falsify the truth and abolish rationality. This attempt is governed by a colonialist logic based on misrepresentation, deception, and turning the given facts upside down, if what gave rise to the British Government's rancor was the contact of a certain party with the IRA. As it recently confessed, it was in official contact with this organization at a time when it was describing it as a terrorist organization and anyone who had contact with its members as a terrorist who supported terrorism. But if the matter is related to aid from one party to another, in Britain's history and the behavior of its governments are matters which make it the first to be condemned and the first against whom a campaign should be waged motivated by the anger of peoples rather than those campaigns based on falsification. It has been noticed that it was Britain who received and provided support for the Iranian opposition. Now it is trying to cover up this stance by waging its propaganda campaign against Iran. When it raises the Irish issue in this framework, it is trying at the same time to deceive peoples' minds by diverting attention to the essential cause of this problem which is its occupation of Ireland and its determination to colonize this country and deny Irish people the right to self-determination and then has recourse to pinning its evil actions on others. The Editor added that what Britain is complaining about today is its own doing, as it is the one which occupied Ireland and the Irish people did not go to occupy Britain. It is also the state which built an empire on colonizing peoples and draining their wealth and is now reaping what its hands committed and that empire and its limbs were cut off by the struggle of peoples for freedom and independence. Britain has collapsed to the point where it retreated to its capital London and in front of which it is taking in its doorstep and might even retreat to beyond this capital unless it submits to the logic of right and law and abandons its behavior ruled by the colonialist and guardianship mentality and becomes aware of the fact that the resistance by the Irish -- whose fire is burning as the result of its occupation -- is not caused by Iran or anyone else. Britain has no other way to get out of this situation apart from ending its occupation of Ireland and letting the Irish people achieve self-determination.
