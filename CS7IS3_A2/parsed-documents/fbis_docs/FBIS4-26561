He expounded China's stance on negotiations on issues of the new airport, No. 9 Wharf project, the legislative election of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, choice of the Chief Executive and the press freedom in Hong Kong after 1997. With respect to the Sino-British negotiations on the new airport of Hong Kong which had attracted broad attention, Mr. Lu said the Chinese side had been always hoping to solve the issue of the new airport of Hong Kong as early as possible through the Sino-British negotiations. Since liabilities left for the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by the Hong Kong authorities in its financial budget for the new airport greatly surpassed HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars], a solution to this issue was yet to be reached. The Hong Kong authorities now expressed to increase investment in the new airport project, thus making it possible to reduce liabilities to be left for the future government of the region. Therefore, the issue of the new airport could be expected to be settled soon. But settlement of this problem depended on the British side's cooperative stance and actual move. When talking on the issue of the legislative election of Hong Kong, Mr. Lu stressed again the Chinese side advocated an "orderly and gradual" democratic electoral method with an aim of realization of the smooth transition as well as maintaining stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. As for the issue of what are characteristics qualified for the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region apart from those requirements stipulated in the Basic Law, Mr. Lu answered the candidate for such a post would be required to have administrative management experience, to enjoy a high reputation among the Hong Kong residents and be acceptable to the majority. The Chief Executive should be elected by the Hong Kong residents in accordance with the Basic Law. With regard to the press freedom of Hong Kong after 1997, Mr. Lu said the Basic Law had relevant provision about this issue and what was common practice today would still be practiced after 1997. It was impossible to imagine that all six million Hong Kong residents were in favor of socialism. On the contrary, the majority of Hong Kong residents were probably not for socialism. However, he said, he believed that most of the Hong Kong residents would be surely in favor of "one China, two systems". The Hong Kong residents may express their own opinions freely, but it would be impermissible for any one to take actions trying to use Hong Kong as a basis to subvert the Chinese government.
