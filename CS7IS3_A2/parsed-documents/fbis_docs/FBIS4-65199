In the tiny Bonn representative's cubicle the bombastic flag appears a sheer parody. It is out of all proportion--and that is why it suits Moellemann. The FDP [Free Democratic Party] land chairman of North Rhine-Westphalia knows about the lofty effect of national symbols. But he does not know what a thin line separates the lofty from the ridiculous. So it appears simply comical when he--after the embarrassingly close reelection at the Dortmund land party congress on the weekend before last--announces he will "decide" only in May whether he will be a candidate for the FDP presidium at the party congress in Rostock. His opponents found it just as amusing that he--after the resignation of Education Minister Rainer Ortlieb--informed the German public that he had been asked, but was ready to assume the office only under certain conditions. "If he had taken it on," says an influential party caucus colleague, "he would have fallen on his face." Even his mentor, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, was furious when Moellemann traveled across the country announcing that the FDP must proclaim its honorary chairman as presidential candidate. This is what Klaus Kinkel meant when he thundered at the Dortmund party congress that "there was too much chatter." Moellemann was deeply wounded that the party chief dressed him down in public: "That was a demonstrative affront." He felt his offer of comradely cooperation had been meant seriously. Kinkel's threatening answer ("I shall take you at your word, Mr. Moellemann"), and the storm of applause caused by it, knocked for a loop the chairman of the FDP land association with the largest membership. "There he hit me with a straight right." But Moellemann would not be Moellemann if he did not simply swallow the insult. No one has to explain to him how to turn big defeats into small gains. An embarrassing ballot result? Are 59.6 percent not a majority? His relations with Kinkel? If the party chairman declares important political decisions--such as the issue of the presidency or the coalition statement--to be an executive matter and takes them on himself, so be it. But then, in Moellemann's logic, he also has to suffer the consequences by himself. Is it not true that he tried repeatedly to have personal talks with the chairman, to signal his willingness to cooperate? He had tried to gain access to him "with an open heart," but nothing had transpired except for a noncommittal "Mr. Moellemann, we need you." Still, he does not want to stay on a confrontational course: "We will just have to try again," he forces himself to say, "for the sake of the FDP." Had he not warned them? Had he not made noises against the premature coalition announcement in order to avert danger to the FDP? Had not the parliamentary caucus chairman, Hermann Otto Solms--who called Moellemann's criticism "damaging to the party"--said the same thing on this subject, but without being reprimanded? He did not miss what started to happen in Dortmund: "I don't sit on my ears." First came the letter by the parliamentary caucus chief, publicly calling for coalition discipline. Then he heard how General Secretary Werner of Cologne was being belabored to run as an opposing candidate. On the Wednesday before the party congress, members of the Cologne bezirk committee talked for hours with Hoyer in the Ratskeller at Cologne's Alte Markt, to persuade him to run. But he did not want to. Kinkel had let him know that, although he had nothing against an opposing candidacy, he wanted to keep Hoyer as general secretary. "If Werner had run," bets Cologne Liberal Walter Klein, "he would have been elected and Moellemann would be gone." But it was not only the intrigues in the land association, not the "operative preparatory work," and not the blows by Chairman Kinkel which almost shot down the superliberal from Muenster. He was punished because, even in the disguise of Cassandra, he was never seen as the friend concerned about the party's welfare, but rather as some well-known variant of Juergen Moellemann: the frustrated man who never got over the fact that Kinkel instead of him managed the rise to the top; the know-it-all who appears aggressively dogmatic even when he is right; the agile public relations leader whom one cannot take into one's confidence or tie him into it because he publicly talks about joint agreements for his own advantage. It agitates him greatly that he has become dispensable in Bonn, within the coalition as well as in the party. And it is no consolation to him at all that he is experiencing personally what he has been predicting for his party in the fall election: That no one who does not maintain his profile is any longer important in Bonn. The advice of a friend, to throw in the towel and use his talents for his own gain, has no effect on him whatsoever. To quit politics? "I cannot do that," says Juergen Moellemann, "for I have been associated with the club too long."
