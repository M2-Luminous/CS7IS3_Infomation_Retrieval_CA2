FBIS4-51929 "dreas087__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-087-A Daily Report 1 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Dialogue With DPRK Supported Over Sanctions Dialogue With DPRK Supported Over Sanctions OW0405134494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 May 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0405134494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] A MAINICHI SHIMBUN opinion poll shows nearly 70 percent of the respondents want the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program to be resolved by dialogue and not by sanctions. As regards Japan's participation in the UN Security Council as a permanent member, while 45 percent of the respondents said they "support" it, 43 percent said they "don't have an answer." This indicates that the public does not yet have a full understanding of the issue. MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide survey by interviewing 3,000 eligible voters on 22-24 April, with 76 percent responding. Regarding North Korea's nuclear arms development program, 26 percent said they are "greatly concerned," and 43 percent said they are "somewhat concerned." Thus a total of 69 percent of the respondents were found to be concerned about the issue. On the other hand, the proportion of respondents who said they were "not much concerned" amounted to 20 percent, and those who said they are "not concerned at all" totaled 10 percent. When asked about ways to resolve this issue, 71 percent said: "Concerned nations should continue dialogue with North Korea to persuade it to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." This number substantially exceeded the 13 percent of respondents who said: "Economic sanctions must be taken against North Korea." Only 4 percent said: "There is no need to ask North Korea to accept inspections." Broken down by the political parties supported by the respondents, 17 percent of the Liberal Democratic Party supporters and 16 percent of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] supporters replied "economic sanctions must be taken," while high rates of 85 percent of Japan New Party supporters and 82 percent of Sakigake [Harbinger] supporters replied "it should be resolved through dialogue." Compared with when the last poll was conducted in September 1993, the proportion of respondents who "supported" Japan's participation in the UN Security Council as a permanent member decreased by 2 points to 45 percent. The number of those who "opposed" it also decreased by 1 point to 10 percent. However, the number of respondents who said they "don't have an answer" regarding Japan's participation totalled 43 percent, an increase of 5 points over the last poll. Among male respondents, 55 percent said they "supported" it, 11 percent said they "opposed" it, and 31 percent said they "don't have an answer." Of female respondents, 36 percent said they "supported" it, 9 percent "opposed" it, and 53 percent said they "don't have an answer."
