Kuznyetsov; date and place not given. [Text] The Chernobyl disaster has doomed Russian atomic energy to the role of unwanted stepdaughter--favored neither by the people, nor by the powers that be--just a source of constant headaches. But, atomic energy currently provides 25 percent of the electrical energy used by the European part of Russia, and it would be impossible to simply dispense with it. At the same time, the useful lifetime of the present generation of nuclear reactors is now drawing to a close, and we must think about the construction of replacement facilities. Given existing conditions, this undoubtedly will only be possible if the population in locales of proposed AES (atomic energy station) construction--in addition to being provided with economic incentives--are convinced of their safety. The concept of atomic energy development which has taken form in Minatom Rossii calls for installation of a new generation of safer reactors, which achieve reliability through inherent design characteristics, rather than by the thickness of the reactor walls. The record of past mistakes points out the need for creation of scientific-industrial centers for atomic energy, which will document reactors in order to conduct in-depth verification of their safety. One such center is currently being created in the city of Sosnoviy Bor in Leningrad Oblast, on the grounds of the formerly hush-hush Minatom Rossii research center. Our correspondent met with its director, V. Vasilenko, and asked about the project to develop a Northwestern Scientific-Industrial Center for Atomic Energy, as well as the work the institute itself. [Kuznyetsov]Vyacheslav Andreyevich: Until recently, your institute was well known only to a narrow circle of specialists. What have you been doing there? [Vasilenko]The institute (NITI) was formed in 1962 by a decree of the government of the USSR. Its creator, Academician A. Aleksandrov, personally selected the site for the institute, and, in subsequent years, the institute gave life to the city of Sosnoviy Bor. In 1964, the first offices were laid out in the structural framework, and, in 1968, work was begun on development of testing facilities designed by NIKIET [expansion not provided], ``Gidropress,'' and OKBM [expansion not provided]. The institute was established as a test base for experimental naval nuclear power facilities (YaEU), and, in the course of its own development, progressed from conducting complex experimental work to wide-ranging scientific investigations of all aspects of the facilities. This resulted in the development and introduction of new technological processes which increased the tactical and technical data bases of these facilities. [Kuznyetsov]Which is to say, your institute actually brought these facilities into existence? [Vasilenko]Yes, that is an accurate assessment. The institute worked with the chief designers, assuming the very difficult and, frankly, thankless role of critic, inasmuch as we were called upon to uncover inadequacies in these facilities, the correction of which required design and technology changes. The institute thus gave birth to the basic, fundamental, sea-going power facilities. [Kuznyetsov]How many researchers are there at the institute now? [Vasilenko]More than 2000 people, of whom about a fourth are scientific and technical personnel carrying out broad-based research. More than 500 nuclear industry service workers provide maintenance services, as well as preparations for experiments and modernization operations. A powerful infrastructure also exists which permits the institute to thrive and grow. [Kuznyetsov]In our difficult times right now, what is it that the institute is concerned with? [Vasilenko]We are actively working with the Navy, and the total volume of its orders amounts to about half of our financing. There are government orders from a number of enterprises within the atomic energy complex--this allows us a respectable subsistence. In the process of building naval nuclear reactors, we have developed several operational directions, one of which is the design of training systems. Operational personnel receive their training in our systems, and the trainers are aggressively employed as preparation for operations under non-standardized conditions, as well as for handling other situations. And, it is only after nuclear power plant processes have been extensively modeled in trainers that we proceed with the power plant testing program, which improves substantially the safety of these potentially dangerous facilities. In addition, we have worked on the neutron physics properties of the RBMK reactors [large-capacity, pressure-tube reactors], and, in the process of this work, an enormous potential has been put in place. In particular, the ``Sapfir'' program developed by our enterprise: It can be used to compute the reactor core design for any reactor of this type. We are aggressively offering our programs to consumers in the nuclear power station sector. [Kuznyetsov]This kind of research and development requires a potent scientific base. [Vasilenko]As far as that is concerned, we pride ourselves on it. Since 1972, each one of the institute's installations has developed computerized test-measurement systems which have scale capabilities five to ten times superior to the standard measurement devices used in atomic energy installations. We are required to demonstrate and document that our measurements are precisely and metrologically aligned. We have accumulated archives of experimental data, which--I believe--belongs to the nation. We are intensively utilizing this, not only to obtain the most precise characteristics of systems now being used, but also to plan the parameters of future reactors. The capabilities of our computerized data collection and processing system, ``ANIS,'' have, to this time, not been surpassed within the field. This instrument allows observations of the condition of reactors, as well as standard control and testing systems, which, in combination with extremely accurate experimental data, provides a new level of quality in research. [Kuznyetsov]What products and services are you offering to the international market? [Vasilenko]We have a number of highly competitive products, especially, an innovative, fail-safe operational system which functions in real time. This system is unique in its ability to counter any type of malfunction in the computerized test equipment and assure operations even during degradation of a test-measurement or control system. The principles underlying its operation are still state-of-the-art. We also possess technology for equipping trainers of any size and class, including conceptual, functional, local and half-scale types. We are in a position to put together, without outside help, a real-time simulator system for training operational personnel, and for analyzing crisis situations. The technological characteristics and economic indicators of these systems are better than for similar systems being supplied by joint ventures and Western firms. [Kuznyetsov]If your trainers are of such high quality, what do you say to the question of why you are not producing them for our stations? As far as I know, French and American trainers are being installed these days in preference to yours... [Vasilenko]It is, unfortunately, for us as well, a somewhat puzzling situation. One of the reasons I can see in the fact that, previously, the West was closed to people in our ministry, but now, one may quietly travel abroad and purchase whatever is needed. Another factor is that defense industries began to offer formerly secret products of a higher quality, which had not been available to the civilian atomic energy sector. Project designers and equipment operators seemed to be confused, since they were not familiar with these technologies, but their use substantially restructured the very technological solutions which they traditionally employ. And, there, the West offers familiar solutions--almost, in fact, a gift... Help for us from abroad! They help, but not to the benefit of our atomic energy industry. Nearly all joint projects--they are Trojan Horses, in which Western firms calculate how to move into our atomic market. This process, whether willingly, or unwillingly, is continually accelerating, which will produce a serious effect in the future. Our own high-level native technologies are becoming irrelevant, In the final analysis, this will lead to our atomic energy industry being pushed into the background, where it will not develop to any significant degree. France, for example, jealously defends its market, and protectionism is growing there. With us, everything is exactly the reverse. In fact, a number of things, particularly associated with safety, are being artificially exaggerated and depreciated. Conditions are driven by the formation of public opinion, which does not provide for the required level of safety in our atomic power stations. I think that, at first, it is necessary to equalize the forces needed for elevating domestic testing and control systems to a higher level, and to examine the possibility of using our own technology, and then adopt solutions. Right now, there is still time to develop domestic atomic power station control systems, based on new principles and technologies. Otherwise, tomorrow, we shall find ourselves bound to the West. [Kuznyetsov]What are the institute's plans for the future? [Vasilenko]For the past three years, we have been intensively applying our wealth of experience to the civilian atomic energy sector, and we are now working on the creation of the Northwestern Scientific-Industrial Center for Atomic Energy (NPTsAE). This work is part of the Russian effort to develop a new generation of medium-capacity, safer nuclear plants, which are being brought on line in accordance with the government program, ``Environmentally Clean Energy.'' Since 1991, we have been working with the Leningrad institute, ``Atomenergoproyekt,'' to develop the new-generation VVER-640 (V-470) water-moderated, water-cooled power reactor designed by the experimental design bureau, ``Gidropress.'' Together with the reactor facility design team and the scientific leadership--the Kurchatovskiy Institute--we shall be conducting research on the dynamics of reactor behavior, as well as processes within the reactor and containment vessel. [Kuznyetsov]Why have you experienced delays on this same project? [Vasilenko]This reactor incorporates substantively innovative approaches, such as passive heat venting, a high degree of automation, and a dual containment feature based on a design developed for the descent of high-altitude military aircraft. The use of reactor cores employing reduced unit loads allows for better fuel utilization and improves nuclear station safety. The passive systems provide an outlet for residual heat release from the reactor core during an emergency situation. Nuclear plant safety is assured, under normal operation, over the course of the entire projected service period, which amounts to 50-60 years. An example of the use in this project of new, high-level technologies previously not seen in civilian reactor design is the base slab of the reactor vessel, which is capable of withstanding earthquakes of up to 8 points on the MSK-64 [expansion not given] scale. The levels of radiation exposure for nuclear plant workers do not exceed 0.1 percent above background values common in Russia--that is to say, the radiation exposure for the population and the environment is measured at minimal. Its inherent characteristics enable the VVER-640 to be sited at any location on earth. It does not require water resources, as it can make use of dry cooling towers. When the reactor is outfitted for water cooling, it can exhaust as much as 60,000 cubic meters of feedwater per day. At 640 MW, the electrical power capacity of the reactor also is optimal for the majority of regions, not all of which require million watters. After thoroughly analyzing the new projects developed by our reactor designers, we came to the conclusion that the VVER-640 project is the most promising, not only from the perspective of the internal needs of Russia, but also for penetration of foreign markets. This conclusion has been confirmed by our subsequent research and by the results of an international competition in St. Petersburg, where a panel of judges marked this particular project, ``recommended,'' and ``advanced.'' Yet, the special nature of this project lies in the fact that enterprises in Leningrad Oblast and St. Petersburg, such as the production associations, ``LMZ,'' [Leningrad Metals Plant] ``Izhorskiy Zavod,'''' [Izhorskiy Heavy Equipment Plant] and ``Kirovskiy Zavod,'' and others, are in a position to fully assume the entire range of operations involved in the engineering, manufacture and supply of nuclear plant power blocks using the VVER-640 reactor to regions within Russia, as well as abroad. We suggested to local authorities at all levels that the scientific-industrial center for new-generation reactor development be organized around our facilities, explaining its prospective benefits for us and the region. Both the Ministry and the government have supported the project. The future promise of this project is already being confirmed by the generation of orders in Russia; a decision is in place concerning construction of the triple-exchange [triple-loop, heat exchange] blocks on the Kola Peninsula, and talks are underway on construction of the triple-blocks in Primorye, as well as preliminary negotiations on their construction abroad, and one of the indispensable conditions for closing the export contracts is construction and testing of the main block. The electric power being produced in our main block will travel to such potential consumers as future Russian ports on the Baltic Sea, and the high-speed, St. Petersburg-to-Moscow rail line. [Kuznyetsov]Why did this specific NITI become the base for the center? [Vasilenko]Our advantage lay in the fact that the institute had at its disposal the necessary potential in terms of technology, experience and knowledge to complete the work in the shortest time-frame, and to develop a new-generation main block for use as a potent argument in the atomic sector of the Russian energy program. We also have no need to create storage facilities or district heating networks, and we have control over the construction, having built the four blocks at the Leningrad nuclear station, in addition to holding a license for construction of atomic power stations. We have dozens of atomic sector enterprises nearby, with great project-management capabilities. Which is to say that the center combines the construction, as well as technical and technological, experience of the entire atomic energy industry, the coordination of which will allow us to obtain a new result, a new level of quality--and a safe new-generation power station. [Kuznyetsov]According to statistics, about 50 percent of the incidents at atomic energy stations are the fault of personnel. What are you doing to forestall such extraordinary occurrences? [Vasilenko]We will not simply build a main block, but create a scientific-industrial center, where, along with the reactor facility, we shall establish a teaching-training complex with a center for analysis of crisis situations. There is a proposal for a fully staffed trainer at the complex, not only to deal with issues of training and retraining of personnel, but also to simulate emergency situations, and provide follow-up analysis of them. The center for analysis of crisis situations will receive information from all operational power blocks, and we will be capable of disseminating safety recommendations to cover any situations. The complex will house a technical school for training mid-level technicians from atomic power stations under construction. In addition, the center will contain test facilities for modeling emergency processes, and for experimental research on serious emergencies, as well. [Kuznyetsov]What do you think will happen if this project is delayed? [Vasilenko]A study of the prospective projects of Western firms indicates that the ``Westinghouse'' firm is planning to obtain a license to construct a similar block in 1995. If we delay our construction, they will be the first to enter the world market. Right now, we have a real chance to get there ahead of them. We just have to persevere, and we will make a breakthrough onto the world nuclear market. I
