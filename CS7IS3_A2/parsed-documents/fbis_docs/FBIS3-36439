The commission's task is to decide which of the leading officers of the former security ministry will continue to occupy the top command posts in the new Russian intelligence service. Among the members of the commission are Yuriy Baturin, the president's aide on national security issues; Valeriy Rubanov, deputy chairman of the Security Council, who took an active part in the previous attempt to reorganize the KGB in 1991; and Sergey Kovalev, the chairman of the human rights commission under the Russian president, a prisoner of conscience in the past and a severe critic of security bodies. [Lobov] I think that such a composition of the commission makes it possible to draft adequate suggestions on the candidates for the top command posts of the counterintelligence service, to be endorsed by the president. Some 200 to 250 people will be appraised. [Kiselev] Those are senior officers? [Lobov] Yes, certainly, those to be appointed by a presidential order or decree. I think those who are unsure of their position or who are opposed to reform will leave of their own accord -- some of them have already left. The people who stayed are eager to work. [Kiselev, over video of KGB building in Lubyanka] The notorious building in Lubyanka Square where we went for a comprehensive interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy head of the Russian counterintelligence service, has always been a symbol of the VChK, OGPU, NKVD, KGB and finally the former Russian Ministry of Security to the Soviet people. However, we found out to our surprise that the headquarters of the service has recently moved to another building, also in this area. [Stepashin] You see, the heads of the KGB and later of the Security Ministry have been working in this building since the late 1980s. As for the building you have mentioned, most of it is currently occupied by the directorate for the border troops. Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev [commander of the border troops] and I have agreed that the central entrance, which is always shown on TV, the one with the state emblem above it, will have a large board saying Border Troops of the Russian Federation. So the people who were so annoyed by this building and this service should feel gratified. [Kiselev] So, border troops have departed from the Security Ministry. Which parts of the former Security Ministry have then remained within the structure of the federal counterintelligence service? [Stepashin] The counterintelligence itself has remained. Therefore, its three main operational directorates will be involved purely in counterintelligence work. This will include practical measures [operativnyye meropriyatiya], economic counterintelligence, and the protection of important state installations. In addition to this, our directorate for combatting terrorism will also be active. [Kiselev] What about the executive apparatus? Have you inherited all of it from the outgoing Security Ministry? [Stepashin] Naturally. What is more, I do not see anything wrong in it. It stopped being the KGB long ago -- you know how many changes it has gone through since 1991. Many people left at that time -- it is another question whether they were the worst or the best. So, today, the majority of people who have come to work at the Security Ministry will certainly stay. People who work here must first and foremost be professionals, and they must also believe in the unwritten dictum "to serve our country, our fatherland, and our state" -- these are the words of the president. [Kiselev] Yes, there is an opinion that the strength of all special services is that they are loyal to the existing authorities on the one hand and indifferent to the political orientation of that power on the other. [Stepashin] This is certainly so. [Kiselev] But are you sure, Sergey Vadimovich, that the majority of the staff of the federal counterintelligence service, who worked in the Security Ministry in the past and before that in the Soviet KGB, is quite neutral politically and quite indifferent to the political orientation of the country's leadership? [Stepashin] As individuals, as citizens -- of course not. It should not and cannot be like that, especially in such a politicized country as ours. This is natural and I think normal -- after all, they are living people. As for carrying out their professional duties, their military duty if you like -- because we are all military... [Kiselev, interrupting] What is your rank, by the way? [Stepashin] Lieutenant General. As regards that, I think the answer is yes. Moreover, a number of our employees -- I will not name them -- including two generals for whom I have great respect, simply handed in their resignations after the decree of 21 December saying that they had to leave under the present circumstances. They acted honestly. We are almost halving our numbers, but we are not reducing the numbers of the operational counterintelligence units. [Kiselev] But as for external surveillance services and services that may tap telephones if necessary, do they remain? [Stepashin] Well... [Kiselev, interrupting] I know this is a painful question. [Stepashin] Painful, why? This is quite a normal question. A counterintelligence service without operational and technical underpinning does not make any sense. So, we are going to keep all these. [Kiselev] Are you also going to keep your system of agents, as well as recruit new agents? [Stepashin] Most certainly. Agents form the foundation of the entire work of a special service. It is another matter that recruiting methods have been changed, are changing considerably at the moment. To tell you the truth, in the past, blackmail was sometimes used as a recruitment technique, so that when a person saw he had no other way out -- he failed to get promotion at work, could not go abroad, could not obtain a PhD, could not become an academician -- I am speaking in general terms... [pauses] Now, today such methods are completely ruled out. [Kiselev] What about people recruited as agents in the past? I know the word agent was often avoided then, it was not much liked and some called them assistants or some other names... [Stepashin, interrupting] Yes, the secret apparatus... [Kiselev, interrupting] The secret apparatus, that is right. And now this argument has been going on for several years. Some say: let us identify those who collaborated with the KGB in the past, while others say this should not be done by any means. [Stepashin] We shall do all we can to prevent this happening. First of all, I have already told you that all special services in the world employ agents -- all of them, regardless of whether the state is democratic, antidemocratic, communist, and so on. This is the first point. The second is that we have no right to break the promises given to those people. We can simply ruin their lives, and those who demand it should think about this if they really consider themselves humane people and defenders of human rights. And the third point is that there are some laws that have not yet been abolished by anyone and that not only protect the secret agents but call to account those who attempt to declassify this secret network. Therefore, I think this should certainly not be done. [Kiselev] But coming back to your principal function, the counterintelligence service: counterintelligence means first of all, if I understand it correctly, fighting foreign intelligence services, that is, counteracting intelligence activities of other states on the territory of Russia. How active is this work now? It was mentioned at a news conference that foreign secret services had attempted recruiting some of the most high-ranking state and government officials and that such incidents had even been reported personally to the president of Russia. Could you talk about this in more detail? [Stepashin] Well, I would not like to talk about this in more detail. Such attempts have been made, are being made, and will continue to be made. And you know, it applies not only to our state officials but to rank-and-file citizens as well. They simply are not aware that such recruiting attempts are being made. This is the first point. Second, we are really seriously concerned about a leakage of nuclear, military, and other technologies, which today is quite considerable, and about attempts to recruit our scientists and experts. We have information about many incidents of this kind. These are only a few facts that show that foreign secret services are intensifying their activities in the Russian Federation. [Kiselev] What about a situation when, for instance, reports appear in the press that the Dutch company GMM financed Zhirinovskiy's electoral campaign? Is it part of the responsibilities of the federal counterintelligence service to verify reports of this type? [Stepashin] If we look at it from the point of view of our charter and our direct functions, then no. Moreover, you will recall that when President Yeltsin signed the decree of 21 December [on restructuring the Russian security services], he said at a news conference before the New Year that he had abolished political investigations and everything they are based on. But political investigation in its literal meaning is activity of special services directed against opposition parties. [Kiselev] Right. How can you draw a line between gathering information about organizations that might potentially become extremist or begin to threaten citizens' safety, the security of the state and society, on the one hand, and political investigation on the other? [Stepashin] This is a very subtle matter. Everything should be known, but our service will not be involved in active measures or operations against opposition parties, movements, and organizations. [Kiselev] But it will collect information? [Stepashin] Well, not quite collect information -- or perhaps yes, collect information. When this party or organization turns up here, weapons in hand, and takes over power -- then it will be too late. We must be aware of this and must prevent this. For this, protective measures must be taken. We must obtain information -- including information from the parliament, the government, and the president. So, I agree with you on this point. Incidentally, 10 days before the final election results were published, we conducted our own poll in five regions, and we predicted Zhirinovskiy's victory with 23 percent, falling short of the actual result by just 1 percent. [Kiselev] Did you make this information known to the higher authorities -- the president and the government? [Stepashin] I do not know if it reached the president, but we did send memos to the leadership with regard to this matter. [Kiselev] At the moment, there is a lot of talk and surmises about a new upsurge in the activity of the extreme opposition and that there allegedly exists an armed underground opposition movement. They say some people went underground after 3-4 October and that they are armed. How close to reality are these reports? [Stepashin] What is real is that unless the promise publicly given to the people by the prime minister, the government, and the president to stabilize the political situation, to provide a normal civilized standard of living for our people is fulfilled...[pauses] increasing [opposition] activity is certainly a real fact. As for armed formations and other attempts to discover an enemy in the army or here, the information we have -- and I assure you that we do have serious information -- indicates that such things and processes do not exist. [Kiselev] Well, thank you very much, Sergey Vadimirovich, my list of questions seems to be exhausted.
