Today, as a result of the outcome of the referendum, which expressed the people's solemn mandate, we proclaim that the new Peruvian Constitution is in force. [applause] This Constitution, which for the first time in the history of our Republic, has the backing of the people's vote, is democratic, functional, and aimed at bolstering the development of current and future generations. The electoral process, which was held openly and within the framework of unrestricted liberty, showed the maturity and civic- mindedness of the public which participated in a broad debate throughout the country to take a stand on the Congress-approved constitutional draft bill. We are convinced that the referendum was a historic landmark for the consolidation of our democracy, and Peru was the single winner. We have left behind past frustrations to forge a viable country with opportunities in which all Peruvians will grow. The new Constitution ratifies our belief in democracy as a way of life that guarantees and encourages the people's freedom, human rights, and dignity. The new Constitution reflects the people's wish expressed in the elections to choose the current Congress, which voted for the state branches' modernity, efficiency, and moralization. We have reduced the government's size and excessive interventionism to transfer greater responsibility to civilian institutions, to free up human resources, and to boost the social market system without interference. As of now, the state will fulfill three objectives: First, it will be a promoter state; that is, it will work toward economic development and well-being for the population. Second, it will act as a regulator to secure the foundations of real competition without privileges, as well as to protect workers, the elderly, mothers, and children. Third, the state will also be a compensator state, seeking social equity. We have established a single chamber Congress with 120 members, which is the most appropriate system for our needs. Similar to the current Congress, the new Congress will have the advantage of being swifter and more efficient in debates and legislative production as well as being able to exert political control and supervise the handling of public affairs. The judicial branch, whose restoration and autonomy is essential for the balance of the democratic system and for the working of the country, will be freed in the appointment of its magistrates of all possible forms of political interference, be it from the executive branch or Congress. The appointment of judges and prosecutors, at all levels, will be the decision of the National Council of Magistrates, which will begin its duties when it completes the task that we have entrusted to the Honor Tribunal. The praiseworthy work of its five honorable members will soon become evident in the appointment of prosecutors and judges. The country's pride, prestige, and faith in the justice system will be restored with these appointments. The economic regime, which was conceived within a pluralist system, is based on private enterprise, whether big or small, as the center of development in a market system that is free, competitive, and open to international trade in order to guarantee a dynamic and sustained growth. We are convinced that our juridical framework will allow us to attract foreign investments. We are treating both national and foreign investments equally to open more jobs, close the existing gap, educate better our children, offer better services, and, in sum, bring progress to the country. We have thus acted with foresight and realism. Past ideological battles are being replaced, almost everywhere in the world, with a more pragmatic relation between market efficiency and the social solidarity. Consequently, we foresee a more humane economic system that will allow everyone to gain access to the market and its benefits. The main tool for Peru to join the modern era is, undoubtedly, education. It will be high-quality education geared toward humanistic training, work, science, and technology. The Constitution guarantees free education, at all levels, in public schools. Our contribution was that we extended free and compulsory education to the preschool level; this is a step forward to train and correctly stimulate our children to enter primary school, where the percentage of students who repeat a grade and the incidence of school drop-outs are alarming. The modern Peru we want must be sown right now, and the best fertilizer for it is education for our children. Children must grow like healthy and robust seeds and plants; for this reason, I would like to urge all sectors to depoliticize the debate on this issue and find the best way to propose an educational reform, a priority in the national agenda. The new Constitution is a modern and pragmatic document that is inspired by ethical values, but just like any other human endeavor, it is a perfectible work. Contrary to totalitarian regimes, democracy is based on the plurality of ideas, the tolerance to differences, and the search for consensus. The people trust that we will seek points of understanding to diminish our differences and establish the objectives and priority goals the country needs to face our big challenges. This must be shown in the legal norms needed to implement the Constitution. The people also hope for greater consensus on the part of all sectors that are committed to ideas of change in order to give stability to the modernization program. Terrorism--this implacable enemy that has caused so much death and destruction over the past 12 years--is abating, but it has not disappeared. We are going to persist until we eradicate this scourge, but we should not allow ourselves to be deceived. If we eliminate terrorist violence but overlook poverty and the conditions in which millions of Peruvian live, we will be exchanging one danger for another. The national reconstruction process must be consolidated. Our economy, for example, must grow until the end of this century at a rate similar to those of developed countries solely to recover the standard of living that we had 20 years ago. The illiteracy rate reveals that 2 million people do not know how to read and write in Peru; that is, one out of 10 Peruvians does not know how to read and write. Seven out of 100 children die before they reach age one, and this reveals our poor health levels. This painful situation that we inherited was worsened by the poor economic and social policies of the past, and we cannot remain impassive toward this. This is an immense challenge that we will overcome and must tackle together. Only in a real democracy can we articulate the contributions of all sectors to establish a consensus, integrationist, and consistent force, a long-range national project. Congress and the government are committed to this task. The great decisions [definiciones] made to relaunch a country are often painful and traumatic, and thus, a consensus is indispensable; this is why no sector or group should reap political benefits. We must all feel part of this modernization program to ensure that a reform such as the one being implemented to modernize the country will last long; we need to have a collective determination and consensus. Throughout these years, the government, with the people's support, has won the most difficult battles in a country that was in ruins. As a result of the good policies of this administration, which is responding to a global vision as opposed to a short-run vision, we have emerged victorious in the main fronts of our struggle against subversion. In the economic arena, we have defeated inflation. We have begun to stop the serious recessive process and managed to grow this year at a rate of 7 percent of gross national product. We also rejoined the international financial community and are again creditworthy at the international level. We have successfully advanced in privatizing public companies. We now have a more organized and healthier institutional structure. We enjoy the support of popular organizations and the understanding of businessmen and workers. We have a legal framework--that is, the new Constitution--which guarantees the application of structural reforms that the country requires to modernize itself. The people, who have placed their trust in these policies, have collaborated with remarkable courage and generosity, but they also harbor the hope of seeing better days. The time has come to take a new path. We have to join efforts in this frontal battle so that we can venture forth to modernization. It is in this spirit, Mr. President, that we present for your consideration an initiative to reach a national consensus on priority issues related to the people's development. The exchange of ideas and the conclusions to be reached will guide the government in establishing policies and will help Congress in implementing the legal norms the Constitution requires. To conclude, allow me to make a reflection. Democracy is universally recognized as the system based on freedom which promotes economic growth and collective well-being. The dramatic events that have crumbled political totalitarianism and economic socialism have reconfirmed that democracy is the best form of government. The challenge before us is to demonstrate that democracy is also able to promote human development in Peru. If all of the Peruvians of our generation are able to build an authentic democracy--which will bring prosperity and happiness to our children and our children's children--all of our struggles and sacrifices will have been well worth it. Thank you. [applause]
