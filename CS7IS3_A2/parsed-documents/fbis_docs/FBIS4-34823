"I have good friends within the Indian leadership, such as Luis Macas, Bolivar Tapuy, and Ampam Karakras," the new government official declared. Guayaquil -- "The fact that we are descendants of royalty was not the reason the government sought us out," Luis Felipe Duchicela Shyri XXVIII, the recently appointed National Secretary of Indian Affairs and Ethnic Minorities, told HOY as he gave our newspaper a detailed explanation of the policy he proposes to follow as head of that secretariat. "I shall carry out a policy that is not linked to any political sector, religious or political," he said. "I shall seek the welfare of the Indian sector and of the nation in general. My policy will be to work hard in behalf of the Indian population, and to coordinate projects and efforts with the other cabinet ministries and governmental and nongovernmental institutions -- such as foundations -- with a view to implementing this program in the Indian sector." He emphasized that his secretariat will make certain that the resources allocated by the government for projects in the Indian sector will actually reach those who most need them. "At the same time," he added, "we shall succeed in strengthening our nation's credibility in the eyes of the international institutions that provide financing for social and economic development." The interview was conducted as follows: [HOY] Do you acknowledge that there is disunity in the Indian sector? [Duchicela] Definitely. That is precisely why the guiding principle of the Secretariat will be to avoid politicization or capture by this or that political movement, and instead to remain above politics and above the doctrines that the various religious sects are imposing on the Indian population. [HOY] How can the unity of the Indian sector be achieved? [Duchicela] That will be our principal objective. We shall propose the following to the Indian organizations: Let us sit down and talk, and let us identify those areas in which we can get to work immediately. [HOY] But will some sectors say "no" to you? [Duchicela] It is only natural that a problem as complex as the Indian problem will involve some areas in which we shall initially be unable to reach an agreement. I believe, however, that President Duran Ballen definitely wants to make this secretariat function efficiently, and that above all else he is seeking unity and positive results. [HOY] Do you believe the government has the political will to implement these changes that you are proposing? [Duchicela] I believe so. The government has successfully established a policy of macroeconomic stabilization, and I believe it is prepared at this time to step in with a strong plan and program in the social area. [HOY] Why have these concrete measures been taken in the Indian sector? [Duchicela] This secretariat was created precisely in order to avoid a situation in which some organization or other would have to take de facto measures because no one had paid any attention to the Indians or listened to them. With the creation of this secretariat, we shall have sufficient time to take such measures. [HOY] Many have expressed the opinion that you were appointed to carry out a symbolic social policy for the government. What is your opinion in this regard? [Duchicela] I believe these interpretations are not correct. [HOY] There has been speculation concerning the reasons why the government chose someone such as yourself who is not necessarily active in the Indian sector. What is your response? [Duchicela] Because of the disunity within the Indian community, the government had great difficulty finding someone who could remain above all this; hence my appointment. [HOY] But why Luis Felipe Duchicela? Why not someone fron a tribe, from the Conaie [National Commission for Indian Affairs], or from the Cofanes? [Duchicela] The Indian problem cannot be managed efficiently at the governmental level by someone who is not equipped with the administrative and technical tools used in the areas of finance, human resources, and systems. Why is this so? Because a secretariat is an executive entity. We will be coordinating projects. As we go forward, we will be interested in getting results rather than in making speeches. [HOY] But don't we need someone who understands the reality of Indian life? [Duchicela] Of course we do. In that connection I believe the press has not been very accurate, perhaps because they have not been informed about my career and do not know about it. [HOY] Haven't some people said that you sought this appointment in order to focus attention on your royal ancestry? [Duchicela] Although it is true that we are very proud of our ancestry, we are prouder of our Indian roots and our culture than of being "noble," because we are modern persons. We have never proposed that we be conceded anything, or granted anything, merely because we are descendants of the ancient Shyris. This is because we have earned everything we possess through our own efforts. My grandfather was an Indian who emigrated from Caccha to Guayaquil -- as hundreds of Indians did -- and I had the good fortune to excel intellectually and to progress. As a result, I was the first Ecuadoran to be hired as an attorney by Chiquita Brands in Ecuador; in its 60 years of existence, all of the company's attorneys had been gringos. We must give the community something in return for the progress that we have made as professionals; that is the way we can show how we feel and give something in return. The fact that we are descendants of royalty was not the reason the government sought us out. [HOY] Some columnists have wondered how this secretariat could possibly be entrusted to someone who among other things lives in a residential district of Guayaquil such as Urdesa. What is your interpretation of this evaluation? [Duchicela] This is one of the mental chains that has to be broken. The columnist in question is saying that this post must be given to an Indian who was born and raised in the Sierra. But what does this mean? Does it mean that we Indians who after one or two generations have been able to get an education, rise to another level, and excel in the world of the white mestizos have ceased to be Indians? This is precisely what we wish to combat. [HOY] Have you encountered any resistance from the Indian sector? [Duchicela] No. I do not think so. I have not heard of any. What Conaie said was that they opposed the action because the secretariat would be just one more bureaucratic jurisdiction and would prove to be an obstacle to communication with the government. I say that is not what is going to happen. [HOY] Haven't some people said that you are an unknown in the Indian movement? [Duchicela] Although it is true that I have lived these past 11 years in Panama, Costa Rica, and Honduras, I have always kept in close touch with our community of Caccha in Chimborazo. [HOY] What was your background before the appointment that you are pointing to with pride? [Duchicela] During my university years, instead of going to parties or soccer matches I went to the Indian communities, where I made many friends among the peasant leaders of that time. Some of them are top leaders today, such as Luis Macas, who has been my friend since we were fellow students at the university; Bolivar Tapuy, who is deputy for Napo; Anpam Carakras; Sharine Shiguango, who has been named to a post in the Ministry of Social Welfare; and others. We worked together with them, and in those days I came to know the Indian reality. My degree thesis dealt with the reality of the Indian peasants of the Sierra and involved a study of the various forms of material development in the sector.
