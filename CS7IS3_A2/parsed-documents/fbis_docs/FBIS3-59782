Most of the LSI makers in the country will increase DRAM production by 20% from now until the end of the year. By companies ensuring their source of supply and inventory, the supply is sufficient for two to three months in the future. At the beginning of next year, the plant of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. which had an accident will partially recover and increase the quantity of production. Many LSI makers say that the movement towards reducing the amount of epoxy resin used which began after the accident will advance in the future as well. There are costs from the perspective of environmental problems as well. On the other hand, the raw material of the sealing material can be ensured in terms of quantity, but the problems of an oligopoly remain in that system as usual. The instability in the supply of epoxy resin which is the raw material for package sealer was caused by the accident of Sumitomo Chemical (previously reported in the August 1993 issue of this magazine, pp 123-124), but according to the recovery plan after the accident reported by this company on 5 August, it was estimated that the previous supply can be ensured in January of next year. The supply will decrease within the year, but appears to be supported by the inventory. Even considering the DRAM production increase plan (see ``Domestic LSI makers together to increase DRAM production 20%'' published separately) presented here by the LSI companies together, an outstanding shortage does not occur. In the future, the estimate of whether the demand of industry as a whole will be satisfied is divided among LSI makers, but companies will ensure their own portion even when responding ``some shortage'' in the survey conducted by this magazine at the beginning of October (Table 1). Makers saying ``no shortage'' were Toshiba, Fujitsu, and Oki Electric Industry. In particular, Toshiba makes the same estimate as the optimistic MITI presentation in August (previously reported in the September 1993 issue of this magazine, pp 123-125). Therefore, measures toward reducing the amount of epoxy used have not been planned in particular. Of course, Fujitsu and Oki Electric Industry also are ``ensuring the supply for our company'' and say they are not worried about a shortage. NEC and Hitachi said ``some shortage.'' NEC especially gave concrete figures of 5 to 10% and estimated a shortage. In the background, both companies appear to be biased towards a single supplier of sealing material. Because a supply shortage will result if the supplier cannot ensure the epoxy in this type of system, the influence of the demand of the industry as a whole is easily applied. NEC has already ensured enough for two to three months and damage to the user appears slight. Long term reduction of quantity of epoxy used Many LSI makers say the technical development because of the reduction in the amount of epoxy used which began when the supply instability occurred will continue. The following countermeasures for reducing the amount used have been found: (1) increasing the coefficient of utilization for the sealing material; (2) increasing the filler charging rate; (3) changing to a biphenyl system. Despite the excess or deficiency, they are handled as a part of the environmental countermeasures. (1) and (2) were given by all of the makers surveyed as useful means of reduction. NEC says it can raise the coefficient of utilization by 20 to 30% and Oki Electric by 30%. With (2) for increasing the filler charging rate and reducing the epoxy, Oki Electric reduced the percentage of epoxy from 20% to 10%. Hitachi reduced the quantity of epoxy used 20%. NEC and Oki Electric are examining the change in materials in (3). With the progress of these countermeasures, there is a risk that there will once again be an epoxy surplus. The supply from Choshunjinzo Resin of Taiwan, on which Sumitomo Chemical relies for joint production, began and the first line of Sumitomo Chemical aiming for a year end recovery is said to be ``recovery is smooth.'' There is also the stronger production of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd. The time is undecided, but the danger of a supply surplus is high if another line of Sumitomo Chemical recovers. Also, when the quantity of filler is increased, there is a possibility that an unstable supply of filler will result next. The general use, spherical silica is becoming mainstream as a filler material effective for low stress because of the state of oligopoly of the electro-chemical industry. Domestic LSI makers together to increase DRAM production 20% US and Japan LSI makers have set about increasing DRAM production together. In the background, the major 4M sales are satisfactory mainly in the United States. First on the list is NEC and Hitachi making 10 million per month by the end of the year; most will increase production of 4M by about 20%. The two means of increasing production are to strengthen the production capacity and to switch production items. Two methods to switch production items are the method of switching to the shrink edition and expanding the production quantity and the method of reducing the 1M production quantity and turning back the production surplus. NEC and Toshiba are expanding production capacity. With continuing satisfactory 4M demand, production facilities will be added to the current mass production plants by next spring. Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Oki Electric Industries are handling the item switch. Hitachi and Oki Electric avoided additional investment as it is unclear whether the 4M demand will continue. The shrink edition production percentage is drawn upwards. Fujitsu is reducing the production of the 1M cut down edition and turning toward production capacity. United States manufacturers are also increasing production. The Texas Instruments company will strengthen 4M production capacity 35% by next spring. Along with increasing the production capacity of existing plants, they operated the Singapore plant constructed in a joint venture. Also, the United States Motorola company has said it will somewhat increase Tohoku Semiconductor in a joint venture with Toshiba by next spring. On the other hand, Korean manufacturers will not increase 4M production. This is because process technicians are divided by the switch to low voltage production and because the shift to 16M is sudden. Table 1.
