FBIS4-57122 "drlat093_m_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Brazil Government To Ask Mexico for Compensation for NAFTA Government To Ask Mexico for Compensation for NAFTA PY1305015494 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0116 GMT 12 May 94 PY1305015494 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Brasilia, 11 May (EFE) -- Official sources reported here today that the Brazilian Government will ask Mexico for compensation for possible losses our country may sustain as a result of the tariff benefits Mexico will be granting to its NAFTA partners, the United States and Canada. The Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) has decided that Mexico should compensate any of its 10 ALADI partners whose exports may be hurt by NAFTA. By compensating them, Mexico will be exempted from the ALADI requirement of sharing the benefits it may obtain through NAFTA with the other ALADI members. To obtain a waiver for this requirement, Mexico will have to negotiate compensations with those ALADI members whose exports to Mexico may be hurt by NAFTA. Arthur Denot Medeiros is the Brazilian Foreign Ministry under secretary for integration, economic affairs, and foreign trade. He said: "Waivers will be conditioned to compensatory negotiations." Denot added that this solution will contribute to preserving ALADI, "which has been institutionally weakened" since Mexico joined NAFTA.
