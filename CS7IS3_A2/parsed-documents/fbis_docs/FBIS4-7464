At the ceremony held on this occasion, which, in addition to NATO Secretary General Woerner, was also attended by the ambassadors of all 16 NATO member-states, Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek stressed that the partnership is extremely important for Slovenia. [passage omitted] After the signing of the document, Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek had a closed-door meeting with the ambassadors of NATO member-states. According to him, they all expressed satisfaction with the economic and political situation in Slovenia. The ambassadors were also interested in Slovene views about the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as whether there are any possibilities for the restoration of certain forms of cooperation on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek stressed that Slovenia is in any case interested in restoration of peace in this region and is also willing to assist within the limits of its capacities and interests. However, this does not mean that Slovenia is open to any sort of institutionalized linking with the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Slovenia has already overcome the worst crisis that emerged with the loss of the Yugoslav market, which was, among other things, also facilitated by the creation of the free trade zone with the Central European states. Logically, there was also discussion about the arms embargo today, which is still in force for all the republics of the former Yugoslavia, therefore, for Slovenia, too. Because the Partnership for Peace, in addition to military cooperation, also envisages the adaptation of Slovene armaments to the NATO standards, the arms embargo is becoming nonsensical with Slovenia's membership in the plan. As it was the UN that passed the arms embargo, the NATO officials today avoided giving a direct answer to this question.
