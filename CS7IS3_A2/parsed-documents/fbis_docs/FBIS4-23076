Turkin, All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Opticophysical Measurements, Moscow; UDC 621.372.833+621.373.2:621.372.2] [Abstract] The main problem in building powerful electromagnetic pulse generators is the construction of the wideband transition from the coaxial generator channel, which is filled with an electric insulation medium, to an asymmetric bandline with air insulation. The transition between the symmetric and asymmetric sections has the minimum possible cross section while retaining electric stability. This insures minimal distortion of the leading edge of the pulse between the symmetric and asymmetric portions. The wave channel of the generator was studied using pulse reflectometry. Local distortions were found to be no greater than 15%. The band line has an amplitude of up to 500 kV/m (1.3 kA/m) and a edge length of no greater than 0.5 ns. As a comparison,the Swiss GTEM 1500 installation forms pulses with a edge length of 1.5 ns and an amplitude of 24 kV/m (24/377 kA/m). Figures 3; references 8: 7 Russian, 1 Western.
