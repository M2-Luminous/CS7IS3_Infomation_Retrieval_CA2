Parallel to this position, the delegation's visit created a wave of criticism among party circles, which saw in the visit a disdain for the dignity of the Lebanese people because the delegation's mission was confined to searching for Israeli soldiers while ignoring the destiny of Lebanese detainees and captives in Israeli prisons.
