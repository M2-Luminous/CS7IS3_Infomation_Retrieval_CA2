The one-year tax cuts worth 5.85 trillion yen were adopted as part of a pump-priming package aimed at getting the faltering economy back on its feet. The officials said the income tax refunds for the January to June period will be made in June and those for the second half at the end of the year. As for the residential tax rebate, the refunds will be made in part by reducing such tax payments to zero in June and July and in part by prorating the remainder for the 10-month period from August, in equal installments. Currently, the standard household pays 460,000 yen in income tax and 330,000 yen in residential tax annually. With the stimulative package calling for slashing individual and local residential taxes by 20 percent each, households with annual incomes of 8 million yen will receive about 160,000 yen, the officials said.
