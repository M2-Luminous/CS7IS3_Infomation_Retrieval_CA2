The Presidential Edict Is More Ado About Crime"] [Excerpts] On 14 June President Boris Yeltsin signed an edict "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population Against Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime." It talks in particular about enacting a system of urgent measures to combat it. Primarily total -- including criminal prosecution -- investigation not only of suspects but also their relatives, friends, and other individuals and corporate entities. [passage omitted] Here is how the edict was assessed by Duma Security Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin: "The first impression: The mere fact of signing such an edict is a gross violation of the Constitution, a departure from criminal law procedures and substantive criminal law norms, and a violation of human rights and freedoms. The president has once again shown that he has not observed and is not going to observe the Constitution -- even the one that he drafted and spent enormous efforts to have approved. "Second: Under normal conditions this regime cannot function or stand up to crime. In the end, nothing prevented the president from inviting the Duma to draft and approve a law to fight crime. And the situation would have changed drastically. In that event this struggle would be based on a clear-cut legal foundation. But no matter what may be said in presidential and government structures, there have been no results. And the edict is just a warning to criminals: Be more careful."
