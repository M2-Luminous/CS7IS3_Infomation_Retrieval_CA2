The proposal was put forward by Armenian permanent representative in Moscow, Felix Mamikonyan. He said it was naive to expect that the 170,000 Nagorno-Karabakh people would win over the 7 Mn Azerbaijani nation. Zolyan repeated that a resolution was adopted by the Armenian Supreme Soviet on July 8, 1992, in accordance with which Armenia would recognize no document in which Nagorno-Karabakh is mentioned as an integral part of Azerbaijan. Zolyan stressed that the will of the Nagorno-Karabakh people must be the decisive point when settling this issue. He pointed out that the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic had been proclaimed through a nation-wide referendum. Baku refuses to recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Zolyan spoke for the continuation of negotiations between the Azerbaijani and Karabakh leadership to search for a political settlement in the region.
