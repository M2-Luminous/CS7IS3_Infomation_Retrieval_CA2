Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was there to address the council and the message he brought was that South Africa intended being a good citizen of the world. The debate evoked considerable comment and overran its scheduled time by more than two hours. We now we have some excerpts from the proceedings. [passage omitted] [Begin Mbeki recording] We therefore view the decisions that the council will take today as an acceptance by the world body that we have become a democratic country, and a country that can be counted on to subscribe and adhere to the pursuits of the important goals of international peace and security. Like millions of other people across the globe, we count on this body to continue to act as a principal protagonist in the global struggle for peace, security, and stability. We firmly commit our country, Mr. President, as a member of the United Nations and as a responsible citizen of the world, to live up to its obligations in this regard and consequently to contribute what it can to the making of the peaceful world, which is the right of the people. Our government and people are determined to ensure that within our borders we banish from our national life all those things that make for war and violent conflict. The successful transition to a democratic order constitutes the firm foundation for peace which our people have yearned for, for generations. It constitutes also the basis from which we will move in the search for a negotiated, just, and stable regional security system for all the peoples of southern Africa, which would guarantee the sovereignty of all the countries of our region and ensure that never again should any country fall victim to aggression and destabilization. Our country has also begun discussions to see what further contribution we can make to the search for peace in Angola and Mozambique, in support of the efforts of the United Nations, and the governments and peoples of these two countries. We are also committed, Mr. President, to participate to the full extent of our abilities in the efforts spearheaded by the OAU to address the related issues of peace, security, stability, cooperation, and development on our continent. We are accordingly ready to begin discussions with the OAU, the UN, and all concerned with regard to what can and should be done concerning the tragic situation in Rwanda. [passage omitted] I thought it might be appropriate, Mr. President, without taking too much time of the council, to express our -- our thanks for the statements that members of council, and members of the United Nations generally, for the statements that they have made today -- for the salute they have made to our President Nelson Mandela, to Deputy President De Klerk, and our people generally, for the manner in which they have conducted the process of transition in South Africa and to say, Mr. President, we shall surely convey to our leadership and our people the sentiments expressed by this council, members of the United Nations, and to say we appreciate very much the fact of the unanimous decision by this council. I'm grateful, Mr. President, that you make reference to the extent to which our continent is over-armed, and indeed we thought we needed to indicate in our own intervention that it certainly was not our intention to play a role on the African continent, given South Africa's capacity with regards to armaments production. It certainly was not our intention to exploit the decision that the council took today, to worsen a situation on the African continent which does not need worsening, but needs improving.
