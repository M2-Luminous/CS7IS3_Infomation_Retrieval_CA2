"My first step will be the creation of an authoritative delegation which would go to Moscow to conclude a close economic and cultural union with Russia", he said in an interview with the business "VEK" (CENTURY) newspaper on Friday. The Crimea was handed over to Ukraine by former Soviet communist leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954, but Meshkov believes the people of the peninsula remained a part of the Russian people. "As far as the Russian people are concerned -- I believe that before and after 1954 the people of the Crimea were a part of the Russian people. I hope the restoration of unity, unification is an issue of the near future", he stressed. Meshkov who was inaugurated on Friday insists that the Crimea should hold a referendum on independence despite the ban of Ukrainian authorities. "The acting ban of Kiev on holding the referendum has no grounds", he said adding that enough signatures had been collected in the Crimea in favour of holding the plebiscite. "The talk is about the right of the Crimea to independently determine the contents and forms of its relations with neighbouring states", Meshkov said. The president also said that the Black Sea Fleet which is disputed between Russia and Ukraine should not be split and should remain Russian. However, he added that the fleet should help create the Ukrainian Navy.
