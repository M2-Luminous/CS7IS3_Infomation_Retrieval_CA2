"I don't want to say anything other than that I have resigned," the rather cautious Mumtaz Ali remarked when asked about reasons of resignation. The move of the Deputy AG, viewed as a setback to the government, comes at a time when serious efforts are being apparently made by the top government officials to persuade Fakhruddin G. Ibrahim to withdraw his previous decision. In his resignation letter, sent to the President, Mirza says, "I regret to say that it is no longer possible for me to continue as Deputy AG. Accordingly, I tender my resignation. You are informed." Government circles refused to comment on the resignation.
