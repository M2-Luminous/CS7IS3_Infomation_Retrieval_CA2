An undetermined number of people were injured and others arrested. A source at the Alexandria state security department put the number of those arrested at 20. But 'Adil 'Id, a lawyer and member of the Alexandria branch of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights [EOHR], said as many as 338 people had been detained. The trouble began when Nahid Hafiz Abu-al-'Azm, a representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, went to the society's head office, accompanied by a number of policemen, on 8 May to enforce the governor's decision. According to eyewitness Yusri 'Abbas, a butcher who lives and works in the neighbourhood, members of the society and their families as well as hundreds of sympathisers reacted by staging a sit-in inside the building which they locked from the inside. "Sheikhs shouted anti-government slogans through loudspeakers and urged the people of the district to challenge the police," he said. By that time, the number of police had swelled to hundreds. Another eyewitness, Ahmad Qasim, said the protesters hurled stones and bottles of acid at police who responded with tear gas and used batons. The violence continued for two days. According to 'Adil 'Id of the EOHR, 138 persons were remanded in custody for 15 days on charges of staging an illegal gathering, resisting the police and damaging property. Some of them are members of the society and the Islamist-leaning Labour Party while others are members of the Physicians Syndicate and the local municipal council. Moreover, 'Id said, about 200 persons were detained under state of emergency powers, and no specific charges were levelled against them. The security source said the governor's decision to dissolve the board of al-I'tisam bi Habl Allah society was triggered by administrative and financial irregularities. The Arabic name of the society is derived from a Quranic verse and may be translated as "holding fast to the rope which God stretched out for the faithful." The governor's decision means that "board members will have to be replaced by others through democratic elections," the source said. "It does not mean that the role of the society must come to an end." The society is located in a four storey white building atop the Abu-'Umar Mosque. In addition to running the mosque itself, the society also extends medical and educational services to the poor inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Dr Ibrahim al-Za'farani, chairman of the human rights committee of the Physicians Syndicate, said the board of the society was not the first to be dissolved. Others which faced the same fate were al-Rida', Huda al-Islam, al-Ikhlas and al-Tawhid. "All were Islamic-oriented and all were in Alexandria, and the reasons for dissolving them were not legitimate," he said. Al-Za'farani said that instead of shutting down these societies, the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) should compete with them in extending services to the public. "And the NDP is capable of offering much more than these nongovernmental societies," he said.
