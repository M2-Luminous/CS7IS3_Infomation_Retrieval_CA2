You have just met with U.S. President Bill Clinton. What were the major topics that you discussed? [Scharping] We had a quite long and very personal conversation on German-U.S. relations, on the situation in Europe, on the developments in the individual countries, and on parallel developments among the U.S. Democrats and the German Social Democrats. By the way, I would like to make one thing clear: The election campaign does not play a role, but the reliability and continuity of German policy does. It is good for Germany that no basic changes are needed in Germany's foreign policy. Yet changes are urgently required in the domestic sphere, which the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will ensure. [Christiansen] Did you succeed in guaranteeing the required reliability to the United States? [Scharping] One thing struck me in particular. In the German discussion, there is a great deal of talk about combat missions and that this issue allegedly determines Germany's reliability as a partner and cooperation with the United States. I got the impression here that the issue is being overestimated in Germany. One should not claim that the United States is urging the Germans to participate in combat missions. This is not true. There are considerations here to introduce tighter rules, particularly in connection with UN missions. [Christiansen] However, in view of the current mission in Bosnia, you probably also discussed the possible future German contribution. [Scharping] First, the United States has no expectations. Second, there is no difference between the position of the Federal Government and our stance. The attack on Gorazde was the required response to an aggression that endangered tens of thousands of people. On the other hand, we agree with the government and the government agrees with us that German soldiers cannot achieve anything positive in Yugoslavia. [Christiansen] Let us change the topic. Domestic policies were also discussed, as you just stated. The U.S. economy seems to have overcome the recession in numerous spheres. What can one learn from that? [Scharping] It is a confirmation of what the SPD has been claiming for a long time. We need more investment and more favorable conditions to attract them. We need economic growth that must be environmentally compatible. We must reduce the public deficit and create a leaner and more modern state. Otherwise we will not be able to overcome the main problem -- the fight against unemployment. The United States has recently created 2 million jobs, whereas another 700,000 have lost their jobs in Germany as a result of the government's policy. [Christiansen] Mr. Scharping, thank you very much for the interview. Good bye. [Scharping] Good bye.
