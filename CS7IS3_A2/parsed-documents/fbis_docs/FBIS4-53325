Some bright signs are seen in personal consumption, and housing spending and public works remain buoyant, Toshio Morikawa, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, told a regular news meeting. But he said capital investment is still "motionless" and conditions for income and labor are deteriorating. Under these circumstances, Morikawa expressed hopes that the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package in February and summer income tax cuts would combine to "cement a recovery trend." On possible downward pressures ahead, he reiterated his concerns over the yen's rise, delayed passage of fiscal 1994 budget and stalled Japan-U.S. trade talks. "I hope currency rates will remain stable," Morikawa said, noting the yen's rise has come to a halt with recent intervention by leading industrial nations to prop up the dollar. However, the yen's current levels are "tough for manufacturers," he said. The dollar traded above 104.50 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday. On shaky political situations, Morikawa said he does not see any great impact on the economy from the minority rule by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. But he called for "positive handling" to pass the fiscal 1994 budget as soon as possible, and to conduct economic reform as promised in the March market-opening package, primarily to resume trade talks with the United States. "I'm concerned about a further long delay" in passing the budget for the year started April 1, even though public works are maintained with the third fiscal 1993 budget, he said. Referring to the release of fiscal 1993 business results next week, Morikawa, who is also president of Sumitomo Bank, said his bank is likely to post a better-than-expected net operating profit from core banking business since interest rates stayed low through the year. But a lower-than-expected pretax profit is predicted from active write-offs of nonperforming loans, he said. On the interest rates trend, Morikawa said short-term rates are likely to remain stable at low levels for the time being, and long-term rates will level off from a recent slight uptrend. U.S. long-term rates are on the rise, but this is unlikely to affect rates in Japan, where the economy remains weak and prices stable, he said.
