This opened the first Technology Industry-Academia Cooperation Conference with leaders from academia and industry held at a Tokyo hotel on May 31. With these words, Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, who chaired the industry side, emphasized the great expectations on forming new cooperative relationships between industry and academia. This conference was organized as a forum to discuss ways for industry and academia to cooperate. The participants were 15 of the best people from representative technical industries and 12 engineering department heads from seven national universities in Japan. Although the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) proposed and mediated the conference, both sides demonstrated a strong interest. According to the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of MITI, in less than one month after approaching the participants, the conference became a reality. Previous industry-academia cooperation was limited to the range of individual research themes. In addition to having problems in training, there was little opportunity to have a dialogue on the structural and basic issues that stretched between both sides. Therefore, Hiroyuki Yoshigawa, president of the University of Tokyo and chair of the academic side, stressed the meaning of this conference by stating, ``I was convinced that the industrial world had no intention of changing its view of universities. However, the economic environment is undergoing major changes. Therefore, the time has come for industrial and academic organizations to think about a new cooperation mechanism.'' The motto shared by industry and academia is ``the nurturing of creative people.'' The engineer's experience of a high-powered growth period is a necessary condition for developing high quality products and mastering mass production technology. But, President Yoshigawa reasoned, ``From now on, the people who will revive the new industry are important. That is, the engineer of the industrial revolution is being sought.'' Related Legislation Prepared The report on the roundtable discussion sponsored by AIST, which was held three days before this conference, concluded that international joint research is an effective means for avoiding trade friction and contributing internationally. Based on the problem Japan faces with the criticisms of getting a free ride in basic research and the excess import of technology, the necessity for international cooperation in industrial research is indicated. For this reason, a government policy was also proposed that begins by enlarging the budget for expanding national research organizations and institutes at universities, and promoting personnel exchanges. This policy crosses many areas, including the provision of related legislation to improve the procedure for the public and private use of patents. According to AIST, these proposals will be ``implemented in the government policies created next year.'' The Antimonopoly Act Eyed On April 20, the Fair Trade Commission announced guidelines on antimonopoly laws related to joint research and development. An environment that promotes joint R&D was provided from the perspective of the application of the Antimonopoly Act. The contents included, for example: (1) No problem exists when the market share of a participating enterprise is less than 20%. (2) When the market share exceeds 20%, a judgment is made by considering the research objective as a whole. Hidekatsu Hirabayashi, regulation manager at the Fair Trade Commission, explained the objective as the ``desire to further promote fair joint research for industry by clarifying the decision standards concerning the application of the Antimonopoly Act.'' This kind of guidance has already been provided in developed countries and planning for international coordination is necessary. In response, MITI feels constrained because ``the Fair Trade Commission itself decides whether antimonopoly laws have been broken. But, it is better, perhaps, if technological development by industry is not shackled.'' There is concern in joint research as well since competitive restraints that emphasize preventative restrictions like merger regulations were introduced. However, there either hasn't yet been a case that had this problem or the concern from important private industries is slight. From the perspective of industry, academia, and the government, the opportunity to build an environment to promote joint research should lead to a broader debate on competition policies for joint research.
