An official press statement issued in Islamabad says that, through Pakistani efforts, a group of nonaligned countries have presented a draft resolution in the UN Security Council demanding the withdrawal of Serb forces from Gorazde. The draft resolution calls upon the UN protection force to use all available means, including the use of force, to foil the Serb aggression against Gorazde. Pakistan hopes that the members of the UN Security Council will discharge their obligation to save the people of Goradze from the aggression. They should take urgent and concrete steps for the security of the population of Gorazde and other UN-protected areas. Pakistan has especially appealed to the North Atlantic Council [three preceding words in English] to immediately order air action against the Serbs. The statement says the government and people of Pakistan are deeply anguished by the brutal action and aggression by Serb forces against the Muslims of Gorazde.
