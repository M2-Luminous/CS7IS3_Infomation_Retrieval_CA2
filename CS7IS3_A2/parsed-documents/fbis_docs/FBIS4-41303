Both events, he noted, will not just determine the course of future relations with Russia in many ways, but also positively affect the general climate of international relations. The 'Partnership for Peace' program and the protocol that was made public in Brussels which give impetus to the process of further development of the `Russia-NATO' bilateral program of deeper cooperation are fully in the national interests of Russia as a great power, in the view of their specific features and the general mood in Europe, which reflects the desire for deeper trust and stability. According to Karasin, the signing of the Brussels documents signifies a mutual agreement between Russia and NATO as two major partners in European and global security. The upcoming conclusion of the full-scale agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the EC will bring cooperation between Russia and the EC to a new level, Karasin said. "This will be of enormous potential benefit for the Russian economy, access of our goods to the European markets, and for the deepening of the mutually beneficial processes of economic development in the European region. The EC too, might draw tangible benefits from closer cooperation with Russia, such as a boost to its economy, easing the unemployment problems, and opening up new markets," the Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.
