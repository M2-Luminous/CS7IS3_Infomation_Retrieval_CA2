FBIS4-9685 "drlat062_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 Peru Fujimori on Economy, Postponed Ecuadoran President Visit Fujimori on Economy, Postponed Ecuadoran President Visit PY3103132594 Lima Global de Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 31 Mar 94 PY3103132594 Lima Global de Television Network Spanish BFN [Text] President Alberto Fujimori has reiterated that legislative decree No. 776 [not further specified] will not be repealed. He said this issue will not be dealt with in political discussions. Commenting on another issue, Fujimori said he respects his Ecuadoran counterpart's, Sixto Duran-Ballen, the decision against traveling to Peru, but he made it clear that the invitation still stands. [Begin recording] [Fujimori] We have to continue working along the same serious lines, without adding any demagogic or populist ingredient. Because you know what the answers are; the people are well aware of them -- earnest effort, sound management of the economy, and unheard-of levels of government resources, which total some billion dollars. International reserves exceed the benchmark of $3 billion. We are now talking about billions, not millions. The government will continue with the same economic program, which will enable us to definitely overcome our problems. We have to avoid discussing or taking measures by letting ourselves be carried away by a passing euphoria because that will be tantamount to going backwards. We have to avoid this at all costs. This is why I am not concerned about public opinion polls. [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct] [Fujimori] I am going to continue with my job, I am going to work harder and earnestly in handling the economy and everything we have started. [Reporter] Is there going to be any change with regard to the decree, some details of which have been criticized? [Fujimori] The decree [passage indistinct]. [Reporter] With regard to the Ecuadoran president's decision to suspend his visit to Peru [passage indistinct]. [Fujimori] Only through the media. As you very well know, both the Ecuadoran community and the president himself [words indistinct] Peru is awaiting this visit with open arms. Whether this visit has been postponed or not, whether it will be made in the near future or not, we want to welcome him with open arms. I suppose there are circumstances preventing him from coming to Peru for the time being. [Reporters interrupting] [passage indistinct] [Fujimori] The invitation still stands; it is an ongoing and open invitation. [Reporter] In any case, Mr. President, this decision to postpone this trip again... [Fujimori, interrupting] These are decisions that the invited person has every right to take -- to set the most appropriate date. We will conform to this... [Reporter interrupting] Do you think, Mr. President, that relations between the two countries may deteriorate because of this decision? [Fujimori] No, bilateral relations are at their highest level. Current circumstances do not change the [words indistinct]. [end recording]
