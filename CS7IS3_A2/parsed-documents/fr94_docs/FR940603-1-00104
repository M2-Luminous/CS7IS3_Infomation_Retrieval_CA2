FR940603-1-00104 FR940603-1-00009 4. Familiarity With Conditions: Prior to the submission of the Proposal, the Bidder shall make and shall be deemed to have made a careful examination of the site of the Project and of the Plans and Specifications, forms of Construction Proposal and Acceptance, and Contractor's Bond on file with the Secretary of the Owner and shall become informed as to the location and nature of the proposed construction, the transportation facilities, the kind and character of the soil and terrain to be encountered, the kind of facilities required before and during the construction of the Project, general local conditions, and all other matters that may affect the cost and the time of completion of the Project. Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, etc., including those pertaining to the licensing of contractors and the so-called ``Kick-Back'' Statute (48 Stat. 948) and regulations issued pursuant thereto. 5. Proposals will be accepted only from those prequalified bidders invited by the Owner to submit a proposal. 6. Time of Completion of Construction: The time of completion of construction of the Project shall be as specified by the Architect in the Proposal. 7. Bid Bond: Each proposal must be accompanied by a bid bond in the form attached or a certified check on a bank that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the maximum bid price. Each Bidder shall agree, provided its proposal is one of the three low proposals, that by filing its proposal together with such bid bond or check in consideration of the Owner's receiving and considering such proposal, said proposal shall be firm and binding upon each such Bidder and such bid bond or check shall be held by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (or Builder's Risk Policy) is furnished by the successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of proposals, whichever period shall be the shorter. If such proposal is not one of the three low proposals, the bid bond or check will be returned in each instance within a period of ten (10) days to the respective Bidder. 8. Contractor's Bond or Builder's Risk Policy: The successful Bidder will be required to execute two additional counterparts of the Proposal and to furnish: (a) For contracts in amounts in excess of $100,000, a Contractor's Bond in the form attached to the Proposal with sureties listed by the United States Treasury Department as Acceptable Sureties, in a penal sum not less than the contract price. (b) For contracts in amounts of $100,000 or less, either a Contractor's Bond or a Builder's Risk Policy, whichever the Owner has specified below: (Check One) XXX Contractor's Bond XXX Builder's Risk Policy 9. Failure to Furnish Contractor's Bond or Builder's Risk Policy: Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to furnish a Contractor's Bond (or Builder's Risk Policy) satisfactory to the Owner within fifteen (15) days after written notification of the acceptance of the Proposal by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such event, the Owner shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check has been delivered with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check the difference between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amounts for which the Owner may in good faith contract with another party to construct the Project. The term ``successful Bidder'' shall be deemed to include any Bidder whose proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has failed to furnish a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (or Builder's Risk Policy). 10. Contract Is Entire Agreement: The contract, effected by acceptance of the Proposal, shall be deemed to include the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and the Bidder shall not claim any modification thereof resulting from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer, agent or employee of the Owner or by any other person. 11. Minor Irregularities: The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in the Proposal, if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal prior to its acceptance by the Owner. 12. Rejection of Proposals: The Owner reserves the right to reject any or all proposals.
