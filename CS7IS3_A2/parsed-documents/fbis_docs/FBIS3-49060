Although he was appointed foreign minister as late as 1 June, it was that part of politics that marked global events. Unprecedented dynamism in meeting world diplomats and heads of states enabled Granic to make significant changes in the image of Croatia in the world, and thanks to his persistence and the right dose of determination, Resolutions 847 and 871 were adopted, unambiguously confirming Croatia's right to establish full sovereignty over its entire territory. His insistence on respecting international humanitarian law, regardless of the fact that the world did not view all sides from the same perspective regarding the issue of convoys, made the world understand that Croatia sincerely intends to establish peace. Although his efforts were disturbed by injudicious moves, primarily in Herceg-Bosna, Granic showed that, in a relatively short period of time, he acquired capital that can grant credit to the bad moves of others. Consequently, the destruction of the Old Bridge in Mostar did not have serious repercussions on Croatia. The fact that he was received by the United States Senate, and his ease in establishing contacts with his Western counterparts, speaks for his credibility as the representative of Croatian politics in the world. [Gugo] At the end of this calendar year, could you summarize Croatian foreign politics? [Granic] Croatian foreign politics are characterized by securing a better international position for our country. There were many problems, the pressure of the international community after the Maslenica operation to begin with, but especially due to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We gave special consideration to solving the problem of the UNPA [United Nations Protected Area] zones. European integration processes and settling the relations with our neighbors were a parallel task. We obtained Resolutions 815, 820, 847, and 871, which undoubtedly confirm the right of the Republic of Croatia to sovereignty over its entire territory, i.e. within internationally recognized borders. Furthermore, President Tudjman launched a timely initiative. This period is probably also characterized by the failure of the Geneva talks, which contributed to reducing tensions toward us, for it finally became obvious who does not want peace. "Help to Central Bosnia" [Gugo] The latest round of the Geneva talks had been announced quite optimistically, but there were no obvious improvements. Why? [Granic] There were many bilateral talks on various levels, from peace mediators to foreign ministers. The Serbs were expected to show more leniency and Alija Izetbegovic was expected to show more determination to establish peace, which did not happen. Simultaneously, two important things happened -- on one hand, Karadzic was inflexible regarding the agreement on Sarajevo, thus triggering the rage of the international community, and, on the other hand, Izetbegovic did not turn out any better either. Refusing some rational solutions and demanding more concessions, Izetbegovic brought the negotiations to a dead end. What we have long been warning the international community about has obviously finally come to the surface -- that a great Muslim offensive is imminent. Izetbegovic wants to buy time and repeats demands to which we will never agree. [Gugo] If the bilateral talks of the cochairmen of the Geneva conference were cause for optimism, what has changed in the meantime? [Granic] At the first meeting, it was obvious that Milosevic gave an election speech for the public in Serbia. That was the main reason why no improvement was made. At the first plenary session, Izetbegovic accused the entire international community of being responsible for the suffering of his nation and for the disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Already at that point it was clear that no improvement was possible. At the second meeting, Milosevic was pressured by threats of even stricter sanctions, and he was much more prepared to talk. Karadzic was the one who did not accept some solutions. We must not have any illusions and view the two of them separately, for that was a trick. In fact, they belong to one and the same Serbian side. Alija Izetbegovic did not agree to some quite sensible and realistic solutions. A very strong ministerial delegation attempted to convince the Muslim side to accept sensible solutions, but it did not succeed. We were not surprised by that. We think that an agreement will soon be reached. On the other side, the Muslims think that they can still gain something by the military option and several factors are to their advantage. The most important one is the insufficient threat of the international community. [Gugo] Can the Muslims achieve military victory in central Bosnia? [Granic] Croatian enclaves are in a very bad position and helping them is one of our priority goals. The essence of our strategy is the survival of the Croats in central Bosnia and Sarajevo, and we need all the help we can get to realize that. We expect -- and the same holds for the entire European Union -- a Muslim state in which there will also be space for the Croats, just as there will be space for the Muslims in the Croatian republic. All of democratic Europe will support that type of secular state, but no one, in these parts, wants a fundamentalists county like that which some closest associates of Alija Izetbegovic want to create. "We Will Not Give Neum" [Gugo] Our public was very disturbed by the alleged proposal of President Tudjman that the Muslims be given 5 km of the coast at Prevlaka. What is the background of such a move? [Granic] We offered the approach to the sea to the Muslims, and that is something the international community asks from us. However, they exclusively demand access to the sea. The Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina favored the creation of the union, i.e. they wanted a reciprocal protection of rights within units in the Union. It is well-known that the Serbs and the Muslims signed an agreement on the referendum for the exclusion from the Union. Such an act was accepted by the international community. The Croats must be prepared for both options, both for the disintegration and for the survival of the Union, but they will not do anything to prejudice any solution. At one point, the Muslims accepted the port on the Neretva River, a tourist complex under joint administration in the area of Klek, and the highway from Stolac to Neum. Afterwards, they expanded their demand to require sovereignty over Neum, to which we will never agree, for that would entail the dismembering of the Croatian ethnic territory. The cochairmen proposed an exchange of territory in the area of Prevlaka. President Tudjman left the possibility open, but only in case of establishing a lasting peace on the entire territory of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. As you see, there is no peace, and the Croats will not accept being cut off at Neum. [Gugo] Does such an option not lead us into the trap of informally canceling resolutions that say that borders must not be changed? [Granic] There was talk of exchanging territories among recognized and sovereign countries by agreement. [Gugo] Can we expect to see the war end soon on occupied territories of the Republic of Croatia? [Granic] At the meeting of the European Union, Serbia accepted the modus vivendi, which was publicly confirmed by Minister Jovanovic. That means that we must first establish a lasting cease-fire, and then open up communications. Then we must organize the "London II" conference, which will solve the questions of local autonomy. Only after that, at the "London III" conference, provided that a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina is found, lifting sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro would be considered, as well as their inclusion into the international community. Actually, we must implement Resolutions 847 and 871. The Serbs are aware that the implementation of the peace plan is, in practice, also tied to lifting sanctions. At the latest session of the European Union, Russian Minister Churkin proposed that lifting sanctions be tied only to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which encountered serious resistance. Indeed, he also proposed the immediate mutual recognition of Serbia and Croatia and the establishment of diplomatic relations. Lifting sanctions is, for us, totally unacceptable before the establishment of lasting peace. The fact is that Serbia is in the stage of preparing its own public to accept the peace plan for Croatia. [Gugo] How long could that last? [Granic] Any kind of Cyprus syndrome is out of the question, or the example of Germany, which waited for reunification for 50 years. We demand a dynamic process. Anyway, you can estimate how long Milosevic can endure sanctions without serious social upheaval. "Russia Is Not Against Croatia" [Gugo] Is one justified in fearing that the arrival of Greece at the head of the European Union will not contribute to a rapid solution to the war crisis? [Granic] That does not have to be true at all. The Greek are not hiding their friendship with Serbia. We had many talks with them and I believe that they, too, will see to it that the war is over as soon as possible. [Gugo] An extreme nationalist won the elections in Russia, and he announced breaking the sanctions imposed on Serbia. Are those threats founded and can they influence the present situation? [Granic] They cannot lift sanctions imposed on Serbia. At the same time, a new constitution was introduced in Russia, giving authority to President Yeltsin. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy is obviously not hiding his inclination toward Serbia and the fact that they want to lift sanctions as soon as possible. However, the view of official Russian politics does not violate the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia. [Gugo] Do you really believe that, in any variant, those who pointed their weapons against Croatia, will allow two parts of Croatia to be joined through the territory that they presently control? [Granic] UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] is here to guarantee the success of that agreement. There are some people who are against reaching and implementing any agreement. Those are well-known facts. However, the position of Belgrade is here most important, for everything depends on that. The initiative of the European Union starts from the fact that Belgrade is directly responsible for the situation in the UNPA zones. [Gugo] So, on one side, there is Milan Babic, who has had conflicts with Belgrade and was disobedient before, and on the other, UNPROFOR, which is totally incapable of doing anything using force.... [Granic] With a clear stand of Belgrade regarding the UNPA zones, UNPROFOR itself will act differently. Unfortunately, even that does not guarantee the implementation of the peaceful option and we must therefore strengthen our defense forces in case the peace option is not possible. [Gugo] That means that a military option is also being considered? [Granic] More precisely, we will not allow any calculations or compromises with the Croatian territory. We will make no concessions regarding that. [Gugo] Prime Minister Valentic's economic program cannot be realized without the integration of Croatia into European institutions. What is the situation regarding that? [Granic] It is true that we are interested in being granted credit from the IMF, the World Bank, to enter the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program.... Signing the peace agreement will allow Croatia access to all those institutions and we are capable of applying those programs very soon. We will demand to begin talks on our membership of European institutions, and we stand a good chance, for we respect all set conditions. After all, we have fully complied with everything we were asked to do regarding international humanitarian law. Let us just look at how many convoys are allowed free passage by the Croats, and what the Serb or the Muslims did with the convoy headed to Nova Bila. Indeed, there is an occasional act of sabotage, when we least need it. Looking at the time of the events in Ahmici, Stupni Dol, or the Old Bridge, it is obvious that those were sabotages against the position of Croatia. And we will have to deal with that. The Muslims committed many more terrible atrocities, but every stupid move of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats costs us much more. I do not intend to justify crimes done by some Croats, for they cannot be justified and I condemn them, but I want to point out that we went through many situations that were not to our advantage. The Old Bridge in Mostar was destroyed at the time when the image of Croatia in the world started to improve. The world knows of our efforts to release prisoners. In the past 32 days, 284 convoys went through without any problem. The international community expects us to behave like that, and, whether some like it or not, we must respect international humanitarian law. Our politics must be transparent and credible. "Changes at the Ministry" [Gugo] Does that mean that we can soon expect Croatia to become a member of European institutions? [Granic] I believe that will mark the following year. European integration processes are our primary goal. Moreover, we would like to develop relations with major world powers and try to establish good relations with countries of outstanding economic development, like some Asian countries. We must also think of our neighbors and fully define our mutual relations. At the beginning of next year, there will be a ministerial meeting with Italy, and I hope that some minor tensions will disappear. We are especially interesting in developing good relations with Slovenia. There are some problems, like Krsko and Ljubljanska Banka, but expert groups are working and there will probably have no problems in solving these to mutual satisfaction. Regarding the Bay of Piran, I think that we have not yet exhausted all means, and that must be done before the arbitrage. Right after New Year, we will intensify our talks. [Gugo] How much truth is there in rumors that we will soon see some significant changes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? [Granic] I do not know what precisely you are referring to, but there will be some changes. According to the new law, our Ministry will be organized, as it is customary in Europe, and will have a state secretary, and some personnel changes have already been made. We established a permanent financial expert control in all embassies and consulates. From the month of March, permanent post-graduate studies will begin for the education of our personnel. We are working on improving the communication network, which is one of the more important factors in our Ministry. I believe that will contribute to organizing a modern and efficient state ministry.
