Did you meet Zhirinovskiy there? [Girke] No. I do not even know where Zhirinovskiy is based in Moscow. I was there purely for business reasons. [Krause] The search of your office and apartment was intended mainly to produce documents concerning the whereabouts of 4 million German marks [DM], which you are said to have used for private purposes. [Girke] Nothing has been taken away illegally. Even the Trust Agency knows that. Due to my knowledge of former assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, I have recovered some DM63 million for the Trust Agency since spring 1991. [Krause] How much has been transferred to Trust Agency accounts? [Girke] A total of DM53 million so far. Another DM6 million are on their way, so this leaves those DM4 million. [Krause] What about them? [Girke] These are the commissions to which I am entitled. The Trust Agency received the corresponding claims and bills one year ago. [Krause] Where are the DM4 million now? In Russia? [Girke] No. The money I took to Russia this time was invested in a food service project. [Krause] Behind which stands Zhirinovskiy? [Girke] My Russian business partner is in no way connected with that gentleman. [Krause] Did you give any money to Zhirinovskiy? [Girke] Not a single mark. [Krause] Why did you invite him to Berlin? [Girke] He asked me. Shortly before Christmas, my partner Werner Neumann and I happened to meet Zhirinovskiy in Austria. [Krause] Was it also a coincidence that one of Zhirinovskiy's staffers worked in your company for six weeks last summer? [Girke] I was not aware of that connection at the time. [Krause] So, you are only interested in business relations with Zhirinovskiy? [Girke] Yes, that is what I would be interested in.
