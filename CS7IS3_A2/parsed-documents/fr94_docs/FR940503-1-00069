FR940503-1-00069 FR940503-1-00012 EPA believes that importers would be able to decide whether and when to claim use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline. This approach is predicated on the assumption that importers would be expected to use great care in making this decision, and would do so only if the importer has complete confidence the foreign refinery baseline information was properly submitted to EPA and the foreign refiner intends to fully and properly comply with all requirements related to use of individual foreign refinery baselines, including requirements that apply years into the future. EPA also would expect importers to require the foreign refiner to carry out a gasoline volume tracking scheme that would enable importers to know with certainty that any batch of imported gasoline for which use of the foreign refinery's individual baseline would be claimed is within the foreign refinery's baseline volume. III. Justification for Proposed Amendment to Final Rule When EPA issued the final rule on December 15, 1993 the Agency was not fully satisfied that the baseline-setting scheme applicable to importers, and thereby applicable to foreign refiners, was the optimum solution. In preparing the final rule, EPA focused on three major issues regarding the use of individual baselines for foreign refiners in the reformulated and conventional gasoline programs. EPA's overriding consideration, and the basis for EPA's focus on these issues, was the ultimate environmental consequences of the baseline-setting scheme. The three issues are: (1) The technical problems with using baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to accurately predict the qualities of gasoline imported in 1990 from a foreign refiner; (2) the ability of the agency to adequately verify and enforce the use of foreign refiner individual baselines, including problems identifying the refinery of origin of imported gasoline and enforcing performance standards against a foreign refiner; and (3) any risk that would result from providing refiners or importers with options in establishing baselines. The final regulations for reformulated and conventional gasoline, promulgated on December 15, 1993 pursuant to a court ordered deadline, attempt to resolve these issues. These issues, however, are complex and have potentially broad consequences. EPA therefore announced that it would continue to consider individual baselines for foreign refiners after promulgation of the Final Rules in mid-December 1993. This consideration has resulted in today's proposal, with EPA inviting comments on the proposed resolution described above. The first issue involved whether and when it would be appropriate to allow refiners or importers an option in establishing individual baselines. In general, EPA's Final Rule takes the approach that options should not be allowed. Given a choice, a refiner or importer would tend to choose the option requiring the least expense overall, which would also presumably be the least protective of the environment. Avoiding options should therefore tend to avoid skewing the program in a way that would reduce air quality benefits. EPA described this gaming concern in the preamble to the Final Rule, at 59 FR 7785 (February 16, 1994). Under EPA's Final Rule, domestic refiners are basically provided no choice regarding individual baselines_they must develop an individual baseline, using one or more of three different methods or modelling approaches. Since gasoline produced by domestic refiners made up an overwhelming majority of the gasoline sold in the U.S. in 1990, the average of all domestic refiner baselines should closely approximate the average 1990 quality of gasoline sold in 1990. Importers are treated like domestic refiners in that they are not provided an option on how to develop an individual baseline. A major difference, however, is that importers may use only the first of the three modeling methods. If the data are not available for this method, the importer defaults to the statutory baseline. In general, EPA expects all or almost all importers to default to the statutory baseline.
