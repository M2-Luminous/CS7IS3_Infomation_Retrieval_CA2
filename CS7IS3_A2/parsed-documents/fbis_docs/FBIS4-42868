Lakopoulos: "Intelligence Service Factions"] [Text] For the past several months, a storm has been brewing on the top floors of the Katekhakis Street skyscraper which houses the offices of the National Intelligence Service [EIP]. The internecine conflict, whose outcome to date remains undecided, has escalated thanks to the actions of a group of Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] party members who hold official trade union status within EIP. Critical of their director, they are demanding certain changes in the structure and administration of the Service. The administration in turn believes its critics' motives to be "largely self-serving and vengeful." Service director Admiral Leonidhas Vasilikopoulos, an officer with a brilliant career and a democratic past, is in the eye of the storm and is observing in-house developments with composure, and waiting for the waters to calm before giving in to a counteroffensive trade. Nevertheless, things are extremely serious. The trade unionists who are criticizing the administration are members of PASOK--some even participated in party congresses. In this capacity, they sent two letters to the executive bureau on 14 January 1994 and 14 February 1994, seeking the removal of the director. This was after the bridges between them had already been severed. Mr. Vasilikopoulos' reaction, though discreet, matched their own style of operations: Being himself a member of the PASOK Central Committee at the time, he addressed himself to the same executive bureau in his vested capacity and, in the name of the party, asked them to resume their duties. At the next congress, the trade unionists were ready for him: they lobbied energetically to prevent his reelection. He got 346 votes and came in 190th. This "victory" was celebrated appropriately, yet the admiral does not seem to mind. What exactly is going on? Tempest in Intelligence Sanctum The situation which has developed within EIP can be characterized as explosive and dangerous. In a service sensitive about its bad past, this escalating power struggle takes on at times the form of an "unorthodox war" which threatens to reveal to the public information--whether true or not--that could damage even the service activities of EIP. Threats and accusations are flying about, unsigned denunciations are circulating, and personages known as "Anonymous" threaten old EIP members with public disclosures. Throughout the mess, in this atmosphere of reciprocal mistrust and blackmail, party factionalism is rising rapidly, while "democrats" vs. "junta supporters" and "greens" vs. "the Gryllakis people" coexist in a silent balance of terror. Incriminating Dialogue The trade unionists are asking for a "dialogue" and claim that they already have the plan for the "democratization of EIP." The administration counters that this "is not a matter of trade unionism, but of party members who wish to control a service which can no longer be influenced by political parties--as was the case in the past." Serious insinuations hide behind such declarations from the two sides. The trade unionists are threatening to release "documents" detrimental to the director, since they will prove that he "is collaborating with people who were in power in the past." In a flyer signed by the "Coordinating Committee" of the "Democratic Cooperation" one finds the following statement: "Our national conscience obliges us at present to keep our silence." The administration, on the other hand, insists: "Even if Admiral Vasilikopoulos does belong to PASOK, his very record does not allow him to repeat within EIP what occurred in the past, and especially during that period between 1981 and 1989, that nobody can be proud of." The trade unionists reply that "The director has not honored the preelection promise he made at a public rally, namely, to lend his support to those who had been ousted previously." To this, Mr. Vasilikopoulos' aides reply that "the fact that he participated in a public rally in his capacity as a PASOK official cannot be used to hinder the director of the EIP from performing his duties." And the mess goes on. The government, for the time being, is following these events with some embarrassment. Minister to the Prime Minister Mr An. Peponis, nominally in charge of EIP, is avoiding any involvement, knowing that Mr. Vasilikopoulos enjoys the full trust of the prime minister. Nevertheless, the trade unionists claim that they have been assured by departing PASOK members of the executive bureau that the director will be replaced or, at the very least, that their own demands will be accepted. When Mr. Vasilikopoulos was informed of this--what kind of EIP director would he be, had he not been?--he redefined the dispute on a different basis: "Either you hold them back, or I'm getting the hell out of here." Nevertheless, a few individuals are trying to negotiate a compromise which will achieve a frictionless coexistence between the director and the party members, and eliminate the danger of having the dispute escalate to the point that it would end up making public "documents" that would hurt not only EIP but also the government. Already, certain "papers" are circulating, which one side considers to be "hot," while the other side thinks they are "counterfeit and created for base purposes." What is their content? Terrorism, which seems to be the "favorite game" of some EIP members, even though legally EIP has no authority to play it. From a certain point of view, all this is the result of a peculiar kind of trade unionism that has been developing over the past several years in EIP--a work place where, significantly, the workers cannot even reveal their occupation. Retirees and Career Officers In the beginning of the 1980's, the New Democracy [ND] tried to "govern EIP from the outside," through a staff of retired officers formed by the party to control--perhaps even more decisively than the regular administration would have done--many officers of the service. After 1989, PASOK countered this effort by encouraging trade unionist activities within EIP. The ND has already paid the price for its decision. PASOK is in danger of doing so. The "retirees" of the one faction and the "trade unionists" of the other are tending to develop into complementary forces. How things develop during the present period will be critical for the future. At the moment, the only winners are the faceless and impersonal mechanisms of EIP, which are often made to serve very opaque interests. In intelligence work, the question what is "democratic" and what not often does not have an easy answer. [Box, p A39] Power Play A certain theory says: "If you want to turn out good pursuers, pick them from among the most pursued." The power struggle that is going on at present in EIP is violating all the rules of service operation. PASOK officials are asking to be "vindicated" and wish to have their "persecutors" removed from office. The director of EIP is sufficiently wise and experienced to realize that playing with fire in this situation is dangerous. Before he intervenes, he prefers to get to know in depth the service in his trust and take stock of his own strengths. On the other side, the trade unionists and party officials appear to be in a hurry and demand "changes here and now." The rift between them was unavoidable and was bound to take on the characteristics that dovetail perfectly with the specificities of the service itself. On Katekhakis Street there is only one modus operandi. And so the theory is confirmed: "If you want to turn out good pursuers, pick them from among the most pursued."
