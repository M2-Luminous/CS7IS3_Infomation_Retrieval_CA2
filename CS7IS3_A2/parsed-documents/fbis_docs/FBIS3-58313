Investigations indicate that his conviction could be the reason for the series of letter bomb attacks [carried out last December]. The unidentified blackmailers threatened to poison several people if their demands were not met. They demanded that a helicopter be placed ready and waiting at a field at Hennersdorf, south of Vienna, at 1:00 PM on Sunday [9 January]. Kuessel should be brought there direct from prison and taken away in the helicopter. His destination was not to be released by the blackmailers until immediately afterwards. Police met most of the blackmailers' demands. They provided a helicopter and they also brought someone resembling Kuessel along to the helicopter, which took off at 1:30 PM. Yet, there was no sign of the blackmailers, whereupon police broke off their mission.
