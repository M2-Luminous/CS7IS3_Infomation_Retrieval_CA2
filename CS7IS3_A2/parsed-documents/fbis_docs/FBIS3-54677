I want to analyze the current situation without any (?intention) of self-justification or escaping criticism. In my yearly report to the parliament a few days ago [words indistinct]. I think that deputies should be generally satisfied with the (?explanations) given. The situation in our newly independent state is very [words indistinct]. Not only our daily tables but also the festive tables are poor or almost empty. And we could still face new difficulties and even graver days. Hard work [word indistinct] will remain an inseparable part of our lives for a long time to come. This is the result of the state's emergence from the fall of empires. [words indistinct] Scores of years are needed for the creation of a secure and prosperous state. If anyone promises you something else, do not believe him. They have fed you for a long time with talk of miracles, but miracles happen only in fairy tales. At present, as a people and government we are solving one single problem: evading the (?revival) [word indistinct] of the Soviet Union. We must note with utmost pride that we are successfully solving that problem. That success is evident in Armenia's balanced foreign policy, the full governability of the situation, and the internal stability in the Republic. The (?collapse) of any of these three political factors is fraught with far graver consequences than the ones generated by price increases and the fall in the standard of living, which are temporary phenomena that can be corrected. Armenia's successes [words indistinct] become more conspicuous when compared to the countries sharing the same fate. It is an undeniable fact that not only Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, which were more or less at our level, but also strong Russia could not escape internal tremors. Armenia's success was not mere chance, but above all the result of wisdom displayed by the people and hard work by the state structures. Despite all the defects and shortcomings, the state's role cannot be (?denied) in this success. While proudly noting this fact, we must protect and deepen this valuable success in the coming year because times are still very dangerous and the situation is extremely (?complex). At this moment I do not want to touch on current affairs, such as the stabilization of industry, regulation of the currency circulation, promotion of trade, elimination of irregularities, economic reforms, and wage indexation. This is not because I do not think that these problems are important, but because it is impossible to talk about them since other more fundamental problems are the main cause of these difficulties. The first is the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, or more correctly, the establishment of peace in Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite the success of the Karabakh self-defense Army, the continuation of the war is fraught with serious danger that threatens the Armenian people's security and prosperity. Because of the war, Armenia is being subjected to a blockade imposed not only by Azerbaijan and Turkey but also by international financial organizations, who are imposing open and covert sanctions. Therefore, to talk about Armenia's economic development and improvement in the people's living conditions is tantamount to engaging in self-delusion or political speculation, which is being successfully implemented by certain opposition forces. Because the war is continuing, no substantial improvement can be made in the Republic's economy and the people's standard of living no matter who is in power. The Armenian authorities' position on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has been and continues to remain the same: The peaceful settlement of the conflict and a mutually agreed upon solution. The Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh authorities have given a positive reply to the CSCE Minsk Group's peace plan, as well as to the mediation initiative of the Russian Federation. Therefore, the establishment of the peace depends not on the Armenian side but on Azerbaijan's position and on the coordination of the peace efforts of the international community and Russia. I can inform you that there is movement that inspires hope in both directions. The second fundamental problem facing us is the adoption of the Armenian Constitution. Its centerpiece is the legislative guarantee of human and civil rights, the clear division of power, and the ensurance of the unimpeded and effective functioning of the government. At first glance this problem looks academic, in view of the burden of numerous daily problems, but it also has practical significance. The adoption of the Constitution will undoubtedly discharge the atmosphere of the political conflict and will give the opportunity to [word indistinct] redirect our people's spiritual and intellectual potential towards constructive and creative labor. And, finally, the third main problem affecting our normal course is to ensure energy independence for Armenia. Under the conditions of the blockade, the work on this matter means continuing to find alternate energy sources. We hope that the drilling work to find the Republic's underground resources will begin soon. However, the possibility of reopening the Armenian nuclear power plant is the most concrete and realistic source of energy. The preliminary work connected with its reopening has already been completed and I want to inform you with pleasure that in the opinion of experts this work is (?satisfactory). The production of power by the nuclear plant is scheduled to begin toward the end of next year. That is peace, Constitution, and nuclear power plant; these are our slogans for the new year, 1994. Happy new year to you.
