Rabin came to the meeting after announcing that the declaration would not be implemented on the agreed date of 13 December. The agreement provides for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. Instead of complying with the agreement, the Israeli side only declared willingness to redeploy the Israeli forces in these two areas. So a disagreement ensued between us and the Israeli side and Mr. Rabin over two issues, the first pertaining to the party entitled to supervise the border crossings and bridges, and the second pertaining to the size of the Jericho area under the agreement. The agreement stipulates that the Palestinians should have supervision of the bridges and crossing points, with a UN presence and Israeli coordination. But the Israeli side has rejected that, claiming the right of supervision for itself. We rejected that Israeli demand because it constituted a violation of the agreement and meant turning the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area into Bantustans or something like a "Red Indian reservation" with the entry and exit keys in Israeli hands. We consider that Israeli demand to be an insult to us and to our Palestinian people's struggle for a just peace and for a historic reconciliation with the people of Israel. Furthermore, nobody would accept such a serious violation of an international agreement concluded under the sponsorship of the United States and the Russian Federation in full view of the whole world. There is another disagreement between us over the meaning of external security. We have agreed to Israeli supervision of external security but we have rejected the deployment of Israeli soldiers on our borders because that would place us under Israeli sovereignty. External security, as we see it and under international law, means that Israel would guarantee the security of our borders if subjected to any threat from any side on the grounds that such a threat would also be a threat to Israel's security. But that does not give Israel the right to deploy its forces on our borders as requested by the Israelis. We have suggested tripartite Israeli, international, and Palestinian patrols to guard the borders. The disagreement over the size of the Jericho area actually shows the extent of Israeli intransigence. Under the Israeli administration, the size of the Jericho area was 720 square km. We have accepted an area of 340 square km drawn on the basis of a 32-km line along the River Jordan and a width of 10 km into the Jericho zone. The three bridges linking the Jericho area with Jordan are situated on that line. The Israeli side insists that the area should only be 27 square km. We reject that because accepting it would mean agreeing to live in a ghetto. Would anyone agree to live in a ghetto? We offered to coordinate with the Israeli side on security matters to allay Israeli fears. They can use the most advanced control technology. We could also use international forces from any states which enjoy Israel's trust, such as the United States, Canada, Norway, or any other European state. At our Cairo meeting we agreed with Mr. Rabin that no comments would be made on the issues discussed but no sooner had we left the meeting hall than the Israeli officials began talking openly about what went on during the meeting. That is not in the interest of our efforts to find an acceptable solution to these matters. If Mr. Rabin believes that he has to look after his people's interests then we also must take into consideration the legitimate demands of Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, and Christian public opinion. We want an urgent solution to these problems, and we want the Declaration of Principles implemented in order to establish peace for our people, the Israeli people, and the rest of the region's peoples, and in order to put an end to the Israeli occupation of our territory.
