The Nicaraguan diplomat said his country is willing to cooperate with Honduras in investigating to what extent the statements in the U.S. report are true. He said: "There is cooperation between the governments and a common goal, therefore, this will be resolved between the two governments." He also said the Honduran Government could make inquiries in Nicaragua to clear up the contras' participation in human rights violations but "those inquiries must be conducted by mail, with help on a judicial and diplomatic level." Explaining the Juan Pablo Cruz Laguna [not further identified] murder case, Rivas said the Nicaraguan Government "does not expect anything more;" however, a sentence must be handed down since right now "a trial is under way." Rivas said: "This has to end with a sentence; it must be clear who is guilty."
