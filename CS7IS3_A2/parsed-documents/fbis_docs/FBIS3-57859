The goodwill visit will also help boost Britain's chances of selling military hardware as naval equipment is high on the South Africans' shopping-list. HMS Norfolk, the first of the Navy's most up-to-date Type 23 frigates, and its support vessel Royal Fleet Auxiliary Grey Rover will visit Cape Town and Simonstown from January 27 to 31. The visit follows an invitation by the chief of the South African Navy, Vice-Admiral Robert Simpson-Anderson. A United Nations ban on military contacts with South Africa was lifted last October, reflecting the government's commitment to end white rule. And it is expected that sanctions preventing the sale of military equipment to South Africa will be lifted following elections in April. UK Defence ministers and officials have been holding discussions with the South African government and the ANC [African National Congress] in preparation for the lifting of the embargo. The British government and defence industry can see significant opportunities for sales of military equipment. There is keen interest in buying naval equipment including offshore patrol craft, maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters because of concern about piracy around the South African coast.
