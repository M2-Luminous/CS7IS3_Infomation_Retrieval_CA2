The four subpanels will hold their inaugural meetings in September but the venues have yet to be decided. The agreement was reached in the inaugural meeting of the Korea- China Industrial Cooperation Committee held at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy in the Kwachon government office complex. Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Kim Chol-su led a 31- member Korean team to the conference, while Wang Zhongyu, Chinese minister of State Economic and Trade Commission, headed his country's 36-member delegation. Industrial cooperation in the four areas was initially agreed on in the summit talks between President Kim Yong-sam and Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng held in Beijing in March. At the summits it was also decided to set up the Korea-China Industrial Cooperation Committee. As for cooperation in cars, the two ministers agreed to focus efforts on automotive parts for the time being. In particular, China requested Korean investment in its development of 30 kind of automotive parts. On the list are fuel and ignition systems, pistons, filters, drum brakes, steering systems, shock absorbers, air conditioner compressors, air bags, door locks, motors, auto lamps and special bearings. In the field of TDX digital switching systems, the two ministers concurred on the necessity of expanding the Chinese communications network through a Korean-Chinese joint venture in Shandong which is now manufacturing small-sized systems capable of handling 2,000-3,000 phone lines. Wang promised that his country will help Korean companies take part in the construction of a communications network in the province of Hunan. In the case of aircraft, the two ministers agreed to equally share expenses in the development and manufacture of medium-sized planes with some 100 seats in accordance with a memorandum on bilateral cooperation in the development of commercial aircraft signed in Seoul June 6. Korea and China will consider allowing third countries to take part in the project in case they have high tech which is not available to them. The two countries will jointly conduct a market survey as soon as possible to choose an appropriate model to be developed. With regards to HDTVs, the two ministers agreed in principle to jointly develop and manufacture them. But they decided to collaborate from the research stage over what type of HDTVs they will develop as the world is still undecided about type. To substantiate cooperation, Korean and Chinese HDTV experts will gather in a workshop to be held in October, probably in Seoul. In the meantime, Korea and China agreed to pursue industrial alliances in natural resources and electricity in additions to the four areas and expand exchanges of industrial specialists as well.
