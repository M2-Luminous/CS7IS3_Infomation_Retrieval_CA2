"Economic development is the center of all our work, reform and opening up are the motive force of development, and development and reform are the foundation of long-term social and political stability in China; and social stability, in turn, is a prerequisite for economic development and smooth progress in reform," the premier said. Li expounded the relationship in his report on government work which he delivered at the first meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). The premier said that China is now presented with a rare historical opportunity and that the work of governments at all levels should be subordinate to and serve the endeavor of seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening China wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining social stability. Li called on governments at all levels "to do a good job in every field of endeavor, identify and solve problems promptly and ensure that reform, development and stability are coordinated and promote each other." Only by so doing, he said, can China win one victory after another in its drive for socialist modernization.
