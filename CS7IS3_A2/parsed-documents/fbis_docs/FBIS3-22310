"The committee has analyzed every aspect, both negative impacts and advantages, and concluded that it should go ahead," Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, chairman of the committee, said. The Pasak Dam project was initiated by His Majesty the King in 1989, but was shelved following public resistance. The project was resurrected in December when the King said in his birthday address that he wished to see the dam completed in time for his 72nd birthday in 1999. The Irrigation Department has said it will take four years to build the dam, to be located at tambon Nong Bua, in Lop Buri's Phatthana Nikhom district. The total cost of the project is estimated at Bt [baht] l4 billion, with the dam itself costing about Bt4 billion. When complete, it will hold 785 million cubic metres of water. Chuan said 70 percent of the allocated budget will be used for land expropriation, and compensation. He dismissed speculation that unscrupulous businessmen might try to cream off some of the money. "We have repeatedly emphasized that the benefits will go to the villagers," he insisted. He said that conservationists need not to be worried about the negative effects on the environment, since the relevant government agencies would concern themselves with forestation. Science, Environment and Technology Minister Phisan Munlasatsathon said that the ministry is prepared to resettle people and animals from the site. Villagers would be relocated to five reserved deteriorating forests. Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said that government would spend Bt9.9 billion to help in the resettlement programme and to find measures to cushion the environment impact. About 120,000 rai of farmland and an estimated 17,663 rai of deteriorating forest will be flooded by the dam lake.
