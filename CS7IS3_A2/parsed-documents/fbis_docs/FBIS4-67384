It was only recently that local authorities found out that, since September 1993, unspecified chemical substances have been lying about on the territory of the city (a few meters away from the Styr River). They had been brought in by the Polish firm "Midas." There are more than 10 tonnes of them in 194 barrels. The cargo had been sent to the local scientific and production society "Industriya-T Ltd." The cargo arrived without a proper contract, specifications, or certificate. "To this day, nobody knows through which Customs post these chemical substances got to Volyn Oblast," oblast chief of the State Administration for Environmental Protection Rostyslav Mihas said indignantly. "One has an impression that they have fallen from the sky. Even a commodity-transportation invoice is missing." Very much about it is a mystery. General director of the "Industriya-T Ltd" Yevhen Lebed maintains that he has no business relations with the Polish firm "Midas." "We have a contract with the `Doris' firm in Wlodawa," said Yevhen Oleksandrovych. "The Poles owe us a few thousand U.S. dollars. We agreed by telephone that, for these dollars, they would send us dyes and varnishes.... As for the firm "Midas," I don't know anything." I would like to believe that this is the case. However, the "commodity" had been stored for one-half year on the "Industriya-T Ltd" premises. Without corresponding documents. It is still unknown what substances are within the barrels. Much later, some unofficial papers in German arrived from Poland. If one is to believe the text, the barrels contain dangerous substances, which decompose upon contact with water, acid, or carbon dioxide and may produce toxic hydrocyanic acid. According to R. Mihas, there is a suspicion that this cargo arrived from another country, but via Poland. When local authorities found out what kind of "commodity" it was, they decided to immediately take it away from the city. The Civil Defense headquarters, the Sanitary Service, and the militia offered their help, and the Procurator's Office started looking into the case.... The chemical substances were transported to the territory of a former military unit and buried in the bunker of the former command post. Again a violation. The military property had been transferred to the collective agricultural enterprise "Ukrayina" in Kivertsi Rayon. However, not only wasn't the farm's leadership asked permission, but it was not even notified [about the chemicals]. Of course, the local residents are upset, as some of them work there. Deputy chairman of the Volyn state administration Andriy Chumachenko said that a letter had been sent to corresponding Polish services with a request to locate the owner of the unknown chemicals. The answer was as follows: "`Pan [Mr.] manager' is under `criminal' investigation." Does the "Midas" firm exist at all? This is how we live. It has already been some time since waste products in the guise of raw materials have been delivered from Germany to the Lutsk plastic wares plant. Take what we don't need. This is done without any authorization on the part of environmental protection bodies. The enterprise cannot reprocess this garbage, yet it continues to arrive. Almost 130 tonnes of German waste products are buried on the territory of the plant. Another 40 tonnes are still lying about....Volyn Oblast. Editorial Note On 28 March 1994, with a mutual agreement by representatives of more than 100 countries that are signatories to the Basel Convention, a total ban was adopted on exporting dangerous waste products (including exports of waste products for reprocessing) from developed countries to developing ones and to countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS. Today, 98 percent of waste products of various industries accumulate precisely in 24 most advanced countries of the world -- from now on they will have to deal with that junk on their own. It is true, though, that Ukraine has not yet joined the Basel Convention. That is why it is being used as a dumping ground.
