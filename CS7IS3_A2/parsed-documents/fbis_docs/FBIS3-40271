This limit was set at 0.21 percent and the limit for the V2 blocks -- 1,000 Mbq -- at 2.3 percent. In absolute figures, this means that from the V1 blocks, 1,600 cubic meters of decontaminated liquids were released into the environment in July, 650 in August, and 990 in September. The situation in other months was quite similar. The remaining part of liquid radioactive waste cannot be released, since it would remain radioactive even after the decontamination process. Waste of this kind, as well as solid waste, such as various contaminated objects and equipment used for maintenance, routine repairs, and overhauls of atomic reactors (rugs, protective tools, metallic tools, and other materials), are stored in specially designated areas equipped for this purpose. Both liquid and radioactive waste must be fixed [ridden of volatile parts] during further processing to meet transportation and storage regulations. "Fixation, or the solidification of radioactive waste, is nothing more than giving the material a convenient structure for long-term storage," Konecny says. The fixation of liquid and solid waste is done using various methods -- cementation, bituminization, vitrification, and other methods. The deadline for the test run at the site of the radioactive waste permanent deposit in Mochovce is approaching. So far, the radioactive waste has been stored inside the power stations -- at the Bohunice V1 and V2. From a long-term view, however, this is not the final solution, especially if we realize that last year, the nuclear power station in Jaslovske Bohunice produced 120-200 cubic meters of solid waste and 250 cubic meters of liquid waste that cannot be decontaminated.
