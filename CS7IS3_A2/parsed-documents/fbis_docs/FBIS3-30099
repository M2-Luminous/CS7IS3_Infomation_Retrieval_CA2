The decision emerged at a meeting of related cabinet ministers held at prime minister Morihiro hosokawa's official residence. The top government spokesman quoted the premier as telling the meeting that it is natural for Japan to take necessary market- opening steps on its own volition, regardless of its trade negotiations with the United States. Takemura told a news conference the planned government package will not only cover four areas pinpointed earlier but will also include other necessary measures to further open Japan's markets. The government said last week it will map out a program to speed up deregulation, strengthen import and investment promotion steps, revamp competition policy and improve government procurement processes. Friday's meeting brought together Hosokawa, Takemura and chiefs of the foreign, finance, trade, posts, health and transport ministries, as well as those of the Economic Planning Agency and of the Management and Coordination Agency. The schedule of the next such cabinet meeting is not yet fixed, Takemura said. The cabinet meeting came as the U.S. is increasing pressure on Japan to slash its huge trade surplus following the collapse of bilateral trade talks. On February 11, Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on ways to cut Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. Tokyo spurned a demand from Washington to set numerical targets to gauge the openness of its markets to imports. Asked if Japan will maintain its position of refusing numerical targets in working out a fresh market-opening package, Takemura said, "of course, that's our basic stance." He said no ministers referred in their meeting to an idea of setting nonbinding targets for measuring progress in opening Japan's markets. Takemura also said they did not discuss a proposed dispatch of a special envoy to the U.S. to break the deadlock over trade.
