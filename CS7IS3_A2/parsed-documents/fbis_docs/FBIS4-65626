Yesterday, it was calling for the organization of a regional summit to end the genocide. Today, it was hosting Faustin Twagiramungu, the Rwandan interim prime minister-designate, who was appointed by the Arusha accords as representing a kind of third way between the Rwandan Armed Forces and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. Faustin Twagiramungu held talks this afternoon at the Foreign Ministry in Paris. A Foreign Ministry spokesman this evening revealed that there had been a broad consensus. According to the spokesman, the prime minister-designate insists on the validity of the Arusha accords, on condemning extremists on all sides, and on setting up an international tribunal to judge those guilty of the massacres. Twagiramungu will also see President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Balladur.
