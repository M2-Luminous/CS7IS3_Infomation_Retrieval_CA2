But even this outrageous abuse of state power does not appear to have alerted the Hong Kong community to the very real probability that, in barely three years, a law identical to that which was invoked to commit these two persons to prison, for the crime of disclosing interest rate and gold transaction changes, may be introduced into our own legal system. Article 23 of the Basic Law states that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) shall enact a law to prohibit the "theft of state secrets". Today, Hong Kong has its own Official Secrets Act. It is a law that seeks to protect from "damaging disclosure" information relating to "defence", "security", "intelligence" and "international relations". Each of these terms is defined in the law with reasonable clarity. While many may argue against the reach of this law, few would deny the need to protect these interests even under the most open and democratic system of government. The Joint Declaration promised that laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall be maintained in the SAR. This implied that a localised version of the Official Secrets Act would continue to operate after 1997. But contrary to that promise, the Basic Law decreed that Hong Kong shall also criminalise the "theft of state secrets". It was thereby made clear that, "one country; two systems" notwithstanding, it was the intention of the Chinese authorities that the unique Chinese socialist law concept of secrecy be applied and enforced in Hong Kong after 1997. From recent events we gather that apart from relatively trivial information relating to interest rate movements and the sale of gold in the international market, the Chinese judiciary also regards an embargoed public speech of a senior party official as a "state secret". None of these items of information qualifies to be an official secret either in Hong Kong or in Britain today. Indeed, no sanction has ever followed the regular publication of obviously leaked "predictions" of budget proposals. When some years ago the embargoed text of the Queen's Christmas Day speech was published in advance, the only admonition from the palace was a firm declaration that Her Majesty was not amused. What has emerged, therefore, are two distinctly contradictory conceptions of official information. We believe that the free flow of such information serves not only to check corruption and the abuse of power, but also to increase efficiency and promote accountability. The Chinese authorities, on the other hand, consider the rigorous control of information as indispensable to sustain the essential authoritarianism of their autocratic system. Investigative journalism which is fundamental to one system is obviously anathema to the other. There has also emerged two substantially different conceptions of the role of the judiciary. Their willingness to proceed in secret, to deny the accused persons their basic right to a defence, and then to impose such grossly disproportionate sentences, only tend to confirm the active role of Chinese judges in strengthening and consolidating the "dictatorship of the proletariat". To even suggest that judges ought not to be subservient to the government, as we believe here in Hong Kong, would probably be tantamount to blasphemy. Therefore, to enact a law in Hong Kong to criminalise the "theft of state secrets" is to alter significantly the existing Hong Kong system. It will result in placing an almost insurmountable obstacle in the movement towards democracy and autonomy. It will erode the principles of the rule of law and public accountability, and debilitate at least two of our essential institutions: a free press and an independent judiciary. It ought not to be done. Unlike those who collaborated in the drafting of the Basic Law, a substantial section of today's political leadership enjoys a legitimacy which they have acquired through popular election or acceptance. If they do not focus on this issue now, history is not likely to look upon them too kindly.
