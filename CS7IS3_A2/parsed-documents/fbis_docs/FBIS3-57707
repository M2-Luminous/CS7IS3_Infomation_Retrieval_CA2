This was said to Interfax by a high-ranking official from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk called upon the parliament to ratify the START I and to sign the treaty on nonproliferation on January 24. According to the diplomat, the parliament's plenary session may finish on Monday with no decision made on the president's proposal. This will mean that the settlement of the issue will be deferred for an undetermined period of time. "The Russian president suspended the Supreme Soviet's powers and assumed its authority for the period of transition," the diplomat remarked. "However, the Ukrainian Constitution does not mention the right of the president to sign documents on joining international treaties in the period of parliamentary elections," he emphasized. Deputy Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasuk said that the withdrawal of nuclear military charge from Ukrainian territory would continue until the guaranteed terms for their utilization expired.
