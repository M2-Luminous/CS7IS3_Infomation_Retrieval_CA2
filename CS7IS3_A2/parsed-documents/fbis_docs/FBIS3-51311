The transaction, which also includes the firm that markets gas in canisters for the Italian subsidiary, totaled $60 million. YPF now controls 48 percent of the automotive gas market. Market sources have known about it for several weeks, but the confirmation came from the buyer: YPF admitted having bought the chain of compressed natural gas service stations put up for sale by AGIP six months ago. The transaction cost the mixed petroleum enterprise $60 million, much more than the other companies were willing to pay. They were left in disappointment when YPF's hefty offer was made known in Italy. With the absorption of the 104 service stations operated by AGIP throughout the nation, YPF now dominates the GNC market, which is still booming thanks to the policy of replacing liquid fuel in motor vehicles. The development brings relief to AGIP, a subsidiary of the state-run Ente Nazionale de Hidrocarburi (ENI). Like the rest of ENI, it is feeling the sting of the Italian corruption scandals, which in this case set off a privatization plan. The privatization of AGIP was carried out with the consultation of the Swiss banking industry. ENI has been selling off all its possessions in Argentina, including a 4,200-hectare field in Entre Rios valued at $3.8 million. YPF decided to forego this asset; although it does want to expand, it will continue devoting itself exclusively to the hydrocarbon business. The company, led by Jose Estenssoro, was more attracted to the other goods that were being sold. There are two ways of profiting on this new property: on the canister market, and through the marketing of GNC. In these two areas, AGIP was fairly active in Argentina. It accounted for 26 percent of GNC sales, a third of total spending on gas in canisters. In addition, it had 12 automated bottling plants to put gas in cylinders and canisters, valve maintenance shops that operated under the name Comsergas, and a fleet of trucks. "The deal is closed," sources at YPF said. Argentine AGIP will now be called YPF Gas S.A., and will be devoted to the bottling, distribution, and marketing of liquefied petroleum gas (in containers) and compressed natural gas, according to the official communique. The oil company paid "$60 million (for 100 percent of the AGIP stock package), subject to adjustments under the terms of the contract," adds the press release on YPF stationery. "When do you take possession of the property?" CLARIN asked officials at Estenssoro's company, in which the state is a 20-percent shareholder. "In the next few days, by next week for sure." [CLARIN] Have you already paid? [Answer] I do not have that information. [CLARIN] Was the payment in cash? [Answer] I do not know that, either. The fact that few statements can be obtained aside from documents sent to the commodity exchange is par for the course, now that the largest company in Argentina has been privatized. But the privatization of AGIP followed a similar pattern. All those interested in the Italian properties had to keep their lips sealed regarding the transaction. Those who responded to the call of the Swiss banks received a booklet with the basic figures concerning the operations of the firm established by Enrico Mattei (father of ENI) after World War II. They were sworn to silence with respect to the content of the booklet. Some of those initially interested were turned off by the nature of the sale. It was not an adjudication in the Argentine tradition, which, in the best of cases, is defined as a highest-bidder transaction. ENI studied the offers and decided on the winner a piacere [at its whim]. They were also displeased with the prices that began to be mentioned: In Rome there was talk of figures as high as 100 million pesos. Small oil companies were not willing to pay more than 40 million for the entire package. Before an official offer was made, Astra, Puma (Soldati Group), and even Shell, which had made initial overtures, withdrew from the bidding. It came down to the home stretch, and Argon, one of the three A's (along with AGIP and Autogas) that monopolize the canister market, faced defeat. So, reportedly, did Sol Petroleo, a small company that sells gas and also distills solvents. But YPF beat them hands down. Estenssoro had his heart set on annexing the AGIP infrastructure. The goal is to turn the GNC stations into dual stations that can also sell gasoline, which would give it a better edge in the fuel market that YPF, Shell, and Esso are competing for. With an additional investment of between $80,000 and $100,000 per station, it will add to its arsenal the outlets acquired from AGIP in the Capital and in Greater Buenos Aires. To round out its strategy, all it needs to do is persuade the station managers to exchange the yellow AGIP sign for the light blue YPF sign. [Box, p 20] Disturbing Growth Domingo Cavallo was upset by the idea. Just when the Economy Ministry is trying to do something to combat the oligopolistic practices in fuel sales, YPF strengthens its position in the GNC market with the purchase of AGIP, which gives it a 48 percent share. His closest aides even discussed ways of suggesting that YPF pull out of the deal. But YPF is run by Jose Estenssoro, the executive president who acts on behalf of the D-class (private) shareholders. And while the state still holds 20 percent of the shares, that amount bears no weight when it comes to making operational decisions, which in many cases are reported to the rest of the board of directors after they have already been made. Now YPF also has the edge in the GNC market, where sales have multiplied several thousand times in less than eight years. On the other markets, it was already number one: In gasoline and gasoil, it leads all other companies; it controls more than half of the oil and gas reserves and production facilities, as well as distilling capacity. In the private management of YPF, what matters most is showing good results to the stockholders on the inside, and the more numerous ones on the outside. For this reason, the addition of the AGIP sales network will enable it to compete better and with fewer outlays: All it will have to do is add hoses for gasoline and gasoil to the existing GNC connections. Since the oil company will retain the management of the stations located in the Capital and Greater Buenos Aires (those in the interior will be subject to private management and credit), it may show a new face soon, with the more modern facilities that AGIP operated. This will cost less than upgrading the stations connected to the YPF network. For the Economy Ministry, this is less a matter of business than of strategic considerations. The problem arises when the international prices of crude oil fluctuate, while Argentine gasoline prices act as if nothing had happened. This occurred a few months ago, and in addition to the finger-pointing and momentary anger at YPF, Shell, and Esso, it prompted a petition filed with the defense council that deals with these matters. The petition was based on allegations of oligopolistic management, and it is not known what the ruling was. Paving the way for more effective control, the draft of the new hydrocarbon law contains a chapter providing severe penalties for monopolistic or oligopolistic practices. Under this system of enforcement, YPF is in for closer scrutiny.
