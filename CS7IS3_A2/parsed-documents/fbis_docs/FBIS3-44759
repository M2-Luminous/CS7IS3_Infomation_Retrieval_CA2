The situation is now returning to normal following a government notice to bring an end to the chaos. With a circular setting out a restructuring of the foreign exchange system on December 30, last year, shopping malls here where FECs circulated were crowded with shoppers. The Friendship Store took in more than one million FEC on one day, amounting to much more than the usual daily takings of 100,000 FEC. A handful of shoppers used FECs to buy household electrical appliances while most people spent their certificates on daily necessities and food. Stores adjusted the exchange rate between the renminbi and the FEC on their own because they did not know how else to solve the problem, leading to disturbances by FEC-holders. The People's Bank of China in response issued a special notice to clear up doubts regarding circulation of FECs and how they were to be cleared in accordance with the official exchange rate posted on December 31, 1993. The issuing of this notice helped ease the chaos to a great extent. Shoppers using FECs are now becoming increasingly fewer in number. Some foreign-funded hotels here stopped accepting FECs on January 1.
