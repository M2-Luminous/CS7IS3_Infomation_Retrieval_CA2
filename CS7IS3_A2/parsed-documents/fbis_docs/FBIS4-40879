They erroneously believe that it was regular and centralized deliveries of energy resources that allowed our economy to remain afloat. It should be noted that, indeed, production and consumer demand for energy resources were completely met in 1993-94. However, no one ever asked the question -- at what cost and with what consequences? -- or saw fit to provide an answer. Let us clarify this issue. The centralized supply of these resources to the Republic is being carried out through natural exchanges in the form of clearing operations and bartering. However, such economic relations have irrecoverably damaged the national economy and triggered a wide range of negative consequences. In particular, according to experts' estimates, in comparison with our losses in 1993 -- due to underestimated prices for Belarusian-made products delivered on a clearing basis ($349 million) and overestimated prices for Russian-produced goods ($88 million) -- our 1994 will total some $437 million. Belarusian economic entities -- dealing with clearing-basis deliveries -- continue to suffer losses. For example, prices for tractors delivered on a clearing basis stand at 82 percent of market prices in Belarus and Russia, while prices for cars -- 85 percent. Due to this, in 1993 the Minsk Vehicle Factory suffered losses amounting to 69 billion Belarusian rubles [R], while in January-April of 1994 -- R18 billion. To fulfill planed deliveries of refrigerators on a clearing basis in 1994, the Minsk Refrigerator Factory will suffer losses amounting to R135 billion. Due to the unprofitability of deliveries of Belarusian-produced goods by our enterprises, the Republic chronically fails to meet its commitments. Already in 1994, clearing-based imports from Russia have exceeded our exports by 37 percent, which automatically triggers equivalent nondeliveries from Russia. Economically unjustified prices are imposed on products delivered on the basis of clearing transactions and intergovernmental agreements. In particular, oil prices on the Belarusian market in January slightly exceeded 70 percent of clearing-based prices, in May -- 62 percent (foreign prices for oil in 1994 stood at $85 per tonne, while the domestic price in January was $61, and in May -- $53); prices and tariffs on electricity and central heating in Belarus are roughly four times lower than prices for electricity and gas imported for these purposes. If we can put it this way, our economic policy lacks sense. We are buying products from Russia at high prices and selling them on our domestic market at low prices. The question arises: At what expense and who is being made to compensate for these expenditures? At the expense of eating away at our foreign loans. In accordance with the aforementioned trends, as a result of price distortions, participants in clearing-based deliveries are suffering huge losses. For example, this year, the Ministry of Resources -- handling clearing-based oil deliveries to Belarus -- suffered losses to the tune of R838 billion, while the Ministry of Energy -- after selling electricity and heating to Belarusian consumers -- suffered losses amounting to some R4 trillion. The Belarusian Government probably has resources, which could allow it to compensate for these losses. However, the answer is not clear: The government has no such assets. Between January and April of this year, the government used some R1.2 trillion -- or 15.4 percent of all budget expenditures, that is, the entire volume of yearly budget expenditures designated for these purposes -- to underwrite state subsidies. Moreover, according to Finance Ministry estimates, in connection with the shortsighted pricing policy regarding the import of energy resources and the preservation of the old system of regulating prices for agricultural products, bread, milk, tariffs for municipal services, city transportation, and so on, some R5-6 trillion will have to be issued for these purposes (according to May 1994 figures, we have every reason to believe that this sum will be much higher). Despite the fact that Belarusian consumers receive energy resources at prices which are lower than their import prices, and due to the weakening of payment discipline and solvency among the enterprises, their debts for using energy resources -- received on a clearing basis and through intergovernmental agreements -- are growing. As of late May 1994, the oil debts of Belarusian enterprises to the Ministry of Resources amounted to R760 billion or 69 billion Russian rubles; gas debts to the Belarusian State Company for Gas Transportation and Delivery -- R5.9 trillion or 534.1 billion Russian rubles; debts for electricity and central heating to the Ministry of Energy -- some R1.4 trillion or 125 billion Russian rubles. Mutual debts of all Belarusian enterprises for oil, gas, and energy resources total more than R8 trillion or 729 billion Russian rubles. Distortion of domestic and foreign prices, increases in debts for energy resources, lack of budget means necessary to cover losses of importers of energy resources prompt increases in Belarusian debts to other states, primarily to Russia. Oil debts of the Belarusian Ministry of Resources in late May reached R760 billion or 69 billion Russian rubles, gas debts -- R5.8 trillion or 533 billion Russian rubles, and electricity debts -- $869 billion or 79 billion Russian rubles. The system regulating economic relations exerts constant pressure on the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble and triggers its decrease. Taking into account the impact of a stable exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble on the stabilization of the national economy and continued speculations of some of our statesmen on this issue, I will present the bases of this subject. The economic essence of the ratio of one currency to another is nothing more than the price of money. It, in turn, as the price of any commodity, depends on the market correlation between supply and demand. It has been tested in practice and confirmed by economic relations that if demand exceeds supply, prices rise. If it is the other way around, prices fall. Considering the price of money -- the currency exchange rate -- the correlation between these indexes is defined by trade and payment balances. If they are negative, then the price of a given state's currency is lower than the price a partner-state's currency. When these negative balances increase, prices -- the currency rate of a state with this negative tendency in trade and payment balances -- continue to fall. What about these tendencies in the Belarusian economy? According to the State Committee for Statistics, Belarusian imports in 1993, in particular, from Russia, exceeded exports by R1.149 trillion, while in the first quarter of this year the negative trade balance reached a level of R713 billion. Due to this negative balance and the aforementioned regulation of intergovernmental agreements, current Belarusian debts to Russia, as of late May, stood at R7.4 trillion or 681 billion Russian rubles. In connection with the increase in the negative balance in trade and current debt, demand for Russian rubles has increased, while in connection with the decrease in exports -- the supply of Russian rubles has decreased. This, overall, triggered the devaluation of the Belarusian ruble. The increase in the supply of Belarusian rubles -- due to increased credit allotments by the Belarusian National Bank forced under constant pressure from the government -- considerably decreased the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble. Our estimates indicate that the rate of the Belarusian ruble against the Russian ruble fell in inverse proportion to the increase in earmarked credits. The increase in the proportion of the Belarusian-Russian trade balance -- based on barter and clearing deals -- has also had some impact on the falling Belarusian ruble exchange rate. If in 1993 barter deals composed 17 percent of all Belarusian exports, in the first quarter of 1994, that figure reached 30 percent. Barter operations narrow the sphere of the money-exchange relationship and thus increase the disparity between supply and demand for a currency. The increase in the negative trade and payment balance, growth in the unfounded issue of credits, and the naturalization of foreign trade prompted the drop in the Belarusian ruble exchange rate against the Russian ruble from 1.33 (as of 24 March 1993) to 4.51 (as of January 1994), later to 9.97 (as of 1 April 1994) and 11.00 (as of 1 June 1994). Therefore, state regulation did not only exacerbate the problems, but also triggered an economic collapse and deep crisis in the financial situation of enterprises and the state. The image of social welfare, however, did develop. Proceeding from the officially confirmed 35-percent drop in industrial production in the first quarter of 1994 and taking into account the impossibility of selling at least half of all goods produced, the real drop in production stood at 75 percent. By using energy resources and other material elements of production, and selling products at fixed prices, enterprises are operating in a mishmashed environment, which aggravates their financial situation. The bulk of our enterprises lost their directions and prospects -- formed under market relations -- for development. Our agricultural sector is also experiencing difficulties. Increases in state support for this sector of the economy, in the form of state subsidies and favorable credits, does not at all compensate for all losses incurred from violations of price parity for agricultural and industrial goods. The financial situation in the transportation network -- in particular, in city transport -- and municipal services due to tariffs, which are lower than production expenditures, is continuing to exacerbate. In particular, 90 percent of costs for housing and municipal services should be subsidized by the state and only 10 percent -- be covered by tariffs. Limited subsidies from the budget do not provide for the financial stabilization of the enterprises in this sector. Eventually, state regulation of the economy, which does not agree with basic economic laws, has exacerbated the already distorted financial situation in Belarus, primarily, its budget, and has prompted a huge budget deficit. To cover this deficit in the first quarter of this year, the Belarusian National Bank has used its yearly quota of credit issues. Along with this, foreign debts have climbed to such a level that the Republic is in danger of going bankrupt. The Belarusian people will have to pay a considerable price for overcoming this situation.
