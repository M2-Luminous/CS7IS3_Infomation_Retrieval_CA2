Prime Minister Hosokawa said that a 6-trillion-yen [Y] reduction in income and resident taxes will be carried out while the consumption tax will be replaced with a 7 percent national welfare tax. The prime minister said that the proposed tax system is designed to help boost the economy, noting the tax reductions will be retroactive to 1 January 1994 and the tax increase will go into effect in April 1997 -- about three years after the tax reduction is carried out. We would like to give a positive evaluation to the government's proposal because the prime minister's decision basically reflects the purpose of tax system reform aimed at introducing a new tax system that imposes adequate taxes on income, consumption, and properties so that the people feel impartial about their own tax burden. We would also like to admit that even though a future tax hike is scheduled, the tax reductions will have instant an effect on the economy. There is the opinion that it would be more effective to increase taxes two or three years after a tax cut is carried out. However, of course, there is a counter-argument that the people would feel uneasy about when and what sort of tax increase will be carried out and that such a plan would curb economic activities. Above all, we would like to stress that this issue's real substance lies in tax system reform. For those reasons, we can basically support the government's decision. However, there is a problem in the government's decision- making process. Although we do not simply subscribe to a critical view that the government has formed a hasty conclusion without listening to public opinion and the ruling parties' opinions, we wonder why the prime minister could not simply say that the government will raise the consumption tax. He must have thought that the government's introduction of the national welfare tax, which replaces the consumption tax, can win the people's understanding. But it is wrong. However hard one thinks, a national welfare tax is a consumption tax. There is no doubt that most of the people will consider the government's proposal as deceiving the people, and the people will increase their opposition to the proposal. Most of the taxpayers must be considering that the consumption tax has taken root in its own way except political activists, scholars who stick to their own ideas, and their followers. In this sense, the prime minister should have openly and logically explained the reason the government has to raise the consumption tax. If he takes such an honest attitude, the people would further support his government. We also wonder why the amount of the tax increase is set at Y9.5 trillion despite the amount for the tax cut being Y6 trillion. We think the tax increase is too big, even if various welfare measures are taken under the name of the national welfare tax. The government is required to study the possibility of expanding the scale of tax reductions including corporate taxes. It will take a little more time to make a final decision. Thorough discussions by the Tax System Reform Council are scheduled to begin soon. In promoting discussions, there are many things to discuss -- such as whether three years is an adequate grace period for the tax increase, whether some portions of the current consumption tax system should be reviewed, and for what purposes the national welfare tax should be used.
