The university and high school students paraded through the city's Left Bank carrying banners reading "Equal pay for equal work." The demonstration was mainly peaceful but between 500 and 1,000 youths, some of them masked and armed with clubs, broke away from the main march near the Montparnasse Tower and smashed shop windows, cars and telephone booths. They tried to break into a shopping complex, but the doors had been locked. Police said they were trying to surround and arrest the violent protestors. Hundreds of other demonstrators staged a sit-in on a main boulevard. The marchers demanded that the conservative government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur withdraw its measures completely, although Balladur has watered them down considerably. Several thousand students also staged demonstrations in the French provinces, at Dunkerque in the north, Charleville-Mezieres, Besancon, Belfort, Vesoul and Montbeliard in the east and at Bayonne in the south-west. One of the march organisers, Philippe Campinchi, president of the socialist student union UNEF-ID, called on all Parisians to join in. "Workers, youths, jobless, come and join us," he said, and called for a strike Friday in all high schools. Campinchi met with Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy earlier on Thursday. "The minister did a lot of explaining, but he did not give way on the essential which is abrogation of the decrees" announcing the new measures, Campinchi said. Initially the government planned to allow firms to recruit youths at less than the minimum take-home pay of 880 dollars a month whatever their qualifications, in an attempt to cut unemployment. But it backed down in negotiations with the trade unions, saying holders of university degrees or certain diplomas would be paid 80 percent of the going rate set by collective agreement in the various sectors of industry, provided arrangements were made for training of the youths. No one with a diploma would in any case get less than the minimum wage, the government conceded. The communist-led CGT [General Confederation of Labor] trade union is planning its own demonstrations here and in the provinces next Saturday. With French unemployment standing at a record 3.3 million or 12.2 percent, employers and conservatives say the minimum wage is excessive and a major structural impediment to job creation. Students and unions had charged that the Balladur proposals would allow employers to simply replace existing workers with more educated youths at lower wages.
