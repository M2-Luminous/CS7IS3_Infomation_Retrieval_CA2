Governor Fu Xishou attended and spoke at the conference, while Yang Liangduo, vice governor and concurrently director of the provincial foreign affairs office, delivered a work report. The conferees agreed: In 1993 Anhui, saw the fastest and most productive growth of its economy, as well as an accelerating pace of opening to the outside world. Today an excellent situation of multidirectional opening at various levels and through different channels has taken shape in the province. Workers engaged in foreign affairs have made their share of contributions to promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the provincial economy and to accelerating the pace of opening to the outside world. In his speech, the governor said: Local governments should further gear their foreign affairs work to the needs of economic construction, reform, and opening up. To effectively carry out foreign affairs work, they should familiarize themselves with the pulse of local economic developments as well as with some knowledge of economics. He emphasized: We should strengthen the centralized, unified leadership over foreign affairs work and the management by the relevant departments. Principal party and government leaders at all levels should show concern for and support foreign affairs and should bring into full play the functions of foreign affairs offices, which can only be strengthened, not weakened. Foreign affairs offices should help party committees and governments implement to the letter the central authorities' principles and policies on foreign affairs. They should give good advice and serve as competent assistants to the party committees and governments while providing quality service to other departments and units. He added: Foreign affairs and foreign liaison departments at all levels should fight corruption and promote clean government to intensify the building of spiritual civilization. They should firmly crack down on and correct some unhealthy practices and chaotic situations in contacts with foreign affairs matters, in striving to score periodic results to ensure Anhui's opening in a sound, orderly manner. In his report, Yang Duoliang emphasized: Foreign affairs departments should foster an overall concept of foreign affairs and improve work in the following seven areas: 1) strengthening management to ensure that Anhui's foreign affairs work proceeds in a healthy, orderly way; 2) actively expanding contacts with foreign countries by inviting more persons to visit Anhui and sending more persons abroad; 3) increasing exchanges with foreign countries in various forms and through different channels; 4) strengthening the functions of foreign affairs offices and improving the quality of their staff members; 5) reinforcing discipline in foreign affairs work and enhancing the security concept to safeguard the national dignity and security; 6) stepping up publicity to foreign countries to make Anhui and the degree of its opening better known to the outside world; and 7) strengthening the leadership to go all-out in promoting the opening to the outside world.
