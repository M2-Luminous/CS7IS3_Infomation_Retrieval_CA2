FR941004-1-00097 FR941004-1-00018 Section 1357.16␣Annual Progress Reviews and Services Reports This new section of Part 1357 implements and closely follows the requirements of section 432 of the Act. In summary, sections 432 (a)(2) and (a)(5) require that once the five-year plan is developed and in operation, the State and the Indian tribe annually must review the progress made in accomplishing the goals in the plan; and, on the basis of the annual (interim) review, must: •Periodically update or revise the statement of goals in the plan, if necessary, to reflect changed circumstances; •Prepare, send to ACF, and make available to the public, a description of the services that will be provided in the immediately succeeding fiscal year under the plan; and •Include in the description of services the population(s) to be served and the geographic area(s) where services will be available. Paragraph (a) reflects the statutory requirement for an annual review of progress toward accomplishing the goals and objectives in the plan and the preparation of an Annual Progress and Services Report, based on updated information. It also requires that the State and the Indian tribe involve the agencies, organizations, and individuals who are a part of the on-going consultation and coordination process in the development of paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4), i.e., revisions in the statement of goals and objectives and descriptions of services to be provided in the up-coming fiscal year. Paragraphs (a) (1) through (7) propose that the content of the report must include: A report on specific accomplishments and progress made toward meeting goals and objectives; any revisions to the goals and objectives; a description of the continuum of services to be provided in the upcoming year (see §1357.15 (n)); information on training, technical assistance, research, evaluation, and management information systems efforts; and, for States only, information required to document the maintenance of effort (supplantation) requirement. The annual review must be based on updated information in order to measure progress in achieving the goals and objectives in the CFSP. States and Indian tribes may utilize various sources of information (as they did in establishing the goals and objectives in the five-year plan) such as future State management information system reports (e.g., SACWIS/AFCARS/NCANDS); other planning processes; available public and private data sources (e.g., health departments, ``Kids Count Data Book''); and outcomes of other activities such as monitoring, quality assurance efforts, and service delivery improvements. We believe the information we propose to require in the Annual Progress and Services Report, like the information required in 45 CFR 1357.15(n), is a modest extension of information available to and, for most of the services in the continuum, already being provided to ACF. We also believe that this information is and will be important, useful, and necessary as States, Indian tribes, public and private agencies and organizations, advocacy groups, parents, and others continue to work over the five-year plan period to bring about improved well-being for children and families. In paragraph (b) we propose deadlines for submitting the Annual Progress and Services Report to ACF, based on the requirement in section 432(a)(5). In paragraph (c), we specify the information that should be reported by those States and Indian tribes that used FY 1994 funds for services. Paragraph (d) proposes to require each State and Indian tribe to make the Annual Progress and Services Reports available to the agencies and organizations and others with whom they are consulting and working to coordinate services. We do not specify a mechanism(s) that must be used to do this; we believe there are many options for this purpose including newsletters, public reports to the media, and use of electronic bulletin boards. Paragraphs (e) and (f) reflect requirements in section 432 (a)(2) of the Act for a final review in FY 1999 of progress made toward accomplishing the goals and objectives in the five-year plan and the development of a new plan for the next five-year period. States and Indian tribes must conduct a final review; prepare a final Progress and Services report; send the final report to ACF, and make it available to the public; and, in consultation with a broad range of agencies, organizations, practitioners, and others, develop a new five-year plan following the requirements in §1357.15.
