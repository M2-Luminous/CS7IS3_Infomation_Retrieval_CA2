Although it preserved more than four-fifths of the territory of the USSR, even so it has slightly more than half the population of the former USSR and controls no more than half the gross national product of the USSR in 1990. If we are speaking of society as a whole, Russia has certainly not achieved political accord yet and its strategic economic future is not clear yet either. The important conclusion follows from this that at least for a time, in terms of most parameters (other than the size of territory and military potential), Russia has moved to the category of medium-sized (regional) powers. China is undergoing fundamental changes too. The phenomenal rate of development achieved in recent years is making this state one of the leaders in terms of overall might and prospects for development no longer only among the "third world" countries. However, China, which is now second in the world after the United States in terms of total production of goods and services (gross domestic product), continues to enjoy all the advantages of a "developing country." Remember that Russia is in 10th place for this indicator, behind not only the United States and China but even Japan, Germany, India, France, Italy, Great Britain, and Brazil. Today China is third in the world in terms of industrial production, behind only the United States and Japan, while Russia is in fifth place. It is no secret that today people in the PRC [People's Republic of China] are extremely disturbed by the changes in the geopolitical situation along the perimeter of China's borders and the especially destabilizing influence on Chinese society of sociopolitical processes in the CIS republics, which theoretically might bring to China processes similar to those which caused the dissolution of the USSR, given the separatist trends in Tibet, Xinjiang, and Guangdong. Despite the obvious success of the reforms, there are difficulties of a political and economic nature in China just as in Russia, and the future appearance of this country is not perfectly clear, which obviously worries not only its closest neighbors. Russia is a Eurasian power, and its interests in connection with this are objectively grouped in both the West and the East. Russia's role in Asia is gradually beginning to change. The country's national interests were wrongly assessed by USSR foreign policy strategists. The struggle against imperialism and then against the PRC for a long time had a prominent place in our country's foreign policy course in Asia, while other countries for the most part concentrated on maintaining or achieving the needed growth in labor productivity per capita, which should finally be regarded of paramount importance in Russia's strategy. But at the same time Russia must now also decide which components of its national interests are to be realized and in what direction. And the approach to this question should be as pragmatic as possible. That does not mean Russia's assuming a one-sided orientation to the West or to the East, which still occurs depending on the domestic policy situation in the country, but rather it means achieving a consensus among the political elite in terms of what direction the "strategic partnership" needed for peaceful existence and to attract new technologies and investments to modernize the economy should take; and where we can find mutually advantageous cooperation in relations and the balance of economic interests needed for Russia's geopolitical stability. It is perfectly clear that today large-scale investments and new technologies can only come to Russia from the West; that is the objective reality. Regardless of our likes and dislikes, the United States' role here is a crucial one in all senses. That is why access to U.S. markets is so important to Russia. True, behind the talk of a "strategic partnership" of democratic Russia with the United States, we somehow do not hear of successes of Russian diplomacy in achieving most-favored nation status in trade with this country, while communist China easily extends this status from year to year. At the same time, however, China is not only our largest Asian neighbor with a dynamic rate of development (the ratio of the yearly volume of production of GNP between Russia and China dropped from 2:1 in 1990 to 1.25:1 in 1992 and may change to 0.75:1 by the year 2000) and a population of almost 1.5 billion people opposite the sparsely populated territories of Siberia and the Far East. It is now the second most important trade partner with the Russian Federation after the FRG. The PRC is apparently the only country upon which Russia can realistically depend in strengthening its positions in northern Asia, this most dynamically developing region of the world. The extraordinary importance of a Chinese orientation for Russian foreign policy stems from that. Indeed, neither the United States nor especially Japan is inclined to automatically help raise Russia's role in the Asian-Pacific Ocean region, since this would objectively result in their narrowed influence in the system of foreign policy and economic ties which have already become established. For this reason, the hopes of certain analysts that the resolution of the territorial question with Japan will open an era of large-scale cooperation with this country are very problematical. But for China cooperation with Russia may to a significant degree act as a factor for maintaining the balance of forces in northern Asia in counterbalance to the one-sided rise in influence of the United States and Japan, which is not to China's advantage. And although on the strategic level China may consider Russia a source of instability, at the same time there is no doubt that a threat to China from the north disappeared along with the disintegration of the USSR. Russia's entry into the Asian economic space is predetermined by the fact that the USSR, whose successor Russia is, in the past built up only its military-political presence and in practice did not participate in the process of forming the structure of regional economic cooperation. After the USSR's disappearance from the international arena and in light of the economic difficulties, Russia's future presence in the region depends only on its ability to incorporate itself into the process of economic integration. In present conditions Russia will not be able to decide any issue by military means. It is obvious that the situation that has now taken shape is characterized by Russia's low level of realization of its interests in Asia, which is linked above all to the lack of a clearcut strategic course of development of the country. At the same time, however, Russia's transfer of focus from the military-political sphere to the area of economic contacts, that is to say the change in status from a military superpower to the status of an economic partner, is undoubtedly in China's interests. China is interested in multipolarization of the economic structure in the region to counterbalance the one-sided rise in Japan's role in order to prevent China from experiencing a growing relative economic lag. Fairly strong economic ties of the northern and northwestern provinces of the PRC with the Russian Far East and its Central Asian part would also be in the PRC's interests in order to prevent the growing imbalance in the economic development of the country's north and south, which is fraught with the potential danger of increased separatist tendencies within the Chinese state. For Russia friendly relations with China guarantee a reliable rear area for relations with the West, no matter what these relations are in the future, in exactly the same way that Russia provides this rear area for China. As its positions in the world are reinforced, the new Russia could help raise China's role on the world level just as China could provide support to Russia on the regional level, and accordingly both countries could continue to progress along the path of reform and structural reorganization of their economies. However, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that a breeding ground for rivalry between Russia and China within the framework of the international system of relations continues to exist. Today it is defined not only by traditional geopolitical considerations as in the past, but also by the following two features. First, both Russia and China now occupy a similar position in the world system of relations, that is to say, in the eyes of the world they are major regional powers which are either on the threshold or in the process of transforming their political systems and reforming their economies, that is to say, essentially they are developing countries called upon in principle to play a world role based on their objective conditions. Moreover, the medium for rivalry is determined by the differences in the initial parameters, general strategy, and context of socioeconomic transformations in these countries. Without dwelling on comparing the Chinese and Russian reforms, one can assert that in terms of such criteria as the state's economic role and the correlation of forms of ownership, the interdependence of transformations in economics and politics, and others, they are developing in different ways. Thus, the degree of Russia and China's compatibility with international economic structures and the degree to which the countries fit into the world economy differ. On the other hand, the Russian domestic policy situation determines the complexities of economic interaction at the given stage, in particular the clearly unequal character of trade between our countries. The similarity of the tasks which our countries are performing and at the same time the differences in the nature of the reforms and their rates allow Russia and China in the very near future and with definite focused efforts to occupy different niches in the world division of labor and in attracting international investments; that is to say to avoid a direct collision of interests, which when the complementary nature of the economies is taken into account may ensure perfectly harmonious development of both interstate relations and economic ties. The main components of the national interests of Russia and China are by no means mutually exclusive in principle. Although periods of acute confrontation between our countries were observed more than once throughout the 400 years of history of interrelations, this was above all the result of major foreign policy miscalculations or considerations of an ideological nature. So the difficulties which exist in relations are certainly surmountable today, and both countries may at least in the short-term utilize one another's potential to modernize and reform their own economies.
