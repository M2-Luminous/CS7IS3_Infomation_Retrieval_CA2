They met with the Bosniak delegation immediately on arrival. Judging by the statements made after the meeting, we can expect the agreement to be signed successfully tomorrow, although it is still unclear what the territorial percentage ratio will be -- 51 to 49, as recommended by the international community, or 58 to 42 as proposed by the Bosniaks and Croats. [Silajdzic] We arrived at the conclusion that we all wish to negotiate, that a peaceful solution would be the real solution, if it can be found. What awaits us now in the implementation of this agreement -- which has become a constitutional obligation -- is a series of extremely serious issues to be resolved in practice. On the other hand, we hope that the international community will accept this agreement as the first step in finding a final peaceful solution for both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. He hope we can count on the international community regarding a just solution. This means that genocide and aggression must not be rewarded. [Zubak] As Mr. Silajdzic said, at today's meeting we analyzed what we had agreed on in Vienna and reconfirmed the assessment that we had reached agreements in Vienna that were in the interests of both peoples. We also concluded that the reactions among the world public were positive, as well as on the home political scene, which instills hope and confidence that what was agreed in Vienna will be translated into practice as well. After that we discussed several concrete questions. As Mr. Silajdzic said, we agreed to immediately form a commission charged with searching for missing persons. This commission should resolve the issue of a number of persons imprisoned in Bugojno and thus resolve the question of the blockade of the road leading across Mount Vran. We will designate this commission on the basis of parity and it will be constituted and will begin operating within seven days. We also agreed to convene a session of the constituent assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina for the end of this month, 30 May to be precise, which is an approximate date [as heard], and to include these agreements reached in Vienna on the agenda. This means that we should proceed with the election of the federation's president, vote on laws on the government and ministries, and prepare other documents necessary for the implementation of the federation's constitution. [Granic] During the two-hour long talks we discussed a number of important strategic issues and many vital issues of the relationship between the federation and Croatia. This means that we talked about the ways of ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which implies negotations between the federation and the third party, and a just peace, on the one hand and, on the other, the reintegration of the UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] into the legal and constitutional system of Croatia. Our view is that we shall coordinate many future actions at various levels, including the United Nations. In specific terms, Croatia will not agree to the lifting of the embargo on Serbia unless the issue is linked with the UNPA's in the Republic of Croatia. We also talked about the problem of succession and our joint approach to that issue, the issue of entry into Croatia from Bosnia-Herzegovina, the movement of convoys, border crossings, and the strategic problem of refugees and, in particular, the issue of their return, help in rehousing them, and all other issues of importance for ensuring that the federation can start functioning successfully, and also the relationship between the Republic of Croatia and the federation.
