Why Could the U.S. President Not Contact the Russian One?"] [Text] Bill Clinton said that he could not reach Boris Yeltsin due to technical reasons to discuss the latest turn in the Bosnian crisis. This may mean two things: either the Russian president is on his deathbed, or he has nothing to say to his American counterpart. I do not believe that Boris Yeltsin's announced slight indisposition has even the slightest bearing on his loss of speech. Hence, the "technical reasons" must be related to the proposed NATO air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia. What matters is not so much that the Russian president cannot say "Yes" in principle, but a bombing strike in response to his "No" would have greatly damaged the Russian leader's prestige. The consequences of a punitive solution to the Bosnian crisis could be incomparably more serious that moral damage, even if it was done to a head of state. One may guess as long as one wishes about the peacemaking potential of the NATO action. In what may turn out to be its immediate effect, however, the Serbs may start hunting the UN "blue helmets" and start out-and-out guerrilla warfare. Then the "Atlantists'" next step would be to bring ground troops into the region, troops that are capable, unlike a peacekeeping contingent, of carrying out full-blown combat operations. In practice this will amount to the West's war to eliminate the Serb people. Neither more nor less -- simply because the Serbs do not surrender (there has not been such a thing in their history) and, having earned a reputation of a guerrilla people, they would fight to the last man. And then Russia will have to make a choice. Either, staying neutral, to take part in the Serb-NATO war at the diplomatic level, or to stand up for the underdog and send its troops there. This will be a new big war in which Russia will be effectively left alone against all, because in Bosnia the interests of the "Atlantists" and the Muslim world coincide surprisingly. This third world war would bring about what did not happen in World War I and what was about to happen in World War II: Russia would be crushed and, maybe, would cease to exist as a state. Its territory would be divided into protectorates, the borders of the North and the South would close, and the ruined Orthodox civilization would no longer be there to prevent the two sides from warring, trading, and simply having direct contacts. There will be no World War III if Russia does not stand up for the Serbs should something happen. To do so, in order to counter the pressure of radicals from among pro-Serb nationalist patriots, the Kremlin will need only to organize a national referendum. "Pan- Slavism" was a new word for those who lived a century and a half ago. For the current generation of the Empire's heirs it is completely unfamiliar. So the results of a referendum featuring a question like "Do the Russians want war?" can be foretold right now. By doing so Russia will retain its statehood, but its authority in the world would be measured in negative values from that very instance with all the ensuing consequences. After all, nuclear weapons themselves do not guarantee great power status to a state. Without an ideological underpinning an A-bomb is nothing more than a box of matches in the hands of a foolish kid. The ideological underpinning, however, is the so-called postponed threat factor, which is the foundation of modern military-political rivalry. How strong this factor is as an indicator of the strength of one world leader or another can be revealed in a specific crisis situation -- those leaders, once broken, would be dismissed as outsiders. So the position of President Yeltsin, who has a slight indisposition in Zavidovo, is unenviable: Every alley is a dead end. He will probably still talk to Clinton, but there is just one hope left -- that NATO will back away from its decision and, contenting itself with effectively meaningless concessions from the Serbs, will not bomb them after all.
