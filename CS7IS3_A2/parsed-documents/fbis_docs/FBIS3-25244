Applications for registration closed at midnight last night. Details of the applications will be published in the government gazette on Tuesday. Nineteen parties signed their applications. Members of the Freedom alliance, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the Conservative Party and Bophuthatswana did not register. A senior spokesman for the Electoral Commission, Mr. Peter Cronje, said the only condition under which late applicants will be considered was if political parties involved in the Transitional Executive Council reconvened a session of Parliament to amend the act. Mr. Cronje said that between 7,000 and 10,000 polling booths were expected to be in place for the election. He said the IEC would attempt to make ballot boxes accessible to all areas. These included hostels in black residential areas and other anticipated flash points. Party-political broadcasts and advertisements were to be banned from television between the fourth of next month and the 25th of April.
