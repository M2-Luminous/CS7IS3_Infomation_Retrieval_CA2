Rol was born in Kiev, where he completed high school and received training at an aviation club. He studied at the Chernihiv Aviation School and later graduated from the Military Aviation Academy. He was a fighter pilot, a bomber pilot, and also did staff work. For three years, he was adviser to the commander of the Vietnamese Air Force. Even though Rol's military service was almost entirely outside Ukraine, he speaks very good idiomatic Ukrainian and this points to his family's healthy roots. [Bazelyuk] General, what is, in your opinion, the role of SOU in the state building? [Rol] The union's main task is to promote the building of the armed forces and, thereby, to strengthen the Ukrainian state, since the army is one of the institutions in charge of its defense. The SOU is a public organization, which unites both officers on active service and those in the reserves and in retirement. The union has lived through difficult times owing to the uncertain attitude toward it on the part of the Defense Ministry. Of course, the leadership of the union did make certain mistakes, for which I am also responsible, since I was within the leadership. One of these mistakes was the excessive preoccupation with political activity, because, after all, the main task of the SOU is the building of the armed forces, and it is hardly expedient to come out with criticisms of the commander in chief in the form of various statements. This, of course, gave rise to a negative reaction on the part of leading figures. It goes without saying that the SOU does not need any assistance from the armed forces. It even assists the army in its difficult material situation and gives our servicemen moral support. In what way? We find it our duty to indoctrinate the army personnel in the spirit of Ukrainian patriotism and glorious traditions of the Ukrainian Army. It is difficult to overestimate the SOU's activity in this direction, since it has close ties with other public organizations and participants in the national liberation struggle who can have a significant influence upon the training and indoctrination of the personnel. Yet another aspect of our activity is the social protection of servicemen and their families and the assistance to the command in maintaining strict discipline in military units and subunits. Today, we must clearly determine and regulate ways for reviving the SOU, and this is precisely the goal of its leadership. On the eve of the last meeting held in 1993, the SOU leadership had a meeting with Lieutenant General Kobzar, chief of the Ministry of Defense's Main Administration for Educational Work and Socio- Psychological Services. In the course of conversation, we found out that our positions regarding the tasks and place of the SOU in the building and strengthening of the Ukrainian Armed Forces coincided. General Kobzar asserted that the Ministry of Defense would support all those organizations that will contribute to raising the combat readiness of the Ukrainian Army and expressed a desire to increase the SOU's role in indoctrinating officers and in introducing the best traditions of the Ukrainian Army. He also drew our attention to the need to establish new traditions. We agreed that it is necessary to have amateur artistic groups, as well as professional actors, perform in the military units more often; meetings with interesting people must also be organized. In short, we had a constructive conversation with General Kobzar, and he promised to pass its contents on to the minister of defense. I believe that, in the very near future, we will meet [with the defense minister]. The Officers Union must work in close contact with the Ministry of Defense and with all those state structures, which are in charge of defending our state's independence. Both the SOU and the Ministry of Defense are doing the same work for the state. [Bazelyuk] Did you take part in elaborating the Ukrainian Military Doctrine? What is your opinion about it? [Rol] It is centered on defense. The doctrine adopted by the Supreme Council in October 1993 has become a state document, which soldiers must adhere to rather than assess. [Bazelyuk] However, it is written in the doctrine that "Ukraine must become, in the future, a nonnuclear state if other nuclear powers undertake similar actions." After it became a state document, some people in the upper echelons of power rushed to transfer nuclear weapons immediately to Russia. What is your position with regard to our state's nuclear status? [Rol] Starting from 1991, I made many statements for the press and spoke from various rostrums. I said that Ukraine must have atomic weapons as a means of deterrence. Our state must possess nuclear weapons as long as at least one country, which may become our adversary and lead to a military confrontation, keeps its nuclear weapons. This is my opinion. No matter how big our army is, there is nothing like nuclear potential as a means for defending Ukraine. The position of our political leadership has led to several negative processes. Back on 24 August 1991, Ukraine, for some reason, proclaimed to the whole world that it was going to become a nonnuclear state. Another example. Why, people are asking, does Ukraine need the Black Sea Fleet, if it declared that it only needs the Fleet for local needs? This gave rise to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet with all its consequences. It is a pity that we gave away our tactical weapons so quickly; they might defend Ukraine much better than the largest army. It is impossible to guarantee national security without modern weapons. Ukraine must proceed from the fact that it is impossible to ensure the defense of our state if we only rely upon guarantees offered by other states. In questions of Ukraine's defense capability and national security we may only rely upon our own forces. Why does the West help Russia in every way? Simply because it has a powerful nuclear potential and is, in this respect, a strong power. [Bazelyuk] What are Ukraine's real possibilities for maintaining its nuclear status? [Rol] First and foremost, it is up to our president. We might conduct a nationwide referendum on Ukraine's nuclear or nonnuclear status. You know, I am very annoyed when some state tells us didactically: "You must give up your nuclear weapons." Who would dare make such claims upon China, Great Britain, or France? [Bazelyuk] How do you assess that the personnel of the 43d Rocket Army has not, to this day, taken the oath of allegiance to Ukraine? [Rol] I will investigate this situation as chairman of the SOU. [Bazelyuk] You have been nominated as a candidate as Ukraine's people's deputy. Do you agree to stand for this post and why? [Rol] I agree, because I have a clear picture of my work in the Ukrainian Parliament. [Bazelyuk] Thank you for the interview, from which I have become convinced that, despite the enormous pressure exerted upon Ukraine both from the West and from the East, Ukraine will be able to create a reliable defensive shield with all those types of weapons necessary for this.
