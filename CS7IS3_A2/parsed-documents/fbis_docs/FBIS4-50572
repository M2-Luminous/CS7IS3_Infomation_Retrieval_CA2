Among them are 30-year-old Dr. Chen Yongcong, who was promoted to professor of physics at the Chinese University of Sciences and Technology; 34-year-old Chen Zhangliang a department head at Beijing University; and 34-year-old Wang Wei, professor of communications at Nanjing's Dongnan University. Professor Hu Liming, 31, of Shanghai's Huadong (East China) University of Science and Engineering, is known as a "rising star" in science and tutors students for doctor's degrees. "Training trans-century talented people is one of China's programs aimed at helping the country catch up with the rapid international developments in science," an official of the State Education Commission said. The central government will mobilize both central and local efforts to do a good job of running 100 major universities and colleges to approach the advanced international level in the quality of education, scientific research and management in the coming years, the official said. According to him, priority will be given to the development of Qinghua, Beijing, Shanghai Fudan, Shanghai Jiaotong and Xian Jiaotong Universities this year. Vice Premier Li Lanqing has called on localities to train leaders in trans-century sciences by saying, "the Chinese Government will offer its support in manpower, goods and materials to create a better environment for young talented people to display their abilities." China has set up a special foundation to offer funds for young people to carry out research and participate in academic activities at home and abroad. Guo Qipeng, a 30-year-old professor at the Chinese University of Sciences and Technology, has set up a high polymer laboratory for young scientists at home and abroad to use. "My purpose is to create opportunities and conditions for them to bring their initiative into full play so that they can become influential academic leaders in the field of high polymer science," the professor said. Professor Lu Jupu who was awarded the title of "outstanding young scientist" by the central government, attributed his success to the improved academic environment these days. Professor Li Xiaoguang, 33, of the Chinese University of Sciences and Technology has put forth new ideas for the study of superconduction, for which he has been highly commended by experts at both home and abroad. Xu Xiaoming, China's youngest tutor guiding doctorate students in automation control at Shanghai Jiaotong University, has put forward a new theory for the forecasting and control of industrial systems and elicitation method control for robots. He has been invited by a U.S. mathematics society to write articles specially for it. Known as an expert in handling photo information, Li Chang of the Chinese Civil Aviation Institute has developed three research findings in the past two years.
