This fear has been expressed by Hans-Peter Repnik (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state secretary in the Ministry for Economic Cooperation. German companies are not involved in any of the large privatization projects in Latin America in the fields of energy supply, water supply, or telecommunications, Repnik said with regret. On the other hand, Spanish and French competitors, for instance, are very active. If they get first pick in the privatization of power plants or telephone companies, it will become increasingly difficult for German producers to supply, for instance, turbines or telecommunications facilities. "We must get our foot in the door in the strategic fields of growth," Repnik demanded. In Repnik's view, the Japanese have recognized Latin America as a market of the future. They are also using development aid as a means to develop markets. Repnik pointed to Tokyo's plans to increase development aid from $10 to $15 million over the next five years. Japan has clearly raised its capital share in the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) from 1.08 to 5 percent. It was important that, as a result, the Europeans also raised their share from 6 to 11 percent, said Repnik, who was chairman of the Governors' Council until the IDB annual meeting in Guadalajara/Mexico in April. To increase the German share from 0.99 to 1.9 percent, Bonn must pay 53 million German marks. In return, German presence in the Directorate has been achieved. Parallel to raising the IDB's capital by $40 billion to $101 billion, it was decided to give priority in the bank's work to promoting social justice and combating poverty. In contrast to the Japanese strategy, the FRG wants to reduce its share in contributions to multilateral institutions in the development budget from 34 to 30 percent in the medium term. One will pay more attention to the efficiency of the work of the international organizations and perhaps reduce the German contribution to one or the other of these institutions, Repnik said.
