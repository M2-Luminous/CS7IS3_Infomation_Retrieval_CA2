Cross-Sectional Analysis of Changes in the Federal Rate The analysis in Table VII examines the impact of the following changes in the Federal rate set forth in section III of the addendum to this proposed rule_ •The effects of eliminating the separate operating prospective payment system rural standardized amount, as required under section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act (column 3). •The effects of the annual reclassification of DRGs and recalibration of the DRG weights required by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act (column 4). •The effects of the annual update of wage survey data on the capital geographic adjustment factor (column 5). •The effects of the proposed changes in transfer policy (column 6). •The effects of FY 1995 reclassifications by the MGCRB (column 7). •The effects of changes in outlier policy (column 8). •The effects of all proposed FY 1995 changes affecting the Federal rate, including those displayed in columns 3 through 8, compared to FY 1994 payments based on the Federal rate (column 9). To estimate the effects of these changes, we simulated payments based on 100 percent of the Federal rate. As a result, the simulation in Table VII has two significant limitations. The simulation necessarily employs the FY 1994 and the proposed FY 1995 Federal rates. However, the FY 1994 and FY 1995 Federal rates were determined on the basis of the transition rules in which hospitals are paid various portions of the Federal rate. (Fully prospective hospitals receive 30 percent of the Federal rate in FY 1994 and 40 percent in FY 1995. Hold-harmless hospitals receive a portion of the Federal rate based on the hospital-specific ratio of new Medicare capitals costs to total Medicare capital costs. Approximately 16.7 percent of hospitals will be paid 100 percent of the Federal rate in FY 1995.) In particular, the budget neutrality adjustment required to assure that aggregate payments equal 90 percent of reasonable costs would require revision if all hospitals were paid 100 percent of the Federal rate. Thus, the simulation of 100 percent Federal rate payments is based on rates that would be different if payments were actually based on 100 percent of the Federal rate. Furthermore, the simulation does not necessarily reflect accurately changes in capital prospective payment system payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. Rather, it reflects the percentage change in payments that hospitals would experience if all hospitals were paid 100 percent of the Federal rate. In fact, as previously noted, hospitals will receive varying portions of their amounts on the basis of the Federal rate in FY 1995. Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that estimated aggregate payments based on the Federal rate for any year after any changes from DRG reclassification and recalibration and the geographic adjustment factor equal the estimated aggregate payments based on the Federal rate that would have been made without such changes. Appendix B explains that the varying portions of the Federal rate paid to each hospital are taken into account in determining the aggregate Federal rate payment amounts used to compute the DRG/GAF budget neutrality adjustment. The aggregate Federal rate payments used to determine the budget neutrality adjustment would be different if all hospitals were paid based on 100 percent of the Federal rate. Thus, Table VII represents the change in payments under circumstances unlike those for which the DRG/GAF budget neutrality adjustment is computed. As a result, it is to be expected that the full effects of that budget neutrality requirement will not be precisely reflected in Table VII. The simulation in Table VII is not representative of changes in capital prospective payment system payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. Rather, it reflects the percentage change in payments for hospitals receiving 100 percent of the Federal rate. For other hospitals, it reflects the percentage change in the Federal rate portion of payments, holding the Federal rate portion constant. (Of course, for those other hospitals, the Federal rate portion changes in almost all cases from FY 1994 to FY 1995.) Unlike the Federal rate payment change in Table VI, the analysis in Table VII also does not include any increase in Federal rate payments attributable to anticipated increases in the case-mix index. Because of the limitations on the simulation presented in Table VII, we are considering whether to omit this table in future impact statements. We welcome comments on the utility of this table and its continued use in future impact statements. The table shows that Federal rate payments can be expected to decrease 4.5 percent overall prior to consideration of any increase in the case-mix index. This decrease is due to the 6.5 percent decrease in the Federal rate, which is partially offset by the 1.9 percent increase in outlier payments. The table also shows the distributional effects of the changes in Federal rate payments from the changes noted above. We modeled the effects of the changes in all columns, except column 7, in the same manner as in Table I above. Thus, column 3 displays the payment changes resulting from eliminating the rural standardized amount, modeled by comparing simulated 100 percent Federal rate payments using our FY 1995 baseline model (as described in the operating portion of this impact analysis) to simulated payments after eliminating the separate rural amount. The changes in Federal rate payments from eliminating the rural standardized amount are, as is to be expected, insignificant. The 0.1 percent gain for other urban hospitals reflects the spillover effect of an increase in outlier payments for urban hospitals.
