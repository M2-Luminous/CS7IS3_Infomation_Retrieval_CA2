In a statement to AL-AHRAM to be published tomorrow, Peres said that Israel has actually completed the withdrawal of the major part of its equipment and men from the Strip, and only the necessary forces to guard the Israeli camps there have remained. The Israeli foreign minister added that he will meet with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat next Friday [22 April] in Bucharest, noting that if tangible progress is made during this meeting, he will leave with 'Arafat immediately for Cairo. Peres said that Israel is prepared to respond to President Husni Mubarak's call from Cairo following his meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for reciprocal concessions by Israel and Syria. The Israeli foreign minister said that Israel is ready to return the Golan to Syria, but this will depend on the nature of peace, which Damascus wants. He noted that Syria still refuses to hold direct, secret talks with Israel. Peres denied reports about Israel's intention to dominate the Middle East economically. He said that Egypt received Israeli assistance in the agricultural field, and within a few years it was able to compete with Israel in exporting its agricultural produce to the countries to which Israel used to export its own agricultural produce. Regarding Israeli pressure on the Palestinians to make concessions, Peres said that Israel is the one that is making concessions and not the Palestinians. He said that all those who carried out stabbings against Israelis came from Gaza. The Israeli foreign minister said that agreement has actually been reached regarding the Palestinian force that will operate in Gaza, and that the date for the deployment of the first group will be decided by the Palestinian authority. This may take place at any time after the signing of the agreement. The remainder of the force can enter after the signing of the final agreement, which might be ready by the end of this month. Peres said that it was also agreed with the Palestinians that 'Arafat and senior officials of his administration can use helicopters to move between Gaza and Jericho. Agreement is also being worked out on a number of matters such as identity cards for the Palestinian citizens, postage stamps, and so forth.
