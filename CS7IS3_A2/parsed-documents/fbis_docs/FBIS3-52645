A Foreign Office spokesman told reporters in Islamabad today that Pakistan has taken notice of Indian Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit's statement that the presentation of Indian proposals on Siachen Glacier, Wullar Barrage, Sir Creek, and nuclear nonproliferation will depend on Pakistan's response to holding the next round of foreign secretary-level talks. The spokesman said that during his stay in Islamabad, Dixit pledged that proposals on these issues will be submitted within two weeks. But the Indian foreign secretary said at a news briefing yesterday that the presentation of Indian proposals will depend on Pakistan's response to holding the next round of talks between foreign secretaries within four months. The spokesman said all these problems -- Siachen, Wullar Barrage, Sir Creek, nuclear proliferation, and Kashmir -- were created by India. He added that if India puts forward proposals to solve the problems that it has created, how can this be described as a liberal concession to Pakistan? The spokesman said the latest Indian statements confirm Pakistan's view that India has remained intransigent on the core issue of Kashmir. Answering a question, the spokesman said that Pakistan will consider how and when to raise the Kashmir issue at the United Nations in light of the outcome of the India-Pakistan talks.
