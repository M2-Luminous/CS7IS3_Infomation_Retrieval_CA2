Talking to newspersons in Geneva yesterday, the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khursheed, however, ruled out negotiation of the status of Kashmir, which is an integral part of the country. Mr. Khursheed said that Pakistan has no locus standi to teach India on human rights. He welcomed the U.S. decision to avoid any reference to Kashmir. Earlier, in her address to the Human Rights Commission, the leader of the U.S. delegation, Ms. Geraldine Ferraro, made no reference to Jammu and Kashmir or the alleged violation of human rights in her six-page statement. Hailing the virtues of democracy, she said that democracy puts no chain around a nation's neck. Ms. Ferraro said true democracies allow their people the chance to breathe, dream, and to grow. Reports say that the U.S. delegation leader made it clear that Washington will abstain from voting on the Pakistani resolution. The European Union of 12 members has also decided to abstain from voting on the resolution. As reported earlier, China has described the Pak-sponsored resolution on Kashmir as out of context. Iran has regretted terrorist activities being promoted by Islamabad in Kashmir.
