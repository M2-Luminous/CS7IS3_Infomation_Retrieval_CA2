FR941122-1-00080 FR941122-1-00019 The standard configuration of a Class B airspace area consists of 3 concentric circles centered on the primary airport extending to 10, 20, and 30 nautical miles respectively. The vertical limits of the Class B airspace area should normally not exceed 10,000 feet MSL, with the floor established at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriate for operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteria may be authorized contingent upon terrain, adjacent regulatory airspace, and other factors unique to the area. Pre-NPRM Public Input As announced in the Federal Register on April 22, 1992, pre-NPRM airspace meetings were held on June 23, 25, 30 and July 1, 1992, at Brentwood, San Diego, Los Alamitos, and Walnut, California, respectively, to encourage the public and airspace users to participate in developing the design for the Los Angeles Class B airspace area modification 57 FR 14670. Comments on this proposed modification were provided by private citizens, local government agencies, user groups, and local airport authorities. These comments were considered in the proposed modification of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area. Pilot groups were concerned more about the aviation aspects of the proposal, while some homeowners were more concerned with the non-aviation aspects. Lowering the ceiling of the proposed airspace from 12,500 to 10,000 feet MSL generated positive response from most pilots, because pilots would be able to overfly the Class B airspace area and descend south of the Class B airspace area while conforming to the mode C requirement. Some homeowners viewed this modification negatively. Current flight tracks bring aircraft over their homes, and lowering the ceiling of the proposed airspace would bring these aircraft in closer proximity to their homes. It should be noted that this proposed action does not propose a change to these flight tracks, as they now exist. Both groups had positive comments on raising the floor in the Malibu area to provide additional VFR operations. Expansion of the Class B airspace boundaries generated conflicting comments. Homeowners saw the regulatory airspace as growing for no reason, while pilots viewed the growth of regulatory airspace as providing additional controlled airspace for high performance aircraft from the east, southeast and south. Other comments are discussed below in the ``Proposal'' section. The Proposal The FAA proposes to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the existing Los Angeles Class B airspace area, based on safety and operational needs. The FAA's responsibility is to manage efficiently and safely the airspace surrounding the Los Angeles area. This proposal would lower the ceiling of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area from 12,500 feet mean seal level (MSL) to 10,000 feet MSL; raise the base altitude west of Santa Monica, CA, from 4,000 feet MSL to 7,000 feet MSL to provide more airspace for uncontrolled traffic to navigate outside of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area; and expand the eastern, southern and southeastern boundaries for additional controlled airspace for the high performance aircraft. The proposed alteration is depicted in the attached chart. The following proposed modifications of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area are as follows: Area A. That airspace extending from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning at lat. 34 ○00 ’08 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○45 ’01 ’ ’W.; to lat. 34 ○00 ’33 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○32 ’56 ’ ’W.; to lat. 33 ○57 ’42 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○27 ’23 ’ ’W. (Ballona Creek/Pacific Ocean); to lat. 33 ○57 ’42 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○22 ’10 ’ ’W. (Manchester/405 Fwy); to lat. 33 ○58 ’54 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○16 ’41 ’ ’W. (Broadway/64th St.); to lat. 33 ○55 ’52 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○16 ’43 ’ ’W. (Broadway/Imperial Hwy); to lat. 33 ○55 ’51 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○26 ’05 ’ ’W. (Imperial Hwy/Pacific Ocean); to lat. 33 ○45 ’34 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○27 ’01 ’ ’W. (LIMBO intersection); to lat. 35 ○45 ’14 ’ ’N. long. 118 ○32 ’29 ’ ’W. (INISH intersection); to the point of beginning. This change is necessary because of the concentration of high performance aircraft operating very close to the surface as they arrive and depart Los Angeles International (LAX), the Class B airspace primary airport. The proposed modification, which incorporates the suggestion made by the Southern California Airspace User's Group to relocate the boundary of the area, would reduce the area size to the north of Los Angeles, thereby enabling aircraft utilizing the VFR Special Flight Rules Area to enter the traffic pattern sooner for the Santa Monica Airport. Additionally, this would allow aircraft at Santa Monica Airport to enter the traffic pattern at a more reasonable altitude. General aviation user groups actively supported this modification with the assurance that the VFR Special Flight Rules Area would remain available for transition through the Class B airspace.
