Four million German marks have been invested in the factory's ultramodern equipment, not counting the cost of the basic adaptation and modification of the building which the Kovin municipality donated to Hemaform for this purpose. Dr. Borivoje Antic, Serbian health minister, and Pavle Todorovic, Serbian minister for the protection of the environment, were present at the ceremony inaugurating the new factory in Dubovac. Engineer Miodrag Babic, general director of Hemofarm, informed journalists that the factory will produce 100 million capsules or 3.8 million packages of high-quality antibiotics annually. Thanks to the most modern technology, 30 people will work here initially, in two shifts. "Hemaform built this factory -- just as it did the natural medicines factory on 12,500 square meters in Vrsac -- under the difficult burden of international sanctions," Mr. Babic said.
