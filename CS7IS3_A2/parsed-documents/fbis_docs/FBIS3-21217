(Dowa Mining), has successfully developed magnesium that is 99.9999 percent (6N or six-nine) pure. Previously the highest purity confirmed with magnesium had been 99.99 percent (4N). Thus, Dowa Mining was able to reduce the amount of impurities to 1/100th of the previously purest metal. Dowa Mining achieved the feat by ingeniously modifying its own metal purification method and by developing the necessary purification facility by itself. Knowing that high-purity magnesium can help improve the performance of the blue semiconductor laser that is under development by electric machine makers, Dowa Mining plans to broadly distribute samples of the new metal. As one can surmise from the fact that magnesium has been used for photographic flash, magnesium is highly reactive with air. Thus, it is more difficult to produce highly pure magnesium than to produce other high-purity metals. That is the reason 4N-purity magnesium had previously been the purest possible. Dowa Mining first designed its own purification facility with a new material to minimize the opportunity for magnesium to react with air, and it optimized temperature conditions for magnesium purification. Furthermore, Dowa Mining made use of previously known metal purification technologies, such as zone melting, chlorides, distillation and electrolysis, as well as added the production technology for gallium arsenide, a compound semiconductor, and developed the new purification method to achieve the 6N purity for magnesium. High-purity magnesium is used with zinc and selenium in the clad layer of the blue semiconductor laser. The blue semiconductor laser has been in the limelight as a next-generation product that major electric machine makers have been trying to develop. Today, the laser is not yet completely developed, as it can emit light only at a low temperature, and intermittently. The new, 6N magnesium is expected to improve the performance of the semiconductor laser. In addition, the high-purity metal provides the additional advantage of permitting laser developers to concentrate only on design improvement without worrying about any flaws in the material. Dowa Mining intends to sell samples of this purest magnesium at Â¥30,000 per gram, and the aggressive sales activities will be coordinated with the sales of 6N-pure zinc and selenium.
