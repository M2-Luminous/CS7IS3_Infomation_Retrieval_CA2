Militant Bosnian Muslims organized the demonstrations without permission from local authorities, and stoned the building, breaking windows and damaging doors on it. Ambassador in the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry Zivadin Jovanovic said that the unprovoked demonstrations were violent, and the German side was responsible for the damages caused on the consulate building, the property of Yugoslavia. Ambassador Jovanovic requested of German authorities to open a thorough investigation, take adequate measures against the perpetrators of the violence, and secure all necessary conditions for the normal work and full security of the Yugoslav diplomatic and consular missions and representatives in Germany. Charge d'affaires of the German embassy in Belgrade Gerhard Schwemgens said he regretted the deplorable incident, and promised he would communicate the Yugoslav protest to his government so that similar incidents would be prevented in future.
