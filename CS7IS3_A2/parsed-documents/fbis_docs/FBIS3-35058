It will be the committee's last meeting and will put the final touches on the measures leading up to the signing ceremonies. On the telephone from Yemen, the country's Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah told our news desk: [Begin Basindwah recording] It was only natural that we decide on Amman, the capital of brotherly Jordan, to be the venue for signing the accord document, in view of the key role played by Jordanian officials, above all His Majesty King Husayn, in the reconciliation effort. If the signing is not to take place on Yemeni territory, then Amman is the right choice. We hope that when the signing takes place on 10 Ramadan [20 February] in Amman, it will mark the beginning of the end of the crisis that--had it not been for God's providence--would have pushed Yemen over the brink of disaster. I hope Amman's spiritual atmosphere in this favored month will rub off on the signing ceremonies. I am confident that his majesty's wisdom will go a long way toward a Yemeni reunion and the closing of ranks so we can pursue our constructive drive on the road to unity and democracy and a glorious and immortal Yemen will emerge, and, God willing, our country will be a source of strength and support for all its Arab brethren.
