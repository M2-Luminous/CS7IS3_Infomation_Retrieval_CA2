The NEZAVISMAYA GAZETA newspaper notes that legislators voted down Shushkevich because they blamed him for splitting "the democratic movement in the republic". He has not created either his party or a group in parliament over 18 months' work as speaker, which would have supported him unconditionally. This has resulted in the present logical end," [no opening quotation marks as received] the newspaper notes. Speaking of Shushkevich's activities as parliament speaker, the newspaper writes that he "tried to keep at least illusory balance in relations with Russia, on which the Belarusian ruling elite now seeks to impose the main responsibility for maintaining the economic status quo". The TRUD newspaper has a different opinion on this event. It called the decision taken by the Belarusian legislature "a political drama of Stanislav Shushkevich". The newspaper reminds its readers in an article printed on the front page that "the formally proclaimed sovereignty of Belarus started assuming more real outlines" after Shushkevich became parliament speaker. "The main event of that time for Belarus was to lend the declaration on state sovereignty the status of a constitutinal law which clearly recorded the republic's desire to become a law-governed democratic state with a developed market economy as well as a nuclear-free and neutral state," TRUD says. However, TRUD continues, it became clear in the recent past that "the law was nothing but a political set in the performed play with sovereignty for the pro-communist parliamentary majority and bureaucracy which grabbed executive power at all levels". Shushkevich's resignation took place "under the evident influence of changes in Russian politics, feeding the Belarusian political establishment with hopes for conservation of its own power," claims the newspaper. TRUD predicts that the resignation will trigger a deeper political crisis in the republic and tougher administrative measures in the domestic policy, which will lead to "a drastic review of the course defined by the above declaration on state sovereignty". The IZVESTIYA newspaper headlines its article on this event as follows: "Shushkevich's resignation is a revenge of opponents of reforms in Belarus and a gift to Yeltsin's opponents in Russia". The newspaper quotes a statement by prominent writer Vasil Bykov who spoke about an onslaught of pro-Communist forces, while leader of the Belarusian People's Front Zenon Poznyak describes parliament's position as treacherous towards Belarusian national interests. Claiming that the event was preceded by well-orchestrated preparations, Poznyak predicts the establishment of an authoritarian regime in Minsk. Writing on the same event, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper notes that the latest developments in Belarus are logical, and the reasons for the resignation were caused, above all, by confrontation in the Belarusian parliament. According to the newspaper, "the national democratic opposition which is in minority and supports Shushkevich, lost to the parliamentary majority backing Kebich who pursues a resolute course for rapprochement with Russia and represents pragmatists who are ready to waive some elements of illusory sovereignty for the sake of saving the republican economy". The newspaper also publishes a refutation by Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, of an article in a Japanese weekly saying that Russia allegedly contributed to the implementation of North Korean missile-nuclear plans. Kolesnikov said that the article was a crude fabrication. Commenting on the appointment of Sergey Dubinin as acting finance minister, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA suggests that people may now "expect an improvement in the results of the ministry's work, since Dubinin will bring conceptual issues to cabinet meetings instead of newspaper articles". The same newspaper features an article by Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Russian Federation of Manufacturers (the federation includes the league of assistance to munitions factories, the Russian union of industrialists and entrepreneurs, the agrarian union, the union of work collectives, the Russian chamber of commerce and industry and the union of oil producers). Asked by the newspaper about reasons for the recent drop in the rouble's rate, he said that "many financial problems have now become not a subject for professional solutions but a theme for speechifying politicos". Besides, Skokov said, "we have no normal foreign political activities and do not have a clear understanding of what our currency is worth".
