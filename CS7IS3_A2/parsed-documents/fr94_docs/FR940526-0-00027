FR940526-0-00027 FR940526-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service 8 CFR Part 204 [INS No. 1436&hyph;94] RIN 1115&hyph;AC71 Immigrant Petitions; Religious Workers AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations by providing that all persons, other than ministers, immigrating to the United States as religious workers, must immigrate or adjust status to permanent residence before October 1, 1994. This interim rule implements section 101(a)(27)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) which provides that religious workers who have two years of membership and experience in a religious occupation or vocation qualify as special immigrant religious workers. By statute, this immigrant category for religious workers expires on October 1, 1994. This rule codifies, in regulatory form, the October 1, 1994, statutory deadline. DATES: This rule is effective May 26, 1994. Written comments must be submitted on or before June 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please submit written comments, in triplicate, to the Records Systems Division, Director, Policy Directives and Instructions Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 5307, Washington, DC 20536. To ensure proper handling please reference INS No. 1436&hyph;94 on your correspondence. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael W. Straus, Senior Immigration Examiner, Adjudications Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 7122, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;5014. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 151(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, November 29, 1990, created a new special immigrant category for religious workers and ministers by amending section 101(a)(27)(C) of the Act. In order to qualify as a minister, the applicant must be an ordained minister of a religious denomination and have carried on the vocation of minister during the two years immediately preceding the application for admission. Section 101(a)(27)(C) also provides for special immigrant status for persons, other than ministers, who will work in a religious occupation or vocation for a religious organization in a professional or other capacity. Such religious workers must have carried on the religious occupation or vocation during the two-year period immediately preceding the petition for special immigrant status. See section 101(a)(27)(C)(i)(I) of the Act. Unlike the provision for ministers, which does not contain a sunset provision, section 101(a)(27)(C)(ii) (II) and (III) of the Act states that the other two types of religious workers must ``seek to enter the United States before October 1, 1994.'' By requiring special immigrant religious workers (with the exception of ministers) to enter the United States before October 1, 1994, Congress clearly intended that this immigrant category terminate or ``sunset'' on that date. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a petition be filed with the Service to establish the alien's eligibility for special immigrant status as a religious worker. See section 204(a)(1)(E)(i) of the Act. The next step in the immigration process is for the alien to enter the United States as a permanent resident or adjust status to permanent residence under the religious worker category. By requiring special immigrant religious workers to immigrate before October 1, 1994, Congress mandated that the entire immigration process for these persons must be completed before October 1, 1994. In other words, in order to immigrate under the special immigrant religious worker category, aliens who are not ministers must have a petition approved on their behalf and either enter the United States as an immigrant or adjust their status to permanent residence before October 1, 1994. On or after October 1, 1994, the Service will lack the statutory authority to accord permanent resident status to a religious worker. The Department of State regulations already provide that an immigrant visa issued to a special immigrant religious worker shall be valid no later than September 30, 1994. See 22 CFR 42.32(d)(1)(ii). This interim rule is consistent with both the statute and the Department of State regulation.
