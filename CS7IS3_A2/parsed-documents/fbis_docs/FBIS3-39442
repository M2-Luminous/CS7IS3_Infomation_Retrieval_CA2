Only ten days after he was forced to withdraw blanket criticism of foreigners, Mr Portillo condemned the Community's reluctance to open up its markets to imports from East Europe and attacked its record on job creation. "We have to recognise the intimate connection between political and economic freedom, and between economic freedom and free trade," Mr Portillo told the American Chamber of Commerce in London. "We have put restrictions on Polish suits, we have been very reluctant to admit Czech and Slovak steel, and we have been niggardly about sauerkraut and jam," he said. Comparing the European Union unfavourably with the United States and Japan, he said that long holidays and short working weeks meant that in some European countries an employee cost as as much in "extras" as in wages. Although he was careful not to stray beyond the bounds of Government policy, Mr Portillo's Thatcherite critique of the EU served to highlight the tensions within the Tory Party as it prepares for the European elections in June. These divisions were exposed yesterday by Michael Heseltine's scornful dismissal of Norman Lamont's call for a referendum if Britain ever wants to join a single European currency. The President of the Board of Trade, one of the Cabinet's foremost pro- Europeans, said: "Norman has his view.... But I don't think you will find that, in the pubs and clubs of Britain, the words of Norman Lamont are on everybody's lips." Mr Heseltine said that a single currency was "not on the agenda." He suggested that in the eyes of many Tory MPs Mr Lamont's outspoken criticism of the European exchange-rate mechanism and a single currency were motivated by pique at being sacked as Chancellor. Mr Heseltine's comments were privately echoed by loyalist ministers, who described the former Chancellor as a "sad man" without a following in the Commons or the country. But Mr Lamont received support from the Euro-sceptic wing of the party. Roger Knapman, MP for Stroud and a ringleader of the Maastricht rebels, said: "Norman was a Chancellor who absolutely understood financial and economic policies and as a consequence many colleagues will be listening carefully to what he has to say. When it comes to the choice between style and substance, most of us prefer the latter." In his speech yesterday Mr Portillo said that Britain's continental partners were pricing themselves out of jobs. Praising President Clinton's support for free trade, he called for a joint Anglo-American effort to reverse the tide. "The world does not owe Europe a living. "Europe as a whole tends to have the highest wage costs without high productivity, some of the longest holidays and some of the shortest working weeks in the world." Over the past 20 years America had created jobs at the rate of 2 per cent a year and Japan had managed 1 per cent, Mr Portillo said. The EU had lagged behind at the rate of less than 0.5 per cent a year, because of high unit wage costs.
