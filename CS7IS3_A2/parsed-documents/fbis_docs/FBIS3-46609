Concerning this matter, I, Norodom Sihanouk, would like to emphasize again that there has been no punishment nor arrest of any journalist or newspaper for criticizing, attacking, insulting, or slandering me. No one has been arrested, threatened, or accused because of me. Moreover, no courts will examine nor make judgment on any newspaper or journalist because of me. In the case that there is any unfair or incorrect report in newspapers affecting me, all I will do is make a clarification like this one. I would like to stress again that national and international newspapers, radios, and televisions in Cambodia enjoy 100-percent full freedom. Cambodia's liberal democratic system in the 1990's, at present, and in the future is as free as the liberal democracy in France, the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and other countries in the Western world. [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk
