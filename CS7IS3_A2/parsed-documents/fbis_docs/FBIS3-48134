Hosokawa made this clear at a meeting of representatives from parties in the ruling coalition, the officials said. The package, which was rejected by a margin of 12 votes by the House of Councillors on Friday, can be enacted if it is passed again by a two-thirds majority in the lower house. The bills also could be enacted if a joint committee of 10 members each from both houses works out a compromise and wins approval by a majority vote from the two houses.
