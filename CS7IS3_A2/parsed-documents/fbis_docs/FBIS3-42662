Andreyev: "We Have Something To Offer Partners"] [Text] [Andreyev] Recently in Moscow the first session of the organizing committee for the "Technology From Russia" exhibit took place, which will be held in mid-May in the U.S. capital--Washington. Can you tell us about the results [of the session]? [Volskiy] Last year the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [RUIE] jointly with its American partners decided to hold an exhibit at which it would be possible to show the leading achievements of Russian science and engineering. The idea of holding this exhibit was supported both by the Russian government (in December the Council of Ministers issued a directive and the organizing committee was created with the participation of heads of the country's leading ministries and departments) and by the American government. We are talking about an exhibit which would be able to make a breakthrough into the now unified North American market, where namely technology is needed. [Andreyev] Who will participate from the Russian side? [Volskiy] Invitations to participate have been sent to more than one thousand enterprises, scientific-research, and scientific-production centers. As of today we have several hundred responses, primarily from large enterprises which understand the importance of a civilized and purposeful entrance into the outside market. Moreover, at the same time as our exhibit an American industrial exhibit "MAK-94" will be held, and ,thus, there is the possibility of direct contact between the interested parties. On our side we are proposing to show the latest achievements in the spheres of aerospace industry, shipbuilding, medical equipment, communications and computer science, the mining industry, etc. In addition, there will be a series of seminars with prticipation of representatives of the largest American firms. [Andreyev] The exhibit will be held on a commercial basis, and, apparently, many of our country's enterprises, which are in the throes of financial crisis, do not have the money to participate. [Volskiy] Yes, the cost of the complete package is about $10,000 (with payment in rubles according to the current exchange rate). This is an impressive sum, but it includes exhibit space, round trip flight, lodging and complete room and board from 5-16 May, participation in all measures of the exhibit, and talks with American partners. Taking into account how foolishly many of our enterprises spend their money on advertising their products, such a purposeful investment absolutely justifies itself. And for a number of enterprises, which produce unique technology but are in a difficult financial situation, we will search for sponsors. The organizational committee decided this. [Andreyev] When is the deadline for applications? [Volskiy] According to an agreement with the American side, which is showing enormous interest in the exhibit, the date for submitting applications will last until 15 February. Those enterprises and organizations which are ready to exhibit their products can write to the exhibit at the address: 109240, Moscow, Kotelnicheskaya Embankment 17, apartment 312. Telephone: 915 4831. Fax: 926 2052.
