At a very well attended news conference, Karadzic said that the decision on whether NATO will bomb us or not does not depend on the Serb side. By tomorrow we will issue an official statement regarding the NATO ultimatum. We are not an internationally recognized state and therefore an ultimatum in such a form cannot be issued to us, Karadzic said, adding that such moves were unnecessary and reminded him of knocking on an open door. To explain this assertion, he recalled that on 7 February all details of the demilitarization of Sarajevo had been agreed with Yasushi Akashi. We are satisfied with the UN mission and its unbiased position and we fully cooperate with their representatives in order to reduce tension, but we are not satisfied with the NATO position, for their decisions are completely anti-Serb, Karadzic said, and stressed that he subsequently welcomed the additional explanations by the United States and Russia that the ultimatum referred to all the warring sides, and not only to the Serbs. We are a small people who are fighting for their freedom and rights, something to which other people are entitled. If NATO exists only to threaten small peoples, then its' member countries ought to ask themselves what they spend so much money on, Karadzic said, emphasizing the Serbian people's gratitude to Russia. We must, however, rely on our own forces while believing that there is commonsense in one part of the international community. In reply to questions that referred to the withdrawal of Serb artillery around Sarajevo, Karadzic stressed the Serb side's willingness to move some of the weaponry in order to facilitate more effective UN control, since the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] lacks staff who can effectively control all the armed positions. We are going to group some of the weaponry to enable observers to take control more easily, something that should lead to the further restoration of peace in Sarajevo and that could set a precedent for other areas in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. Peace does not suit the Muslim side, though. Their true intentions will soon be revealed, Karadzic cautions. Both the United Nations and the Serb side want a lasting peace in Sarajevo, which is not a besieged city but a city split into a Serb and a Muslim part, a situation that will remain pending a final political settlement, Karadzic said. By no means are we going to provoke NATO, as we know to what extent some circles in the West are interested in continuing the bloodshed, because their ultimate aim is to demonstrate force to Russia by punishing the Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic said at today's news conference.
