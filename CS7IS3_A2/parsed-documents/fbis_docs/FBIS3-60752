Before his departure to Germany, Zachert said that Milczanowski was in favour of a closer cooperation with the BKA and planned to meet the German interior minister in 1994. One of the major issues to be dealt with jointly by the police services of the two countries is smuggling and trade in radioactive materials. According to the BKA head, 12 incidents of ``nuclear crime'' were recorded in Germany in 1990, 160 in 1992 and over 200 during the first three months of 1993. Poland and Germany have signed an agreement on cooperation in combating organized crime. Within this framework the German government is to grant the Polish police in 1992-94 material aid worth 6 million marks. Poland has already received cars, motorbikes, drug detecting kits and cameras. It was agreed during Zachert's visit that the assistance will also cover an exchange of experts in fighting economic fraud.
