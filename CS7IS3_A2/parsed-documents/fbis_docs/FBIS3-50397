The ICRC said in a letter to the Health Ministry of the Bosnian Serb Republic on Saturday that the arrested medical workers were allowed to contact their families through the ICRC. Health Minister Dragan Kalinic on Saturday sent a letter to the coordinator for medical evacuations of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees threatening to suspend cooperation in response to this inhumane and criminal act. The health authorities of the Bosnian Serb republic will suspend all medical evacuations until the arrested doctors and nurses have been uncondtionally released and allowed to freely enter Serb territory, said Kalinic. Speaker of the Bosnian Serb Parliament Momcilo Krajisnik and Bosnian Moslem Premier Haris Silajdzic met at Sarajevo Airport on Sunday [as received] afternoon for talks on rebuilding confidence among the warring sides and releasing the Serb doctors and nurses from the central Moslem prison in Sarajevo. Until they were arrested, the doctors and nurses worked in Moslem-controlled hospitals in Sarajevo.
