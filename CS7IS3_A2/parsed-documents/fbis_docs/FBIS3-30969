He will return to see a slightly different political configuration; this situation seems to be more favorable to him. The coalition has survived the crises, but it has changed as well. The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] gained; Prime Minister Pawlak won the position as the real leader of the coalition. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] lost this round quite noticeably. These Facts Will Strengthen the President The prime minister is very polite toward the Belweder; he has accepted its rules of the game, at least as far as the filling of the deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries (the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs--MSZ, and the Ministry of National Defense) is concerned. He does not demand positions for his party activists; he settles for the promotions of PSL members who are already working in those ministries (examples are the new MSZ deputy minister and the new deputy of the Office of State Protection chief). PSL members are getting high posts in the presidential ministries, which is being kept rather low profile. SLD wants these posts for its own politicians and it has exerted pressure on Pawlak to achieve that. Now the weakened SLD may take various steps; the possibility cannot be ruled out that, wanting to compensate itself for the recent defeat and improve its mood, it may start an even more vehement campaign to obtain the deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries. So far Pawlak has resisted--he did not want a war with the president. Now he will find it easier to handle the coalition partner's demands. In line with the principle that a precedence that has been set becomes the rule, it may remind the SLD leaders of who calls the shots in the coalition. The psychological aspect of the conflict in the coalition is also very important. Pawlak Took SLD Politicians Aback He turned out to be firm. SLD leaders will now feel greater respect for him and will keep themselves at a distance. The personal advantage for Lech Walesa, if he decides to run in the presidential elections, is the fact that the position of Aleksander Kwasniewski has been weakened quite considerably. Of course, we still have a long way to go before the elections, and the situation may change more than once. Today Walesa gains the following: Kwasniewski will no longer be treated, also by the mass media, so unequivocally in the good spirit of the current configuration, as the main player, as the "prime minister without portfolio." His image was tarnished quite considerably. The prime minister is Pawlak. Kwasniewski is "merely" the leader of one of the two coalition groupings--it is the grouping that is today politically weaker at that. Curbing the Increasing Popularity of Kwasniewski It is a present that Walesa received from Pawlak a year and a half before the presidential elections. However, it may be the Belweder's mistake not to consider Pawlak as Walesa's future countercandidate in the elections. The weaker SLD means also one more advantage for the Belweder. In the Army, police, and the special forces the Belweder and SLD are competing for influence. In this game, which seems to be very important to the president, the weaker SLD becomes, the better for the Belweder. The weakening of SLD after the last conflict may be seen by some employees of those services as an indicator showing where the real and stable authority center is. One can also say that any conflict in the coalition is favorable to the Belweder because it diverts the interest of the mass media from it.
