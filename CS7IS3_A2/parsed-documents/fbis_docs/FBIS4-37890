Our correspondent Darestani reports from Kabul: [Darestani] Forces of the two conflicting sides in Afghanistan started severe battles in the southern areas of Kabul city this morning. In the battles, which are continuing, the two sides fired rockets and mortars at each other's positions, and fighter jets of President Borhanoddin Rabbani's government bombed the joint positions of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and General Dostam in the south and southeast Kabul several times. Severe street clashes have taken place along several lines of contact of the conflicting forces in the southern part of Kabul city and the forces loyal to the president are especially trying to infiltrate the positions of the other side. Although hospital sources in Kabul have not published the causality figures of this battle, prolonged honking by cars carrying the wounded to the hospitals speak of the high number of casualties. The severe clashes in Kabul are taking place at a time when, according to the decisions reached by the leaders of jehadi parties in Jalalabad and Islamabad, only four days are left before the expiration of Borhanoddin Rabbani's presidential term. His opponents--namely Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, National Salvation Front leader Sebghatollah Mojaddedi, who was also the first president of the mojahedin government, as well as representatives of General Dostam--have gathered in Jalalabad to discuss the formation and institution of a government based outside Kabul. This is the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kabul.
