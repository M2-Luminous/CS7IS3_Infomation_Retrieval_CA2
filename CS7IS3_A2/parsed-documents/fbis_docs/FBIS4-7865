According to our information, the initiator of the provocative action that interrupted Geza Jeszenszky's speech was a member of one of the research groups of the Eotvos Loramt Science University. We asked Jeszenszky's opinion about the incident. [Jeszenszky] When I said, also referring to Jozsef Antall, that Nazism and Communism are equally responsible for the death of millions of innocent people and that these two "fallow ideas" must be condemned together, for a moment I thought that the clapping and the noise were signs of agreement; only later did I realize that the opposite was true, namely that the people making the noise wanted to stop me from finishing my speech. Evaluating the "patience" of the back seats, I did not finish my speech. [PESTI HIRLAP] Mr Jeszenszky! According to our information, it was not planned that you would deliver a speech at the conference. [Jeszenszky] That is true. The official greeting speeches, and especially Chief Rabbi Jozsef Schweitzer's words inspired me to deliver a greeting speech. Jozsef Schweitzer expressed his hope that the conference would serve the truth and the need for spiritual peace. I found this justified also because, in my opinion, it is very important for the new generation to learn the history and causes of the black year of 1944, because new genocides are taking place today, and the silent forms of ethnic cleansing have been known in the Carpathian Basin for 75 years. [PESTI HIRLAP] What was the main idea of your speech? [Jeszenszky] I drew the attention to the fact that the tragedy of the Hungarian Jews had widespread and broad causes, just like the causes of World War I, namely that there were quite a lot of people responsible, but some people are more responsible than others. I also said that the Hungarian Government, one that is usually called a government of historians and in which unfortunately there is one historian less today, continues to be led by the spirit and evaluation of 1944 expressed by Istvan Bibo in his study on the Jewish question written in 1948. [PESTI HIRLAP] In your opinion, what led to the Holocaust in Hungary? [Jeszenszky] Among the causes of events that took place in 1944, one should definitely list World War I and the subsequent unjust settlement and the wave of terror in 1919. One should also consider the responsibility of the policy of the neighboring countries and of the great powers. One should not mix the Jewish victims with the army losses, but I find it necessary to also remember the similar size of other victims, in addition to the losses of the Hungarian nation through the death of Jewish citizens. One should not forget that it was Nazism that made it possible for Bolshevism to spread in Hungary and that liberation from Nazi occupation and the Arrow Cross rule was also the beginning of a new terrible dictatorship of several decades. One should strongly condemn the "Jewish laws" in Hungary and the anti-Semitic incitement of those years, but there would have been no deportations and genocide without German occupation, and Hungary would have received a good mark for its humanity. There were guilty people in Hungary who received due punishment, and other guilty people escaped punishment, probably by joining the Communist Party, but the Hungarian nation is not a guilty nation.
