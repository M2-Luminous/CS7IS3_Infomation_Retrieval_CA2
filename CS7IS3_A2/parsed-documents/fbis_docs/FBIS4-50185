The decision consists of 30 clauses in six parts, namely: (1) Stabilize the agricultural base by increasing investment; (2) intensify work on the "vegetable basket" project to ensure urban market supply; (3) ensure all-around development of the rural economy to realistically increase peasants' incomes; (4) deepen reform of the agricultural economy to meet the requirements of a market economy; (5) persist in actively developing high-yield agriculture through scientific and technological progress; and (6) strengthen leadership over rural work by introducing the administrative chief responsibility system. The decision emphasizes the necessity of maintaining acreage of grain and oil-bearing crops and their total production volume, adding that no one is permitted to arbitrarily change the land use of protected grain and oil-bearing crop cultivation areas or occupy them to guarantee fulfillment of contractual state procurement of grain and oil- bearing crops, and self sufficiency of grain and oil among suburban peasants. The decision distinctly imposes a responsibility system under which both county and district chiefs will be responsible for the production of grain, oil-bearing crops, and nonstaple food; whereas district chiefs will be responsible for supplying grain, oil-bearing crops, vegetables, and nonstaple food to downtown areas. Annual evaluations will be conducted, the results of which will serve as an important criterion in gauging leading cadres' performances.
