A possible date for the swearing in of the new government cabinet is 6 July. Replying to a question on the upcoming government reshuffle, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: The government reshuffle is the exclusive responsibility of the prime minister, who is evaluating all possibilities. No one else is participating in this process. In order not to waste time on scenarios, Venizelos added, I can tell you a few very simple things. First, the reshuffle will take place within the time limit that was announced from the beginning so that the government's pace remains steady. Second, there is no truth to rumors of a realignment of ministries or the appointment of deputy prime ministers. Replying to other relevant questions, the government spokesman said that there could be minor changes in some ministries. He also did not rule out some division of ministries for better administration.
