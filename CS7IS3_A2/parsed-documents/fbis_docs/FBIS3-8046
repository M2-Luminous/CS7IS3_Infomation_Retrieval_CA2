Stanislav Devaty told a CESKY DENIK correspondent: "In my post, I can only congratulate our U.S. colleagues on their great success. I must say that in all the time I have held this position, since August 1992, I have not come across a case that would be even remotely reminiscent of a CIA employee's defection. As a citizen, I am distressed by the confirmation of my concerns that even under the new circumstances Russia has not changed its approach to the objects of its interest. The head of Russian intelligence, Primakov, recently said that the Czech Republic's place in Russia's sphere of certain interests does not mean that Russia conducts activity against the interest or laws of our country. In view of what has happened, I am not certain whether this statement of his can be trusted."
