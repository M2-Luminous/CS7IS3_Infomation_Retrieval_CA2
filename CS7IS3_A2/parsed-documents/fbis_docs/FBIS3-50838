Independently of last year's energy deficit, 80 percent of electrical power was generated by using Cuban oil. However, the production plan was based on the fuel available and in consideration of the deficits of other generating plants. [as heard] Although a great part of the electricity available is due to the use of Cuban oil, this oil needs various additives to counter corrosion and partially neutralize the effects of its high viscosity and sulfur content which obstruct its flow through the pipes and damage the steel plates. Add to these difficulties the maintenance limitations which are dependent not only on material shortages but also on the labor force deficit. Agustin Jimenez Saranda pointed out, without raising false hopes, that proper maintenance might result in long term improvements and the energy situation will be less unnerving in '94 and succeeding years: a pleasing bit of news for the beginning of 1994.
