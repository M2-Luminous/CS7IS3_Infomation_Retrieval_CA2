By the end of last year, the province had approved the setting up of more than 800 Taiwan-funded enterprises, doubling the figure of the previous year. The enterprises had taken in 521 million U.S. dollars from Taiwanese businessmen. Government officials attribute the boom to the province's rich natural and labor resources and a fairly strong industrial and technological power. The investors are going to light industry, electronics, high technology and real estate development instead of the previously favored catering trade and processing of agricultural and sideline products, the officials said. Big companies and financial groups from Taiwan have also begun to set up businesses in the province to pursue large development projects.
