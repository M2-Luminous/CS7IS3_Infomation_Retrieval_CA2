FR940622-0-00100 FR940622-0-00019 NMFS has approved Amendment 6 and hereby issues final implementing regulations. Comments and Responses Written comments on the proposed rule to Amendment 6 to the FMP were received by the NMFS from the Center for Marine Conservation (CMC) and from the Council. The Council had no specific comment on the proposed rule but went on record at its May 11&hyph;12, 1994, meeting and again in writing on May 13, as supporting Amendment 6. In addition, on March 8, 1994, prior to the beginning of the comment period for the proposed rule to implement Amendment 6, the Council submitted comments on proposed Amendment 6 and its EA/RIR. Comment: The Council commented that proposed Amendment 6 and its EA/RIR had several deficiencies in content and format including: The need for a ``Purpose and need'' section, a clear statement of objectives of the Amendment, a description of the consistency of the Amendment with the national standards of Magnuson Act, evidence that the Amendment's possession limit for haddock promotes efficiency in the utilization of the resource, a section describing the Amendment's relationship to other applicable law, better evidence that the 500-pound possession limit is the proper preferred alternative compared to several incremental amounts higher than 500 pounds, and a convincing argument justifying preparation of an EA rather than an EIS. Response: The final EA/RIR of Amendment 6 has been revised to contain a ``Purpose and Need'' section (page 4), an improved objectives statement (page 5), consistency of the Amendment with national standards (page 75), evidence that the 500-pound haddock possession limit promotes efficiency of the resource, and effects of the preferred possession limit on the resource (pages 19&hyph;27), a discussion of compliance of the Amendment with other applicable law (pages 72&hyph;76), a comparison of the effects of the preferred alternative versus several different haddock possession limit amounts (pages 19&hyph;37), and a convincing argument for preparation of an EA rather than an EIS (pages 38, 72, and 73). Comment: The CMC supported the protective measures contained in Amendment 6 and suggested the possession limit on haddock be reflected in three standard totes, consistent with the Council's recommendation from its May (1994) meeting. Response: The Council and the NMFS are aware of the need to ensure that the haddock possession limit is adhered to strictly. The standard tote, or box, measure is currently under review to determine whether the number of totes allowed is sufficiently equivalent to 500 lb (226.8 kg). Changes from the Proposed Rule In ยง651.9(a)(12) and (e)(34), the phrase ``or the equivalent in totes or boxes'' is added to reflect the language in the amendment and to clarify the requirement. Section 651.27(b)(1)(iii) is added to clarify who is subject to the haddock possession limit and provisions specified in ยง651.27(b)(2). Classification The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce, when this rule was proposed, certified to the Small Business Administration that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Fishing vessels that will be subject to this rule rarely take more than 500-lb (226.8-kg) of haddock per trip because of the severely depleted status of the stock. Based on the most recent catch statistics, 68 percent of the fishing trips landing groundfish landed no haddock, 84 percent involved less than 500 lb (226.8 kg). The allowable bycatch of 500 pounds (226.8 kg) is expected to discourage vessels from targeting haddock, promoting rebuilding of the stock that will result in long term benefits to the groundfish fleet. The measures in this rule will not result in a reduction of annual gross revenues of more than 5 percent. Annual compliance costs are not expected to increase total costs by more than 5 percent and are not expected to be substantially higher for small, as compared to large, business entities. The measures will not force more than 2 percent of small business entities to cease business operations. As a result, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds that under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, there is good cause to waive part of the 30-day delay in effectiveness and make this rule effective on June 30, 1994. This effective date will avoid a one or two-week hiatus between the effective date of this rule with a 30-day delay in effective date and the expiration of the emergency rule on June 30, 1994, that imposes the three management measures contained in this final rule. This will avoid confusion in the fishery, continue protection of badly depleted stocks of haddock from further overfishing; and enhance the likelihood that abundance of those stocks begin replenishment.
