Gregoriy Karasin, director of the Press Bureau of the Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference today that all countries having interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be invited to attend such a meeting with the council's members. He said Russia appreciates the call by NATO countries for the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo by all warring sides in Bosnia, or putting them under U.N. control. He said the withdrawal of the weaponry could be an important step towards peace. But Russia also objects to explaining the NATO call, made yesterday in Brussels, as an air strike ultimatum that goes to the Serbs only. He said this is an very partial explanation. He said Russia always considers it a job for the U.N. to solve the problem of the siege of Sarajevo, and does not want to see any one side in the Bosnian conflict to have "privileges" in the demilitarization process of the Bosnian capital. The NATO issued a call to the Bosnian Serbs yesterday, asking them to remove their artillery from hills overlooking Sarajevo within 10 days, or face NATO air strikes. The NATO decision was made after 68 civilians were killed and 200 wounded in a mortar shell explosion last Saturday [5 February] in a downtown Sarajevo marketplace. It is not determined yet who made the mortar attack. The Russian official also warned that any "hasty decision made outside the framework of the U.N." could wipe out any hope that could emerge from the Bosnian peace talks. The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin also said today that the hopes to solve the Bosnian conflict now lies in the demilitarization of Sarajevo and U.N. administration of the city, which has been under Serbian siege for 22 months.
