Or Why Mr. Radetskyy Ignores President Kravchuk's Position"] [Text] Because the final session of the former Ukrainian Supreme Soviet took place a few days ago, the legislative branch in the republic has temporarily ceased to exist. For now, it is hard to tell how long this will last. Therefore, during this period all power in Ukraine has been concentrated in the hands of Leonid Kravchuk, who is to continue in his presidential post for approximately two more months. Nonetheless, judging by some signs, Mr. Kravchuk's control of the situation is rather weak. The most graphic evidence of this is the openly rebellious behavior by Ukraine Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who at the talks in Sevastopol completely ignored his president's position on the issue of Black Sea Fleet basing, even at the risk of thwarting the talks. Observers consider at least three versions explaining the situation that has arisen. First, it cannot be ruled out that Kravchuk and Radetskyy are acting on an earlier coordinated plan. The president is demonstrating his inherent peace-loving nature, while the defense minister, who has ostensibly "gotten out of hand," is "misbehaving" somewhat. Yet at stake is Mr. Kravchuk's personal prestige and his ability to control the situation. He would hardly agree to have his competence called into question. The second version is based on the assumption that at the talks in Moscow, Leonid Kravchuk went too far in agreeing to the principle of the navies' separate basing, and then, recognizing his mistake, left Vitaliy Radetskyy to make up for his blunder. It is hard to believe, however, that such an experienced and cunning politician as Leonid Kravchuk, who carefully calculates his moves, could have disgraced himself so. Since the first two explanations of the situation that has emerged in the relations between the Ukrainian president and his defense minister are inconsistent, there is the last one -- most simple and alarming. Leonid Kravchuk is gradually losing effective control of the events. If this assumption is true, therefore not only legislative but also any supreme political authority is absent in Ukraine. The resultant period of power vacuum can be taken advantage of primarily by various national-patriotic organizations. In light of this the manifestation of unusual independence on the part of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, where the most avid supporters of the national-patriotic idea are concentrated, is a more than alarming symptom. According to some leaders of the national-radical orientation, such as Mikhail Goryn and Stepan Khmara, the patriotic forces of Ukraine have literally just a few weeks to save the great power from another enslavement. This time frame is dictated by the date of the upcoming June presidential elections. The elections will not gain anything for the national patriots, while the advent to power of a leader like Leonid Kuchma is regarded by them as the end of the history of independent Ukraine. The wish of the "true patriots" to prevent such an end is quite natural. Which methods will be used for this, the very near future will show. Yet it is clear already at this stage that they can be rather far from democracy, which has not justified the "nationalists'" hopes: That much is clear to anyone today. Signs are that Vitaliy Radetskyy, who is showing an "independence" rather unusual for a defense minister, has been assigned a far from minor role in the pending events.
