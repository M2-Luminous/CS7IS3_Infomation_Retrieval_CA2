FR940425-2-00032 FR940425-2-00025 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;154&hyph;001] Northern Natural Gas Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff April 19, 1994. Take notice that on April 15, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), tendered for filing changes in its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1. Northern states that the filing revises Northern's March 1, 1994, filing in this docket by removing certain incurred transportation costs that, upon further examination, Northern has determined are more properly categorized as GSR expenses. The removal of these expenses from the Stranded Account No. 858&hyph;R.A. surcharge lowers such rate from $0.435 to $0.346. Therefore, Northern has filed Substitute Sixth Revised Sheet Nos. 50 and 51 to revise this surcharge effective April 1, 1994. Northern states that copies of this filing were served upon the company's customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before April 26, 1994. All protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestant a part to the proceedings. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
