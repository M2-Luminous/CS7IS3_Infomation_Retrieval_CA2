[passage omitted] After a brief rest at the airport's VIP lounge, President Hafiz al-Asad and his important guest left in an official motorcade for Tishrin Palace, where his highness will reside. His Highness Shaykh 'Isa is accompanied by an official delegation, including Foreign Minister Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Mubarak, Interior Minister Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Khalifah Al Khalifah, Transportation Minister Shaykh 'Ali Bin-Khalifah Al Khalifah, Information Minister Tariq 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mu'ayyad, Finance and National Economy Minister Ibrahim 'Abd-al-Karim Muhammad, Minister of Trade and Agriculture Habib Ahmad Qasim, and Amiri Court Chief Yusuf Rahmah al-Dusari. President Hafiz al-Asad and His Highness Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah held a meeting in Tishrin Palace attended by the Bahraini delegation accompanying the amir. On the Syrian side, the meeting was attended by Vice Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah, Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', Interior Minister Dr. Muhammad Harbah, Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman, Economy and Foreign Trade Minister Dr. Muhammad al-'Imadi, Presidential Affairs Minister Wahib Fadil, Agriculture Minister As'ad Mustafa, and Transportation Minister Dr. Radwan Martini. In a statement to the media, Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah said: It is my pleasure to be on this brotherly visit to the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic--the cradle of Arab civilization, the launching pad for pan-Arab awakening, and the rallying point for the Arabs--in order to meet with brother President Hafiz al-Asad whom we hold in deep respect and fondness for what his excellency enjoys in terms of pan-Arab devotion and a farsighted vision of current Arab and international developments. This is in addition to his honorable and firm principled stands on pan-Arab issues and toward all Arab brothers in the big Arab Homeland. It is also my pleasure to express during this visit the deep feelings of love and solidarity the government and people of Bahrain have toward the fraternal Syrian people and their national government. Our fraternal countries met, each from their vital position in the Arab world, on the road to national commitment and adherence to the joint interests of our Arab nation in terms of its awakening and building. Syria has played a distinguished Arab role since the beginning of the process by spreading enlightened Arab awareness, entrenching the values of Arab civilization and culture, standing in solidarity with our fraternal Arab brothers at various stages and against all challenges. Fraternal Syria's stand during the October 1973 war, championing the Arab right to Palestine and the Arab territories had a great impact in creating an effective Arab consensus. We are now in real need for solidarity under the critical circumstances we are facing to confront the rapid challenges and developments in the region and around the world. We now reaffirm our full support for the comprehensive peace process based on pan-Arab constants and principles to which we, along with sisterly Syria and fraternal Arabs, adhere. We must reaffirm that in order to achieve stability and development for the people of the entire region, the peace process should be based on the principle of comprehensive and just peace. Peace cannot pervail without restoring the territories. Land should be exchanged for peace. Based on this basic principle, we reaffirm that Bahrain supports Syria's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from its occupied territories and its legitimate right to the full return of the occupied Syrian Golan to Syrian sovereignty without encroaching on its international borders under any claim whatsoever. On another pan-Arab level, we must praise Syria's just stand on the issue of liberating Kuwait and returning it to its owners. In continuation of this positive stand, Syria's coordination with its sisterly states in the Gulf Cooperation Council and with Egypt within the framework of the Damascus declaration is the best formula to support the march of Arab cooperation. In conclusion, we look forward to more steps toward coordination and cooperation between our two fraternal countries during this renewed brotherly meeting with brother President Hafiz al-Asad and his countrymen as a reinforcement of our distinguished and constructive brotherly relations. We believe that these relations are a positive and advanced model in the march of joint Arab action. An Arab greeting from Bahrain to the leadership and people of Syria, the stronghold of Arabism.
