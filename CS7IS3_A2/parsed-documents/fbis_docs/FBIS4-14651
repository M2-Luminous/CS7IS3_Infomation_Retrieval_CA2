Today, the CSCE mission published its report on the language problem in Moldova in the republic's press. The document notes that the questions of whether to call its official language Moldovan or Romanian, and whether to use the Latin or the Cyrillic script lies within Moldova's jurisdiction. Moldova is to a large extent a bilingual country. It would, therefore, be both a pragmatic step and a magnanimous gesture if Russian were made the other official language alongside Romanian, the document says. CSCE experts believe that it was pragmatism that prompted the Moldovan Parliament to give Russian the status of the language of interethnic communication. They believe that making provisions for the use of the official language and the language of interethnic communication throughout Moldova is quite sufficient to guarantee the rights of the Russian speakers.
