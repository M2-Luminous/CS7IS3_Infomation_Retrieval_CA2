The meeting is a followup to previous efforts that were crystallized at the Tehran meeting of 7 June 1993, which produced important positive results strengthenbing cooperation and mutual understanding and tackling conditions in the border areas with Iraq. In this regard, the conferees attached special importance to the situation in northern and southern Iraq, affirming their countries' commitment to the unity and safety of Iraqi territories for the sake of the region's peace and stability, and also in order to get rid of the negative effects of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which not only caused great damage to Iraq and Kuwait, but also adversely affected neighboring countries. Iraq, including both the northern and southern parts, is still going through an anomalous, unstable situation due to its invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent burdens -- hence the call of the foreign ministers of the three countries urging the Iraqi Government to cancel all restrictions and measures against Iraqi citizens, which would help the return to a normal situation of security, stability, and peace. It would also help foil all plans and efforts to divide Iraq and disintegrate its unity. It is understood that the unity of Iraqi territories and the necessity to safeguard it from any divisions or disintegration constitute a major factor, in fact, an indispensable condition, for the security, peace, and stability of the region as well as the unity of Iraqi territories. Above all, it is a national and pan- Arab necessity dictated by the interests of the Iraqi people and the entire Arab nation. Disintegration or division, as often affirmed by Syria, has never been the method to resolve any problem no matter how complicated on the regional level. Therefore, the Iraqi people, despite all the circumstances they are going through, are called upon to affirm the unity and integrity of their territories. This is a general popular desire on Iraqi, Arab, and regional levels. As noted in the statement issued by the Istanbul meeting, the future of Iraq will be determined by the free will of the Iraqis on the basis of equality, democracy, and good neighborly relations.
