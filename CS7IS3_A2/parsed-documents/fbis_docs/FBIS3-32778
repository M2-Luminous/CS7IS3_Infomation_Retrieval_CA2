No, it is not a question of easing, even slightly, pressure exerted on Cuba or of improving relations between Washington and Havana. It is only a measure that seeks to minimize the violation of U.S. citizens rights by prohibiting visits to other countries, in this case Cuba. As is well known, measures adopted by the U.S. Government to exert pressure and cause economic damage to the Cuban economy include the enforcement of severe sanctions on U.S. citizens who travel to Cuba in defiance of these restrictions. Obviously, the reported attenuation of those restrictions does not include those who want to travel to the Pearl of the Antilles as a tourist because that would represent income in dollars to the Cuban tourism industry. Cuban specialists on international relations believe the elimination of certain travel restrictions to Cuba and the expedition of possible information exchanges are part of a system designed to influence the Cuban civilian society and increase its political influence on the island, as was done in Eastern Europe. Others believe that, far from contributing to the improvement of relations between the United States and Cuba, its real purpose is to weaken Cuba's conclusive arguments before international organizations, where it has stated the travel restrictions imposed on U.S. citizens who wish to travel to other countries for personal reasons are a violation of their human rights. Cuba cannot be accused of extreme mistrust because it has only experienced all kinds of aggression from the United States for more than 30 years. Besides, Washington officials have made it clear they are not interested in making any policy changes towards Cuba as long as Cuba does not adopt changes to resemble the so-called representative democracies that follow the U.S. model throughout the world. Cuba has repeatedly stated it will not tolerate this blatant interference in its internal affairs, and it cannot accept conditions to establish and maintain diplomatic relations, or other types of relations, with another sovereign state. If the United States eliminates or reduces restrictions on its citizens so they may travel to Cuba, even with the provision that they do not to contribute in any way to the Cuban economy, this would be another step towards reason and wisdom. Cuba has many friends in the United States and has always been happy to receive visitors from all nations, whether they sympathize with Cuba or not, if they want first-hand knowledge of the real Cuban situation. The Cuban Revolution has always been able to differentiate between government and people, as far as the United States is concerned, and Cubans have always felt respect and sympathy for the U.S. people.
