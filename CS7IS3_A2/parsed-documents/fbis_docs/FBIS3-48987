Our country has recently been included in the cascade of insults, warnings, ultimatums, and revanchist slogans recently launched by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of the Russian Federation, the statement reads. In the most insulting way, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy went so far as to state that Romania is an artificial state, consisting of Italian Gypsies who seized territories from Bulgaria, Hungary, and Russia. Although these pronouncements look more like the outcome of a certain pathological rather than political state of mind, such public statements should not be ignored at all, since they can become starting points for developments that might have nefarious consequences for the countries and peoples of Europe and for humankind in general. Romania's Government, the statement reads, firmly rejects and condemns such beliefs revived from a propaganda arsenal, which has bloodied the entire planet 50 years ago. In our entire history, no one has dared to insult the Romanian people in such an indescribable manner. No criminal plotter against our national being and identity has ever dared to utter such dirty invectives against us. We have never allowed and will never allow anyone to hurt our national dignity. Romania and the Romanian people have never tolerated and will not tolerate such aberrations. Romania's Government unanimously expresses this steadfast position vis-a-vis Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's irresponsible insults and is convinced that all the country's citizens and all Romanian political groupings will have the same intransigent attitude of condemning and rejecting such a serious affront. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's irresponsible statements are actually an attempt on our national security. Other extremist statements of his made about European matters are quite inflammatory and jeopardize the stability and security in our region and Europe. This fully justifies our concern with defending our national security interests, especially now on the eve of the forthcoming NATO high-level meeting. At the same time, Romania's Government again points out that our country has supported and continues to support the democratic process in the Russian Federation and President Boris Yeltsin's reform program. We also consider their success as a guarantee for security and stability in Europe and the world. We are interested in developing good relations with the Russian Federation. Therefore, we express the hope that the president and Government of the Russian Federation will distance themselves most clearly from Zhirinovskiy's positions, including his insulting statements against Romania. We express the conviction that the realistic and reforming forces in the Russian Federation will prevail in the positive evolutions toward democratic reconstruction, so as to bar the way of extremism and ultranationalism, facilitate the development of a Europe of peace and good understanding, and further consolidate the traditional Romanian-Russian relations -- the declaration of the Romanian Government, which we received by fax from the spokesman of the executive branch, concludes.
