"If Russians, Ukrainians and Germans residing in Kazakhstan took Russian politicians' campaigns at face value and opted to move to Russia or other areas, they would plunge into a more severe situation than now," Nazarbayev said. "Although such an exodus has not yet begun, my biggest anxiety comes from this issue," Nazarbayev told the Japan National Press Club on the final day of his four-day visit to Japan. At present, some 5 million Russians, or more than a quarter of Kazakhstan's population, reside in the country which has a population of 17 million. Germans and Ukrainians each account for some 5 percent of the populace. Under the 19-century colonial policy of Czarist Russia, Russians were ordered to move to the central Asian country. Nazarbayev accused Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other politicians of having tried to rekindle Russian nationalist sentiments in a bid to lure Russian voters during 1993 parliamentary election campaigns. Kozyrev said last November 22 -- three weeks before the parliamentary vote -- that Moscow would "protect the Russian population and Russia's interests in a tough manner, wherever it is needed and whoever is concerned, even if it (concerns) our friends." "The treatment of official Russian representatives, servicemen and our compatriots on the territory of any state, be it near or far abroad, is the litmus paper on which good neighborly relations with any state will be tested," Kozyrev said. Nazarbayev told the press conference, "these Russian politicians tried to draw strength from the theme of the interests of 'Russia' in view of the December 11 parliamentary election." Nazarbayev said there is no rationale for any calls for an exodus of Russians from Kazakhstan, as the Kazakh Government has taken a "policy of providing free plots of land to enable all residents to build homes and plow fields," whatever ethnic group they may belong to. Nazarbayev refused to comment on press reports that Russia and the former Soviet Union bought U.S. security secrets from alleged U.S. Central Intelligence Agency turncoat Aldrich Ames over the past eight years for 2.5 million dollars. Asked about U.S. congressional arguments calling for a halt to aid to Russia following the reported espionage case, Nazarbayev said, "I am not in a position to give advice to other countries on their aid policy to Russia."
