Two joint ventures will be established within the year to include a firm to manage and operate the CATV firms currently owned by Sumitomo in Japan and another firm to offer programming services using communications satellite systems. Sumitomo will separate and transfer CATV operations and programming services to the new firms and utilize the abundant knowledge of TCI in running the joint ventures. The two firms recently exchanged a memorandum establishing the joint ventures. Operating plans and capital requirements will be the subject of pending discussions and the schedule calls for establishment of the joint ventures by the end of the year. According to sources at Sumitomo, TCI "wants to contribute about 40 percent of the capital" for each joint venture, but its initial contribution will be restricted to the amount specified by foreign capital regulations. Sumitomo plans to transfer all capital already paid into the 18 CATV firms operated throughout the country into the newly established CATV management firm. It will enter into discussions with other shareholders of the CATV firms concerning the joint ventures. In the future, Sumitomo plans to buy additional CATV stations, engage in consulting services, and contract for management services, with the goal of becoming Japan's first multiple system operator. It will also engage in the implementation of telephone services via CATV. The president of the firm will be appointed from among Sumitomo officials and TCI will assign two directors. The joint venture engaged in programming services plans to establish multiple channel services to include animated films, documentaries, and sports broadcasting. Estimates of new capital requirements for the two joint ventures for the next three to four years totals $500 million.
