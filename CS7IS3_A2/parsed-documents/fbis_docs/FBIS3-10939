Raul Gutierrez has talked with him about the vice presidency, the Liberal Party leadership, and the government. [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] Will you replace former President Turbay in the party's national leadership? [Samper] This depends on Dr. Turbay. I have said he played a very satisfactory role in the management of the primary, as indicated by Sunday's results. His staying in office will depend on his own decision. [Gutierrez] Will Ministers Villegas and Santos be included in the campaign team? [Samper] If they would like to cooperate with me, they will be welcome in the campaign. I would appreciate their effort very much. [Gutierrez] How will you play the vice presidency card? [Samper] I will select the person I think can take my place according to the Constitution in case of a necessary absence. [Gutierrez] Lleras de la Fuente or Pedro Gomez? [Samper] There is a list of names on which I am working. [Gutierrez] How will you reconciliate yourself with your adversaries of yesterday? [Samper] With programs. I think the idea is not to reach bureaucratic agreements, rather, to identify ourselves with a subject that became the common denominator in our campaign--social policy. [Gutierrez] Don't you think the high rate of abstentionism poses a risk when you run against Pastrana in May? [Samper] No, because abstentionism is not caused by Pastrana, rather, objective factors that we will naturally have to correct gradually. [Gutierrez] What did the government do for your campaign for your candidacy to be successful? [Samper] Nothing, except remain neutral. I did the rest. [end recording]
