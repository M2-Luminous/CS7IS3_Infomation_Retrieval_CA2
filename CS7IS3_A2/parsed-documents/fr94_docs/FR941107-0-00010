FR941107-0-00010 FR941107-0-00005 7 CFR Part 928 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;928&hyph;4FR] Papayas Grown in Hawaii; Final Rule to Change the Membership of the Papaya Administrative Committee AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule changes the membership of the Papaya Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the Hawaiian papaya marketing order. This rule increases the number of grower members on the committee from six to nine and reduces the number of handler members from six to three. The number of growers in the industry has increased in recent years, during the same period the number of handlers has remained constant. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule becomes effective December 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles L. Rush, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2526&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone (202) 690&hyph;3670; or Martin J. Engeler, Assistant Officer-In-Charge, California Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102B, Fresno, California 93721; telephone (209) 487&hyph;5901. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 928 [7 CFR Part 928], as amended, regulating the handling of papayas grown in Hawaii, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory rules to the scale of business subject to such rules in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 120 papaya handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh papayas grown in Hawaii, and approximately 400 producers of papayas in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
