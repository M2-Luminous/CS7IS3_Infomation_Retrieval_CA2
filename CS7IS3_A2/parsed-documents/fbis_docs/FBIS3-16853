Andrey Kozyrev said he and his Japanese opposite number had had "a detailed, circumstantial and constructive conversation covering a wide range of bilateral problems and some international issues". On the initiative of the Japanese side, the question about the peace treaty between the two countries, including the territorial issue, was touched upon. "We are not eschewing this problem," the Russian minister said. According to him, these questions will be discussed in detail during bilateral negotiations on the basis of the Tokyo declaration signed during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. The Japanese minister was handed over a message from Boris Yeltsin to Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in which the Russian president expresses the desire to see the head of the Japanese government arrive for a visit to Moscow as soon as possible. Tsutumu Hata said the Russian president's message was "very amiable". He said the prompt signing of a peace treaty and the solution to the territorial dispute would be in the interests of better bilateral relations. He noted that popular support was needed for the solution in both countries. Tsutomu Hata confirmed Tokyo's readiness to assist Russian reforms in all ways. He said Japan intended to cooperate with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in establishing a 50 million dollar fund to support Russia's small- and medium- sized businesses. Asked about Japan's stance on turning the Group of Seven into a group of eight by adopting Russia as a full-fledged member, Andrey Kozyrev said Japan's reaction was "quite encouraging".
