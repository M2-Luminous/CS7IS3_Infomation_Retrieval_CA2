Fourteen Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power station] units in 1993 produced 75.2 billion kilowatt-hours, or 32.9 percent of the total output of electric power in the state. The plan task, set at the beginning of 1993, was fulfilled by 111 percent, and in addition, the price of a nuclear kilowatt-hour was the lowest. In the winter of this year the AES's of Ukraine were producing up to 40 percent of the total production of electric power in Ukraine. These results are even more meaningful in that they were achieved under conditions of a growing economic crisis. They indicate the great potential of the nuclear power industry and its great vitality and stability. As calculations and even life itself show, without nuclear energy the formation and development of all industry, which also means the economy of Ukraine, is impossible, and a rise in the standard of living of the 52 million people of Ukraine is impossible. President Leonid Kravchuk with complete justification and accountability announced recently that nuclear electric power stations are the salvation of Ukraine today. Nevertheless, the situation in the nuclear industry of Ukraine is very difficult. All AES's are in a very serious economic position. Starting with the second half of 1993, practically no fresh fuel was bought because of a shortage of resources, spent fuel was not removed to prolonged storage, and a breakdown occurred in contractual relations between many plants, institutes, and AES's for equipment, spare parts, and scientific service for the industry. The problem of the highly qualified personnel drain is severe, and a system to provide personnel for the industry in Ukraine has not yet been established. Comprehensive scientific and information tracking is absent, all of which has a negative effect on AES safety. If the problems of the nuclear power industry are not faced and urgent measures undertaken, in a short time it could cease to exist as an economically effective and ecologically safe industry. Traditional (thermal) power engineering, especially the revived types of power engineering (wind, solar, hydro, etc.), will not be able to cope with the requirements of the national economy of Ukraine. But this could lead to a crash of the whole economy of our state. A serious discussion about all this transpired at a meeting of the president of Ukraine with AES directors held at the beginning of March. Its result was the presidential edict concerning urgent measures for the development of Ukraine's nuclear power industry. In the context of the outlook for the development of the industry, something should be said particularly about the problem of providing it with qualified personnel. This question is being addressed by the Commission for Nuclear Policy under the president of Ukraine. Inasmuch as I am a member of the working group for the creation of a national personnel training system, which works under the commission, I would like to share some ideas in this regard. The number of AES personnel in Ukraine is now on the order of 40,000, of which 25,000 are industrial-production personnel. Personnel turnover has reached 10-12 percent per year, which is explained mainly by the departure of highly qualified personnel for Russia, where wages and the standard of living of atomic scientists is much higher than in Ukraine. The training of young engineers for the AES's according to a small list of nuclear specialties is conducted in Ukraine only three times a year--in the Kiev and Odessa polytechnical universities and the Sevastopol naval institute. Considering that the Sevastopol institute just began training students in 1993, and that the Kiev and Odessa VUZ's [higher educational institutions] can graduate only about 130 persons (and, indeed, will all of them go to work in an AES?), a catastrophic level of specialist shortage can be observed. Analysis of the personnel requirements of the AES'S of Ukraine indicates a need for the immediate establishment of a Ukrainian national system of personnel training for nuclear power enterprises and organizations and for the industry of Ukraine. The draft of such a program has been created by specialists of the Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power [Goskomatom]. It contains a complex of studies that in a compressed timeframe (three to five years) will permit ensuring the maximum possible effectiveness of the personnel training system within the scope of the traditional structures of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine. Thus, the preliminary elaborations of the group of the Commission on Questions of Nuclear Policy show that as early as 1995 the nuclear industry of Ukraine can receive on the order of 400 nuclear engineers according to a broad list of specialties. But for this it is necessary to unite and coordinate the efforts of all interested departments and organizations, from the AES's to the Supreme Council and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. First, it is necessary to have immediate special purpose financing and technical support of the Ministry of Education and its institutes, which will train personnel for the nuclear industry. Second, it is necessary to train highly qualified teaching personnel, who in their turn will be able to train professional nuclear scientists. Are there such people in Ukraine? In my view, there are. However, because of a distortion in the assessment of spiritual and moral values in the direction of the commercial side of life, normal work and the existence of such people have become impossible, and many of them were compelled to seek other, more "profitable" jobs. The search for qualified teachers and their training is a complicated process. It can be successfully resolved only given appropriate material support of teachers on the part of the state. The problem of training science teachers for the nuclear power industry of Ukraine, in my opinion, is the key to the development of the nuclear power industry. Whether the VUZ's--the principal executors of the program--are ready for this will be shown by the results of their work in the 1994-1995 academic year.
