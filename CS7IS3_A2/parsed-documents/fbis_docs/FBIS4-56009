The change to the election law, on the basis of which every voter would receive the ballot papers only at the polling station, would enable real manipulation of the elections and could result in the distortion of election results. Besides, the situation during the elections would be confusing because if any citizen did not arrive at the polling station for one reason or another, his ballot could be misused.
