The right-wing Conservative Way Forward group, which has Lady Thatcher as its president, said economic recovery was not improving the government's fortunes. Its statement came two days before Major launches the Tory European election manifesto. "Political benefit from economic improvement will continue to elude us as long as ministers remain out of touch with public opinion," the group said. It demanded "leadership of a very high order" during the European campaign, which ends on June 9, noting the Tories had suffered a "disaster" in this month's council elections. "Our natural supporters focused their gaze on national government and failed to find inspiration. Effectively, Tory supporters are on strike," the group said in its magazine. Major will try to rally his party tomorrow by accusing Labour and the Liberal Democrats of supporting federalist policies. "We will fight for the kind of Europe we want -- not a European superstate but a Europe of nation states," Major writes in a foreword to the manifesto, leaked to THE SUNDAY TIMES. "We believe it is for nations to build Europe, not for Europe to attempt to supercede nations." While emphasising that Britain's national interest lies in Europe, Major says: "We want less interference from Brussels, not more." Labour and the Lib Dems [Liberal Democrat Party] "would submerge Britain in a socialist superstate". The 56-page manifesto, entitled A Strong Britain in a Strong Europe, promises the government will preserve Britain's "vital national interests" by using its veto to block unnecessary EC integration. Hinting at a two- speed Europe, it calls for "flexibility" as new members join the EC. The manifesto says the decision on whether to join a single European currency will be for the British parliament. There will be no re-entry into the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) "in the foreseeable future." Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, refused to predict that the Tories would gain seats, which he did before the recent council elections. "We have a winning message. What we have to do is get that message over and get our voters out," he said. The Labour manifesto launched tomorrow, anticipates the Tory attack over increasing EC powers. A draft giving greater powers for the European parliament was amended to emphasise that the party would retain Britain's veto over economic issues, foreign policy, EC integration and "other key areas of national interest." Labour has watered down its commitment to a 35-hour working week. The draft manifesto said changes "might involve a substantial cut in working time." The final version says they "might involve reductions in working time". The Labour programme, A New European Future, says: "Britain has the chance to change direction on Europe, moving us from the margins -- where the government resists co-operation, alienates allies and opts out of progress -- into the centre where Britain can help to o shape and direct Europe." The Lib Dems, who will pledge a referendum on further EC integration in their manifesto tomorrow yesterday accused the Tories of breaking the promises they made in the last Euro campaign five years ago.
