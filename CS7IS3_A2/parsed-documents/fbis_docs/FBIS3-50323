The prosecution is founded on the publication of a reader's letter last summer which read: "As long as various popularity polls are led by a person like Mr. Meciar, with (Party of the Democratic Left Chairman Petr) Weiss, (Culture Minister Dusan) Slobodnik, (Parliament Chairman Ivan) Gasparovic, Ambassador to the Czech Republic Ivan) Mjartan, (Constitutional Court Judge Milan) Cic and the Kovacs behind him, things will never be all right in Slovakia." Since the word "Kovacs" could be understood as referring to Slovak President Michal Kovac, the investigating officer has maintained that the author is "publicly defaming the president of the Republic." "These people are political cowards, characterless rogues, who are doing great damage to Slovakia. It annoys me that people cannot tell lies from truth and that they have been duped again by sacked comrades," the letter continues. The investigation has so far established that the author was writing under an assumed name. Consequently Hrico, as editor-in- chief legally obliged to ensure the authenticity and check the origin of all the information he publishes, has in effect broken the law. Hrico told CTK that he was questioned twice last year although the investigation at that stage focused more on the sender of the letter. In his view the writer was not necessarily referring to the president as he personally could think of half a dozen Kovacs who currently figure in Slovak politics.
