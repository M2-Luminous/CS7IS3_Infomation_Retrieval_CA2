[PULS] How much money was planned to be supplied for the budget last year on the basis of customs duties, and to what percentage were the projections fulfilled? [Buzlevski] There were 2.5 billion denars planned, but 90.9 percent of the projections were fulfilled. It is interesting that the percentage achieved was not achieved continuously throughout those months, since during the first six months only 22.2 percent of the planned customs funds were supplied to the budget, which indicated a very low level of the collection of customs duties. That was associated with many problems in customs procedures which directly led to that low percentage collected. As a result of certain measures that we subsequently implemented, for the period ending in December customs duties constitute the highest percentage in fulfillment of the planned budget funds. One of the measures that we undertook is to prevent manipulations with respect to imports of consumer goods. Importers exercised the right of customs supervision of those goods, as well as the right to customs storage within their business premises, and those goods were very frequently lost and put on sale; the state thus, in a way, provided the enterprises with advance financing of part of their unpaid customs duties, and according to some information, the unpaid sales tax as well. It is precisely for that reason that through a decree sometime in May 1993 we prohibited putting consumer goods under supervision. We thereby achieved two results: preventing the uncontrolled placement of those goods in the markets, and at the same time gaining the opportunity to collect customs duties on time. Likewise, an important element in improving the collection of customs duties is placing the collection immediately in the customs line, by requesting through the appropriate shipping office an instrument for ensuring collection, either acceptance or certified checks. There is also one other element that we analyzed in detail for improving the collection of customs duties: determining the true value of imported goods. The fact is that the importers used two types of invoices: an invoice that they received from the foreign partner and that cited the real price that they paid, and another invoice with a reduced value, i.e., with a reduced base for the payment of customs duties. The Customs Administration adopted a decision that wherever there are suspicions about the validity of the value given in the invoice, it is to be verified. [PULS] How many consumer goods were imported last year without paying customs duties? [Buzlevski] Somewhere around $600 million. [PULS] With all the exemptions from paying customs duties, what level is the general rate? [Buzlevski] The average duty on imports in 1993 was 6 percent. With this percentage, we are the most liberal country in Europe. [PULS] How consistent is our tariff liberalization with tariff trends in the world? The GATT negotiations, for example? [Buzlevski] In general, the tariff duty in the United States and in the developed West European countries is not much over the percentage that was noted here last year. Nevertheless, the imported goods subsequently fall under the regime of tax policy. In this case there has to be mutual coordination. Let us take cigarette smuggling as an example. Our analysis shows that the prices of cigarettes in the duty-free shops are more or less identical with black market prices. This alone suggests that a large part of those cigarettes come from the duty-free shops. That is why we are currently preparing a decision on the regime for the sale and importation of cigarettes, whiskey, and other sought-after products from the duty-free shops. Not to prejudice matters, I would also like to state just that the purchase of one carton of cigarettes and one bottle of whiskey will be permitted, and then only for someone who is leaving Macedonia. [PULS] All of these deviant phenomena and smuggling activities suggest the question of whether the Customs Administration is equipped to counter those phenomena. [Buzlevski] We are not equipped as a service. We have a model for development of the Customs Administration that was verified by top customs experts in the United States and Canada, but we will only be able to speak of successful customs when we have started to implement that model. So many things are happening to us because we are not equipped to discover them. For example, our law allows the tariff payer himself to decide which customs branch office the duties will be levied at. The data indicate that the Skopje customs house accounts for about 62 percent--a figure which itself is very large, and represents a difficulty in conducting a detailed inspection of every truck that has entered. Otherwise, all the trucks should be inspected in detail and the contents of the goods should be verified. In developed customs administrations that is simply done with the most modern devices: for measuring the density of the freight contents, for measuring the length of a vehicle... Likewise, we should equip customs in regard to automated data processing. During the course of this year we expect to develop that computer network and we are on the way to obtaining a finished program. [PULS] After the collapse in transportation that occurred with the blockade of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], Europe announced a much more liberal procedure for avoiding customs jams. How much does that increase the danger of all sorts of smuggling--of weapons, for instance? [Buzlevski] We are participating actively in that program, which was conceived at the European Union [EU] level. The idea of that project is a customs corridor that would make it possible for the customs procedure to take place rapidly. In certain cases, perhaps, it would become possible for goods to be transported to their destinations where they are sent by convoy. In mid-March, top experts from the European Customs Union will visit Macedonia to implement the project. I can say that the European Customs Union's analyses for approving financial assistance for modernizing two border crossings are in the final phase. These are the Cafasan and Deve Bair border crossings, a corridor planned for communications with Europe. North Rhine-Westphalia will provide about 1.1 million German marks [DM] and the United States will provide $1.1 million to equip the Deve Bair border crossing, while they will likewise provide $1.1 million for Cafasan. [PULS] A lot is said about the corruption of the customs service. [Buzlevski] So far the Service has fired 15 individuals for whom there was substantiated proof that they had committed serious customs violations. It is a well-known problem with oil in Gevgelija and the channel going to Tetovo and Kumanovo, and a well-known problem with imports of silk from Turkey and China. The blunder of the customs officers was that they participated in ensuring the legality of transactions by which the entry of the goods was recorded by one customs branch office, but the importer, dissatisfied with the established tariff base, announced that he would return the goods to the original destination, and the customs employee attached a seal to the form that the goods had left Macedonia, while they remained here de facto. We had the latest case at the Skopje airport a few days ago, with imported satellite antennas. [PULS] It has been heard at the Customs Administration that a list has been prepared of officials who have opened shipping offices either in their own names or in the names of close relatives. What about them? [Buzlevski] It is a very unfavorable element that a certain number of customs officials, even though those individuals are in higher-level positions in the customs hierarchy, have commercial firms, especially in the area of shipping, which are registered in the names of members of their close family. We have prepared the list, and the legal procedure for resolving this problem is being analyzed now. Two solutions are possible: either closing the shipping offices or leaving the job. [PULS] How true is it that last year the Ministry of Internal Affairs bought automobiles from one of our distributors--we will not mention his name and give him an advertisement--in the value of DM 1.2 million. We are asking you the question, since such activity cannot take place without being observed by the customs authorities. [Buzlevski] The Ministry of Internal Affairs is a body that has to be well-equipped, and we should not view that negatively. The fleet that it has purchased is intended for performance of its established duties. [PULS] The fleet can also be equipped with confiscated vehicles. How many vehicles were confiscated last year, and how many were released for auction through AMSM [Automobile and Motorcycle Federation of Macedonia]? [Buzlevski] Approximately 250-300 vehicles are confiscated each year. Last year there was only one auction, in Bitola, and about 15-20 vehicles were auctioned off. This year, however, with the resolution of the dispute over where the second-level procedure will take place (it has been determined that it will be at the Customs Administration), things will take place more quickly. [PULS] Did the number of vehicles confiscated increase last year? [Buzlevski] It increased considerably, since a large number of individuals sought to take advantage of various benefits, especially for imports from Albania. The vehicles were registered in the names of firms there, but were driven by citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, and that is a customs violation. [PULS] Since as a state and a people we are inclined toward actions that skirt the edge of the law, we would like to ask you whether there have been any pressures on you at all from powerful commercial firms or from individuals of high political rank to look aside in specific cases. [Buzlevski] I have been at the Customs Administration for nine months, and I can freely state that the service, and I personally, have been released from all forms of political pressures. In practice, it is impossible for such pressures to be applied in the Customs Administration. We have established such a working regime in customs procedures that the customs employee's autonomy is guaranteed, although a commission may feel that his work is over. [PULS] Nevertheless, the general belief is that in any businessman's contact with certain individuals in your hierarchy, things can be made easier with a fat bribe. Is that possible? [Buzlevski] It is most likely possible. Nevertheless, in the event that it were discovered it would be punished, starting with me and including the last employee in the Customs Service.
