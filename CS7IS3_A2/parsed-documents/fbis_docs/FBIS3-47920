Sison. Drilon made this suggestion amid the continued failure of the government and the National Democratic Front [NDF] panels to make any headway in the peace efforts. "The government has bent over backwards for too long," he said. [passage omitted] Drilon said the NDF, or the group identified with Sison, be given until the end of January to conduct exploratory talks with the government. After that, the government should start talking with locally-based rebels opposed to Sison, he said. Drilon said it does not matter if the anti-Sison faction does not completely control the New People's Army [NPA]. Making peace with one faction is better than having no agreement with anyone at all, he said. "We should prepare to talk with at least a faction," he said. [passage omitted] Drilon, who was a member of the National Unification Commission, recalled that when the agency was still existing, it received word that local rebels opposed to Sison wanted to have separate representation. "We got very clear signals that it is alright for the government to hold exploratory talks with Sison et al, but when it comes to formal negotiations, they would want to be represented," the justice secretary said. He added that even some members of the CPP hierarchy want to conduct talks with the government. "There was a report that a certain point, certain NDF leaders in the Philippines were disappointed because of the perception that we are talking only with Joma [Jose Ma. Sison]," he said. [sentence as published] The government is currently communicating officially with NDF Vice Chairman Luis Jalandoni who heads the NDF panel.
