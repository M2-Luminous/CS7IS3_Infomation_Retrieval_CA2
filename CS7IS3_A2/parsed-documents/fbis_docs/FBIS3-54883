The Central Bank has issued a press release confirming that GMM's operations are illegal and saying that its activity "jeopardizes the interests of citizens who have entrusted their savings to it." Curiously, repeated requests by the Foreign Ministry demanding that the Dutch company, which has been conducting purely banking operations in Russia without bothering to obtain any license, be properly dealt with have been stubbornly ignored by the Central Bank. Nor was Mr. Gerashchenko's office impressed by an entirely convincing article in IZVESTIYA on oddities in GMM's activity. Obviously, it was the political context in which he has found himself owing to his friendship with GMM that impressed Mr. Gerashchenko so strongly in this particular case. Any unbiased observer can draw this fairly simple sequence of logical conclusions: the Central Bank chairman, whose position has been fairly shaky of late, has been covering the illegal activity of a company of financial black marketeers; the company finances the penetration into the parliament of deputies meeting its moral and political standards; subsequently, the deputies appoint Gerashchenko Central Bank chairman. The only inconvenience is that the paid deputies are Nazis of sorts. However, the stunning impudence such people tend to display on Russian soil has precluded their thinking that anyone might take a serious interest in this. The behavior of Mr. Gerashchenko, whom Anton Nenakhov, chief of GMM's Moscow branch, was praising to the skies in the "Without Retouching" television program (at the same time fulminating against Finance Minister Boris Fedorov), is also very peculiar. Initially he covered the "trust" company's activity, allowing it to collect millions of dollars from the population, then, upon suddenly seeing the light, he called it illegal, thus effectively assuring the bankruptcy of tens of thousands of investors. One cannot help getting a strange impression: What if this is a deliberately fabricated affair? Yet more indirect evidence is that the Central Bank, as far as I know, has not frozen GMM's accounts. Hence, investors' money can be siphoned away -- according to its commercial -- round the clock throughout the world. The answer to a popular question of to whom one should address one's claims is simple -- to the Central Bank and its chairman. Generally speaking, bureaucrats in a normal society would at least resign in similar circumstances. Self-assurance prevented the hapless "businessmen" from noting that financing Nazis is seen as something extremely inappropriate in civilized countries. As a result, the Dutch Foreign Ministry has launched an investigation into the activity of GMM, which turned out to have had no right to engage in overseas trust operations under the legislation of Holland (which, unlike this country, does have a trust law). When asked by DE VOLLKSRANT, a Mr. Van de Meer, a GMM official in Amsterdam, said that GMM gave Zhirinovskiy as little as $50,000. He claims that the "trust" company also financed other "important" candidates, and that large amounts were handed to "Russia's Choice." Election campaign chiefs of "Russia's Choice" insist, however, that the bloc has not taken any money from either GMM or any other foreign companies. According to the aforementioned Mr. Van de Meer, his chief, Nenakhov, personally supported a number of candidates as a private person, guided by his own preferences. Van de Meer sees this policy as reasonable. "Mr. Nenakhov has one single political preference, which is money," the official says. The ingenuity multiplied by his deliberate unscrupulousness may turn out to be not so "reasonable" as some Western partners tend to think, mistaking Russia for a banana republic. Under Russian laws, financing an election campaign of a candidate or a bloc from foreign sources may give grounds for annulling the votes cast for the candidates or blocs. Unless we are a banana republic indeed.
