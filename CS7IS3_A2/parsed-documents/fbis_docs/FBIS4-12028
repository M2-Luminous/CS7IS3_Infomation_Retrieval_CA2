Article on Land Day REPORT ON VIOLENCE IN ASYUT On page 4, the newspaper publishes a 2,000-report by Qutb al-'Arabi on the ongoing confrontation between the security forces and the Islamic groups in Asyut. The report notes that violence has escalated in Asyut in the past three months, with armed operations against the police increasing from six operations in January, to nine in February, to 18 operations in March. Over 50 people, including policemen, citizens, and Islamic group members, have been killed and over 70 others have been wounded in these operations. The report then tries to explain the reasons for this escalation, putting the blame squarely on the government's heavy-handed policy. The report says "the leaders of the Islamic current in Asyut (Labor Party-Muslim Brotherhood) believe that the reduction of violence in Asyut must take place within the framework of a comprehensive solution that will establish real pluralism and democracy and allow and decriminalize freedom of political action." "Moreover, moderate Islamic leaders believe that the haphazard arrest of citizens in Asyut, their detention as hostages, their harsh treatment, and the blockade of residential quarters encourage the escalation of violence and the formation of a strong front supporting it." The report notes that these government tactics "feed the industry of violence" in Asyut. It calls for lifting the blockade on al- Walidiyah quarter and allowing freedom of movement for its inhabitants. ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY TEACHING CLUB ELECTIONS In an 800-word report on page 4 by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad, the newspaper says that "despite strong government pressure and overt rigging", the Islamists won 6 seats in the elections for the board of directors of the teaching club of Alexandria University. The government ticket won the remaining eight seats while the leftist ticket won no seats. The report identifies the elected Islamist members of the teaching club as Dr. 'Umar al-Barbari, Dr. 'Abd-al- 'Aziz Salamah, Dr. Mustafa Abu-al-Huda, Dr. Mustafa Abu-al-'Aynayn, Dr. al-Masiri, and Dr. Nabil al-Mulukhiyah. ARTICLE BY MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL DR. AHMAD AL-MALAT On page 5, the newspaper publishes a 1,500-word article by Muslim Brotherhood official Dr. Ahmad al-Malat. Referring to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, al-Malat deplores the weakness of the Muslims who now receive "blow after blow" and "slap after slap," without doing anything. He adds that "regrettably, the media, including the Egyptian media, have not paid any attention to this tragedy, as if it was an earthquake that happened in a remote place and did not harm us in any way." The media have maintained their "trivia" and their "deliberate defiance of Islamic values." "The last days of Ramadan were celebrated with dancing, nakedness, and entertainment. The Koran's share on the radio were a few minutes every day while 'Adawiyah [a folklore singer] got the lion's share." The writer goes on to say that all the Arab governments without exception have become "defeatist", running after the "mirage of peace" which they are worshiping instead of God. CRITICISM OF THE MOVIE "THE TERRORIST" On page 9, the newspaper carries a 900-word critique by Sharif Samih of the movie "The Terrorist," played by famous Egyptian actor-comedian 'Adil Imam. Samih says "the movie represents the Interior Ministry's view of terrorism. It deals with this issue "very superficially" and without trying to identify the roots of the problem. He goes on to say that if the movie's message is to entertain and kill two hours of time, then it has succeeded, but of its message is to fight terrorism, then it has failed. Samih says the move has no relation to reality and is based on a fabricated scenario. The audience are only attracted by 'Adil Imam's acting abilities and by the "sexual jokes" in the movie. Also on page 9, reader Muhsin Mahmud Amin Sarhan from the College of Sciences says the movie "The Terrorist" offers an alternative slogan to the slogan "Islam is the solution. The alternative slogan is "Corruption is the solution" because the movie urges us to emulate the "immoral and dissolute Western civilization." SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI COLUMN In his 800-word column "This Is Our Religion" on page 12, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali criticizes an article headlined "Religion and Ideology" by counselor Muhammad Sa'id al-'Ashmawi. Al-Ghazali notes that al-'Ashmawi's article is "vague" and "deliberately creates confusion" between heavenly and terrestrial religions. He says al-'Ashmawi equates Buddhism and Hinduism with Islam and Christianity. Wihout offering a counteropinion, he also takes al-'Ashmawi to task for saying that "Islam is a religion, while the doctrines embraced by some groups are ideology." Referring to the British Parliament's passage of a law reducing the age of consent among homosexuals to 18, al-Ghazali asks whether the religious people who oppose this legislation do harm to God or interere in politics. He also asks if this "abnormal" legislation is adopted in the Arab world, will we blame the pious youths if they oppose it? He then says that the Koran is an immortal book that specifies the following punishment for those who commit adultery: "Flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if ye believe in God and the last day." REACTION TO BAN ON 'ABD-AL-KAFI SERMONS On page 12, the newspaper publishes an 800-word article by writer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus entitled "Blatant Injustice." The writer says the ruling regime has committed grave mistakes in fighting the "entire Islamic current," thus winning the enmity of wide sectors of the people. Giving an example, the writer says the "police rule was blatantly manifested in the decision to prevent Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from delivering sermons, although he never attacked the government." The writer notes that the government caved in to the demands of the secular people and haters of Islam and adopted this measure against the popular preacher, who used to attract large crowds of worshipers. ARTICLE ON LAND DAY On page 12, the newspaper publishes a 2,000-word article by Dr. Mahjub 'Umar on "Land Day," celebrated by the Arabs of Israel on 30 March of each year. The article reviews the events of that day on 30 March 1976 when the Arabs of Israel staged strikes and demonstrations to protest the seizure of their lands by the Israeli Government. Six Arabs were killed by the Israeli forces during these protests. The writer notes that the Arabs of Israel are a force to be reckoned with and will have the "final say" in the long conflict with Israel over the land.
