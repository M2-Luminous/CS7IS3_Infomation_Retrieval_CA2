Different countries, he stressed, have approached the establishment of relations with the European Union in different ways. Often those relations have been of disadvantage to those states. As for Russia, we have taken the path of signing a full- scale document which reflects not only Russia's political, but also its economic interests. The representative of the Russian foreign policy department said that the talks were difficult. The final compromises were reached literally over the final weeks of work on the document. "We are grateful to our Greek friends," Churkin noted in particular, "who, as EU chairmen, have shown commitment and energy in ensuring that work was completed on the agreement which will be initialled this evening and signed tomorrow by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and the EU leadership."
