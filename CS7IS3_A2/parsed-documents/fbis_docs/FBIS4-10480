The Senate committees were constituted during a voting session. All the committees were constituted with two CPPD senators, two from the opposition, and one government-appointed senator. This result was described by several senators as "a great defeat" for the CPPD and "a great triumph" for the center right (Unity for the Progress of Chile) in the Senate. Also within the CPPD, the bloc formed by the PS [Socialist Party], PPD [Party for Democracy], and PR [Radical Party] was strengthened to the PDC [Christian Democratic Party]'s detriment. During the first legislative term, the CPPD obtained the majority in five committees (defense, labor, government, finance, and mining). On 23 March, the CPPD obtained a majority only in the Finance Committee, which is considered a "key" issue for the government's economic administration. This majority was decided by a coin toss that favored PDC Senator Andres Zaldivar, who was tied with government-appointed Senator Carlos Letelier with 30 votes each. (The committees are made up of five members, but in this case there were six candidates). The other committee members are Jorge Lavandero (PDC), who obtained 36 votes; Sebastian Pinera (RN) [National Renewal], 35 votes; Francisco Javier Errazuriz (UCC) [Center-Center Union], 35 votes; and Carlos Ominami (PS), 34 votes. The chairmen of each committee will be elected by their own members during the first week of April when they meet to agree on their work methods. It was learned on 23 March that the right will offer the CPPD the presidency of the Labor and Defense Committees (to Arturo Frei in the latter case). The government-appointed senators will preside over two or three committees; the independents will preside over one or two; the RN will preside over seven or eight committees; the UCC will preside over one; and the Independent Democratic Union [UDI] will preside over two. The CPPD senators believe the 23 March voting session changes the balance that existed during the last four years and has turned the official bloc into "a minority in all the committees." This is a "real change" in the political reality and a fact that will have consequences in the Senate's future work, the CPPD senators said. They said that by joining the committees from which they were left out before 1990, the government-appointed senators left out the CPPD senators. They also pointed out that the government-appointed senators have constituted a new political bloc. The opposition (RN-UDI-UCC) senators believe the new distribution of posts is the result of "a perfect balance" of harmony and unity in the center right and also the logical result of the parties' representation in the Senate.
