FR940610-0-00055 FR940610-0-00023 (e) Present value of the remainder interest in the case of transfers to pooled income funds for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989 _(1) In general. In the case of transfers to pooled income funds for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, the present value of a remainder interest is determined under this section. See, however, §1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). The present value of a remainder interest that is dependent on the termination of the life of one individual is computed by the use of Table S in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. For purposes of the computations under this section, the age of an individual is the age at the individual's nearest birthday. If the valuation date of a transfer to a pooled income fund is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700, in valuing the transferred interest. (See §601.601(d)(2)(ii)( b ) of this chapter.) (2) Present value of a remainder interest. The present value of a remainder interest in property transferred to a pooled income fund is computed on the basis of_ (i) Life contingencies determined from the values of lx that are set forth in Table 80CNSMT in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations); and (ii) Discount at a rate of interest, compounded annually, equal to the highest yearly rate of return of pooled income fund for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding its taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the yearly rate of return of a pooled income fund is determined as provided in §1.642(c)&hyph;6(c) unless the highest rate of return is deemed to be the rate described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for funds in existence less than 3 taxable years. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), the first taxable year of a pooled income fund is considered a taxable year even though the taxable year consists of less than 12 months. However, appropriate adjustments must be made to annualize the rate of return earned by the fund for that period. Where it appears from the facts and circumstances that the highest yearly rate of return of the fund for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property is made has been purposely manipulated to be substantially less than the rate of return that would otherwise be reasonably anticipated with the purpose of obtaining an excessive charitable deduction, that rate of return may not be used. In that case, the highest yearly rate of return of the fund is determined by treating the fund as a pooled income fund that has been in existence for less than 3 preceding taxable years. (3) Pooled income funds in existence less than 3 taxable years. If a pooled income fund has been in existence less than 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer is made to the fund and the transfer to the fund is made after April 30, 1989, the highest rate of return is deemed to be the interest rate (rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one percent) that is 1 percent less than the highest annual average of the monthly section 7520 rates for the 3 calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the transfer to the pooled income fund is made. The deemed rate of return for transfers to new pooled income funds is recomputed each calendar year using the monthly section 7520 rates for the 3-year period immediately preceding the calendar year in which each transfer to the fund is made until the fund has been in existence for 3 taxable years and can compute its highest rate of return for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made in accordance with the rules set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. (4) Computation of value of remainder interest. The factor that is used in determining the present value of a remainder interest that is dependent on the termination of the life of one individual is the factor from Table S in paragraph (e)(5) of this section under the appropriate yearly rate of return opposite the number that corresponds to the age of the individual upon whose life the value of the remainder interest is based. The tables in paragraph (e)(5) of this section include factors for yearly rates of return from 4.2 to 14 percent. Many actuarial factors not contained in the tables in paragraph (e)(5) of this section are contained in Table S in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). A copy of this publication may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. For other situations, see §1.642(c)&hyph;6(b). If the yearly rate of return is a percentage that is between the yearly rates of return for which factors are provided, a linear interpolation must be made. The present value of the remainder interest is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the property on the valuation date by the appropriate remainder factor. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example: Example. A, who will be 55 years old on May 8, 1990, transfers $100,000 to a pooled income fund on January 1, 1990, and retains a life income interest in the property. The highest yearly rate of return earned by the fund for its 3 preceding taxable years is 9.47 percent. In Table S, the remainder factor opposite 55 years under 9.4 percent is .18785 and under 9.6 percent is .18322. The present value of the remainder interest is $18,623.00, computed as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Factor at 9.4 percent for age 55 .18785 Factor at 9.6 percent for age 55 .18322 n,s Difference .00463 E:GRAPHICSER10JN94.002 ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Factor at 9.4 percent for age 55 .18785 Less: Interpolation adjustment .00162 n,s Interpolated factor .18623 Present value of remainder interest: ($100,000×.18623) $18,623.00
