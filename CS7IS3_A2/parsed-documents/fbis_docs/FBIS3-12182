[Beilin] It is hard to say that I was surprised but this is definitely a worrisome development which should not be disregarded. I think that the next step should be the United States getting into the thick of things in order to prevent any exacerbation that could ultimately present all the parties with a situation they may not have initially wanted. Such a development may, God forbid, preclude the continuation of the talks. [Einstein] You speak of deeper U.S. involvement in the talks. Perhaps from our point of view this may lead to greater pressure on Israel? [Beilin] No, definitely not. We are not worried about U.S. pressure on Israel. There is a high level of coordination between the United States and Israel. We know that the U.S. Administration is highly interested in promoting the peace process. On no account would the United States want the situation to deteriorate. Now, after this terrible act, Israel would have a hard time directly persuading the Syrians and Lebanese to return to the talks. We are also having a hard time with the PLO in this respect. I believe that right now the Americans could be helpful in this. [Einstein] Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin, should Israel perhaps be more forthcoming toward the PLO, or were yesterday's cabinet decisions sufficient? [Beilin] I believe that the decisions made yesterday constitute a precedent. Such decisions have never been taken before. [Einstein] But nevertheless? [Beilin] I do not see any room for additional decisions with regard to what happened in Hebron and the ramifications of that terrible deed. Israel can now tell the world that it has done all it could, and I very much hope that it will now be easier to resume the political process despite all the natural and understandable difficulties. [Einstein] Thank you, Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin.
