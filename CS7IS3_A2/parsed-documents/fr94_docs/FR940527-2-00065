This information collection was previously approved under OMB control number 0970&hyph;0030. ADDRESSES: Copies of this information collection may be obtained from Edward E. Saunders of the Office of Information Systems Management, ACF, by calling (202) 205&hyph;7921. Written comments and questions regarding this information collection should be sent directly to: Laura Oliven OMB Desk Officer for ACF OMB Reports Management Branch, New Executive Office Building, room 3002 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503 (202) 395&hyph;7316. Information on Document Title: Refugee Resettlement Program Estimates: CMA Cash/Medical/Administration/ Unaccompanied Minors Form No. ORR&hyph;1 OMB No.: 0970&hyph;0030 Description: Section 412(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides that no grant or contract may be awarded under this section unless an appropriate proposal and application are submitted to, and approved by, the appropriate ACF administering official. CFR 400.11 (b) authorizes the award of funds to States and the District of Columbia that meet specified eligibility requirements for the purpose of assisting States to provide assistance to immigrants to facilitate their transition to this country. Major portions of ACF funds for refugee resettlement involves grants to 47 states and the District of Columbia. Therefore, to obtain budget estimates for reimbursable costs from these entities, reliable state estimates of expenditures, must be completed an submitted annually to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. In order to provide accurate budgetary information and establish a fiscal and programmatic baseline for effective monitoring of the use of these funds, regulations found at CFR 400.11 (b) require States participating in the Refugee Resettlement Program to submit annually estimates on the average number of recipients for each of four budget categories. The budget categories are: refugee cash assistance, medical assistance, State administrative costs and costs associated with unaccompanied minors. The budget estimates will be recorded on the Refugee Resettlement Program Estimates: CMA Administration/Unaccompanied Minors_Form ORR&hyph;1. The ORR&hyph;1 form minimizes the State administrative burden by asking only for key information on a single-page form, using the categories that are precisely equivalent to those used for the State reporting of actual quarterly fiscal obligations and expenditures. Annual Number of Respondents: 48. Annual Frequency: 1. Average Burden Hours Per Response: 5. Total Burden Hours: 24. Dated: May 18, 1994.
