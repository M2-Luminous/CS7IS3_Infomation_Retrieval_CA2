It says: In connection with Lithuania's official request to join NATO, I am authorized to state the following. A desire to join international organizations is an acknowledged right of independent states. Democratic Russia respects such rights. At the same time, the haste with which some countries, among them the Lithuanian Republic, are striving for membership in the military-political alliance cannot but put us on our guard. Regrettably, this tendency toward a bloc mentality is manifesting itself at a time when the world's major powers are earnestly seeking instruments for dismantling the inheritance of the "cold war" and are declaring their desire to build relations on the basis of principles of partnership in the name of peace. Democratic Russia, with its new military doctrine and following the principles of interstate relations, exclude any kind of aggressive displays on her part in foreign policy. In this connection, the motives and arguments of countries aspiring to membership of NATO are unconvincing. The president of Russia is worried at the tendency toward the expansion of the bloc system. The encouragement of such a tendency would contradict declared intentions to build mutual relations on principles of trust, partnership, and equilibrium. The president is worried that expanding NATO with new members from the countries in direct proximity to Russia's borders will provoke a negative reaction in Russian public opinion, promote the development of undesirable attitudes in civilian and military circles, and, ultimately, could lead to military-political destabilization in a region which is of key importance for the destiny of the world. President Boris Yeltsin expects that the leaders of NATO member-countries and the NATO leadership will dispel the impression of ambiguity in their position on the issue, which has a bearing both on the destiny of the world and the national interests of Russia.
