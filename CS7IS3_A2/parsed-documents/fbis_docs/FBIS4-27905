During the negotiations, U.S. negotiators did not drop the U.S. proposal to discuss expanding the procurement of equipment by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). Why is the United States taking a tough stand on the NTT's procurement of equipment? As one of reasons for the United States taking such a tough stand, an official familiar with telecommunications projects has cited the fact that the NTT and the private sector are set to take the lead in promoting the project for building Japan's next- generation telecommunications network (the optical fiber communications network). The United States therefore has to attach great importance to selling its telecommunications equipment to NTT. Japanese negotiators are agonizing over how to deal with the U.S. proposal, claiming "It is not rational for the governments of the two countries to discuss the Japanese private sector's procurement." The project for building the next-generation telecommunications network is aimed at installing optical fiber cables and replacing the current telephone switchboards with digital-type telephone switchboards across Japan by the year 2010 and the new telecommunications network will make it possible to transmit a large volume of information including clear live visual images at a high speed. It has been pointed out that the next-generation telecommunications network will become an important infrastructure to shore up the multimedia. Japan is expected to invest 75-95 trillion yen to build the next-generation telecommunications network, and the project for the network will provide American corporations with great business opportunities. Which organizations will take charge of building the next- generation telecommunications network? This question has so far been a focal point. At first, the idea surfaced that a corporation should be established to build the network. The Telecommunications Council (an advisory body to the minister of posts and telecommunications) compiled a report in late May asserting that "the NTT and private enterprises should take the lead in building the next-generation telecommunications network." The report drew a conclusion on the question of which organizations should take charge of building the network. The report made the assertion after concluding that using the private sector's vitality can better contribute to building the next-generation telecommunications network. The task for the United States has become more how to sell American telecommunications apparatus to the NTT than to the Japanese Government. The negotiations on government procurement under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are mandated to discuss ways to increase the government's procurement of foreign equipment and materials. The U.S. attitude is that "the Japanese Government holds a stake in the NTT and the NTT is a semi-official organization. The two countries can discuss the NTT's procurement at the negotiations on government procurement." The Foreign Ministry is not hiding its embarrassment. The prevailing view is that behind the U.S. proposal is a concerted strategy charted by the U.S. Administration and the private sector that aims to establish American superiority over Japan in telecommunications and information technologies. Some Japanese Government officials, who want to move the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks forward one way or other, have begun voicing the need to hold another Japan-U.S. governmental parley to discuss the "NTT issue."
