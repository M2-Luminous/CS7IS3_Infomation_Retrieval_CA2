The Council was briefed on the results of the latest round of Geneva talks on the former Yugoslavia and on the declaration on the normalization of relations between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY, i.e. Serbia and Montenegro. The Council supported the declaration, and assessed the normalization of Croatian and Serbian relations as in the strategic interest of the Republic of Croatia and a prerequisite for the establishment of a new international order in the former Yugoslav territory and in this part of Europe and the Balkans. The signing of the declaration based on the UN Charter and the main CSCE documents is of great political importance, and at the same time confirms the readiness of both sides' signatories of the declaration that the problem of Serbs in Croatia will be resolved in a peaceful way, by reintegrating UN Protected Areas in the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of Croatia. International factors supported the declaration, and assessed it as an important step in the process of finding a permanent political solution in this region. The government of the Republic of Croatia will do everything in its power to ensure that the provision on the establishment of official representative offices is implemented as of 15 February this year. As for the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- despite all peace proposals on the part of the Republic of Croatia and the European initiative -- the conference failed to reach a permanent solution because of the Muslim side, but the talks will continue and the next conference has been scheduled for 10 February this year. Having given full support to the Croatian delegation's consistent stands, the Council expressed hope that the resumption of such policy on Croatia's part would bring about a permanent and just solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
