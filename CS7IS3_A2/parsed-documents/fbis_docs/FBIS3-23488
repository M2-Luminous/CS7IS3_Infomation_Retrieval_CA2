The highly-placed source identified the terrorist as Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, one of three terrorists who remain at large after allegedly carrying out the bomb attack on the World Trade Center on Feb 26 last year. The source said pictures of Yousef had been distributed among police in Bangkok and the Muslim-majority provinces in the South where he was believed to be hiding. He said apart from the Israeli diplomatic mission, possible targets of the terrorists responsible for the truckload of explosive materials uncovered by police last Thursday may have included the embassies of the United States and Turkey as well as foreign dignitaries in Bangkok. [passage omitted] The source said Pattani is one place where international terrorists, most of them Shi'ite Muslims, can find a safe haven after committing crimes in other countries. He said the terrorists travel on fake passports and get to Pattani via Malaysia. Tourist districts in Bangkok frequented by visitors from the Middle East, such as Soi Nana and Saphan Kwai, are also hiding places for terrorists, the source said. [passage omitted]
