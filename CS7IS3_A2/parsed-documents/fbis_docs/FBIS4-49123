The prosecutor recommended 34 months in jail for speaker Hsiao Teng-wang and five years for Deputy Speaker Chen Chun-kui for vote- buying if they are found guilty. An investigation showed that Hsiao and Chen had offered NT$1 [new Taiwan dollars] million (US$37,878) and NT$800,000, respectively, to each councilor who would vote for them. The prosecutor also proposed a jail term of two years for councilors Chang Tung-kun and Li Tien-lang, who were suspected of buying votes on behalf of Hsiao and Chen. Eleven other people face proposed jail terms of between eight months and 18 months for their roles in the nation's worst election scandal. At least 360 people around Taiwan, including 13 speakers, nine deputy speakers and 185 councilors, have so far been indicted on graft charges as the investigation into the scandal continues to unfold. The Chiayi County Council on Monday emerged unscathed from the scandal when the Chiayi prosecutor's office concluded an investigation into the election of the council with nobody being charged. The ruling Kuomintang won all 23 city and county speaker positions at stake in the polls.
