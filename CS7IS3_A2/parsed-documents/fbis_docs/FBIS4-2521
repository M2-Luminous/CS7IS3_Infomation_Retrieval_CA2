Its efforts have promoted the development of ideological and political work within enterprises, have stabilized the workers' ranks, and have deepened reform and development. To improve and intensify enterprises' ideological and political work, over the past two years the institute has dispatched eight groups to investigate nearly 100 enterprises along open coastal areas and in certain provinces and cities; their findings have helped enterprises build stronger party organizations and make decisions on carrying out ideological and political work. Recently, the institute also organized the fifth and sixth national seminars on enterprises' ideological and political work in order to exchange experiences on studying theories of market economy, and called a symposium in Shenzhen to study and discuss the relationship between enterprises' cultural work and ideological and political work in an effort to guide political workers to move out from their "small circles" [xiao xun huan 1420 1789 3883] of ideological and political work and step into the "large circles" of economic construction, reform, and opening up; the symposium also helped the vast number of political workers change their mind sets and improve proficiency so they can meet the requirements of the transformation period as quickly as possible. According to a person in charge of the institute, the institute will continue to employ its resources for doing ideological and political work for enterprise development. He said members of his institute will serve party committees and governments at various levels as advisers, providing them with investigative findings and relevant information. He said the institute will soon carry out studies on the modern enterprise system as well as ideological and political work, and on ideological and political work in joint ventures and village and town enterprises. He added that efforts will be made to produce significant research results in one or two areas. Meanwhile, the institute will improve its service for grass-roots units, will intensify doing ideological and political work and propagating public opinion, and will provide the grassroots with more effective guidance in accordance with the actual conditions of grass-roots enterprises.
