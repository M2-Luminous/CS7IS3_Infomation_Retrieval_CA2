At the meeting, the ministry revealed several plans that it is ready to implement to support a nationwide effort to raise the country's "competitive edge." One of the MND plans is to open a military technical college. The ministry believes the school will not only teach soldiers the skills needed to "manage and maintain" highly technical military equipment and weapons, but also provide future technicians for the country, since all graduates of the school will be fully licensed. The ministry hopes that the school, which will be open to all soldiers who pass a basic test, will be an added incentive for re-enlistment. The ministry intends to finalize its plans for the school by November, by which time it hopes to have obtained approximately 50 billion won for the school. Another of the ministry's plans involves issuing technicians' licenses to ex-military personnel. Under the plan, anyone who acquired technical skills while in the military will be exempted from taking all or a portion of the required national technicians' tests. Currently, there are 194 technical fields requiring licenses. The ministry plans to come up with additional fields, such as aerial photography, fire prevention equipment installation, auto works, etc.
