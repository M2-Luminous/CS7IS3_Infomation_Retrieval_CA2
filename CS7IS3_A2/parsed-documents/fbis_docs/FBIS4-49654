The administration has issued a circular asking its branches to consider various maximum price increases for major agricultural products. Administration officials cautioned that retailers should not violate the administration's ceilings for price rises since the limits already take into account retailers' costs, such as taxes and transportation, and profit margins. Domestic prices of edible oil, cotton and chemical fertilizer have been increasing by big margins, according to the Ministry of Internal Trade. The ministry's figures show the average price of soya-bean oil, peanut oil and rapeseed oil jumped 43.2 per cent to 7,014 yuan ($806.20) a ton from November to last month the off-season in the year-round agricultural production cycle. Last month the administration's Harbin branch in Heilongjiang forged ahead of other provincial-level branches to hold down local prices of edible oil by setting the maximum increases at 7.40 yuan ($0.85) per kilogram. Cotton prices, too, are spiralling because of a severe shortage of supply. In mid-April, a ton of 21-count yarn fetched an average 24,000 yuan ($2,758.60), up 2,000 yuan ($230) from the beginning of 1993. Because of the soaring costs, most of the country's cotton-spinning factories are on the verge of suspending production. The situation is worst in Sichuan Province, where at least a third of all cotton-spinning factories have already stopped production because of the cotton shortage. Prices are also on the rise for chemical fertilizer. Analysts blame the rocketing costs of production materials and imports for the 11.9 per cent jump since last year in the average price for imported and domestically made carbamide. The price now stands at 1,240 yuan ($142) a ton.
