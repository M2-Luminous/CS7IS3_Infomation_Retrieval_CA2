ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy, Kansas City Support Office announces that, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award to the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research, to continue activities initiated through a cooperative agreement between the Center and the DOE that seek to develop market information electric motor systems and facilitate collaboration between DOE, state governments, industries, utilities, electric motor equipment manufacturers, and other stakeholders on technical and market related issues of electric motor systems. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research is a non-profit organization which sponsors and conducts cooperative research and technology transfer efforts aimed at cost effective and customer sensitive energy efficiency initiatives. The Center has worked in partnership with Wisconsin utilities, DOE, national and state based energy research organizations, and Canadian utilities on a wide range of energy efficient technology and market issues. Through the existing cooperative agreement the Center and the DOE are working together to develop a Midwest Electric Motor Systems Collaborative Project which encourages implementation of energy efficient motor-driven systems in a ten state region. This award will further that effort and the objectives of the DOE, Industrial Electric Motor Systems Program in promoting the use of efficient electric motor systems. Therefore, the application is being accepted because DOE knows of no other opportunity to conduct such a project by any other organization or entity.
