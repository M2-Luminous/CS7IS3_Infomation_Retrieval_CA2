Sedat Yurtdas and Mehdi Zana, DEP deputies from Diyarbakir, left Turkey for France for that purpose yesterday. They will appeal to the international organizations, including the Human Rights Court [as published], to launch initiatives to have the detained deputies released and their legislative immunity returned. It has been ascertained that the French Government has been informed on Yurtdas' and Zana's visit to Europe to appeal to President Mitterrand and Mrs. Mitterrand to take action to support them. The officials will begin to interrogate Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan, Ahmet Turk, Leyla Zana, Sirri Sakik, and Mahmut Alinak today. Dicle and Dogan have been in custody for six days and Turk, Zana, Sakik, and Alinak have been held in custody for five days. They will be interrogated by a group of officials under Nusret Demirel, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court. The group is made up of Major Ulku Coskun, Kemal Ayhan, and Talat Salk, who are prosecutors affiliated with the State Security Court. The deputies will be isolated in separate rooms during the interrogation. Meanwhile, an anonymous person called the Directorate General of Police on behalf of the Kurdish Workers Party yesterday and warned that the PKK will assassinate several officials if the deputies are not released from custody. A special operations team armed with M-16 automatic rifles was instructed to guard the building that houses the antiterror department after the call was received. The DEP deputies are being held in that department.
