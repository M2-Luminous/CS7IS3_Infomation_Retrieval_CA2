Addressing the 51st session of the GCC Ministerial Council here last night, Prince Sa'ud said the brothers in Yemen are passing through difficult circumstances and sad events due to the continuation of violence and fighting in their country. Yemenis are killed in north and south and properties are destroyed as the result of the bloody fighting, he said. Prince Sa'ud noted that the GCC member states, since the beginning, had appealed to the brothers in Yemen to avoid their country woes of war and settle their dispute through peaceful means. Despite the efforts exerted to end the war, yet bloody fighting continued in Yemen, he said. Prince Sa'ud noted that during the pilgrimage season Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, in a personal initiative, called the conflicting parties in Yemen to cease fighting taking into account the sanctity of the hajj season and the feelings of the Muslims. But we were taken by surprise when the military operations continued, he said. When we discuss this issue we should bear in mind that fighting will never enhance the pillars of unity, on the contrary it will deepen the feelings of hatred and disunity, he said. Prince Sa'ud said the UN's Security Council, in its resolution Number 924, issued in June 1, reiterated the keenness of the international community on stability in Yemen. As continuation of fighting in Yemen will have repercussions on the GCC member states, the GCC Ministerial Council should issue a resolution to reiterate that continuation of fighting is an unacceptable matter, he said and added in the light of the adverse impact of the war, it will be an essential matter to take measures vis-a-vis such situation. Prince Sa'ud deplored the maneuvers of the Iraqi regime and its procrastination in implementing the resolutions issued by the Security Council following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. Iraq has been following a selective policy regarding the resolutions issued by the Security Council, he said. Till now the Iraqi regime has not announced its respect to Kuwait's sovereignty and independence, he said and added announcement of Iraq to its respect to Kuwait's sovereignty and independence constitutes the core of the international resolutions. He noted that the failure of the Iraqi regime to implement the international resolutions had forced the Security Council to continue imposition of sanctions on Iraq. We call the Iraq regime to implement the Security Council's Resolutions 706 and 712 so as to pave the way for ending the sufferings of the Iraqi people, he said. On relations with Iran, Prince Sa'ud said "we have not yet get confident that Iran will adhere to the international conventions and norms based on the principle of mutual respect and non-interference in the domestic affairs of the other countries." But yet we are optimistic that the causes which affect the nature of the existing relations between the GCC member states and Iran will come to an end, he added. Prince Sa'ud said the problem of the three islands constitutes one of the main obstacles that prevent growth of Gulf-Iranian relations. The initiative of Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan to settle the dispute of the three islands through dialogue constitutes a declaration of good intentions, he said. Prince Sa'ud expressed happiness over the new era started by the Palestinians to practice their national rights on part of their territories following the agreement signed in Cairo in last May. He hoped that this development would be an initial step towards a comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli dispute in a manner that leads to the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories including Jerusalem in line with the Resolutions 242, 338 and 425. Our countries have supported the peace steps and will continue to do so, he said. On the other hand, Prince Sa'ud deplored the Israeli aggression on Lebanon and said the aggression does not only constitute a flagrant aggression on an independent and UN's member state, but it also runs counter to the Israeli adherence towards the peace process. We call on the UN and the Security Council to take the appropriate measures that prevent recurrence of such aggression and guarantee the implementation of the Resolution 425 issued by the Security Council on Lebanon. On Bosnia-Herzegovina, Prince Sa'ud condemned the Serb aggression on the Muslims in violation to the international resolutions. He noted that the refusal of the Serbs to withdraw from the Bosnian city of Gorazde reflects their unwillingness to positively respond with the ongoing international efforts to settle the dispute. It is high time for the UN and international community to put pressure on the Serbs until they comply with the international resolutions, he said.
