The preliminary results received on the afternoon of 24 February are as follows: 1. We seized a BM-13, a BM-14, and a BM-21 multiple rocket launchers; three 85-mm, a DK-30, and a 122-mm cannons; three DK-82 and three DK-75 guns; three 120-mm and 13 60-mm mortars; 12 B-40, six 12.7-mm, 129 AK, and 12 M-15 guns. 2. We seized 12 60-mm mortar shells, two crates of AK ammunition, five crates of 12.7-mm ammunition, eight DK-75 shells, and three B-40 rockets. This a small amount of large- and small-sized ammunition because the enemy ran out of ammunition. 3. We seized six trucks, set ablaze three T-54 tanks, killed 49 attacking troops in the fight; captured 74 others who were too weak to flee because they suffered from a shortage of food for the past three days after their communication lines were cut off; and discovered 19 corpses scattered along a 12-KM stretch of road from Anlung Veng. 4. The attacking forces were cut off from their supplies for several days. They suffered shortages of ammunition, rice, and fuel. 5. We killed and captured 26 officers of the ranks of general and colonel.
