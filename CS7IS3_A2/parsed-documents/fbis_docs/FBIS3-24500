M. Yegorov; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] Several options for parallel optical linkages between simple two-layer neural-like uniform computing structures, based on a light modulator - photodetector couple are examined. Two design methods of optical multilayer three- dimensional computing devices are possible: With the first method, the complex functional circuits, made for each layer using the traditional silicon p-n-technology are connected to each other by optical information channels. With the second method, the layers are formed based on simple optical logic circuits. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods are discussed. Block diagrams and functional circuits of the structures and samples of parallel computations including simultaneous storage of the results and initial information are provided with the text. The examples of two-layer optical computing structures are functionally not perfect, but a combination of such devices in multilayer computing structures increases their functional capacity and flexibility by a several orders of magnitude, and can be effectively employed for binary and neural computations.
