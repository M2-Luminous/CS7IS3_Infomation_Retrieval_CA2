Kim Chong-u, deputy chairman of North Korea's External Economy Commission, vowed in a conversation with a high-ranking East European diplomat last month to attract foreign investment through wider contacts with such countries, the source said. According to the source, Kim said North Korea is willing to develop ties regardless of their political systems, "as long as these countries do not object to our political system." "If we can limit our excessive military expenditure, which is a heavy burden to our economic development, North Korea could quite quickly revitalize the economy and raise the standard of living of its society," he was quoted as saying. Kim claimed Pyongyang recently began talks with several major U.S. and Japanese auto manufacturers, pharmaceutical and oil firms, the source said. The deputy chairman, who also supervises the Nachin-Sonpong Free Economic Trade Zone in the Tumen River Delta, blamed military spending and the collapse of the "socialist camp and socialist market" for North Korea's economic difficulties, the source said. Kim, 52, considered a strong reform-minded leader, said, "North Korea would like to join APEC and benefit from the fact that it is located in Asia, the fastest growing region in the world." Last December the nation's economic policy was declared a failure at a plenary session of the Workers' Party and one based on development of agriculture, light industry and trade, and strong foreign trade was implemented.
