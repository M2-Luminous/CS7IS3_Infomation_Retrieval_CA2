China started drafting laws on intellectual property protection at the advent of reform in 1979, said Zhao Chunhua, deputy director of MOFTEC's Department of Science and Technology. A Trademark Law became effective in 1982, a Patent Law in 1984, a Copyright Law in 1991 and an Anti-Unethical Competition Law in 1993. Marking the advent of China's legal system on intellectual property, the four laws also provide a legal basis for protecting intellectual property of imported technology. If the supplier fails to provide sufficient proof of holding the rights of that patented technology, it will be banned from entering China--even if this would mean the loss of potentially huge profits, Zhao said. Before importing any patented foreign technology, the Chinese recipient is required to sign a contract with the foreign supplier specifying the scope and duration of the use of the technology. The move is aimed at preventing proliferation of the use of the patented foreign technology, said Zhao. Since secrecy is all important to technological advantage, a foreign supplier is allowed to impose reasonable restrictions on people who have access to the technological know-how, and place reasonable restrictions on areas where products made with that know-how are sold, said Zhao. Computer software is of particular concern in this regard. Protection of computer software is included in the Copyright Law. And in 1991, the more specific Regulations on Computer Software Protection were passed. In recent years, the licensed trade volume of computer software has increased around the world. China's trade volume in computer software has soared beyond several hundred million dollars. In computer software import, China permits foreign software owners to register their own accord in computer software registration and management centres in China. Prohibition and punishment will result from pirating foreign computer software, said Zhao. If disputes over intellectual property arise over imported technology, the two parties concerned should first try to negotiate an amicable settlement themselves. "If negotiations fail," Zhao said, "they may request arbitration, or start legal proceedings in the intellectual property divisions of Chinese courts." Last July, the Beijing Higher People's Court and the Beijing Intermediate People's Court set up China's first intellectual property divisions in their courts. Five provinces and eight cities have followed Beijing's example by establishing special courts to deal with legal proceedings arising from intellectual property disputes. Between 1986 and 1993, the courts handled over 3,500 cases of intellectual property violation. Of these, 1,783 involved patent rights, 1,168 copyrights and 554 trademarks. According to Zhao, a Sino-U.S. negotiation agency has been set up under the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade. "The agency provides a place where disputes pertaining to intellectual property are mediated regularly, thus playing a role in settling disputes over intellectual property between the two countries," said Zhao. In recent years, China has witnessed a rapid expansion of imported technology. Disputes regarding intellectual property did arise in the course. But the disputes were few in number, and were settled through negotiations, said Zhao. To improve protection of intellectual property in technology imports, authorities concerned are drafting Regulations on Technology Imports and Exports of the People's Republic of China. The regulations are aimed at bringing technology trade closer to international conventions, said Zhao.
