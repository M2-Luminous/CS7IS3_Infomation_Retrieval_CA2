The following described lands under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management are designated as open, limited, or closed to motorized vehicle use pursuant to the provisions of 43 CFR 8342.1. Affected by the designation are 146,232 acres, which includes all public lands in the Garnet Resource Area. The lands are managed under the Garnet Resource Management Plan dated January 10, 1986. They are located in Missoula, Granite, and Powell counties. These designations are revisions to Federal Register notice dated Tuesday, September 23, 1986, Vol. 51, No. 189, Wednesday, October 29, 1986, Vol. 51, No. 209, and Monday, September 16, 1991, Vol. 56, No. 179. These revisions are necessary to more efficiently manage vehicle use on public lands, to implement decisions in the Garnet Resource Management Plan and to coordinate vehicle travel management with adjoining intermingled private and public lands. Comments received during public open houses and written responses as part of the Garnet Resource Management Plan process influenced these designations. This designation order supersedes all other off-road vehicle travel designations. These designations are published as final, effective immediately, and will remain in effect until rescinded or modified by the authorized officer. Under 43 CFR 4.21, an appeal may be filed with the Interior Board of Land Appeals within 30 days of publication in the Federal Register. A. Open Designation No areas have been designated as open. B. Limited Designation Areas which are designated limited comprise approximately 85,775 acres.
