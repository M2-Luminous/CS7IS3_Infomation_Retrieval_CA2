FR940426-1-00122 FR940426-1-00015 17 CFR Parts 210, 229, and 249 [Release Nos. 33&hyph;7055; 34&hyph;33920; International Series No. 655; File No. S7&hyph;12&hyph;94 RIN 3235&hyph;AG17 Financial Statements of Significant Foreign Equity Investees and Acquired Foreign Businesses of Domestic Issuers and Financial Schedules AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing for comment amendments to Regulation S&hyph;X, which governs the form and content of financial statements and schedules furnished by public companies in filings with the Commission. The proposed amendments would extend recently adopted accommodations for foreign issuers to domestic issuers that are required to provide financial statements for significant foreign equity investees or acquired foreign businesses. These accommodations address the age of financial statements, nature of reconciling information and thresholds for providing such reconciliations. The proposed amendments also would eliminate certain financial schedules that both domestic and foreign issuers are currently required to include in annual reports and registration statements filed with the Commission. DATES: Comments should be received on or before July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comment letters should refer to File Number S7&hyph;12&hyph;94 and should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. The Commission will make all comments available for public inspection and copying in its Public Reference Room at the same address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wayne E. Carnall, (202) 272&hyph;2553, Office of the Chief Accountant, Division of Corporation Finance, or, with respect to investment company matters, Jim Volk, (202) 942&hyph;0637, Office of Disclosure and Review, Division of Investment Management, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549.

I. Introduction The Commission is proposing several amendments to the requirements governing financial statements of domestic companies required to report financial statements of significant foreign business acquisitions and foreign equity investees. These amendments would extend the same treatment for such foreign business acquisitions and investees as has been recently adopted for foreign registrants. 19 Similarly, the Commission is proposing to streamline required financial schedules to parallel revisions made to the foreign issuer integrated disclosure system. An additional two schedules are proposed to be eliminated for both domestic and foreign registrants. 19 See Securities Act Release No. 7053 (April 19, 1994). The initiatives proposed today continue the ongoing efforts of the Commission to simplify and lower the cost of registration and reporting by public companies in a manner that is consistent with investor protection. II. Financial Statements of Significant Foreign Businesses Acquisitions and Foreign Equity Investees of Domestic Companies Domestic and foreign registrants alike are required to furnish audited financial statements of significant businesses that have been acquired or are likely to be acquired. 20 Audited financial statements are required if the acquired business is significant at a level of 10 percent 21 using tests based on the size of the registrant's investment in the business, the total assets of the business, and the business' pre-tax income relative to amounts reported in the registrant's most recent financial statements. Subject to the same tests of significance, separate audited financial statements of less than majority owned investees (``equity investees'') are required for each year that those entities exceed the significance level of 20 percent. 22 20 17 CFR 210.3&hyph;05. 21 The number of years depends on level of significance: one year at 10 percent, two years at 20 percent and three years at 40 percent. 22 17 CFR 210.3&hyph;09. The proposals made today with respect to these separate financial statements are based on the recognition that U.S. companies may have the same difficulties in, and costs, of obtaining reconciled financial statements for foreign acquisitions and foreign investments as foreign issuers for whom the Commission adopted revisions to the requirements today. A. Significant Threshold for Equity Investees The Commission is proposing to modify one of the three tests for significance made pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation S&hyph;X to determine whether financial statements of an equity investee, foreign or domestic, must be provided. 23 The Commission believes that, for purposes of this rule, the significance of an investee should be based on a comparison of the registrant's proportionate share of the investee's pre-tax income to that of the registrant and of the registrant's investment in the investee relative to the registrant's total assets. Comparison of the investee's total assets to the total assets of the registrant, as presently required, appears insufficiently relevant if the investee is less than majority owned and, therefore, its financial statements are not consolidated in the registrant's financial statements. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation S&hyph;X to eliminate the requirement to consider total assets of a less than majority owned investee in the evaluation of its significance. Comment is requested as to whether the asset test should be eliminated. 23 17 CFR 210.3&hyph;09.
