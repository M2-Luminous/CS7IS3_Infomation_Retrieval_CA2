FBIS4-49506 "drchi089_b_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 United States & Canada 800 U.S. Companies Urge Clinton To Extend MFN Status 800 U.S. Companies Urge Clinton To Extend MFN Status OW0605192494 Beijing XINHUA in English 1827 GMT 6 May 94 OW0605192494 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Washington, May 6 (XINHUA) -- About 800 American companies, trade associations, farm organizations and consumer groups wrote Thursday [5 May] to U.S. President Bill Clinton, urging him to extend the most favored nations (MFN) trading status to China. The business coalition for U.S.-China trade released the letter today and stated that not renewing China's MFN status would jeopardize the over 180,000 high-wage American jobs dependent upon the over 9 billion worth of U.S. goods and service exported to China last year. In the letter which about 800 American businesses put their signatures to, the coalition said that "our companies are engaged in diverse businesses, ranging from manufacturing, farming, and retailing to financial and entertainment services, but we share a common conviction that trade with China is vital to America's future." "We are deeply concerned that initiating economic conflict through MFN revocation or other sanctions, such as denying MFN for state-owned companies, would put American jobs and exports at risk, cede the Chinese market to Europe and Japan," it noted. John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell-Douglas, explained in a news release by the coalition that "China represents an incredible market opportunity which will create thousands of additional U.S. jobs and further improve the U.S. economy as the Chinese demand more American products and service." "If we let this opportunity slip away, our global competitors will take over where we leave off and it will be nearly impossible to recover a competitive position in that area of the world," McDonnell said. The business leaders highlighted the important role that Chinese market has for the American consumer. "Loss of MFN or any form of trade sanctions will have a direct cost for American consumers," said Myron Ullman, chairman of R. H. Macy & Co., Inc. "Low- and middle-income American families will face higher prices and shortages of many familiar items." Maurice Greenberg, chairman of American International Group, said the United States ought to view its relationship with China "in a broader, strategic context and not have a single issue foreign policy." "Massive change is occurring in China, bringing with it improvements in living conditions for the Chinese people that would have been impossible to envision even a few years ago," Greenberg added. The business leaders urged Clinton to support continued U.S. trade with China by extending MFN and to devise a U.S. policy that de-links trade sanction and human rights.
