"To Africa." "So will you see Barmaley [a fictional character in children's poetry--a savage who lived in Africa]?" I did not venture to dispute this assumption. After all, it is known that the standard of awareness is equal to the standard of being informed. For my Sashok, Africa, according to Korney Chukovskiy, is so far associated with Aybolit and a gang of pirates, and for a representative of the older generation--at the very most, with the Days of Solidarity with the countries of the black continent which until recently were held at the highest state level. As is known, it is not easy to debunk established stereotypes, even now that the "information boom" has overcome us. It has been said: Those who want, hear. Consequently, at the very least, a desire is needed. The wish to give the myths their due and to evaluate present-day realities does not develop until later. "And the City Was Called Carthage...." For members of the first official delegation of Ukraine, the words of Guy de Maupassant--"In Tunisia, you find out for your yourself what history is"--materialized by way of unforgettable personal impressions, which confirmed the old truth: Seeing is believing.... The imperishable linkage of times is traced here through ancient monuments and traditions, folk customs and names. The palace residence of President of Tunisia Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, where he held negotiations with L. Kravchuk, has the official name of "Carthage," which is derived from the city-state of Carthage founded 3,000 years ago on the North African coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This is also the name of a hall in the national gallery--the Bardo museum, which stands beside the Chamber of Deputies (the Tunisian parliament) and in which the most unique and the largest collection of ancient mosaics in the world is kept. In particular, its exhibits include the only depiction of Virgil, the author of the Aeneid, surrounded by mythical goddesses. In that hall, I could not help recalling the lines from the Aeneid by I. Kotlyarevskyy, which I remembered from the time back in school: "Dido lived in the city,/ and the city was named Carthage...." To be sure, it is not known for certain where the "Ukrainized" Aeneas made landfall together with his company. However, as one of my colleagues joked, it is not ruled out that this happened at an old fort in the city of Hamamet, which our delegation visited. We did not meet there the modern descendants of the "energetic fellow"; however, the hosts in this resort town clearly could not complain about a shortage of visitors. Everything suggested that the favorable Mediterranean climate and the high standard of the local "recreation industry" lure there numerous tourists from all continents. As we learned later, every year almost 4 million people visit Tunisia, whose coastal zone stretches over 1,500 kilometers. They are the ones who "contribute" the lion's share of revenues to the state treasury. Thirty-Seven Years and Two Years It is best to learn about a so-far unknown country and its people through analogies and contrasts: On this point, they are the same as we are, and on that point, we are not similar. First of all, Ukraine and Tunisia share a similar historical lot, the main landmarks of which lie in the centuries of struggle for national liberation and the assertion of their own statehood. The Republic of Tunisia was proclaimed independent 37 years ago, and Ukraine--two years ago. Just as in our country, the parliament and the president will be up for election next year. However, the political and economic situation in Tunisia gives no grounds for conclusions concerning possible radical changes. Existing government structures have been fruitfully cooperating with the constructive opposition, the emergence of which they themselves facilitated with a view to the democratization of society. If nothing else, the fact that the ban on the Communist Party, which for a long time had been operating illegally, was lifted in Tunisia testifies to this. Evident favorable changes also occurred in the economy. Thanks to them and a balanced foreign policy, Tunisia is playing a leading role in cooperation between the states of northern Africa and southern Europe, and is respected in the Arab world and among the countries of the Maghreb. The headquarters of the Palestinian Liberation Organization is located here. In evaluating the results of his official visit to Tunisia at a press conference, L. Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine views relations with that country as one of the priority directions in its African policy. This is facilitated by the proximity of Tunisia to our borders, its economic potential, and the place it occupies in the Mediterranean region, at a juncture of European, African, and Asian routes. As we ascertained during the trip, the establishment of strong ties to the Republic of Tunisia has not only geopolitical but also promising economic significance for Ukraine. This is especially important at present, when our country is looking for partners in extensive, long-range cooperation. Experts believe that Ukraine may deliver to Tunisia products of the metallurgical industry, machine and instrument building, shipbuilding, and farm machinery. We were told that Ukrainian specialists in the field of water management construction have been working there fruitfully for a long time, and have already built many facilities. However, at the same time we also learned that for almost 30 years, they have been doing all this work within the framework of agreements between the former USSR and Tunisia. Therefore, the funds that they have earned so far have gone, in particular, to Russia and to maintain its embassy. V. Khorev, chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for Water Management, said: "The situation is now changing fundamentally. We have concluded an agreement on cooperation in this sector and established a program for joint work until the year 2010." Minister of Transportation O. Klympush signed, with his Tunisian opposite number, a government-to-government agreement on air transportation, which envisions the opening of air flights between the capitals of our countries, and also specifies flight rights through Tunisia to the countries of Africa and South America. The business circles of the two countries also came to an understanding, reaching an agreement on cooperation between the Union of Entrepreneurs and Merchants of Tunisia and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine. Its chairman, O. Mykhaylychenko, informed journalists that an exhibition of Tunisian goods will be held in Kiev as early as March of next year. Minister of Foreign Economic Relations of Ukraine A. Slepichev stressed: "Tunisia is one of the few partners of ours with which we have a positive balance of trade. Over nine months, exports from Ukraine exceeded imports from this country by almost $19 million. It is also noteworthy that the commercial and economic agreement between our countries envisions most-favored-nation treatment in partnership relations and the defense of investors of the two parties, and establishes forms of settlements both in freely convertible currencies and other forms of payment." The Goal Dictates Deadlines The great scope of industrial and civilian construction is one of the characteristic features of Tunisia. For example, a new city that is called here a "21st-century city" is being built in the vicinity of its capital, at the location of the drained lake Buhayrat. Although it does not have all that many new buildings, one tends to believe that it will be built on time. We also ascertained this during a visit to a new pharmaceutical plant in Tunis, which operates and continues to develop. The goal--to provide all necessary drugs for the country--dictates construction deadlines. There are things for us to learn from the Tunisians. Having rid themselves of economic dependence upon other countries, they do not sever mutually advantageous relations with them. It is precisely on the principle of such mutual interest that a textile combine in the city of Sousse operates. State-of-the-art equipment for it was delivered from many European countries, and cotton is delivered from various regions of Asia and Africa. Such examples are many. Therefore, the standard of living of Tunisians is much higher than in other African states. On the average, the income of each resident of the country comes to $1,600 a year. This is not a great deal, but, as the saying goes, there are other indicators, too. As they build a new country in Tunisia, Tunisians, by all signs, are well aware that they will not do without assistance from other states; hence the desire to cooperate with Ukraine. For example, at present more than 200 students from Tunisia study at our colleges. One of them, Qah La'wi Majid, a graduate of the Kiev Institute of Foreign Languages, accompanied us as a representative of the Tunisian Information Agency for international relations. He returned to the motherland two years ago with his wife, our fellow Ukrainian Olena Ustymenko. Their lot has been happier than that of the mythical Aeneas and the goddess Dido who founded Carthage. On the eve of our departure, Majid told us that an addition to his family is expected soon.... Good luck to them, young representatives of the two friendly peoples who have embarked on the path of independence and cooperation. FROM THE EDITORIAL OFFICE: We take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude for the hospitality and assistance given to journalists from Ukraine during their travel in the country by the staff of the Tunisian Information Agency for international relations. We hope that the experience of Tunisia, in particular of the Ministry of Information of that country in providing state support for the national press, will also become a subject of study and be borrowed by Ukraine.
