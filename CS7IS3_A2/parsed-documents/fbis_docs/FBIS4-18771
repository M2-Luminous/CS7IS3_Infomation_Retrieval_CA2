Will [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi be prime minister? [Bossi] Let us put it this way: we are talking. We imposed the federalist condition, because this is a special historical moment. Very soon, within six months, there may be a strong institutional change in the country. There is also the free market condition. We need an antitrust law to break up the duopoly which in the past controlled the country's economy. On the one hand there were the parties, and on the other hand a few big families which controlled capital and businesses with the support of the state. [Vespa] Let us talk about federalism. Could you renounce your idea of three large regions and adopt a softer approach? [Bossi] There is no doubt that federalism must be based on macroregions. Modern federalism must be based on regions which are homogenous from a social and economic point of view. However, the number of these macroregions can be discussed. [Vespa] What must Berlusconi the businessman get rid of to become prime minister? [Bossi] In America such an eventuality is regulated by the law. Whoever has such a powerful and prestigious post must hand over all his assets to a company which he or she cannot control. This should make it easier for the prime minister to make decisions on issues where there is a conflict of interest between the private and the public spheres. [Vespa] So, are you thinking of proposing that in Italy? [Bossi] Yes. [Vespa] Would Berlusconi then be allowed to become prime minister? [Bossi] Once the condition on federalism is accepted and a first step in the direction of an antitrust law is made, we would not be against it. [Vespa] Do you want a League member to be elected as speaker in the Chamber of Deputies or of the Senate? [Bossi] We want the Senate, because we have [Francesco] Speroni there. The personality and public image of any candidate for the post of speaker of the Senate must be taken into account as he would automatically be the deputy president of the republic.
