Our correspondent reports. [Unidentified correspondent] Today's Majles open session and the continuing debate on the bill for next year's national budget were addressed initially by Rouqani Zanjani, the head of the plan and budget organization. Emphasizing the need to reduce the country's budget dependency on oil income and to move toward other sources of income, he said: In drawing up next year's budget, the government has tried to provide for the greater part of the country's expenditure through tax incomes and to allocate oil income for development projects. Pointing out that the income obtained from the increase in fuel and energy prices must be used for oil related development projects, he stressed: If Note 25 of the budget bill is dropped the projects will come to a stop. Zanjani described the increase in fuel and energy prices to be within the context of implementing social justice and said: One of the reasons that progress is not taking place in industry and technology, in particular the production of vehicles, is the availability of cheap fuel in the country. The head of the plan and budget organization also said that the reduction in the budget's income ceiling was the cause for the stoppage of a number of development projects in the country and reminded the deputies that: In drawing up next year's national budget, the government has set aside many of the projects and has reduced the number of national development projects in comparison to projects in provinces. The oil minister also addressed the session on Note 25 of the budget bill, which concerns the increase in fuel and energy prices. He said: We are presently paying a 11,000 billion rial fuel subsidy and if this process continues and we fail to find a solution, we will have more problems in the next development plan. Speaking on the need to end the increase in fuel consumption, he said: In the second development plan we have looked into all possible solutions that could end consumption growth and we welcome any other solution that might reduce consumption. Referring to the view of the Majles joint commission -- on plan and budget, economic and financial affairs and cooperatives -- regarding the adjustment of fuel and energy prices, he said: If the commission's suggestion is approved we will have to set aside some 700 billion rials of development projects in the oil industry. He then referred to the negative effects of setting aside these projects. [Announcer] In the continuation of the Majles open session, Energy Minister Bijan Namdar-Zangeneh pointed out that the average monthly income for home consumers is 180 kilowatts [kw], but two thirds use less than 180 kw. According to a commission decision, the price increase will not effect consumption up to 500 kw, and 96.6 percent of consumers will not be effected; furthermore the price increase does not effect agricultural usage or 99 percent of hot regions, he said. He clarified that the electric energy price increase will effect less than one percent of the industry. Stating that an annual 2.1 trillion rial subsidy is being paid for electricity, the energy minister said: Social justice does not demand payment of such subsidies or more subsidy for bigger consumers. Zangeneh said the proposed increase in electricity rates would be spent on implementing projects for the oil industry and reminded the deputies that otherwise, many of the projects that are sources of employment will come to a stop. In today's open session, Mohammad Gharazi, the minister for post, telegraph, and telephone also spoke about the increase in the volume of activity in post and communications as well as improvement in service provided for the public. He said: You can rest assured that people will pay if you provide the various services for them. The country is an arena for development and people want progress. He emphasized: Movement must be such as to allow a change from subsidizing to permanent investment. The report by our correspondent indicates that following the 10-hour period allocated for speeches by deputies for and against, as well as explanations given by the joint commission and government representatives on the principles of next year's national budget bill, voting was held and the bill was approved in principle. As required by Majles regulations following the approval of the bill in principle, the review of proposals by Majles commissions and deputies regarding the budget incomes started. Today's open Majles session had a break at noon and deliberations on the proposals followed after the restart at 1400.
