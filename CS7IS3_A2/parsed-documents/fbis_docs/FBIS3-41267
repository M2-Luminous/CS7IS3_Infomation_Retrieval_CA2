(NAN/PANA) -- Another detained Nigerian national drug law enforcement agent, Audu Adams, has been released by the country's Miscellaneous Offences Tribunal. Tribunal chairman Justice Funmilayo Oni-Okpaku ordered the release Tuesday, in view of the appeal made by the director of public prosecution, Wonu Folami, that Adams never saw the drug exhibits till the day the tribunal went to inspect them. Folami also urged the tribunal to release the remaining 10 agents detained in order for them to continue investigations in the case. But the tribunal chairman declined to grant her request, saying that the officials were charged with interfering with the exhibit and, as such, would not be released, until evidence to the contrary was provided. On the continuous silence by Joe Brown Akubueze, the man who imported drugs into Nigeria, Justice Oni-Okpaku ruled that it was clear that the accused had no intention of securing a lawyer and was deliberately delaying the proceedings by refusing to speak up in court. In another development, one Oluyemi Abisayo, surety to socialite Jennifer Madike, was arrested Tuesday and brought to the tribunal because Madike, who was ordered to appear before the tribunal, could not be found. The tribunal ordered Abisayo to assist the police "in getting Jennifer" while the case was adjourned to 15 February.
