The current acting chairman of the Karabakh parliament, 30-year-old Karen Baburyan, signed the document. Our correspondent met with him in Stepanakert the other day.[end bold] [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Baburyan, you are one of the leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh republic, which is still not recognized by the world community. Is it possible, in your opinion, to consider Karabakh an independent state in a full sense. [Baburyan] You know, by right our republic has come halfway to being a state, for international organizations are already taking us into account, and they do not make one decision without our participation. And we do not intend to depart from this state of affairs under any conditions. It is important that Nagorno-Karabakh be recognized by the international community as a party in the conflict. You see in my office the main attributes of our independent statehood. In front of you is the state flag and the seal of the Nagorno-Karabakh republic. We have our own constitutional law, democratically elected higher organs of legislative authority, administrations, and a defense-capable army that performs as a guarantor of the security of our people. [Mkrtchyan] The process of a peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict, after the refusal of the Azerbaijani side to adopt the peaceful plans proposed by the CSCE and Russia, has come to an impasse. What dictates such an irreconcilable position of the Azerbaijani leadership? [Baburyan] The opportunism of the authorities. The Azerbaijani leaders, succeeding one another, tried to strengthen their positions and to demonstrate to political opponents their ability to resolve the Karabakh problem by military means. The NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] leadership adheres to the opinion concerning the need to bring the Russian settlement plan and the CSCE plan together. These initiatives differ little from each other in principle. However, the Russian plan has the advantage that it contains a mechanism for not renewing military operations, and it proposes the introduction of peacekeeping forces into the region. [Mkrtchyan] But why is Azerbaijan refusing military disengagement with the help of mediators? [Baburyan] The leader of that republic who succeeds in achieving a military preponderance will be guaranteed a high political rating. In addition, the current leadership of Azerbaijan needs not only to strengthen its superiority over the opposition, but also to establish itself in mutual relations with Turkey, which is not concealing its urge to help Azerbaijan resolve the question by forceful methods. Incidentally, I do not understand when it is said that Armenia is involved in the conflict, but Turkey is not. I think that if the signatures of representatives of the NKR and Armenia should appear on some kind of official document, then Turkey's signature should stand right next to Azerbaijan's signature. We in Karabakh possess a mass of evidence that citizens of Turkey are fighting on the side of Azerbaijan. [Mkrtchyan] How do you assess the position of Russia in the region, and how pragmatic is it? [Baburyan] Unfortunately, a clearly formulated Russian foreign policy has not existed for some time. I think that without its traditional geopolitical interests Russia will not be a power. These interests also apply to Nagorno-Karabakh, which was historically closely tied to Russia by hundreds of threads. Russia was always present in this zone, and she should not be indifferent to everything that is happening in the region. And, therefore, it is quite natural that Russia began to perform more actively as a peacekeeping force. The plan for the deployment of disengagement forces proposed by it is fully supported by the Karabakh leadership. However, the problem of the deployment of military contingents encounters the need to resolve a number of tasks; for example, purely financial. Incidentally, it is for this reason also that the NKR leadership is coming out in favor of combining the Russian plan and the CSCE plan, so that Russia would receive an international mandate to carry out a peacekeeping mission. [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Baburyan, what do you see as the resolution of the problem? [Baburyan] It is necessary to look further for compromise variants and to stop talking in the form of an ultimatum. We, the leaders of the NKR, were always for this. We have one principal condition--we must be assured real guarantees for the security of our people. The most effective way of achieving this, as I have already said, is the introduction of peacekeeping forces into the region.
