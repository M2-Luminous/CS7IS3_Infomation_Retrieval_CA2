In a report to Health Secretary Juan Flavier, the regional field health office in Region 12 said last January 1994, there were only three measles cases admitted to the Cotabato Regional Hospital compared to the 49 cases in 1993 in the same month. There was one measles case last February. Flavier attributed the 95 percent decrease in the admission of measles cases to the previous National Immunization Day (NID) programs held nationwide. The immunization coverage for measles in Region 12 -- Sultan Kudarat, Lanao del Norte, and North Cotabato -- is 91 percent. Also, the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) told Flavier the number of typhoid fever cases is rising in Sibobo, Calabanga, and Camarines Sur. A team sent to the province last 1 February told Flavier that there were 34 identified cases in the area. The victims, whose ages range from 4 to 64, got sick after drinking contaminated water from a shallow well. Flavier said 90 percent of children aged 12 to 59 months in the country got high-dose Vitamin A capsules during the nutrition service of the DOH dubbed "Araw ng Sangkap Pinoy [Day of Philippine Constituent]" last 16 October. About 86 percent of pregnant women nationwide got iodized oil during the same health program.
