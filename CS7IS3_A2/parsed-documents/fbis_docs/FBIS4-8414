Our correspondent Mu'awiyah Yasin asked Haris Silajdzic about his government's reaction to the NATO action against the Serbs. [Silajdzic] We can get a good action but, in my opinion at least, they are being too cautious and I am afraid that they would interpret this hesitation as another green light and that a different action, a decisive action, would be much more productive. [Yasin] If the Serbs continue to shell the city [Gorazde], what action do you expect to see? [Silajdzic] They have been hit twice but only two, as I understood, two tanks or at most three tanks were destroyed, not enough to send a very strong message. That is a problem. I am afraid if the Serbs practically make a draw, manage a draw with the United Nations and NATO, in this case I think they will be encouraged to do many other things in Bosnia and there will be only one thing left to ask [words indistinct] to lift the arms embargo for Bosnia and let us defend our country and that has been, as you know, denied to us. To tell you the truth, we have many soldiers that killed [as heard] more than 10 Serbian tanks there and they are not very impressed with the results. [Yasin] We know that Russia is earnestly seeking to persuade the UN Security Council to halt NATO's attacks against the Serbian positions. Is Bosnia-Herzegovina expected to launch a campaign to resist these Russian efforts? [Silajdzic] Well, we do not have that leverage. We actually expected this action; just like in the case of Sarajevo they came in at the last minute and actually made a big diplomatic point here. They will do the same round Gorazde and they will look like a big and important player there. They are an important player but it is true that they let Serbs attack civilian areas, safe areas, and the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] for almost 15 days without any action. Now when the United Nations and NATO have acted, they want to be consulted, they want to be an equal player. This is what they are going to achieve, unfortunately.
