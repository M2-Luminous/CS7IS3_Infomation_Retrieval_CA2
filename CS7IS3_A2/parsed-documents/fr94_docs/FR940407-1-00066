SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice amends a notice of public hearings that appeared in the Federal Register on March 31, 1994 (59 FR 15151), by adding an additional public hearing and soliciting public comments at all hearings on draft Amendment 10 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico. Draft Amendment 10 will include the following management measures: (1) A change in the cutoff date from November 19, 1992, to February 7, 1994, to qualify for a fish trap endorsement during the current 3-year trap moratorium. This change would allow a fish trap endorsement on a reef fish permit, which is required to use fish traps, to be issued or renewed by NMFS for a current owner of a permitted vessel who has a record of reef fish landings from fish traps in the Gulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone between 1991 and 1994 as reported on vessel logbooks received by NMFS on or before February 7, 1994; and (2) establishment of a Council appeals board, the members of which would recommend to the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, whether additional endorsements should be issued based on demonstrated financial hardship related to trap fishing or based on an incapacitating illness between November 19, 1992, and February 7, 1994. All other information, as contained in the notice of public hearings published March 31, 1994, remains the same. Dated: April 4, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8385 Filed 4&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
