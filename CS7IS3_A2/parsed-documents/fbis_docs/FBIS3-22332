Although there is no nuclear fuel aboard the submarine, it is equipped with nuclear reactors. As a result, there are fears about the danger of radiation pollution in the surrounding seas. According to information given to NHK by concerned people in Moscow and Vladivostok, it is a November-class retired nuclear submarine, which was commissioned during the 1960's and belongs to the Russian Pacific Fleet. In mid-February the submarine sunk in water three meters deep near a wharf, where it was anchored, at a ship-repair yard in Tajima Bay [as heard], which is located in eastern part of Vladivostok. The site of the accident is now covered with thick ice. All that is visible of the submarine is its conning tower. The submarine is supported all round by ice so there is currently no danger of it tipping sideways. There is no nuclear fuel aboard the aging submarine, which was waiting to be scrapped. However, it is still equipped with two nuclear reactors. As a result, concerned people say there is a danger the surrounding seas may become polluted with radiation when the ice starts to melt and the submarine tips sideways allowing water to enter the reactors. Eight years ago there was an accident, dubbed Chernobyl, in Tajima Bay in the Maritime Kray in which a submarine sank and a large quantity of radiation leaked. There was reportedly an explosion in one of the nuclear submarine's reactors during work to replace nuclear fuel rods.
