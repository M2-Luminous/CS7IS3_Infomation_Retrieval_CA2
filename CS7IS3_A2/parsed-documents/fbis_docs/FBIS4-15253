Now They Only Have To Find the Fools"] [Text] Some citizens think in vain that they can escape the consequences of the deputies' activity in their homes. The State Duma has already decided on a master plan to stir the Fatherland. A law has been drafted whereby the deputies and their brothers from the upper chamber of parliament can stay on TV screens practically for an unlimited time. This draft can satisfy the most fastidious deputies' tastes. For instance, it forbids news programs (ITA, Vesti, Inform-TV) to comment on events that have happened in the upper echelons of power. News bulletins, regardless of their duration, must contain information about absolutely all developments in the three branches of state power (Articles 6 and 7). But this is not all: Article 9 defines who a news or other (!) program journalist may interview, as well as the minimum length of a parliamentary report in TV news broadcasts. Yet this part of the brilliant document contains one obvious slip: It does not specify which questions journalists may put to their interlocutors. The draft contains numerous absurdities; for instance, presidential statements may be broadcast only with the permission of unspecified "federal power bodies" (Article 6, Section 2), while the responsibility for disseminating statements by top statesmen is imposed on journalists. Although experience shows that this process rather depends on the mood of communication workers, power supply operators, and so forth. If the draft comprised only the above, it could be taken for a toast because its main essence boils down to the fact that journalists must provide still better coverage of what they are covering already. Nonetheless, the draft includes two more types of articles. The press must be delighted with the provisions of Article 4, Section 1, promising to wrest ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA from Viktor Chernomyrdin's control and launch them along the waves of the free market. In addition, the draft promises that no officials will be exerting pressure on correspondents, and audio and video recordings may be made wherever permitted by accreditation rules. The president, by the authors' logic, should gratefully support the draft because the deputies, in corresponding articles, make believe that they are equally concerned about all the branches of power. A careful comparison of the "powers," however, fatefully proves to be not in favor of the head of state. Under the draft, acts of amnesty adopted by the lower chamber of parliament or laws passed by both chambers are subject to immediate promulgation. As for the president's signing a federal law (whereupon a legislative act comes into force), an edict, or an act of pardon, or presentation of Russian Federation state awards, and so forth, this should not be announced to the citizens. Incidentally, the same kind of treatment has been meted out to the judicial branch. To top it all: even the mention of the president has been expunged from an article on obligatory analytical programs which, by the way, are to be inserted into the broadcasting schedule only at the discretion of the parliamentary press service. But this must be for considerations of economy. And finally, yet another peculiarity. The draft speaks in detail about the various types of regular programs on Ostankino, Russian, and St. Petersburg TV in which deputies will appear in groups or alone. These articles provide for everything except the source of financing and, most important, the total air time limit that the deputies may claim without cost.
