Shehu Musa Yar'adua was freed on Wednesday [16 February], but a suit against his detention is going ahead in a Kaduna high court in northern Nigeria. Yar'adua, who was number two in the 1976-79 military government of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, was arrested last weekend in his home town of Kaduna, on his return from a foreign trip. There has not been any official statement on his detention, believed to be connected with his press conference 12 January in Lagos, asking the Gen. Sani Abacha government to hand over power by December this year. In a veiled reference to that press conference, the police in Lagos on 13 January, warned politicians against making "inflammatory" statements. A Kaduna high court began hearing the case against the government on Wednesday apparently unaware of the general's release. Yar'adua's lawyer called the detention "unlawful, illegal and unconstitutional." Judge Yemi Ibiyeye had refused to grant bail to Yar'adua saying it would amount to injustice to release him on bail without hearing from the government. The judge ordered the government to be served with a motion on notice and fixed hearing of the case for 28 February. It was unclear what would become of the case. Yar'adua, pressed for comments by journalists on Wednesday, said he would issue a press statement soon. His arrest had provoked condemnation by human rights and pro-democracy groups.
