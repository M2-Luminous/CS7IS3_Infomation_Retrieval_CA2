FR941227-1-00027 FR941227-1-00007 (a) Should ``contractors'' and ``volunteers'' in safety-sensitive positions be reported separately from ``workers on duty''? (b) Should a separate classification for ``employees'' remain? (c) A ``contractor'' is currently a separate classification for reporting purposes. If FRA should decide to delete the proposed ``worker on duty'' classification, should ``volunteer'' be added as a separate classification? (d) How would ``hours worked'' be calculated for contractors and volunteers involved in safety-sensitive functions? Should these hours be listed separately? 2. ``Establishment'' and ``Posted'' As proposed in the NPRM, an ``establishment'' would be defined as a single physical location where business is conducted or where services or operations are performed, for example, an operating division, general office, and major installation, such as a locomotive or care repair or construction facility. FRA also proposed in ยง225.25(e) that each railroad ``post'' a listing of all reported injuries and illnesses for the previous month at each ``establishment.'' (a) If FRA determines that the proposed ``posting'' requirement is in fact necessary, how would you redefine ``establishment'' such that any burden to the railroad is minimized? (b) Should each railroad be required to identify a ``recordkeeping establishment''? (c) Should the proposed list of definitions include one for ``posted''? Should that definition encompass ``electronic posting,'' wherein railroad workers may view accident and injury logs via computer? Where computers are not available at establishments, manual posting would remain a requirement. Please comment. 3. ``Qualified Health Care Professional'' and ``Medical Treatment'' As proposed, a ``qualified health care professional'' is defined as a health care professional operating within the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification. For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to diagnose a case of noise-induced hearing loss and to identify potential causal factors, but may not be qualified to diagnose a case of silicosis. (a) Should the definition be narrowed so as to include only people with a medical degree, i.e., an M.D.? Should the definition be expanded to include additional individuals ( e.g., physical therapists) as qualified health care professionals? (b) Should a railroad's employee assistance officer (EAP) be considered a ``qualified health care professional'' when he or she provides counseling to an employee who has experienced traumatic stress from involvement in a serious or fatal accident? As proposed, ``medical treatment'' would include any medical care or treatment beyond ``first aid'' regardless of who provides such treatment. Medical treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and drawing blood samples.
