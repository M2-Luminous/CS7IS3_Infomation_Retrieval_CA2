Qian Qichen and Kakizawa exchanged views on bilateral relations and on the issue of the Korean peninsula's nuclear problem. Foreign Minister Kakizawa briefed Qian Qichen on Japan's views concerning the current situation. Qian Qichen pointed out concerning the Korean peninsula's nuclear issue that the Chinese Government has always persisted in the basic goals of promoting a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and of maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula. Because these two goals are in accord with the fundamental interests of all the countries of Northeast Asia, they should become the basic starting point for seeking a proper solution to the current problem. Qian Qichen pointed out that China is greatly concerned about the serious difficulties surrounding the Korean peninsula's nuclear issue. We regret the action taken by the International Atomic Energy Agency on 10 June to temporarily halt technical assistance to [North] Korea and the consequences resulting from that action. When faced with difficulties, it is particularly necessary for the parties concerned to maintain calm and to exercise restraint, not to simply close the door to dialogue, and to do everything possible to leave room to maneuver and to maintain the possibility of solving this problem through dialogue. Sanctions will not help to solve problems and can only sharpen contradictions and might lead to consequences that no one wants to see. We call on the parties concerned to try their best to start up the dialogue, to alleviate the contradictions, and to seek ways for a proper solution to the problem.
