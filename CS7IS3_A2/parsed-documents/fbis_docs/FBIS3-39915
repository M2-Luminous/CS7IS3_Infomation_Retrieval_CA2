[van Mierlo] Radicalism is now in vogue. A determined face, and in with the knife. However, I do not believe in that approach. Furthermore, it must tally with the rest of the party's visiting card. I feel strongly about that: Consistency in one's attitude, and in one's presentation -- being reasonable. I know that other parties are not bothered about this, but that is precisely the difference between us. I am governed by my opinions, not by the desire to win 35 seats. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] And yet you, yourself, give rise to expectations, for example by reproaching the cabinet for making drastic cuts in allowances and administrative blundering in your party publication. That gives rise to the expectation that you can do better. Will D66 stick to its approach of lesser allowances? Can you promise that you will not make any cuts? [van Mierlo] For three years the government has not listened to us. The only thing it has done is make cuts -- in everyone's budget, but nas not solved the budget problem. Now it is too late. We are sparing old age pensions, but linking the other allowances to wage movements by 50 percent. In so doing, we have opted for a respectable path. The PvdA [Labor Party] is suggesting that full linkage is possible, but there is no way in which that is true. Freezing levels for the next four years, as proposed by the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], is unfair psychologically, because doing so would mean excluding an entire category in advance, for the next four year, from any possible growth in prosperity. We are offering those people receiving an allowance the prospect of being able to "half-grow" with the economy. However, that approach may also be superseded. I cannot give any guarantees. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Your party congress wants the Betuwe [railroad] line to be laid underground, or at least dug into the landscape, which would cost an extra four to five billion guilders. A ticklish issue in the coalition formation? [van Mierlo] The congress supports the party, but the party lost the debate in the Chamber. We are doing our best. We will fight terribly hard for this. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] One of your members, Rinnooy Kan, president of the employers' federation, sees nothing to be gained by the energy tax, for which D66 is making such a strong pitch. How eligible is he for a ministerial post? [van Mierlo] I am not talking about ministerial posts. Rinnooy Kan speaks as a representative of the employers' lobby, and those are clear views. He is an excellent party colleague. I know damned well that the opinions he is expressing when he says that are those of the employers. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] And yet surely he cannot have completely different opinions on, say, energy tax as the D66 minister for economic affairs? [van Mierlo] I do not know. I have a difference of opinion with employers' president Rinnooy Kan, not with D66 member Rinnooy Kan. Very soon there will be a coalition agreement, and every future minister will have to comply with that agreement. Otherwise he will not become a minister. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] D66 is staking a great deal in the campaign on the referendum. However, does Jan Modaal not merely want to be able to walk safely down a clean street with a reasonably full purse? [van Mierlo] Yes, that is what the rest of the platform is about. However, we consider the referendum to be just as important. A little more power to the citizens, and a little less to the politicians. If the citizens really do not want a particular law, then you give them the chance to pull on the hand brake. That is of a different political order than the energy tax or the fight against crime. People are supporting us on that. I also would consider it to be treason retrospectively to drop the matter after 25 years. It constitutes part of the identity of the party. If we were to drop it, then we would have been better off never having gotten started in the first place. One has a moral duty to make a go of it. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] If the CDA and PvdA were shortly to suffer great losses, and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and D66 made tremendous gains, who would then take the lead when it came to forming a cabinet? [van Mierlo] One guideline is the size of the party, another is who has won the most seats. Mostly it is a cocktail of the two. There is no law about it. I believe the most important criterion is which party is the largest. And of course, to soem extent, parties also look after their own interests. It is not merely the quantitative aspect that is important, but also the qualitative aspect -- how people emerge from a campaign. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] You stick with your preference for a purple coalition? [van Mierlo] As long as you do not write that I raised the subject! [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] But could VVD and D66 ever agree? [van Mierlo] I would be the last person to say that compromises are inconceivable with certain parties. And I am not doing so now, although I will admit there is a large gap between the VVD and D66 -- apart from on a few points. The VVD has radical views, but I must still see that it keeps going, in whatever coalition there may be. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] So purple has precedence? [van Mierlo] I continue to believe that a purple coalition would be structurally good for the Netherlands. The question is whether the PvdA and VVD can wriggle out of their traditional attitude. [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Could you become a minister in such a cabinet and also remain a political leader? [van Mierlo] Everything is conceivable, up to and including a party leadership. I think the most plausible scenario, also for our citizens, is one in which I join the cabinet in one capacity or other, but I am not ruling out anything.
