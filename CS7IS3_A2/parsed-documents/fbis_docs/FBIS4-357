FBIS4-357 "drafr068_a_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Commander Interviewed RPF Commander Interviewed AB0704185694 London BBC World Service in English 1515 GMT 7 Apr 94 AB0704185694 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Excerpts] Two countries -- Rwanda and Burundi -- are today stunned by the death of their presidents. The plane they were traveling in from a summit in Dar es Salam crashed at Kigali Airport. There were strong reports that it was shot down. President Habyarimana of Rwanda and President Cyprien Ntaryamira and the other passengers and crew were all killed. [passage omitted] Well, if the presidential plane was shot down, then almost certainly an accusing finger will be pointed by some quarters at the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. They fought President Habyarimana's government during the civil war, they are still armed, and don't see eye to eye with the government over the implementation procedures. Timothy Ecort asked RPF Commander Major General Paul Kagame if his men had shot down the plane: [Begin recording] [Kagame] No, no. To the best of my knowledge, they didn't. The RPF batallion in Kigali is guarded by the UN force and the shooting couldn't have come from that batallion and we have nothing to do with that incident at all. [Ecort] You are quite certain about that? [Kagame] Yes, I am sure. If I wasn't I should let you know. [Ecort] Do you have any clues as to what happened to the airoplane? [Kagame] Nothing at all. Not at all. But... [pauses] well, I am not very surprised given the situation we have had in this country for quite some time, where everybody has access to all types of weapons and with the chaos that has been going on in the country, I am not very surprised. Anybody could do that kind of job. [Ecort] Are you shocked? [Kagame] Well, I am just aggrieved. I am not shocked. I have heard of such a thing happening elsewhere, the kind of business we have been engaged in is that of war, so I am not very shocked. Such a thing can happen but it is unfortunate. [Ecort] But you are not supposed to be at war at the moment, aren't you? Aren't you supposed to be negotiating with the government? [Kagame] Yes, that is correct. We are not supposed to be at war. In fact, we are not even supposed to be negotiating. I think negotiations were also over long ago. We are supposed to implement what were agreed on in those negotiations. [Ecort] That is what I mean. You said these things happen when you have chaos in the country, but you are saying this thing is not related to the problems you are having in reaching an agreement with the government. [Kagame] I am saying... [pauses] the incident is certainly related to the political chaos going on in the country and there are so many parties to that problem. So, I am only imagining that could be a result of that situation we have been in for quite some time after the negotiations at a time when we should be implementing what we have agreed on in those negotiations. [Ecort] What do you think this will do to the situation inside Rwanda now? [Kagame] Well, I always imagine this may create some problems. I always imagine that people who may come up with all sorts of courses of action. So, we are just waiting to see what happens. But on our part, we think it is an unfortunate incident, but everybody should try and keep on the track on the peace process. [Ecort] Do you fear that chaos will break out again? [Kagame] Well, there is a possibility. [passage omitted]
