We spoke about some reasons and certain interesting cases with Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna. [Kotian] What are the main reasons for the growing crime rate, in your opinion? Is the weakness of the new state a reason for that? [Tuchyna] We need to look at several sides to this problem. The high crime rate is not only a Slovak problem; it is a common phenomenon today in advanced, postcommunist, or totalitarian countries. We are distinguishing four main reasons for the growth of the crime rate--socioeconomic, legislative, international, and personal. After we introduced the market economy, many people became uneasy because they lost social guarantees and did not know how to tackle the new situation. On the other hand, other people are abusing this situation. Many legal standards at present overlap--the new ones and the socialist ones. Many are imperfect because they have been drafted in haste. The people should know the law, but they often do not know it at all. We are building a law-abiding society, but we have a disparity here between people's awareness [of the law] and their actions. From the international viewpoint, I would like to stress that Slovakia is facing a new situation, where migration is going hand in hand with the internationalization of crime. This is a very serious problem and should be solved at all levels, not only at the level of the Interior Ministry and the police. We have to search for a solution and not only in the socioeconomic sphere and the material security of the people. We also have to complete our legal system and establish the legal awareness of the people, which is a long-term affair. The Interior Ministry is much engaged in international cooperation. The perfection of the school system, family activity, churches, and social organizations have positive influence on the development of personality. Unfortunately, we did not manage to introduce into our schools lessons on crime, drugs, and their impact on human personality. [passage omitted] [Kotian] What is the situation with the readmission treaties? Do you know how many refugees have been returned from the Czech Republic? [Tuchyna] This era is one of movement of nations. Last year, some 40 million people went through Slovak territory. More than 10 million transportation vehicles were checked in. A total of 1,041 people were apprehended when on their way in, and 1,140 on their way out. A total of 2,422 people were apprehended because of falsifying or tampering with travel documents. A total of 82,600 people were returned because of flaws in travel documents. This is why the international norms and readmission treaties are important to us. We have concluded such treaties with practically every country except Hungary. We want to conclude a standard international treaty with them, as with all other countries. We cannot conclude a treaty on the readmission of only Hungarian citizens, which is what they would like. [passage omitted]
