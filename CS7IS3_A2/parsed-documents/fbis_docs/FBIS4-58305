President al-Bashir announced the government's commitment to transport and settle them in their areas, and to support them with agricultural equipment, seeds, and everything necessary for their agricultural activities. He said that the government will remain committed to providing them with food until their harvest is ready. He also announced that the government will extend health services, increase the supply of medicine, open schools, and provide teachers to the villages of those who return. President al-Bashir called on the citizens of the Nubah Mountains to rebuild their places of worship, in all their different denominations. The president had earlier addressed tens of thousands of the inhabitants of the Nubah Mountains. They had gathered at the al- Hilal Stadium in Omdurman to express their support for and allegiance to President al-Bashir and his government for granting them a state of their own, within the framework of the federal system announced in Sudan. Their new state is called South Kordofan, and like all the other newly established Sudanese states, it has a governor, a ministerial council for the administration of executive duties, and a mini- parliament to keep watch on the government and its performance, and to enforce the necessary laws. The inhabitants of the Nubah Mountains, in their speech made at the meeting, paid tribute to the government of the national salvation. They declared their support for the revolution and its orientation, and said that they will reconstruct their areas and make them peaceful and productive. They also declared support for peace and the government's endeavors to establish peace. The Nubah Mountains were part of the state of Kordofan, which was subdivided into three states within the federal government framework: South Kordofan, which covers all the areas of the Nubah Mountains, North Kordofan, and West Kordofan.
