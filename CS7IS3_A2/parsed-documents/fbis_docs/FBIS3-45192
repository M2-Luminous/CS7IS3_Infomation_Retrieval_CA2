For years the provincial CPC committee and the government have conscientiously implemented the policy of making education the foundation and invigorating Yunnan through application of scientific and technological advances. Year after year, the province's treasury has set aside sufficient funds for teachers' pay and has steadily increased spending on education. However, from time to time last year, reports were heard that some localities diverted funds for teachers' pay to other projects, thereby being unable to pay wages on schedule or issuing IOUs in lieu of cash payments. Upon learning of this situation, Governor He Zhiqiang specifically pointed out: No matter how tight our finances are, we must not let schools and teachers bear the brunt of the consequences. He instructed localities to take immediate action to settle back pay for teachers. Thanks to the efforts of authorities at all levels, outstanding pay for teachers has been all paid up.
