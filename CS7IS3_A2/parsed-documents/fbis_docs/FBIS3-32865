The president questioned the legal status of the court's members as Samuel Belletini, the president of the National Congress, "swore in" Gonzalo Machado, the government representative at the TGC, as the court's chief justice. In addition to declaring the price hike unconstitutional, the TGC ordered the suspension of all other effects of the presidential decree, stating that the increase "could be very detrimental to the country's future." Duran-Ballen said that the previous Rodrigo Borja administration (1988-92) appointed Machado as a nonvoting member of the TGC and, as such, he cannot very well represent the current administration. He also questioned the authority of the other TGC members, whose terms were extended in light of differences prevailing in Congress regarding the appointment of new members. Duran-Ballen said, "Belletini made an arbitrary decision by installing a presidential representative I did not appoint." He announced that Attorney General Carlos Larreategui [name and title as received] will appeal the decision before the Constitutionality Court of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to constitutional reforms approved in 1993, the Constitutionality Court can ratify or overturn TGC decisions, which were previously indisputable. The president recalled that the TGC itself previously had not accepted Machado because he did not meet the court's age requirements. Of the 11 nonvoting TGC members, six met to discuss the issue and five voted in favor of the unconstitutionality of the decree. The order triggered demonstrations that are threatening to continue if the government upholds the validity of the price hike that has increased the cost of living for the Ecuadoran people. According to recent reforms made to the laws governing hydrocarbons, the president has the authority to set the price of oil products in Ecuador, which was a member of OPEC up until last year. The oil industry produced 40 percent of the government's budget, and the drop in the price of oil on the international market created a controversial deficit. The government tried to cover the deficit by passing new tax laws, which the Congress rejected, and then decided to raise the price of gasoline. Contrary to the trend in other countries, the Ecuadoran Government said if the price of crude goes up on the international market, the price of gasoline may go down.
