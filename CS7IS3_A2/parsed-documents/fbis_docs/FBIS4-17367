He explained that the credit would be used to back the budget through noninflationary means, modernize, and raise the competitiveness of industry and agriculture. Aleksandr Shokhin noted that the IMF decision was important for Russia also because it paved the way for the speediest end of the talks with official creditors on the repayment of Russia's foreign debts in the current year. This decision offers an opportunity for talks with the IMF over a new credit of $4 billion. According to the Russian vice premier, Russia has normal relations with all international organizations, as well as the group of the world's seven most industrially developed countries. Mr. Shokhin believes that the main thing for today is to create a favorable climate for foreign investments. He says he thinks that a system of guarantees should be developed but not at the expense of the federal budget or government. Guarantees shall be created at a joint projects level. The schemes of mortgage guarantees and guarantees of a stable tax regime throughout the implementation of each investment project should be used. Such favorable conditions for foreign investors will enable Russia to handle the problem of recession more effectively than money borrowing. Speaking about Russia's participation in the forthcoming meeting of the IMF and the World Bank Board of Governors due in Washington on 22 to 27 April, Aleksandr Shokhin said Russia planned to launch a number of new initiatives aimed at further developing equal and mutual advantageous credit and financial cooperation. He expressed hope that they would be approved just like a previous Russian proposal to establish special credit programs for countries with a transitional economy. Russia has already obtained $3 billion in credits for structural economic changes within the framework of this program.
