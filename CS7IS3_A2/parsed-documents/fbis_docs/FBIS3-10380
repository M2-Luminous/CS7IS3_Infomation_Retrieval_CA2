Lacayo also announced the beginning of a "diplomatic offensive" whereby economic cabinet ministers will travel to the United States and Europe to "lobby several people who are politically willing" to help us sign the agreement with the IMF. "We want to sign it because we know that the flow of money for the agricultural cycle and the public investment programs depends on that agreement. However, the IMF has been very strict and unrelenting with us," the government official stated. The ministers of the presidency, economy, construction, and FISE [Emergency Fund For Social Investments] appeared before the Nicaraguan Construction Chamber to present the Public Investments Program for 1994. They said 75 percent of the program depends on the signing of the agreement with the IMF. The Public Investments Program allocates 1.476 billion cordobas for 133 projects. A total of 74 percent of the projects worth 1.087 billion cordobas are dependent upon foreign financing and are subject to the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]. The agreement with the IMF is considered to be a sort of "audit" by the international financial organizations to allow the flow of at least $266 million to Nicaragua under the World Bank's so-called "Economic Recovery Credit II." According to the government's estimates, the funds assigned to the Public Investments Program will prompt the construction industry to grow 25 percent -- in addition to its ripple effect on the economy -- and generate 40,000 permanent jobs in 1994. Approximately 56 percent of the program or 825 million cordobas would be allocated for the reactivation and modernization of the country's economic infrastructure; 26 percent or 338 million for the rehabilitation of basic social services; 19 percent or 282 million for the export support infrastructure; and 2 percent to strengthen the central government's administration. Ministers to Apply Pressure As part of the "diplomatic offensive" mentioned by Lacayo, Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger traveled to Paris and London this Wednesday to meet with influential world banking leaders. Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, and Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada left for New York and Washington yesterday, where they expect to meet with IMF President Michel Camdessus. "Our main argument is that Nicaragua should have a special status. We have found in most countries a willingness to favor us. However, we will not see the same attitude among international organizations because they have their standards and deal with economic problems by dissociating themselves from social or political problems," Lacayo said yesterday. He added that the government will attempt to make these organizations see that it is not only a matter of correcting the economy but of ensuring peace and the democratic system. "We hope we can enter the final stretch of the signing of the agreements with this diplomatic offensive," he observed.
