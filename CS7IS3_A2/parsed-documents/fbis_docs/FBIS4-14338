The Islamic Republic has "always condemned terrorism and never supported such activities in anyway," he told a press conference after holding talks with Foreign Office Minister, Douglas Hogg. Ansari's said London's allegations were to divert public opinion from Bosnia, ahead of his participation in an Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) group meeting with Hogg, which included seven other senior diplomats from Muslim countries. The Iranian charge d'affaires was asked to attend the Foreign Office just prior to his participation in the OIC meeting, which criticized the United Nation's indifference to the Bosnian crisis. However, on his arrival, he found the Foreign Office minister claiming that he was "summoned." Political analysts were both mystified and surprised at Britain provoking a fresh dispute with Islamic Iran. The BBC suggested that it could undermine the already fragile relations between the two countries. A delegation of London parliamentarians had been hoping this week to make its first trip to Tehran since the Islamic revolution in a move to repair relations, which had been approved by Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd. Other opinions suggested the smear campaign may be a cover for the failure of Britain's peace initiative in Northern Ireland, which appears to have recently ended in deadlock.
