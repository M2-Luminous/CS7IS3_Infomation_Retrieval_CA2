I. Introduction In June 1994, the Commission published for comment proposed new Exchange Act Rule 3a12&hyph;11 and certain revisions to current Exchange Act rules (``Proposing Release''). 6 The proposals were designed to reduce existing regulatory distinctions between debt securities listed on a national securities exchange and those traded in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market by exempting listed debt securities from restrictions on borrowing 7 and proxy and information statement regulation. 8 The Commission also proposed to simplify registration procedures under the Exchange Act for listed debt securities. Finally, comment was solicited as to whether it would be advisable to extend reporting requirements to issuers of debt securities that are traded in the OTC market under certain circumstances where the issuer is not otherwise subject to periodic reporting requirements. 6 Release No. 34&hyph;34139 (June 1, 1994) [59 FR 29398]. 7 Section 8(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78h(a)]. 8 Section 14(a), (b), and (c) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78n(a), (b), and (c)]. The Commission received 27 letters of comment from a variety of professional associations, securities firms, corporations and self-regulatory organizations. 9 Most commenters supported the proposed exemptive relief and the simplified Exchange Act registration procedures. In addition, most commenters supported, or agreed that consideration should be given to, the extension of periodic reporting requirements to debt issuers in certain circumstances. The issue of extending periodic reporting is still under consideration by the Commission; the proposed rule and amendments are being adopted as proposed, except for minor changes as discussed below. 9 The comment letters as well as the comment summary prepared by the staff are available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room ( see File No. S7&hyph;16&hyph;94).
