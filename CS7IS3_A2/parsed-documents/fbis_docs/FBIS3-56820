He said that although he is regarded as an enemy in Georgia, his stance is the same as that of the Russian president and defense minister -- the territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia. As for the political status of so-called South Ossetia, it is an internal affair of Georgia. To verify this information, we turned to Giorgiy Karkarashvili, defense minister of the Republic of Georgia. He said that he does not possess such information. As for General Kondratyev, nobody in Georgia regards him as an enemy, the minister pointed out, adding that during the first talks on the conflict in Abkhazia General Kondratyev had a rather objective and sensible stance.
