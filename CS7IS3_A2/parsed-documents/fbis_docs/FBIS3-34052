Jerusalem is considering asking the Americans to increase the amount that can be included in the state budget to be used for investments in infrastructure and to fund the internal debt. Within the framework of the loan guarantees agreement, Israel can use only $600 million annually for those purposes -- less than one third of the annual quota. The Americans imposed restrictions on the use of the loan guarantees in order to make sure that they are not invested in the territories and do not fund current expenditures and a rise in the standard of living. [passage omitted] The request to change the clauses in the agreement will most likely be raised in the next session of the Israeli-U.S. Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG) in Washington in March. Sources in the Treasury said that U.S. officials are aware of the problem created by the restrictions imposed on the use of the funds and even support amending the agreement. [passage omitted] Another option being considered is to ask the Americans to be able to use some of the loan guarantees to convert short-term foreign debts with long-term debts thereby improving Israel's foreign debt situation.
