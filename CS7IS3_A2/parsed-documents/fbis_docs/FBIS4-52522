At an audience with the representatives of the losing parties in the general elections and the Muslim and the Chinese communities in Phnom Penh on 7 May, the king rejected an allegation made by some that "leaders of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] are corrupt, while the Khmer Rouge [KR] are good." "The revenue acquired by the Khmer Rouge from the sale of precious stones and logs has not been used to serve the people at all," said the king, adding that money pocketed by the group has not been spent to build schools, bridges, roads, monasteries, but to purchase arms and ammunition. "Besides, nonscientific exploitation of the precious stones in Pailin accorded by the Khmer Rouge to foreign entrepreneurs has led to the pollution of the Sangke river and a large part of the Tonle Sap lake," said the king, who also denounced the perfidious maneuvers of the Khmer Rouge, who massacres its own people under the pretext of attacking Vietnam. His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk calls for an end to the confrontation between the Khmer Rouge and other Cambodians to promote a climate of mutual comprehension, thereby achieving national reconciliation. The king underlined that the internal conflict only benefits neighboring countries. He called on all Cambodians to accept a roundtable meeting or new general elections.
