At the same time it has been shelling residential areas in the quarters of al-Shaykh Uthman, al-Mansurah and Dar Sa'd since this morning. Innocent citizens are being killed and wounded. The Sanaa regime is also shelling vital installations such as the desalination plant, the power station, the fire station, and the refinery. The Sanaa regime is wrong in believing that its killing of citizens and destruction of homes and vital installations will weaken the morale of the sons of our people and force them to prostrate themselves before occupation and humiliation. The sons of our people prefer to die bravely in defense of their homeland and the protection of their women's honor than to prostrate and humble themselves before a regime which does not believe in ideals and does not respect people. It is a regime which is not interested in law or legitimacy whether religious, Arab, or international. In the name of the Democratic Republic of Yemen we announce to the fraternal Arab countries and the international community that the Sanaa regime will not uphold any pledge or commitment it makes to them. It aims to occupy, destroy, loot, pillage and dishonor. Diplomatic advice is achieving nothing except to give more time to the Sanaa regime to continue with its attempts at malicious destruction of our people and Aden, in particular. For this reason we wish to stress what we said in our previous appeal, and the need to take deterrent measures to compel the Sanaa regime to heed the resolutions of the international community and respect human rights. As for our people, they will not submit, and will resist the aggressors with all the strength available to them. God is with us and those who do wrong should know what kind of end they will suffer.
