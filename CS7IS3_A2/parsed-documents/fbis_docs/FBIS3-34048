Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that the three have announced, however, that Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan can acquiesce to their request to suspend the party director general and appoint an external auditor to probe party affairs by 7 February, when the Knesset House Committee is expected to approve their petition to be recognized as an independent faction. If he does, they will withdraw their secession. They contend that one-third of the Tzomet Secretariat will join their move. Eytan's reaction: Segev is gone and good riddance. Now we will be able to run the party without intrigue. Eytan will convene a news conference in a short while. The three stated that they have not negotiated with anyone and that they are busy organizing their new movement. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that their faction will qualify to receive party funding in the sum of 2 million shekels a year. If they join the coalition, they will be eligible for ministerial and deputy ministerial posts in accordance with the current coalition key. The three seceding MK's today held contacts with Labor MK's; it was decided to wait four to six weeks before launching negotiations on their joining the coalition. More political reactions: Coalition Chairman Eli Dayan said this was an internal affair concerning Tzomet alone, and if the three endorse the government guidelines, nothing will prevent their joining the coalition. Ran Kohen, chairman of the Meretz faction, also called on the three to accept the government guidelines and to fight for their missions from within the government. Arye Der'i, the SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] chairman, said SHAS will not rush to join the coalition if the three Tzomet MK's join it. SHAS will return to the coalition only if the government is founded on a majority of Jewish MK's, or if the implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians is guaranteed not to harm the settlers in the territories. Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said he will not intervene in the internal affairs of other parties, but he regrets any rift in the right-wing parties.
