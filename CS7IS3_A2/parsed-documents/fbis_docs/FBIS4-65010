"Let me say immediately that this vote has no winners and no losers either," Olof Johansson said after the vote in the hall of Aso High School in Stockholm. He invited representatives of the no side to consultations in the framework of the party's executive committee to discuss how the work of the referendum campaign is to be tackled. All to try to keep disappointed opponents of the EU from losing heart and to keep them feeling like real Center Party people. Olof Johansson is aware of the no camp's dilemma. Despite everything, they have to mobilize themselves for an election campaign where the EU will be one of the central issues. And right up to 13 November they will have to put forward arguments explaining why they do not believe in the EU without having the party leadership's backing for their views. With tears in his eyes in an emotional closing speech immediately before the vote, Olof Johansson stressed that membership of the EU is not a goal in itself for the Center Party, but merely the means to an end -- a means that Olof Johansson considers to be effective, even though it took him 30 years to reach this view. "We hold fundamental values in common and they remain." The unexpected result of the congress with such an overwhelming majority for a yes must been seen as strong support for the party's chairman and his way of handling the EU question. Olof Johansson has received a lot of criticism from inside and outside his party because he as party leader did not make any pronouncement on EU membership until the final phase of the debate. But there has also been the opposite criticism from many Center Party members. They would have preferred to see that neither the party congress nor the party leader had to make up their minds about the EU, in order to avoid a split in the party. "I have the support behind me now for the party's position," Olof Johansson said at a news conference after the congress. In the referendum campaign the Center Party leader intends to be cautious with his slogans. "I do not want to produce propaganda, but instruction. I will try to be honest with regard to my analysis and convictions even if this might sometimes help my opponents." The party executive also received the congress's backing to work on the answers to the nine questions Olof Johansson put in his opening address to the congress on Saturday [7 May]. For example, he said that the EU's convergence criteria should not be an obstacle to social welfare, and also spoke of trying to create blocking minorities in the environmental field in the EU. "We have retained the right to make the decisions relating to our nonalignment. This could be an issue that would need a referendum," Olof Johansson said. At the news conference the Center Party leader was unwilling to go into excessively hypothetical arguments, as he put it. But a new referendum on the EU does not seem completely out of the question for Olof Johansson, if Sweden is a member and the EU is about to enter into even more intimate political cooperation.
