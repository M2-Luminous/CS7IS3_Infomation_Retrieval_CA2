FR940413-2-00003 FR940413-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Foreign-Trade Zones Board [Docket 14&hyph;94] Foreign-Trade Zone 141_Rochester, NY; Application for Subzone Status, Gleason Corporation Plant (Gear Production Machinery), Rochester, NY An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the County of Monroe, New York, grantee of FTZ 141, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the manufacturing plant (gear production machinery) of the Gleason Corporation (Gleason), located in Rochester, New York (``The Gleason Works''). The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on March 28, 1994. The Gleason Works (37 acres/721,371 sq.ft.) is located at 1000 University Avenue, in central Rochester (Monroe County), New York. The facility (777 employees) is used to produce spiral bevel and parallel axis gear manufacturing equipment, including gear generators, hobbers, grinders, sharpeners, testers, and gear lapping equipment (duty rate range: 4.4_5.8%). Components purchased from abroad (some 12% of total) include ball screws (HTS # 8483.40.8000, duty rate_5.7%) and process controllers (HTS # 8537.10.0030, 5.3%). The finished machinery is used in the automotive, aerospace, truck and heavy equipment industries. Some 50 percent of the equipment is exported. Zone procedures would exempt Gleason from Customs duty payments on the foreign components used in export production. On its domestic sales, Gleason would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to finished gear production equipment for the foreign components noted above. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve Gleason's international competitiveness. In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is on June 13, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to June 27, 1994). A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: U.S. Department of Commerce Branch Office, 111 East Avenue, suite 220, Rochester, New York 14604, Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, 14th Street & Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.
