This was confirmed by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], during his address in the meeting closing the process in Matanzas. Yadira Garcia, Politburo member and first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Matanzas, also chaired the meeting. Ross announced that on 29 March the CTC National Committee will meet officially to close the nationwide process. Topics such as profitability, economic efficiency, subsidies, and possible measures to prevent excess currency were issues discussed by the 205,000 workers in the province who participated in the base meetings, where more than 9,400 interventions were recorded. Both figures represent a record for union meetings in this providence. Ross added that Cuba is looking for a consensus on, understanding of, and comprehension of a package of possible measures to be implemented, some of which are controversial such as the change of currency, an issue on which there are many opinions. There are other measures being endorsed by most of the population, such as the confiscation of ill-gotten money.
