Foreign-made semiconductor chips seized 22.1 percent of the Japanese market in the October-December quarter, based on a calculation formula favored by Japan, up from 19.7 percent in the preceding quarter. The share stood at 20.7 percent on another calculation method devised by the United States, up from 18.1 percent. As a result, the average foreign chip share in Japan in the full year of 1993 came to 21.2 percent under the Japanese formula, up from 18.7 percent the previous year, but slipped below 20 percent to 19.4 percent under the American calculation method, up from 16.6 percent. Japan "substantially" boosted foreign chip buying during the reporting quarter, a MITI official told a press conference. The latest results represent "a steady improvement" in foreign access to the Japanese chip market, the official said. Under the 1991 bilateral chip accord, Japan expressed "expectations" that foreign chip shares in the country would be more than 20 percent. In the third quarter of 1993, the share was below the threshold by both calculation methods, dropping from 21.6 percent in the second quarter under the Japanese formula and from 19.2 percent under the American method. The new statistics were calculated after Japan-U.S. talks in Hawaii that began Wednesday. The 1991 pact incorporates two different methods for calculating the foreign market share in Japan. The U.S. relies on a system that counts only the sales of foreign chips in the open market. But the Japanese formula uses a broader measurement that includes so- called "captive" sales of foreign companies to their Japanese subsidiaries and those by Japanese companies under foreign brand names. In the Japan-U.S. semiconductor trade talks in January this year, Washington urged Tokyo to formulate a new action program on chip trade that would augment the 1991 pact, stating the U.S. is seriously concerned about Japan's commitment on the trade. But Tokyo rejected the demand, saying it sees no problem in Japan's foreign chip-buying efforts. "The Japanese perception remains unchanged," the MITI official said. The chip accord does not bind Tokyo to achievement of the stated trade figure, the official said. The pact says the two governments agree that the 20 percent figure "constitutes neither a guarantee, a ceiling nor a floor on the foreign market share." Sales of foreign semiconductors in Japan, calculated in value terms, kept growing during the whole of 1993 according to both calculation methods, MITI said. But foreign shares fluctuated, affected by swings in overall chip demand in Japan stemming from seasonal factors, the official said, noting that foreign share is calculated by dividing sales of foreign chips by overall demand. Japanese chip users are stepping up buying from foreign makers, the official said, citing the recent increase in "design-in" contracts between foreign chip suppliers and Japanese users. The number of design-in deals featuring partnership from the initial stage of development exceeded 3,000 cases in 1993, up from 500 in 1986, the official said.
