According to experts, the population and nearby Lake Shkoder might be in considerable danger as several containers have sprung leaks and substances have escaped into the wagons. Federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (CDU) intends to make 1.4 million marks available immediately for emergency safety measures, a spokesman for his ministry said in Bonn on Saturday [27 November]. There are 217 tonnes of pesticides in the 17 wagons, which was supplied by Germany following an order from Albania. Following its political transformation, Albania decided not to use these pesticides and asked the Federal Government to take them back. The ministry spokesman said this was not an illegal export of waste. According to a report in the WESTDEUTSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (WAZ), a poison cloud could hit the town of Shkoder and affect Montenegro or even parts of Italy, depending on the direction of the wind. The Environment Ministry spokesman also pointed out that 3,600 tonnes of pesticides from the European Union [EU] and World Bank stocks were still being kept in several stores in Albania. The EU plans to take immediate steps to dispose of the pesticides. However, details had not yet been worked out.
