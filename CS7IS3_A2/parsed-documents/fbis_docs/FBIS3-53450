They have a long history, and their relations have been marked by continuing and numerous changes, in which extraneous elements have constantly had a negative and, at times, a destructive effect. Look at the history of these two countries. In the Ottoman era, despite both having a religious government and many common denominators, foreign elements took advantage of the minor differences between them by pitting one against the other. [passage omitted] Westerners know that Turkey's population is 99 percent Muslim, and the people are devout and follow Islamic traditions. However, by propagating non-Islamic signs or anti-Islamic phenomena and fanning nationalism, they are portraying Iran as a disruptive and dangerous element opposed to Turkey. We perceive the same scenario being repeated in our relations with Turkey regarding the newly liberated Central Asian republics. Intense propaganda is giving the impression that Iran and Turkey are at loggerheads and that in Turkey a lay government is in charge, while Iran has an Islamic government. So, foreign elements seek to play a destructive role. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] How are relations now? [Baqeri] We have cordial cultural, economic, and political relations and recently initiated security cooperation. If we look at Turkey and its neighbors, we see that it has problems with all of them; that is, with Iraq, Syria, southern Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria, and Armenia. I have urged Turkish newspapers to heed the anti-Iranian material that is disseminated, as it could give the impression that all the neighbors have strained relations with Turkey. We believe that relations can be cordial. Dr. Habibi's visit to Turkey was also very successful and agreements were reached on bilateral issues. Some transport problems we had with Turkey were eliminated during this visit. When it came to the passage of trucks and passengers from Syria, Turkish officials created problems for pilgrims to holy sites, so Iran imposed restrictions on the Turkish trucks. The issue was resolved in a friendly manner and there are no restrictions on the passage of trucks or Iranian passenger buses. We asked them not to harass the passengers, as we are obliged to assist the Iranian passengers. [Correspondent] How do you appraise the outcome of this visit? [Baqeri] Prime Minister Ciller played a very active, positive, and cordial role in these talks. We have women prime ministers in our Eastern and Western neighboring countries; that is, in Turkey and Pakistan, but both fortunately have very friendly relations with Irand. This indicates that the Islamic Republic has no problems with female heads of government. We hope to see extremely positive developments following the visit by Dr. Habibi. Two ministers accompanying Dr. Habibi met their Turkish counterparts and some agreements were reached. Soon, we hope to witness Demirel's visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran at the invitation of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. The outlook for our bilateral relations is extremely positive, but because Turkey and Iran have common enemies and foreign elements do not favor broadening Iranian-Turkish relations, the Turkish mass media as well as its officials should heed this point; that is, our enemies will capitalize on any difference between Iran and Turkey. We should give them no such pretext.
