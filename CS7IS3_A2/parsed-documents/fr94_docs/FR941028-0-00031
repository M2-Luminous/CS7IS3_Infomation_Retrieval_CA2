FR941028-0-00031 FR941028-0-00009 Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of §773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice, whether State or Federal, has responsibility for making decisions concerning the status of the violation covered by the notice. The ``status'' of the violation means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Paragraph (b)(2) of §773.25 provides that OSM has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of a Federal violation notice. Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of §773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS, the responsibilities of State regulatory authorities to make decisions with respect to ownership or control links are subject to the plenary authority of OSM. Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of §773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS relating to the status of a violation and with respect to ownership or control information which has not been entered into AVS by a State, the authority of a State regulatory authority is subject to OSM's oversight authority under 30 CFR parts 773, 842, and 843. Paragraph (c) of §773.25 establishes evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and informal review of ownership or control links and the status of violations. Paragraph (c)(1) of §773.25 provides that in any formal or informal review of an ownership or control link or of the status of a violation covered by a violation notice, the agency responsible for making a decision is required to first make a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists, existed during the relevant period, and/or that the violation remains outstanding. A prima facie determination is made when the agency is reviewing the evidence itself, in an informal process; a prima facie showing is made when the agency's determination is the subject of a formal administrative or judicial review process. When the agency makes such a determination or showing, the person seeking to challenge the link or the status of the violation then has the burden of proving the necessary elements of his or her challenge to the link or to the status of the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. Under paragraph (c) of §773.25, a challenger of a link has to prove at least one of three proposed conclusions by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge. First, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of §773.25, a challenger could prove that the facts relied upon by the responsible agency to establish ownership or control under the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist or that the facts relied upon to establish a presumption of ownership or control under the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist. Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of §773.25 provides that a person subject to a presumption of ownership or control under the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 could rebut such presumption by demonstrating that he or she does not or did not in fact have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations are or were conducted. Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of §773.25 provides that a challenger could prove that the violation covered by a violation notice did not exist, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) further provides, however, that a person challenging the status of a violation would not be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited under the provisions of §773.24 unless such challenger is a permittee acting within the context of §§773.20&hyph;773.21 of this part. In any circumstance, a person who had failed to take timely advantage of a prior opportunity to challenge the violation notice or who was bound by a previous administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence of the violation would also be precluded from making a challenge to the existence of the violation at the time it was cited in any proceeding. Paragraph (c)(2) of §773.25 describes the type of evidence that a person challenging an ownership or control link or the status of a violation has to present to meet the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The regulation provides that the evidence presented be probative, reliable, and substantial. See 5 U.S.C. 556(d). Paragraph (c)(2) of §773.25 provides a list of examples of such evidence for proceedings before the ``responsible agency'' (the agency with responsibility for making a decision with respect to a challenge) and for proceedings before administrative or judicial tribunals reviewing the decisions of the responsible agency. The list of the types of acceptable evidence is intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. It is expected that regulatory authorities will add to this list as they develop experience in making determinations under the regulation. Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of §773.25 focuses upon proceedings before the responsible agency. The list of examples includes documents which are likely to be truthful and which have certain indicators of reliability which go beyond the mere assertions of the individual presenting the evidence. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of the section provides that a challenger may submit affidavits setting forth specific facts concerning the scope of responsibility of the various owners or controllers of an applicant, a permittee, or any person cited in a violation notice; the duties actually performed by such owners or controllers; the beginning and ending dates of such owners' or controllers' affiliation with the applicant, permittee, or person cited in a violation notice; and the nature and details of any transaction creating or serving an ownership or control link; or specific facts concerning the status of the violation. Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of section 773.25 each look to official certification as the basis for the reliability of a submitted document. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) allows for the submission of copies of certain types of documents if they are certified. Such documents include copies of corporate minutes, stock ledgers, contracts, purchase and sale agreements, leases, correspondence or other relevant company records. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) allows for submission of certified copies of documents filed with or issued by any State, municipal, or Federal governmental agency.
