Angheli declared that the elaboration of the regulations concerning the favored commercial status in the relations between the Parliamentary Assembly member-states is of primary importance. It is also vital to elaborate mutually advantageous import-export tariffs and to modify the system of license granting. He also mentioned that establishing inter bank collaboration relations and creating a common bank of the Black Sea Basin countries would stimulate trade between them. Angheli considers that the transit of goods from Greece and Turkey to Russia and the Ukraine would be substantially facilitated by the creation of some high-standard services at the Giurgiulesti-Galati frontier point. "By participating in the Parliamentary Assembly, Moldova has a chance to establish large trade programs through both multilateral and bilateral agreements," declared Angheli.
