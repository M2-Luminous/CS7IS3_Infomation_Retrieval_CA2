Shalom to you, sir. [Peres] Shalom. [Zelinger] An Israeli delegation -- albeit one consisting of Israeli Arabs -- is due to depart for Syria. Will you ask Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah or any other delegation member to convey any message to President al-Asad? [Peres] I do not think that is necessary, because the purpose of this visit is to convey condolences. That was the reason cited in the application for permission to visit, and I think it should be honored. There is no need to turn a condolence visit into something else. Moreover, sending messages is not a problem. There are constant exchanges. [Zelinger] I know Israel has been trying to open more than one channel of negotiations with Syria. [Peres] That is correct. I know that on this occasion, however, the visas were granted for the purpose of calling on the bereaved family, and this should be honored. [Zelinger] Would you like to comment on the very fact of the visit? Is the departure of an Israeli delegation to Damascus an important event? [Peres] I think it is a positive signal and I welcome it, although it has its limitations. It does not yet herald a burst of possibilities. It is a signal -- a positive and not at all negligible one -- but that is all it is. [passage omitted]
