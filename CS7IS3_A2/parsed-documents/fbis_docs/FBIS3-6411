Australia was branded a weak link in Western security last night in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation television investigation following the expulsion of six Russian spies last year. The expulsions, reportedly on CIA directions, were kept quiet by the Australian government, which is embarrassed at its image as a soft target used by Moscow during and since the Cold War. The expulsions were only exposed last month by an opposition MP. A spy hunt is under way to identify a network of as many as 30 Russian-recruited agents. The investigation was confirmed last night in an interview with David Sadlier, Director-General of the Australian Secret Service. Through its shared military and commercial operations with Britain and the United States, Australia is still considered to be a more relaxed target for Russia to learn about its more powerful allies. The security breach could date back ten years, or possibly 30 years as the case of the last Soviet spy in Australia, Vladimir Petrov, is reopened. A Russian translator with the Australian secret service George Sadil, has been committed for trial in Canberra for handing over intelligence secrets that would have been passed on to MI6 and the CIA. Last night the programme Lateline offered the first specific details of Soviet penetration and damage. The targeting the late 1980s was the joint Anglo-Australian development of the worlds most sophisticated sonar buoy for tracking Soviet submarine movements. The Barra sonar buoy was used by Britain in the Atlantic and Australia in the Far East. Developed in a project between Plessey and the Australian government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Australian AWA defence manufacturer the buoy has 25 underwater hydrophones. They are dropped by RAF Nimrod surveillance aircraft for the Royal Navy, and by Australian Air Force Orion aircraft for the Australian Navy. Disclosure of the operation was made by Professor Desmond Ball, of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, at the Australian National University in Canberra. The focus of attention was the Garden Island Naval Dockyard beside the Opera House. Professor Ball explained how Soviet agents intercepted phone calls between naval officers and defence headquarters in Canberra, allowing Soviet agents to monitor trials of the buoy by the naval facility south of Sydney.
