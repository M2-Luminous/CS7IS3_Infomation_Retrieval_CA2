In this regard, Sutchit Nimitkun, governor of Phuket Province, held a closed-door meeting with some 20 officials at Dusit Lagoona Resort Hotel on 13 February to map out reception for the Taiwanese leader and his delegation. The Dusit refused to answer any questions, saying the meeting is a regular event. However, it was reported that the meeting discussed the reception and security measures for the Taiwanese delegation. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan will also come to meet the president during his stay in Phuket. It was stressed during the meeting that officials concerned must avoid giving any news about the visit to the mass media for fear of affecting the good relations between Thailand and China. A source revealed that Amnuai Wirawan arrived in Phuket on 12 February and has been staying at the Dusit Lagoona Resort Hotel. However, the place where the Taiwan delegation will stay has been kept secret. Amnuai was seen at Thai Muang Golf Course in Phang-nga Province, presumably inspecting the readiness of the golf course, where the Taiwanese visitors and Thai businessmen will play friendship matches.
