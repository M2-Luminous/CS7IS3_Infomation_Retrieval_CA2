New Democracy is also on the downswing. The polls' winners are the Social Democrats and the Center Party. Seven months before the election, the governing parties are showing no signs of eroding the Social Democrats' large lead. On the contrary, the nonsocialists are losing some ground at the same time the Social Democrats are moving up for the first time in six months. With the Liberal Party's loss, a total of five parties are bunched up around the 4-percent hurdle for Riksdag representation. The Liberals, New Democracy, and the Christian Democrats are just above the line; the Left Party and Green Party just below it. Therefore, uncertainty is significantly increasing about what proportional parliamentary representation the 18 September election will result in and what government will be formed. The Temo polling was done between 24 January and 17 February and consisted of 1,046 interviews, conducted during visits to the respondents' homes. Only 9.5 percent said that they could not or would not choose a party; this percentage was 11 in December. Near a Breakup Since then the government has presented its budget, and the opposition has replied with its shadow budget. The government was near breakup over the Oresund Bridge at the beginning of the year. Ian Wachtmeister announced his resignation as party leader, with ensuing commotion within New Democracy. The government was finally united on family policy; there would be child-care subsidies, reduced compensation in parental insurance, and paternal leave. The three largest parties compromised on a new pension system. The results, with the changes since December in parentheses: the Moderates 21 percent (+ .5), the Liberal Party 5 (- 3), the Center 9 (+ 2), the Christian Democrats 4 (- .5), Green Party 3 (unchanged), Social Democrats 49 (+ 2), Left Party 3.5 (+ .5), New Democracy 4.5 (- 2), and other parties 1 (+ .5). The Liberal Party's and New Democracy's losses are outside the margin of error. In February the governing parties together had 39 percent of the votes, a decrease of 1 percent since December. In the 1991 election they totaled 46.6 percent. The Moderates, after a dip at the end of last year, have now moved up in two polls and are once again at the 21-percent mark, near their election result of 21.9 percent. The Moderates are also stronger than all three other ruling parties put together. Bridge War Such a large loss as the Liberal Party's should be noted with caution. The party reached the low-water mark in February of last year, but then they remained at 6-6.5 percent for a long time. The Liberal Party climbed back up to a level around 7-8 percent. Additional results are needed to see if the Liberals have now ended up at a lower level near the cutoff for the Riksdag. In the 1991 election the Liberal Party got 9.1 percent. One can only speculate on whether the war of nerves over the Oresund Bridge is behind the Center Party's increase to 9 percent, which means that the party, for the first time in the government's term, is above its election result of 8.5 percent. Otherwise, 8 percent -- which the Center has reached twice, once as late as the fall of 1991 -- is the highest the party has been. The child-care subsidy and "Christian ethics" in schools' lesson plans has not improved the Christian Democrats' results. Since March of last year, the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] has remained at less than 5 percent in Temo. Life outside the Riksdag is threatening the KDS, which entered in 1991 with 7.1 percent, but immediately disappeared into anonymity in the government. Great Attention New Democracy is losing ground after having been at 6.5 percent -- that is almost equal to their election result of 6.7 percent -- nearly all of last year. The new record low -- 4.5 percent is the lowest Temo measurement for New Democracy -- was reached before Ian Wachtmeister announced his resignation on Saturday, 5 February. Temo's results surprisingly showed a small increase for New Democracy after Wachtmeister's announcement, perhaps as a result of the great attention the party received in the media. The Social Democrats can be happy about the new strength in Temo before next weekend's election conference with LO [National Federation of Trade Unions] in Bommersvik. From the record high level of 50.5 percent last spring and summer, the Social Democrats fell in two polls to 47 percent. The next poll will show whether the first increase in six months breaks the trend. In the 1991 election the Social Democrats got only 37.7 percent. Left Living Dangerously The Left Party is still living dangerously. Out of 16 Temo polls since the 1991 election, the Left Party has reached 4 percent in six; in the rest they have been under the cutoff. In the latest election the result was 4.5 percent. The Green Party got 3 percent for the third time in a row, a higher level than they had received earlier in the election period, and cannot be counted out of the fight for Riksdag representation. In the last election the Greens left parliament with 3.4 percent. There will many opinion polls from various institutes this election year. The polls are difficult to compare; they were carried out under different time periods and with different methods. In addition, the changes are often contradictory. The levels for the various parties over several rating periods usually coincide very well between institutes.
