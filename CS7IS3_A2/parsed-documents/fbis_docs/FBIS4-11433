It says it is alarmed by the extent of the recent surge of repression hitting the most vulnerable classes of the Haitian population and is warning all the authorities responsible for maintaining order that they are acting against national sovereignty by leaving unpunished those military and paramilitary groups that are devoting themselves to open violence, in defiance of the Constitution, the laws of the Republic, and morality. According to the resigning government, the insane acts reported by the international audio-visual media cast discredit on the Haitian Armed Forces and risk opening the way to interventionist attempts, as much as those brutalities worry the national conscience. The government asks the commander in chief of the Armed Forces to advise the constitutional authorities on the measures taken to protect the population, and to punish the guilty who act with uncovered faces. Meanwhile, the government, which does not enjoy the cooperation of the forces of order, expresses solidarity with the families who are mourning their dead, their injured, and their missing loved ones in all regions of the country.
