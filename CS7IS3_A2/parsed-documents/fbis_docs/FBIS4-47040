They are instructed to vote for Yegor Gaydar in the party chairman elections. In late June the work on setting up rayon party organizations will begin in the city. This was decided on Saturday by the St. Petersburg founding conference of Gaydar's party supporters. The exclusive nature of the event was indicated both by the place where the conference was held (the banking center at 58 Nevskiy Avenue) and the small number of participants (108 persons), as well as limited access for the press. "The people who gathered here are the achievers who already have the experience of respect, wealth, and talent," said Yuliy Rybakov, coordinator of the Russia's Choice St. Petersburg organizational committee. Gathered in a small conference hall were six Duma deputies, high-ranking city administration officials, bankers, industrialists, democratic organizations activists, intellectuals, and even some representatives of the artistic Bohemia. Among the absent was Anatoliy Chubays: He was supposed to attend but at the last moment his plans fell through. Also absent was Aleksandr Belyayev: There are conflicting rumors about the prospects of his joining Gaydar's party. Vitaliy Sychev, the organizational committee coordinator and the leader of the city's Association of Privatized Enterprises, conducted the conference in a no-nonsense manner and at fast pace. By the way, the debate as to who will head the party's St. Petersburg branch is still on. Regional leadership organs have not been elected. They will be formed by the next city conference, which is scheduled to be held after the founding congress. "To what extent members of the organizational committee will become part of this leadership is probably impossible to tell right now, since to a large extent it will depend on how the congress goes," Mr. Sychev explained the situation at SMENA's request. One must say that at this point the organizational committee leadership has a rather firm grip on the reins. The proof of that were elections of deputies to the congress. Two-thirds of those present supported the idea not to expand the already-coordinated list of candidates. This list, which consisted of 17 names, was then approved by an even more convincing majority. Besides them, six St. Petersburg politicians, who at the time signed the appeal to set up Russia's Choice, will go to the congress, along with as many respected members of the city intelligentsia invited as guests with the rights of a decisive vote. The debate on the subject of the program and rules was of limited nature by default: The participants were told that the draft program and rules handed out to them had not been approved by the party leadership and a different version of these documents will be ready in time for the congress. Some hints of disagreements within the party could be picked up from the argument between two organizational committee members (and Duma deputies)--Grigoriy Tomchin and Mikhail Molostvov. Mr. Tomchin is convinced that Russia's Choice must become a rigidly organized liberal-conservative party, with a support base in the large- and medium-size capital. In his opinion, small business cannot play a perceptible political role. Mr. Molostvov declared to thunderous applause that he is against combining liberalism and conservatism: "What we got was not a two-headed eagle but a many- headed hydra." He thinks that Mr. Tomchin is debating Gaydar in the latter's absence, since Gaydar is for looking for support first and foremost among creative and technical intelligentsia." Mr. Molostvov was supported not only by democratic organizations activists. The idea of strengthening the liberal beginnings in Russia's Choice was also supported by Aleksey Kudrin, first deputy prime minister of the St. Petersburg government. ZVEZDA magazine's editor in chief, Yakov Gordin, said in a conversation with the SMENA correspondent: "I think that in the final count a compromise road will be found, with a serious bent towards M.M. Molostvov's position. As to large- and medium-size capital, in a real-life situation it can be protected only by a party that orientates itself towards broad strata." Actually, Grigoriy Tomchin resolutely denies that he is debating Gaydar. In his firm opinion, Gaydar's reforms had been largely aimed precisely at creating big capital. To the SMENA correspondent question on whether he believes in a small businessman--an owner of a kiosk, store, and so on--Mr. Tomchin remarked: "I believe in him as a democrat but do not believe in him as a party functionary. Because if he comes to us as a party functionary, who is going to run his kiosk?" This debate will certainly continue at the congress in the capital. There also will be debates on how strict the party rules should be, on how the regions will be represented in Russia's Choice governing bodies (St. Petersburg members insist on keeping the number of Muscovites in them to a minimum), and, of course, the actual membership of these bodies. The congress is expected to be held on 12-13 June.
