This is a part of the new measures being taken by China to strike back at the unlawful textile activities. (Li Peishuang) has more: [Begin recording] [Li] The activities mainly refer to bypassing the textile [word indistinct] administration by exporting Chinese goods through a third country or region to nations which set quotas on mainland products. At present, 17 countries limit the amount of the mainland's textile exports. They include the United States, Canada, the European Union, Finland, Norway, and Austria. China's new regulations were under discussion last week in Guangzhou at the fourth national conference on quelling illegal trade activities in textiles. Although the laws have yet to emerge publicly, a top official with the foreign trade ministry said they demand stricter penalties for violators. Zhou Keren is the director for the trade administration department. [Zhou speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] Zhou Keren says punishments range from issuing warnings to confiscation, and from fines to the suspension of the violator's export right. He says businesses should be brought to court if they have incurred serious losses for the country. Meanwhile the government is calling for assistance from all sides to check transshipments. The ministry official Zhou Keren says the government will award the larger export quota for enterprises which inform on illegal transshipments. In fact, four enterprises in coastal Liaoning, Fujian and Guangdong provinces have already faced the tougher new penalties. Liaoning's (Shankou) company signed a contract last August with Hong Kong to export shorts and pajamas to Singapore. The products were made by three Chinese factories. However, they were labelled made in Fiji and sent to the United States late last year. The foreign trade ministry confiscated all the company's earnings from the trade deal, cut off all its export quotas of export textile, and deprived of its right to apply for such quotas in 1994. The ministry official Zhou Keren says no cases of illegal transshipments occur occasionally in China [sentence as heard]. The problem in general is not as bad as the U.S. made out earlier this year. Back then, the transshipment issue sparked the dispute between China and the United States and forced both countries to compromise to insure continued trade. Finally Zhou Keren says exposure of malpractices will serve as a signal to potential violators that China is more resolved than ever to fight future illegal transshipments. [end recording]
