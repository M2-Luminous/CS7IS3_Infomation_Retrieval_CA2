Luis Zaldivar, president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], confirmed on 8 February that more than 60,000 citizens qualified to vote in the upcoming elections will be left out due to irregularities in the filing of applications for identification cards. He said: "There are about 60,000 to 70,000 unapproved applications; this does not correspond to exactly that same number of people or voters, because certain citizens have filed more than five applications." He added these people were left out for lacking a birth certificate because "our country's Electoral Code states approval is granted after verifying the information entered in an application with those on the birth certificate." Zaldivar assured there will be no strike, such as last year's, at the TSE, because the workers are aware of the importance of the March elections. (San Salvador Radio Farabundo Marti Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 8 Feb 94) The Democratic Convergence will not be able to participate in the upcoming elections with deputy candidates. The TSE on 2 February rejected a request to extend the registration deadline. The tribunal also reached a consensus agreement to "suspend the advertisements of the Liberty and Democracy Institute aimed against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front Party." TSE President Zaldivar said "this tribunal decided to suspend the political or electoral propaganda promoted by organizations that are not political parties, because this is established expressly by the code." He added there are certain advertisements that violate the Electoral Code, but the TSE cannot level fines prior to the filing of a lawsuit.
