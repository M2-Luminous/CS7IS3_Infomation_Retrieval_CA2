After returning from a 24-hour trip to Belgrade, Kozyrev told reporters that "partnership with the North Atlantic alliance was our (Russia's) choice from the very outset." "Two years ago, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a letter to NATO, offering partnership and close cooperation, and at present we are seeking for the best ways of promoting these ties," the Russian foreign minister stated, commenting on Russia's approach towards NATO's Partnership for Peace Program. He said Moscow is ready to discuss whether a framework agreement should be signed first, which is to be followed by a broader one, or whether Moscow should conclude a broader partnership pact, without signing a preliminary agreement. "We want a more serious and substantive agreement adequate to relations that should exist between NATO and the superpower of Russia...... [ellipses as received] Especially an agreement which will exclude unilateral actions, particularly military ones, in areas where we have to closely cooperate," Kozyrev pointed out. Moscow has agreed in principle to join the NATO plan, which offers east European and former Soviet republics cooperation but stops short of letting them join the alliance. According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, Kozyrev has postponed his visit to Brussels scheduled for April 21 to sign the Partnership for Peace deal, apparently angered by NATO's air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina last week.
