Real estate, manufacturing, commerce and tourism are the mainstay industries of this special economic zone. The issuing of joint stocks has effected a change in the management mechanism of enterprises. The Minnan Trade Center, for instance, raised 75 million yuan for its construction in this way. Under the supervision of the shareholders, the project was constructed one year ahead of time. A construction and development company in Haicang, one of the four government-approved special areas for Taiwan investors, joined with five financial institutions to raise 300 million yuan for the construction of highways, harbors, program-controlled telephones, water conduits and other items of infrastructure. The 6.1-km highway bridge connecting Xiamen Island and Haicang area is also expected to be financed through the issuing of stock.
