He stated: "Among Mexicans, there can be no enmity, only adversaries." Carpizo explained that the resources granted in the agreements signed by the Government Secretariat and state governments are intended to improve the quality of the police force by training personnel in the most modern and scientific methods of investigation. Carpizo stated: "Let me speak clearly. Public security is a state responsibility. Mexico's public security policies must be improved because this is a permanent commitment to the nation and with the law. That commitment rejects illegal actions. It requires our public security corps to remain current, permanent protection of our constitutional order and full respect for liberty, human rights, and the guarantees supporting these rights." The government secretary signed the agreement with 29 governors and the Mexico City mayor. The governors of Baja California and Tamaulipas, Ernesto Ruffo Appel and Manuel Cavazos Lerma, were not present but sent representatives to the meeting. The agreement was signed within the framework of the National Public Security Program. The ceremony took place in the Revolution Room of the Government Secretariat. Carpizo said it is necessary to uphold and improve conditions that provide assurances, calm, and public security, all of which are indispensable to promoting national development. Carpizo explained that the federal government and the states must act "responsibly," especially in view of calls for improved public security without infringing on any constitutional guarantees. The secretary explained that the idea is to reaffirm the legal system and to strengthen conditions that nourish civilized life, order, and public peace within the framework of respect for rights and liberties. The ceremony was also attended by Mexico State Governor Emilio Chuayffet Chemor, who said Mexico has recently endured violence which a majority of the people undoubtedly rejects. He said "crime has tarnished our coexistence." According to him, the country wants better public security so the state can function legally. Chuayffet Chemor said all sectors view insecurity as an offense, so when it is occasionally the result of negligence or abuse of authority, distress turns into indignation. He added that the federal government has responded promptly to public security demands and noted: "The federal entities want to fight violence, crime, and the confusion between legitimate claims and arbitrary attempts to impose particular interests on the majority." The state leader said more policemen are needed to fight crime. This increase in forces is not meant to cause concern in society but to bring it serenity. He added that "the community expects promptness and efficiency from the people who serve it by fighting those who would offend and endanger the community. The people demand assurances and expect no reduction of the freedom we all enjoy. They ask for a stern hand to enforce the law but say there can be no justification for abuse and excessive power under any circumstances." Jacques Rogozinsky, general director of the National Bank of Public Works and Services (Banobras), announced that his organization designed a financial plan to modernize the public security system equipment. The plan's objective is to support the states in purchasing vehicles for their preventive police and judicial organizations. He explained that the funds for these vehicles will be funneled to the various states through Banobras, which will be responsible for providing the vehicles themselves. The federal government will contribute 25 percent of the total cost of the units, while loans will provide the remaining 75 percent over three years. Rogozinsky went on to explain that five assembly plants will be invited to bid. The bank will require a "unit cost and discount reference list" for all vehicles and other equipment, which will be a determining factor for all participants. In addition, the bank will establish a "volume discount rate per unit," which must be applied by all qualifying participants. Socorro Diaz, undersecretary of civilian protection, crime prevention, and social readaptation, said the funds will be used to upgrade the organization and operations of the public security forces in each state, including private security agencies, weapons for the police force, communications equipment, and other materials used for training and to preserve order.
