It characterizes the Kim Yong-sam administration as a "slavish, pro-American regime no different than the succession of military regimes [preceding it]" and is concentrating its efforts on North Korean-U.S. negotiations. We take a look at the North Korean [NK] unification policy and foreign policy for the new year. It is uncertain just when it began, but we have come to ask the question every New Year: "Will a North-South summit meeting materialize this year?" The mood neglects questions of what a summit meeting would be for, what it would deal with, and what role it would play in the realization of unification; rather, interest centers merely on whether it will be held. Recent discussion is no exception. Under the hasty expectation that with the seeming improvement in NK-U.S. nuclear negotiations the North-South dialogue too would begin to improve, vague observations are being made on the possibility that a summit meeting would be held within the year. Summit-related questions were asked at President Kim Yong-sam's New Year's news conference on January 6th, it too being no exception. "We must not have a summit meeting just to have a summit meeting. What is more, there is no reason we cannot hold talks with President Kim Il-song. For this, however, a few problems about which we are talking must be solved," answered President Kim. This answer was prepared in advance and can be viewed as the administration's official position. In short, this means that, for a summit meeting, preconditions, such as North-South mutual nuclear inspections to guarantee nuclear transparency, must first be met. "This is not the stage for saying anything concrete, but NK has started to change," said President Kim in a news conference late last year, "It is believed that next year will be an important turning point in North-South relations." The nuance of the president's statement given on January 6th was entirely different from this optimism. It gives the feeling that he is putting more importance on the fulfillment of preconditions. Last year's optimistic statement is seemingly related to what NK's Kim Il-song revealed on December 25th in his meeting with UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali: "We are willing to pursue a North-South exchange of special envoys." The situation changed this year, however. A statement given in a news conference by deputy prime minister and unification minister Yi Yong-tok, the day before the president's New Year's news conference, needs to be carefully examined. Saying, "The time has come to talk about NK's human-rights problem," he goaded NK's Achilles heel. It is difficult to view this as just a statement made in passing. It gives the impression that they are aiming for something. "A meeting itself must not be the goal of the North-South relationship. It is important to develop it into a substantial relationship," said Deputy Prime Minister Yi, adding, "Even if NK should propose talks, it is our plan to reject this unconditionally if it doesn't fit the principles of the administration." Anyone can read this emphasis on "principle" as a "hard-line posture toward the North." It can be viewed as a response to the "hard-line statement toward the South" given by Kim Il-song in his New Year's address. The nuance of the statement by Yi is different from the original mood of government authorities, who had been optimistic that if a NK-U.S. agreement were concluded, North-South working-level talks for an exchange of special envoys would be held. O this issue, NK, in a report by the secretariat of the Committee For the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] given on January 7th, criticized Deputy Prime Minister Yi as "the one who desecrated the rights of our young students," pointing to the fact that when visiting Pyongyang as the chief representative of the South Korean [SK] delegation to the 1985 9th North-South Red Cross Talks, Yi had been watching group gymnastics by a team of youth, but left in the middle of the event. "In the future, people like Deputy Prime Minister Yi won't be able to step even one foot into the area of our republic," the report said, showing a hard-line stance. The CPRF also added a warning that if another statement is made like that of Deputy Prime Minister Yi, "The North-South relationship may be confronted by a situation difficult to get under control." However, authorities at our Foreign Ministry, carefully watching the developments of NK-U.S. contact, predict that if in early January progress is made on nuclear inspections between NK and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), their is a high probability that a North-South working-level contact will be held around the end of January. They also foresaw the possibility that even the time for a North-South exchange of special envoys would be decided at the NK-U.S. talks. This is reading the mood optimistically. Considering the mutually contradictory stances taken by the [SK] authorities, it is unclear whether their basic position is one of actively pursuing talks (including a conciliatory posture toward the North) or whether it is one which stresses principle and takes a passive approach to talks. Although it may seem somewhat hasty, let us consider the prospects for a North-South summit meeting within the year. To put our conclusion first, "A summit within the year is impossible because of many problems and because of the divergent positions of the North and South." Why is this so? We will first examine the reasons for this, then take an overall look at NK's policies toward the South, the U.S. and Japan this year. In connection with the observation that if the IAEA inspection team is allowed to visit NK, working-level contact for a North-South exchange of special envoys will begin, first, it is questionable that at the present stage NK will actually consent to working-level talks. Of course, our government authorities can be positive about working-level contacts. For NK, however, if there is a little progress in solving the nuclear issue through NK-U.S. negotiations, its incentive for responding to working-level contact weakens. It is clear that even if it is firmly decided that SK-U.S. Team Spirit exercises will be discontinued, NK will not think conditions have been met for North-South working-level contacts. It will again demand of SK that it give up dependence on foreign powers under the name of "abandoning the system of international cooperation," an expression of the intent to withdraw U.S. troops, to permanently discontinue joint military exercises with foreign military units, etc. Even if NK agrees to working-level contacts because of the strong U.S. demand for it, there is a high probability that it will only be a formality, even more so than the working-level contact last October. This is because it appears NK will not back away from its basic position concerning the duties of the special envoys. Compared to our position that the nuclear problem should be solved first and other outstanding issues discussed, NK will want to deal in parallel with the performance of denuclearization and the relaxation of tensions (leading into a demand for arms reduction), planning to promote national solidarity (leading into a demand for a federation-type unification), and a North-South summit meeting. The disputed points of the special-envoy-exchange agenda are unlikely to be easily resolved and the exchange itself is unlikely to be realized. Thus, there are limits to the optimistic view that things will work out in the order of a NK-IAEA agreement, a third round of NK-U.S. talks, a North-South special-envoy exchange (or with a North-South special-envoy exchange coming before a third round of NK-U.S. talks). Although there is little possibility it will happen, if within the year all conditions are met and there is an exchange of special envoys and a summit meeting, NK's President Kim Il-song will use the summit meeting to call for the immediate realization of "a federal system based on the idea of one people, one nation, two systems and two governments, national solidarity (the issue of economic cooperation will also be mentioned in this framework), and peaceful arms reduction from the principle of autonomy. A summit meeting is unlikely, but if it does come about, NK will next seek contact talks with figures from each sector of SK from a "national-solidarity" standpoint Seen in this way, NK's thinking is completely different from that of our government, which has no intention of backing away from its aim of "window unification" for the North-South dialogue. Also, it is the thinking of our government to respond positively to calls for North-South economic cooperation if NK "nuclear transparency" is guaranteed, but it is difficult to hope for the kind of "complete resolution of the nuclear question" wanted by our government. In its negotiations with NK, even the U.S. is pouring all its efforts into binding NK, no matter what, to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and at least getting an IAEA nuclear inspection. For the present, the special inspection of two unreported facilities (NK insists they are "military facilities") for which SK, the U.S. and the IAEA had originally intended to push hard, seems to be out of reach. Prospects are that the more this issue is brought up, the more the rounds of fighting surrounding the NK nuclear question will be repeated. Given this situation, the Kim Yong-sam administration is unlikely to hurry a North-South summit meeting and it appears that the road toward a summit meeting will feel that much more distant. Moreover, suggesting that he has no intention of carrying on a dialogue with the Kim Yong-sam government, President Kim Il-song's New Year's address further dims prospects for a summit. "We hoped the SK authorities would respond to our National-Solidarity 10-Point Program and walk the road of reconciliation and cooperation, and we also took important measures concerning the exchange of special envoys to take place between the highest levels of the two sides. The SK authorities, however, ignoring our generous offers and the cherished desire for unification of the whole Korean people, is walking the road not of national autonomy, but of dependence of foreign powers, not of national unity, but of North-South confrontation," said [NK's] President Kim last year, strongly criticizing the Kim Yong-sam administration's posture toward the North. "Joining with foreign powers, the SK authorities frequently carry out large-scale military exercises opposing our republic and, using our nuclear problem as an excuse, talks of military confrontation and a system of international cooperation, driving the North-South relationship into a perilous situation," he added. These statements attract attention because they show that NK understands our government to be a "pro-American flunkyist regime" and that as long as there is no change in this posture, it has no intention of taking part in an inter-Korean dialogue. This is a 180-degree change from the "sense of expectation" shown by NK Prime Minister Kang Song-san last year after the birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, when President Kim stated, "The interests of the Korean people come before allies." This year's New Year's address was exceptional in that [NK's] President Kim did not include a proposal aimed at our government. In last year's New Year's address, even while criticizing our government for its "antinational behavior," because it obstructed the implementation of the North-South Basic Agreement and reopened Team Spirit exercises, as if having the newly born Kim Yong-sam administration in mind, he stated, "No matter who they may be, if someone comes out with a sincere attitude, genuinely wanting to solve the problems of the unification of the Fatherland, we will sit down with them face-to-face and frankly discuss the problems of the unification of the Korean people, without bringing up the past, and endeavor together to achieve the great work of the unification of the Fatherland." One can feel the extreme distance between the two addresses. We are reminded again that the adoption of the "National-Solidarity 10-Point Program" in the 5th Session of the 9th Supreme People's Assembly held in April and the proposal immediately following it in May for an exchange of special envoys to prepare for a North-South summit meeting were possible because statements of this tone were in last year's New Year's address. This year, not only did Kim fail to make any proposals toward our government, but he did not hesitate to make statements which seem to indicate that he has given up his "original sense of expectation" in the Kim Yong-sam administration. "The so-called civilian government of SK is only a facade: in actuality it is no different from the succession of military dictatorships [which preceded it]. Anticommunist, fascist, evil laws remain intact in SK and the earnest desire of the SK people for the unification of an autonomous, democratic Fatherland is not being realized," criticized [NK's] President Kim. He also stated, "It is right that the SK people and figures from each sector should feel that there is no longer anything to watch and hope for from the present SK regime." Attention has focused on such statements because they reveal NK's overall perception of the Kim Yong-sam administration. In short, they contain an underlying "subversiveness" which says, "You must struggle without attachment to the civilian government," clearly showing a "lack of intention to talk" with the other party in the dialogue. If we are to understand why NK has taken a hard-line posture this year, we must go back a little in time. Originally, NK focused its attention on NK-Japanese negotiations on normalization with the goal of importing Japanese capital and technology and on building a system of coexistence with SK through a federation-type unification and economic cooperation. To accomplish this, it accepted IAEA nuclear inspections and adopted the North-South Basic Agreement and Joint Declaration on Denuclearization. However, NK's plans were not realized because of the U.S.'s hard-line position concerning the nuclear issue. U.S. pressure grew and it became clear that the U.S. was strongly influencing Japan and SK. As a result, Japan, keeping in step with the U.S., made it clear that there would be no progress in normalization negotiations as long as the NK nuclear issue was unresolved. Ignoring the NK position of strongly demanding, as an indication of our intention to implement the Basic Agreement, "the abandonment of the system of international cooperation" and "the discontinuance of various war exercises," our government responded by strengthening cooperation with the U.S. and other allies and using Team Spirit exercises as a means for pressuring NK to resolve the nuclear issue. In this process, NK appears to have understood that its normalization negotiations with the Japanese Government were not going smoothly and that, on top of this, the Kim Yong-sam administration's posture toward the North was not that transitional compared with past governments and was "nonautonomous" to the extent that it considered international pressure on NK important, and that its gradual trend toward conservatism was becoming stronger. Thus, NK put off NK-Japanese normalization negotiations and the North-South dialogue. Rather, by playing its nuclear card, it attempted to find a breakthrough in the direction of direct negotiations with the U.S. This was the mood last year. Now, the situation has changed. NK's nuclear card has won a certain measure of success. As the battle surrounding the NK nuclear issue continues, the scene has taken on a new composition: the North-South dialogue has moved to the back and direct NK-U.S. negotiations have begun in earnest. These are the main factors preventing NK from being active in its dialogue with the Kim Yong-sam administration. NK appears to have concluded that, in view of the conservative current of the Kim Yong-sam administration as is seen in the continued existence of the National Security Law and the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Han Wan-song, it has nothing to gain through the inter-Korean dialogue. Another aspect of this appears to be that NK seems to have been encouraged by reports that activists in SK are again gaining vigor over the opening of the SK rice market and that there is movement to organize a new unification movement. It is because of this that statements have been frequently flowing out of NK reports that the struggle against opening the SK rice market must be sublimated into an "autonomy, democracy, and unification movement." Considering the fact that existing policy, that "the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys must be realized before the third round of NK-U.S. talks," was confirmed by a decision reached in government unification-related, high-level strategy meetings, the U.S. choice now remains important. This is because it appears that NK clearly has no intention of exchanging envoys. [NK] President Kim's New Year's address confirms this. "Pressure and threats do not work with us. Not only is it impossible to solve the problem depending on such methods, but they could push the situation into a catastrophe," he said. "The U.S. must look at all the facts correctly and act prudently." Even while taking this hard-line stance, he stated that the nuclear issue could be resolved "if, on condition of a joint declaration between NK and the U.S., both sides keep and perform the principles already agreed upon." This can be viewed as an expression of his intention to continue to resolve the issue through dialogue. A result of the first round of NK-U.S. talks last June, the "joint declaration" mentioned here contains: suspension of threats and the use of force, including nuclear weapons; respect for each other's sovereignty and noninterference in internal politics; and support for a peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula. For NK, this result in considerable concessions by the U.S. was gained by playing its nuclear card. Thus, NK has evaluated this joint declaration as having "put an end to the hostile relationship between NK and the U.S. and prepared a common foundation capable of fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue." At this stage, an important clue for anticipating future progress is the content of a news conference with the Korean Central News Agency given by a NK foreign ministry spokesperson the day after the 18th contact (on December 29th), which took place after July's second round of talks in Geneva. "In this contact, the U.S. side formally expressed its intention to suspend Team Spirit joint military exercises as a part of its measures to eliminate the nuclear threat toward us. As befits our special status of having temporarily suspended the validation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT], we decided to permit inspections needed to guarantee the continuity of compliance, not regular or irregular inspections legally required in accordance with the treaty on nuclear facilities, which we have already reported," he revealed. Thus, the U.S. ultimately promised to suspend Team Spirit exercises without being able to make NK return to the situation as it was before it announced it would withdraw from the NPT. This means that the SK-U.S. plan to use Team Spirit exercises as a means for pressuring NK ended in failure. "Based on this progress, we have decided to conclude a package settlement of the issues in the third round of talks, to fundamentally solve the nuclear issue by ending the U.S.'s nuclear threat and hostile policy toward us, by improving NK-U.S. relations, and by resuming regular and irregular IAEA inspections of our nuclear facilities," the Foreign Ministry spokesperson confirmed. This means that the U.S. is accepting the "package settlement" upon which NK has stubbornly insisted. If this package settlement is achieved in the third round of talks, there is a high probability that the IAEA special inspections and the North-South mutual inspections (and an exchange of special envoys in preparation for this), persistently sought by the U.S., will be put off. Now the U.S. is left with a serious choice. As a story which was leaked out in early January, it is unknown whether there was an agreement between NK and the U.S. on "reopening the North-South dialogue." Officially, the NK position is, "The North-South dialogue is an issue internal to the Korean people. Therefore, it is not something for the U.S. to interfere in." The U.S. State Department insists that NK expressed its intention to "reopen the North-South dialogue." Even while impatient to gain, if nothing else, at least IAEA inspections of NK, in order to maintain the NPT system, the U.S. seems to be trying hard not to give this impression to the SK side. On the one hand, there is a possibility that, following the current of improvement in NK-U.S. relations, NK-Japanese relations will escape from last year's stagnation and make progress at considerable speed. Reports have already come out that the Japanese Government is secretly pursuing a resumption of talks on normalizing relations with NK. If NK and the U.S. successfully conclude a "package settlement," prospects for NK-Japanese normalization will become that much brighter. Also, even if a "package settlement" is delayed, the mood of negotiations on normalization will change considerably. However, although normalized relations with the U.S. are remote, it is still unknown whether normalized relations with Japan will be achieved this year. This is because negotiations will proceed even in a state in which the NK "nuclear question" has not completely disappeared. In connection with this, it is being reported by some that our government is taking pains to come up with countermeasures out of concern that a normalization of NK relations with the U.S. and Japan might suddenly be achieved. What is more, although difficult to believe, it has even been reported that the government is planning to help NK normalize relations with the U.S. and Japan. Regardless, it appears that the shock of NK normalization with the U.S. and Japan will bring a change of perception greater than when SK normalized relations with China and the Soviet Union and that its effects will be considerable. On the other hand, the U.S. continues to demand a "complete resolution of the NK nuclear question," special inspections by the IAEA and North-South mutual inspections. NK continues to reject this and there is a good possibility it may end up withdrawing its suspension of the validity of its withdrawal from the NPT. If this happens, the NK nuclear issue will ultimately be set before the UN Security Council. In such an event, NK would withdraw from the UN "without hesitating." Although it is questionable whether a decision will be made in the UN to take even economic sanctions, in the unlikely event that this does happen, military tensions on the Korean peninsula will rapidly increase. Thus, it appears that it will be difficult for the U.S. to continue with its existing position, calling for a "complete resolution of the NK nuclear question." However, if the U.S. demands no more than normal inspections (giving up on special inspections of two locations), it will mean relinquishing a complete resolution of the NK nuclear question. This would damage the authority of the IAEA and the UN and would give rise to the insecurity of the NPT system. Here is the dilemma of the U.S. There is a strong possibility that after first achieving full-scale implementation of normal inspections, the U.S. will try to see through long-term, staged demands to secure nuclear transparency. This process will be an extension of NK-U.S. talks. However, even though the nuclear question remains, if the international mood goes in the direction of believing that the NK nuclear issue has been settled, Japan will consider normalization with NK, although it may take some time. In connection with this, the December appointment of party secretary Hwang Chang-yop as chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly's Foreign Relations Committee suggests much. It is anticipated that in the future he will play an important role in foreign relations with Japan, the U.S. and other Western nations. This year, NK is negative toward the inter-Korean dialogue, but it is predicted that it will show comparatively great interest in the expansion of the National Unification Front. This is clearly seen in the New Year's address also. Setting out as a fundamental principle a federation-style unification based on his National-Solidarity 10-Point Program and the idea of one people, one nation, two systems, two governments, [NK] President Kim urged, "By banding together as one under the standard of national solidarity and carrying out a nationwide struggle, this year all Korean people in the North, South and overseas, must open a new phase of the unification of the Fatherland." This is an expression of his intention to concentrate all his powers on expanding the National Unification Front. This is not a National Unification Front aimed solely at activists in SK or overseas. It means that he is going to promote cooperation with various civilian figures, including those in business and religion, and responsible leaders of political parties and social organizations. This unification policy, referred to as the expansion of the National Unification Front, is first of all focused on isolating the Kim Yong-sam administration. The next stage comes out of an intention to give the Kim Yong-sam administration no choice, through the use of internal and external pressure, but to adopt a "transitional posture toward the North." The core of his unification line is contained in the 10-Point Program, which came out last April, and it appears that in the future no NK unification policy will depart from this framework. The 10-Point Program is an extension of 1973's Fatherland Unification 5-Point Program, 1980's Federation 10-Point Revised Plan, and 1990's Fatherland Unification 5-Point Plan. Even so, it can be said to be a new action directive, newly prepared in consideration of the new international environment. The 10-Point Program supposes a "unified nation which is autonomous, peaceful, and neutral" (Item 1). This unified nation would leave intact the existing two systems and two governments. It would be a federal state in which the regional governments would participate equally. The ideological foundation of national solidarity is love for the Korean people and a spirit of national autonomy (Item 2). Its fundamental principle is to make everything subordinate to the promotion of coexistence, coprosperity, and the public interest, and to the great work of unification (Item 3). Presented as actual, immediate tasks are: suspension of all political strife, which promotes division and confrontation (Item 4); elimination of apprehensions about invasion from the North and South, about victory over communism or communization (Item 5); regard for the importance of democracy and acknowledgment of differences in ideology and doctrine (Item 6); protection of material and mental wealth owned by individuals and organizations (Item 7); and understanding and trust through contact, exchange and dialogue. Besides these, it adds that the subject of national solidarity is the whole Korean people in the North, South, and overseas (Item 9) and that people who have contributed to national solidarity and unification need to be valued highly (Item 10). Here, items three, seven, and ten are interesting in that they also aim for economic cooperation with SK businessmen. In light of the 10-Point Program, even if NK does not consider inter-Korean talks important this year, it will continue to be interested in North-South economic exchange through a third country, which is in the middle of active development, and in direct exchange. In this process, discord may appear between our government, which wants overall control of economic cooperation with the North in keeping with its principle of "window unification," and business. NK's interest in the National Unification Front was also confirmed in the All-Korea Alliance [Pomminnyon] Platform (seven items) and Regulations (Chapter 5 Article 23), published December 16th of last year in a news conference by Paek In-chun, chairman of the All-Korea Alliance's northern headquarters. The platform is an overall reorganization of what had been argued in the resolutions of the All-Korea Conference [Pomminjok Taehoe] and the Council of Joint Chairmen. Overall, the inter-Korean dialogue has come to a standstill this year. As the movement of surrounding nations centered on NK speeds up, it is possible that discord within SK will grow over evaluations of the NK attitude and responses to it. There could even be subtle dissonance exposed between SK and the U.S., depending on the situation. This may even become the year that the "breaking of the system of international cooperation," persistently pursued by NK, is successful. If the situation develops in this way, the government may have no choice but to relax its hard-line posture toward the North. NK's hard-line posture toward the South can be viewed as having had this as its aim. NK's brushing aside our government to depend tenaciously on direct negotiations with the U.S. is a result of its conclusion that the North-South dialogue has no meaning under conditions in which the Basic Agreement is not being kept. Also, behind NK's concentration of its efforts on expanding the National Unification Front is its intention to isolate the Kim Yong-sam administration. If the government is to take a leading role in the resumption of the North-South dialogue, then it seems that it would be good for it to actively enter into arms-reduction negotiations, for the "construction of a peaceful system" capable of being a fundamental solution to the nuclear problem. This is because arms-reduction negotiations are desired by NK as well. At the same time, North-South economic cooperation could be implemented in parallel. Otherwise, we could be dragged around by the situation produced by NK, which is simultaneously taking a hard-line posture toward SK and a relaxed posture toward the U.S. A "nationally autonomous," transitional attitude is a prerequisite if the government is to actively enter arms-reduction negotiations. For the present, this appears to be a very difficult choice.
