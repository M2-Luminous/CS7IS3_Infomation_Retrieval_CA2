Police have so far failed to track down either the culprits or the capsule which is believed to have been sawn up. Spokesman for the Ukrainian security services Anatoliy Sakhno described the incident as very serious indeed. Three of the plant employees have been sent for medical treatment in Kharkov and Kiev following symptoms of exposure to excessive radiation and about ten others are examined locally. Unconfirmed reports speak of background radiation levels on the plant's premises rising. It is believed that parts of the capsule may have been thrown in the plant's water reservoir.
