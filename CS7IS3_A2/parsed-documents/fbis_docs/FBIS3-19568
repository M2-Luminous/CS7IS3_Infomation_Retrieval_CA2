At the opening of CeBit '94, the international computer fair in Hannover, which runs until 23 March, Boetsch pointed to the key position of this "market of markets." According to experts' estimates, the worldwide volume for communication services will be 1.5 trillion German marks [DM] by the turn of the millennium; in 1990 it was only DM700 billion. This development harbors enormous opportunities of growth for competitive, flexible industries. By the year 2010 approximately DM2.4 trillion will be invested in the European Union in the modernization of telecommunications infrastructures, the minister stated referring to the Prognos AG market research institute. In addition, considerable resources are going to East Europe. A future-oriented policy creates investment-promoting framework conditions. The rising pressure of international competition also intensifies the trend toward private telecommunications companies. The positive effects of liberalization can be demonstrated in Germany with the examples of mobile radio and satellite radio communications. Thus, the introduction of competition in mobile radio telephone systems has led to an increase in the number of participants from 200,000 to 1.8 million over the past five years. During the same period, the price for mobile radio telephone equipment fell from about DM6,000 to DM1,000. In addition, the opening of the market led to an "impressive variety of private initiatives," Boetsch said. In Germany 47 licenses for private satellite networks were issued until February this year. Not least, the number of companies offering telecommunications services, which was just 66 at the end of January 1991, increased to 381 by the second week of this February. "Europe is Lagging Behind" In the view of the post minister, industry is preparing for new times. Sooner or later, the "television set at home will become an interactive information and communication center," and that not just in Germany. Therefore, harmonization in the field of European telecommunications is more important than ever. Boetsch: "The simultaneous introduction of Euro-ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] in all member states will make an essential contribution to enlarging the telecommunications market." At the moment, Euro-ISDN is being installed by 26 network operators from 20 countries. Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation of German Employers' Associations, said that the European locations for production and services are not yet competitive. In the United States and also in East Asia the input-output ratio is often better than that of European competitors, which leads to production being shifted to these areas. While Europe's share in world trade is going down, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, for instance, have doubled their share to 9 percent of work exports over the past 10 years. Europe is also lagging behind regarding the creation of new jobs. Over the past 20 years the European Community has created only 0.4 percent of new jobs, compared with an annual average growth of 1 percent in Japan and of 1.8 percent in the United States. In Murmann's view, Germany is in the mood for a new start. The way toward new structures of labor organization, work time, and labor costs has been paved by the latest wage contract for the metal industry. Productivity will increase in Germany. The average personnel costs increased by 5 percent in 1992. This year the increase is between 0.0 and 2 percent. In order to correct the wage policy mistakes of the past decade, one needs more than three years, Murmann said. He imagines wage contracts that outline a minimum framework and permit leeway for components that depend on performance and yield.
