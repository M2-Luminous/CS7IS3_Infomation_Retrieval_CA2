Guatemalan society rejects corruption, deceit, schemes, and fraud, and it refuses to continue to live with the impunity with which those state organizations act. The 30 January referendum plans to legitimize the despicable political and moral conduct that has prevailed in the state branches for years. The announced constitutional reforms are not the ones Guatemala needs and demands; they are schemes hatched behind civilian society's back that deliberately intend to worsen the national crisis. The causes that led to the May 1993 coup d'etat remain unsolved. In-depth reforms, based on a different project for the construction of a new nation, are necessary to solve the institutional crisis.
