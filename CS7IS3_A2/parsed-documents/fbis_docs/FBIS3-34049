Speaking at a press conference, Eytan described Gonen Segev, Ester Salmovitz, and Alex Goldfarb's breakaway as an attempt to strengthen their positions in the upcoming elections. Eytan said he was not surprised by reports of their possible plans to join the coalition. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the Labor party must not get involved in the internal political problems of the Tzomet party. Speaking to reporters tonight in Jerusalem, Rabin refused to say whether he would attempt to entice the three resigning members to join the coalition and, in his words, would not answer hypothetical questions. [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 2 February adds that Rabin "stated a short time ago that he had not authorized anybody to negotiate with the three seceding members of Tzomet."]
