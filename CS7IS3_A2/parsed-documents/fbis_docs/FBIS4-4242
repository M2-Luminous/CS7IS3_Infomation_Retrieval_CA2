The annual consumption of over 150 billion cigarettes accounts for 30 percent of the world's total. Because many of them are closet smokers, the actual number of the female smokers may be much bigger. According to surveys, 33 percent of female smokers said they smoked as a way of asserting their equality with men while 40 percent of them said they smoked because of the influence of other smokers. A middle school class in Beijing saw 32 percent of its students smoking because of fun. Other reasons for the bad habit by women include the failures in love, novelty-seeking and a way to kill time. Women smoking in recent years has not only become a problem harmful to health but also an increasingly serious social problem, creating new obstacles for the anti-smoking campaign in the country.
