The Argentine minister arrived in Peru on the evening of 4 April. Yesterday he had a busy agenda. He said: "Peru's prospects today are not the same as they were a while ago; they are now much better, and we want to participate in this process." He commented that the changes implemented by President Alberto Fujimori during the past two years are similar to those carried out by Argentina and other countries. Di Tella said: "This is why I believe there are new chances of cooperation and greater collaboration because instead of rhetoric we now see concrete deeds." Establishing the Joint Peruvian-Argentine Commission with his Peruvian counterpart Efrain Goldenberg, Di Tella said the commission will assess the integration policies contained in bilateral projects. He and Minister Goldenberg reviewed the economic and political issues of the agenda which, he said, were then passed for assessment by the commission which disclosed its conclusions yesterday afternoon. The Argentine foreign minister then disclosed that on 17 and 18 July, Argentine President Carlos Menem will pay an official visit to Lima. He did not announce an agenda because the chiefs of state will draft it. Early this morning Di Tella placed a wreath at the monument of Argentine forefather Jose de San Martin in the square of the same name. Referring to Menem's visit, he said it will be a sign of support for the changes currently taking place in Peru. Regarding the constitutional reform to allow presidential reelection in his country, he said it has the support of the great majority of the people.
