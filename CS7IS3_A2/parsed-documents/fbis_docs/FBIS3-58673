She pointed out that PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorism and the Hezbollah issue were first raised during these talks. Ciller noted: [Begin recording] This is what we have always advocated: If the borders in the Middle East budge in one way or another -- if, that is, Iraq's territorial integrity is threatened in any way -- this would endanger peace in the Middle East, which is considered an energy warehouse and which is extremely important for the world's productive and economic power. This, in turn, would immediately impose a liability on world peace, a question which concerns the West very closely. The struggle against terrorism is not only supported by the Vienna summit and the statements issued by the United Nations; it is not merely discussed on the international arena within the framework of NATO; but, the fact that this struggle is an extremely important issue for the stability of the Middle East has also been revealed. In addition to the Israeli-Palestinian issue and the request for this peace to be embraced by Syria as well, the importance of the struggle against the PKK and the need to act in cooperation against these terrorist organizations in the Middle East were stressed for the first time during the meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. al-Asad.
