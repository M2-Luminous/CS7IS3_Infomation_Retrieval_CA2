The new block stands at Kc4.25 billion and the old block (before the currency separation on February 8) at Kc1.50 billion. The two clearing accounts were set up on February 9, 1993 when the first payments on the old block were cleared. Payments on the new block began February 15. The Czechoslovak currency split on February 8. Transfers from the old to the new block took place in mid-May and mid-August, and at the end of September, October and November. Compensation of the marginal credit was done in the middle of August. The marginal credit amounts to 130 million clearing European Currency Units. If exceeded, a foreign exchange settlement has to follow. At present the balance is nearest to the marginal credit (127 million).
