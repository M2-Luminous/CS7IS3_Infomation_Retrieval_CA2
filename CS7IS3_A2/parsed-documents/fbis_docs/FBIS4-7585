Lupu has worked most of his career at Military Unit 0544 (Foreign Information Directorate) both at the headquarters and outside the Directorate. In 1983, he was appointed chief of the Directorate and deputy chief of Military Unit 0110, which was led by General Victor Niculicioiu. The unit, one of the most efficient in the former State Security Department [DSS], was in charge of counterintelligence in the former USSR area and the other socialist countries. General Niculicioiu's other deputy was Colonel Vasile Ionescu, who was transferred to reserve duty after the 1989 December events. Colonel Mihai Lupu excelled in the counterintelligence structures because of his experience at the Foreign Information Directorate but also because he is considered a very well-informed person about the methods of the secret services in the former socialist countries. After the establishment of the SRI, he worked in the counterintelligence Division and was General Gheorghe Diaconescu's deputy.
