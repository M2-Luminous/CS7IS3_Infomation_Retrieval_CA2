He says that other ministries have far more work to do and that the Culture Ministry's duties could be performed by a department attached to a government body. "A whole ministry cannot occupy itself with the couple of things, such as monuments, the National Museum or the National Library," Klaus says. Asked to react to a recent statement by an unnamed Polish economist that he does not understand the Czech economy because low unemployment, no bankruptcies, and a relative prosperity are not phenomena that go together, Klaus says: "Somebody has erroneously coined the idea that bankruptcies have curative effects, that they are desirable, and that the success of economic transformation is in proportion to the number of bankruptcies," Klaus says. "But there are many forms of restructuring enterprises and the bankruptcy is an extreme method. The first form is the company's getting back on its feet. A number of internal measures are carried out which turn the company, retaining its old name, into an entirely new one. The other thing is the process of privatization which has led to marked changes in the structure of many companies. Hundreds of enterprises have been intentionally liquidated and no one is surprised. Everyone would like to hear the word bankruptcy. But the more successful the other ways of restructuring are, the less bankruptcies can occur," Klaus stresses. He also dismisses the environmentalists' assertion that the large amount of raw materials in Czech exports is not a positive phenomenon in the long run. "This is an entirely erroneous way of thinking influenced a little by the mercantilist idea or by the idea of early industrialization stages. Naturally, these considerations also contain the vision of socialist industrialization which our environmentalists have not yet mentally overcome. This idea is based on the tenet that a healthy economic development is connected with the manufacturing industry, and within it with the so-called modern, effective sectors. "But foreign trade is based on nothing but on the idea of comparative advantage as coined by David Ricardo in 1817. ...If I have comparative advantage in the production of microchips, then I will export microchips. If I have comparative advantage in the production of kaolin tiles, I have to export kaolin tiles even though they have a greater content of raw materials than microchips. This is the elementary truth and it is just this argument -- export of raw materials -- which is used as an argument against free market," Klaus stresses in conclusion.
