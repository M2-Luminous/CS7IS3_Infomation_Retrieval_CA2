FR941013-1-00014 FR941013-1-00004 Q. If the scope of the type of event covered by the rule is broad, and the rule contains the ``money back guarantee,'' should procedures be included that would protect the operator from having to refund the entire tour price if a participant doesn't receive promised admission to something like a welcoming cocktail party? No commenters spoke in favor of a requirement to apply the ``money back guarantee'' to events such as a welcoming cocktail party. Of those who commented on the issue, NTA, the NHL, ASTA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that operators should not be required to refund the entire tour price over failure to provide something like a promised welcoming cocktail party. NACA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the rule should require the value of undelivered ancillary events to be refunded, but should not require a refund of the entire tour price. FBA and the Wisconsin Attorney General both pointed out that certain events on a special event tour (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose Bowl tour) are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized while other events on the same tour (e.g., a side trip to Disneyland) are not. These two commenters suggest that integral events be protected by the'' money back guarantee'' of the total tour price, but not other events. Q. Should the rule specifically ban last-minute or post-departure price increases for admission to the event, one of the problems that allegedly occurred on the 1994 Rose Bowl tours? All commenters who offered an opinion on this subject felt that last-minute price increases should be regulated in some manner. The RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NCAA, ASTA, the Wisconsin Attorney General and Mr. Donald Hamilton stated that last-minute price increases should be banned. FBA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that price increases at any time following purchase should be prohibited unless the consumer receives written notice that the operator reserves this right. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses also suggested that participants who cancel within a few days of notification of a price increase be entitled to a full refund. The Wisconsin Attorney General commented that on tours to special events, ``last-minute or post-departure price increases are common and are tantamount to extortion'' because other options may be sold out. The NHL stated that, in general, price increases should be banned unless the face value of the ticket has been increased subsequent to departure of the tour. However, for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the NHL said that the rule should permit tours on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at the yet-unknown face price plus a service fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact. Q. Some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent that they include, admission to the event. For example, there have been tours to the Super Bowl host city during the Super Bowl weekend that prominently feature ``Super Bowl'' in the headline of advertisements and flyers, but which do not include game tickets. Should the new rule ban this practice, or require affirmative, prominent disclosure that admission to the event is not included? All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on this issue felt that it should be regulated in some manner. The RG Travel Companies stated that they favored either banning the practice or requiring disclosure. The NCAA urged affirmative, prominent disclosure, ``if such tours are to be allowed at all.'' All others who commented on this point (the NHL, ASTA, FBA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, and the Wisconsin Attorney General) recommended prominent disclosure. The NHL suggested a requirement that text disclosing the absence of event tickets from event-oriented tours should be at least 75 percent of the size of the name of the event in advertising material. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that such disclosures should be at least twice the size of the smallest text elsewhere in the ad or flyer, but in no case less than 12-point type, and that disclosure during verbal contacts should also be required. Q. What would be the economic burdens of such a rule? Would the rule be impractical for events where the participants are known only a week in advance, e.g. the NCAA Final Four? All of the parties that commented on this issue agreed that the rule can and should apply to events in which the participants are not known until shortly before the event. The RG Travel Companies commented that the rule would not be impractical because commitments centering around a particular team could be made contingent on that team qualifying for the event. NACA said the ``money back guarantee'' should apply regardless of the timing of the event. The NHL stated that the rule may be burdensome for organizers of short-lead-time tours, but that this is justified by the benefit to consumers. (Note also the NHL's earlier suggestion that on events where the participants become known only shortly beforehand, the rule should permit tours in which the participants must agree to purchase an event ticket whose face value is not yet known.) ASTA, like NACA, said that the degree of advance notice is not relevant, and that an operator who markets an event-oriented tour before the participants are known should simply disclose that event tickets are not included in the advertised price. FBA commented that participating teams in college bowl games are generally known at least a month in advance, and also that any experience the Department has had with Super Bowl tours would be instructive, as the competing teams in that game are sometimes determined only a week before the game. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the NCAA and the Wisconsin Attorney General all pointed out that even though the participating teams in the NCAA Final Four (the example in this question) are determined only the weekend before, the tickets are sold out months beforehand. Thus, the fact that the participants are not known until the final week has minimal impact on the availability of tickets and the feasibility of tours. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses asserted that any economic burden resulting from this rule would fall on ticket brokers and tour operators who buy event tickets from individuals in order to resell them. The Wisconsin Attorney General stated that consumer protection may be even more important in cases where event participants are determined at the last minute, because consumers have less time to investigate their options. Other Comments The Air Transport Association (ATA, an association of large scheduled airlines) filed a comment stating that it expressed no opinion about whether, or to what extent, the current Super Bowl rules should be made applicable to tours to other special events. However, ATA said that DOT should not make air carriers responsible for assuring that tour operators comply with the new rule. NACA echoed this view, stating that carriers should not be made the guarantors of tour operators. Discussion We have decided to propose a rule very similar to that described in the ANPRM, which in turn closely tracks the existing rules for Super Bowl tours.
