This action could seriously jeopardize the reform. With the backing of President Itamar Franco, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and leaders of the proadministration PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and the PMDB [Brazilian Social Movement Party] reached an agreement in Congress with the group of congressmen who oppose a constitutional reform. Under this agreement most of the provisional measures will be approved by 27 January by suspending the sessions allocated to review the Constitution. "The approval of the economic plan is currently more important than the Constitutional reform," President Franco told his finance minister in the evening of 25 January when he authorized the agreement. The government's decision to request that the economic plan be voted on first -- although it might endanger the constitutional reform -- exploded like a bomb in Congress. While the parties that oppose the reform celebrated the success of their strategy, the atmosphere in the corridors of Congress was one of tension, irritation, and great uncertainty. Bahia State Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, the PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader at the Chamber of Deputies, protested: "The government is showing its inability to negotiate and to ensure the approval of its proposals." Magalhaes and the other leaders are in favor of the constitutional reform and could not hide their pessimism. They believe the constitutional reform is definitively at risk. According to one important congressman, who is in favor of the constitutional reform: "If the situation continues, the debates will not begin until after the Carnival holidays. This would mean that the constitutional reform work will coincide with the beginning of the presidential elections campaign and the announcement of candidacies." Deputy Nelson Jobim (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, PMDB - Rio Grande do Sul), the constitutional reform rapporteur, tried his best to look optimistic and calm. Pretending to agree with the postponement, he said: "There is an important reason for postponing the debates. The provisional measures will not be in effect tomorrow." Nonetheless, in private talks with party leaders -- particularly those of the ruling parties -- he did not hide his irritation against the governmentleaders, especially against Humberto Lucena (PMDB - Paraiba), who presides the Senate and the constitutional reform work. He said: "He (Lucena) is responsible for all this confusion because he is making no effort to have the provisional measures voted on or to begin the constitutional reform work." Jobim has a trump card that can be used to speed up the voting: The reform reducing the quorum required for the approval of the constitutional amendment creating the Social Emergency Fund is important for the government. Jobim explained that the approval of this year's budget depends on this amendment, which links the government's revenue to this fund. "If the amendment is not approved, there will be no budget resources," he said. This trump card will be placed on the negotiation table today. Deputy Gustavo Krause (PFL - Pernambuco), the deputy rapporteur, said: "If that does not work, there will be no constitutional reform." The PFL leader, who is coordinating the conservatist bloc for the beginning of the constitutional refom debates, did not hide his dismay. He said: "I will not say the reform will only be voted on after the Carnival holidays because I am in favor of the reform and will not say anything to favor those who oppose it." In the last two weeks, Magalhaes managed to persuade 340 deputies to come to Brasilia by promising that the constitutional reform debates would start soon. "This has not occurred and I wonder if -- when summoned next week -- they will respond as promptly as they did now, because that week immediately precedes the Carnival holidays."
