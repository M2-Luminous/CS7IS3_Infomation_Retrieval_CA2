"The cooperation approach" being proposed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] for Japan's auto industry is designed to dispel "mutual distrust" between Washington and Tokyo in the bilateral trade framework talks, Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice MITI minister, told a press conference. Okamatsu was briefing reporters on his recent visit to the United States, which was intended to help lay the groundwork for the February 11 summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Through a series of talks with top executives of the U.S. "Big three" carmakers and U.S. Government officials over a week until Wednesday, it was made clear that the two sides remain apart over the definition of the term "objective criteria" agreed between them previously, Okamatsu said. But he added the two parties agreed not to resort to "cosmetic" accords just to tide over the February meeting. Okamatsu said the new cooperation scheme comprises three phases -- the setting of objective criteria by each auto maker in parts purchases and other areas, evaluation of performance in accordance with the criteria on a semiannual basis and deciding whether or not to craft additional steps based on the assessment. Criteria for Japanese carmakers may also include the number of their dealership chains handling U.S.-made cars and whether the "design-in" approach is being adopted by them, Okamatsu said. On the other hand, criteria would also be applied to U.S. automakers, such as whether their products are tailored to meet the needs of Japanese motorists by, for instance, having right-hand steering wheels, he said. The new approach regards the establishment of mutually cooperative relationships on a private-sector level as a first step toward progress in bilateral trade talks, Okamatsu said. Turning to the issue of a government role in trade and other business activities, he said the Japanese side rejected a U.S. call for Tokyo to use administrative guidance to increase imports. Such a step would run counter to Prime Minister Hosokawa's major policy of deregulation, Okamatsu said. After the press conference, a senior MITI official accompanying Okamatsu on his U.S. visit said he had the impression that views among U.S. Government officials are a bit divergent over the definition of objective criteria. But the Clinton administration, with the free market mechanism held up as its chief economic policy, will probably work hard in order to coordinate the differing views, said the official who declined to be named.
