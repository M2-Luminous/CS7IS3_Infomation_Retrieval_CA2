FBIS4-23530 "drafr110_c_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 8 Jun South African Press Review for 8 Jun MB0806121194 MB0806121194 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Call for Housing Action -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English considers "the housing challenge" in an editorial on page 12 of its 8 June edition. "The surge in urban land invasions is a head-on challenge to politicians to get down to the real work of redressing the legacy of apartheid," the editorial begins. "It is time for the rhetoric to get real and for specific allocations of land to be added to the endless figures of housing promises." Without such action, the editorial asserts, homeless people will continue their land occupations. It must be remembered, the paper argues, that the homeless are "first and foremost victims of our racial past." The editorial concludes by arguing that although the homeless "have an obligation to give the new government a chance to live up to its promises," it is nonetheless wrong "to victimise those whose illegal presence is a fait accompli. Nothing constructive is served by demolishing and confiscating flimsy shelters and interfering with freedom of movement. And quite the wrong message is sent to ordinary people on both sides of the conflict." BUSINESS DAY Suggestion of "Serviced Squatter Sites" -- The editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 8 June also considers the "crisis" caused by Johannesburg City Council's decision to tear down shacks of illegal squatters. "The council was wrong to tear down even makeshift homes in a spell of freezing weather, and it deserves censure. Yet the reasons behind its haste need to be examined." Noting that there are "costly consequences" to the illegal occupation of land, the editorial goes on to point out that if the squatters are "allowed to stay, the orderly provision of housing may become impossible." The editorial concludes by calling on Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging Premier Tokyo Sexwale and other authorities to consider the possibility of "serviced squatter sites" that, while not "proper housing," would still provide squatters with "freehold title, running water, sewerage, stormwater drains and tarred bus routes. People living there can aspire to improving their accommodation, through their own efforts or with the help of government's vast programme to provide solid, permanent homes." SOWETAN "Jackboot Tactics" Condemned -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English, in an editorial on page 6 on 8 June, also criticizes the destruction of squatter shacks in Johannesburg. "The local authorities are normally in a difficult position when faced with the sudden occupation of land. But what is unacceptable is their insensitivity. Instead of breaking down shacks and letting families with children sleep outside in the cold, they should be looking for solutions....It certainly does not well for the local authority to use jackboot tactics of demolition to discourage illegal occupancy."
