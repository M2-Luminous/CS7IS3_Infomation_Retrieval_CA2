Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee and a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the party Central Committee, said that at present more laws are being formulated to govern and ensure the smooth advance of the country's reform, opening to the outside world and establishment of a socialist market economy. Qiao made the remarks in a group discussion of the Inner Mongolia delegation attending the ongoing session of the eighth NPC. Qiao admitted that China's legislation lagged behind social and economic development despite noticeable achievements made over the past 15 years. Legislation should be speeded up to keep pace with development of the socialist market economy, he added. Qiao also called on local people's congresses to formulate more regulations in line the constitution and state laws. People's congresses at various levels and their standing committees have the responsibility to supervise the work of governments and courts and procuratorates, Qiao said, adding that the ongoing deliberation of the government work report by deputies is not only a form of supervision but also a exercise of democracy. In his speech Qiao also touched China's system of establishing minorities autonomous regions and economic development in areas densely populated by minority people. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a region with good unity among different ethnic groups. The autonomy system introduced since the founding of New China has proved correct and conforms with China's conditions and also accords with the common wishes of the people and their fundamental interests. The system has helped boost local economies and retain ethnic cultural and tradition which are the common wealth of the Chinese nation. The Chinese nation should carry forward the good tradition of maintaining national unity and safeguarding the national unification, he said. On regional economy, Qiao Shi said that Inner Mongolia has witnessed great progress politically, economically, culturally and in terms of national unity over the past 40-odd years. And the region could make full use of its rich resources and take advantage of the good relations among various ethnic groups to strive for greater achievements. Qiao Shi expressed his appreciation of deputies' clear understanding of and support to the general task of correctly handling the relations between reform, development and stability, which is the theme of the session. Every reform measure has undergone meticulous consideration before it is put into effect, Qiao said, adding the measures would also be improved in implementation. China's reform began from the coastal areas to gain experience and then proceeded to expand to other areas because of China's uneven development. Historically, the inland areas had been comparatively underdeveloped. However, so long as these areas give full play to their advantages, their gap with the coastal areas would be narrowed and common prosperity would finally be realized.
