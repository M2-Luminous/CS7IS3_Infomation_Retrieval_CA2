Hawatimah briefed our radio on the meeting: [Begin Hawatimah recording] The meeting reviewed the current situation in light of the results of the Oslo and Cairo accords. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was the bitter, dirty fruit of these accords, which legitimized the presence of settlements in Gaza and Jericho and completely ignored settlements and settlers in the West Bank and greater Jerusalem. In light of the dialogue that took place, brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah said his party completely reject the Cairo agreement and have some observations on the Oslo accord. For our part, we used clear, direct language to ask him and his party to reconsider their position on the Oslo accord and to not support this accord. We also asked him to join the opposition to the Rabin government, because Rabin pursues the same policy as Likud, but embellishes his language. The intifadah in the occupied territories and its expansion into Israel and along the Galilee, the Triangle, the Negev, and the coast indicates the Arab Democratic Party and the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality should reconsider their ties with the Rabin government. In addition, all democratic, leftist, and peaceful forces in Israel should reconsider their stands in order to annul the Oslo and Cairo accords and restructure the entire political, negotiating process within the framework of international resolutions. This would truly lead to full withdrawal in return for full peace, a full, balanced peace based on the establishment of a Palestinian state next to the State of Israel, the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, and resolving the problem of the refugees in line with UN Resolution 194.
