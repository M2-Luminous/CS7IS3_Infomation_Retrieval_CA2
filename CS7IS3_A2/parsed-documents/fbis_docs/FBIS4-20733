The tour was planned to include Britain and the United States and end at the Vatican. The main purpose was to win backing and support for the Khartoum government and strengthen al-Turabi's position on the international scene. In particular, he wanted to set himself up as a mediator between the West and the movements of political Islam. Because Canada plays no direct part in Sudan's policies or in al-Turabi's ambitions and plans, it lies outside the circle of interest when the NIF general secretary began his tour; indeed, it was added to the tour schedule only during al-Turabi's visit to the United States. Perhaps the most interesting irony is that when al-Turabi decided to go to Canada from the United States, he encountered difficulties in making arrangements. The Canadian consulate general in Washington rejected his application for an entry visa, whereupon a number of Canadian members of Parliament and other parties intervened to pressure the government in Ottawa before an entry visa was allowed to be granted to him from the consulate in Washington. Canadian Conservative member of Parliament Don Blankarn [name as transliterated] confirmed to AL-MAJALLAH that he intervened to ensure that an entry visa was granted to al-Turabi. He indicated that during his visit al-Turabi was going to discuss topics of trade and investment in Canada. Blankarn was more explicit when a Canadian journalist interviewed him after the attack on al-Turabi. He said that the NIF leader and the Sudanese Government wanted to conclude deals with Canada in the areas of transportation, banks, communications, and pharmaceuticals. However, when al-Turabi talked about the goals of his visit to Canada and his Western tour, he described them as neither trade, teaching, nor tourism, but rather as a mission and a summoning to God--this according to a speech carried by the Sudan News Agency, delivered at the celebration of his recovery at Green Square in Khartoum on 31 July 1992. For their part, Canadian Foreign Ministry officials insisted later that al-Turabi had come to Canada on a private visit and that the Foreign Ministry had arranged a meeting with him as "an important personality" in Sudan. AL-MAJALLAH contacted Richard Chappell, a Canadian Foreign Ministry official who was one of those who met al-Turabi during his visit to Ottawa. (He was transferred afterward to another department--West Africa--without explanation of whether his transfer was a normal procedure or related to the consequences of the attack on al-Turabi.) When AL-MAJALLAH asked Chappell about the circumstances of al-Turabi's visit, he declined comment, saying that "his department would not allow him to talk about the subject." He referred us to the department concerned with East Africa and Sudan. AL-MAJALLAH then contacted Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Gagnon, who said: "Al-Turabi met with officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We received him as an influential personality." Gagnon denied that any trade topics were discussed during al-Turabi's meeting with Canadian Foreign Ministry officials. He said that they used the opportunity to express anxiety about political conditions, the civil war, and human rights violations in Sudan. Charged Atmosphere Besides the problems accompanying the obtaining of a visa, al-Turabi's visit to Canada took place in an atmosphere charged with tension and anger. As soon as he arrived in Toronto, his companions were surprised by a number of Sudanese who received them with a noisy hostile demonstration, even though the itinerary of the visit had not been "officially announced." The demonstration continued in front of the hotel where the NIF general secretary stayed. This hostile reception by Sudanese opponents was a phenomenon that accompanied al-Turabi throughout his European and American tour. During his visit to Britain a protest demonstration was organized in front of a number of public buildings and institutions that he visited to hold meetings or deliver lectures. The demonstrators shouted hostile slogans, such as: "Al-Turabi, murderer of Khartoum!" Some carried pictures of the officers whom the government of Lieutenant-General 'Umar al-Bashir executed in 1990 on the charge of organizing an attempted coup. Al-Turabi was forced to use the rear door to leave after one of his lectures. The events accompanying al-Turabi's lecture before the Royal Society of Arts in London on 27 April 1992 typified the charged atmosphere of the tour. During the lecture a Sudanese lawyer, 'Abd-al-Baqi 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Rih, stood and lifted his robe, exposing the artificial leg that had replaced his natural leg that was amputated because of the effects of the torture he received during his imprisonment in Sudan in 1989. Having retold the story of his torture amid cries by some in the audience hostile to al-Turabi, al-Rih ended by asking the general secretary, "Does this have anything to do with Islam?" The story of lawyer al-Rih became a subject of conversation, and the British newspapers wrote about it until it almost overwhelmed the visit and the subsequent stages of al-Turabi's tour. The British newspaper THE GUARDIAN published a long article that began as follows: "The tall man stood in his white robe and turban, displaying his wooden leg in the face of the speaker at the lectern and asking, `Is this what Islam means?--torture and dictatorship?'" The story continued: "'Abd-al-Baqi al-Rih was a lawyer in Khartoum until December 1989, when the Sudanese authorities arrested him for membership in an opposition party. After 48 days, during which he was tortured, he lost his leg. 'Abd-al-Baqi waved his artificial leg in the face of the man who is considered the real power behind the Islamic regime in Khartoum--Hasan al-Turabi." When al-Turabi went from London to Washington, the story of lawyer al-Rih pursued him. Finally, he was forced to say at a press conference in the American capital on 13 May 1992 that al-Rih's story might not be true and that cancer may have been the reason his leg was cut off. He added that al-Rih had been detained no more than 40 days!--and suffered from cancer. He did, however, go on to say, "If torture was the reason, it was wrong according to the teachings of Islam." Al-Turabi's visit to Washington came off no better than his visit to London. In addition to the story of lawyer al-Rih that pursued him, al-Turabi found himself surrounded by a hostile atmosphere. At a demonstration following a lecture by al-Turabi at the Institute for Strategic and International Studies on 12 May, angry demonstrators surrounded him. One of them pulled him by his necktie, and two others then joined in, kicking, pushing, and cursing. The American police intervened to rescue al-Turabi and took him away in one of their cars. Uproar in Canada In addition to the protest demonstrations that greeted him in Toronto, al-Turabi faced a flood of criticisms in Canada that continued even after the attack on him. Two associations--the African-Sudanese Association in Canada and the Sudanese-Canadian Friendship Association--issued statements expressing anger and displeasure at the visit. Some Canadian deputies raised questions in Parliament about the facts and circumstances of the visit and the granting of an entry visa to al-Turabi. Liberal deputy Jim Peterson demanded to know the reasons that led the Canadian Government to receive al-Turabi and allow him to enter Canada, given reports by Amnesty International and Africa Watch of "arrests, torture, and summary executions in Sudan." Member of Parliament Svend Robinson sent a letter dated 27 July 1992--after the attack--to Barbara McDougall, the minister of state for foreign affairs, expressing concern that al-Turabi had been granted an entry visa to Canada "despite his reputation." Robinson noted that "a number of reports have hinted that officials in the [Canadian] Foreign Ministry may have leaked al-Turabi's itinerary in Canada," and he demanded an explanation. Many questions indeed were raised about how the Sudanese had known the details of al-Turabi's itinerary in Canada, when it had not been announced officially. Although some circles have hinted that the Canadian Foreign Ministry, which reluctantly granted al-Turabi an entry visa after several members of Parliament intervened, leaked his itinerary to Sudanese opponents so that they could greet him with protests, well-informed sources have told AL-MAJALLAH that the itinerary was leaked by a Sudanese, not by a Canadian. These sources said that a Sudanese informed some of his Sudanese friends about al-Turabi's scheduled arrival time and details of his itinerary. They in turn contacted their colleagues to organize the protest demonstration that greeted al-Turabi when he arrived in Toronto. Because his itinerary had been leaked, al-Turabi not only faced protest demonstrations in Toronto, but was surprised by a protest demonstration waiting for him in front of the Foreign Ministry building in Ottawa, where he was scheduled to meet with officials on 25 May 1992. Al-Turabi was forced to use the rear door to enter the Canadian Foreign Ministry building to avoid the demonstrators who were waiting for him at the front door. Hashim Badr-al-Din, with his wife and two children, were among them. The leaking of the itinerary undoubtedly made it easier for the Sudanese to organize the protest demonstrations that raised the temperature until matters climaxed in the attack at the airport. In his account of the incident, Hashim Badr-al-Din said that he returned to his home frustrated, like the other Sudanese who participated in the demonstration before the Canadian Foreign Ministry. They had been unable to express their feelings against al-Turabi because he had used the rear door of the building to enter and leave. Badr-al-Din indicated that he went that evening--25 May 1992--to say goodbye to a Sudanese who was on his way back from Ottawa to Toronto after having taken part in the protest demonstration. While he was at the airport, Badr-al-Din saw al-Turabi rush in to catch his plane. Just as circumstances had intervened to cause al-Turabi to add Canada to his itinerary belatedly, they also played a role in the confrontation between him and Badr-al-Din at Ottawa Airport. Had al-Turabi not delayed his departure time from six in the evening, as scheduled, to seven, he would never have encountered Badr-al-Din. Security Measures The leaking of news of the visit was not the only controversial and unclear matter during al-Turabi's visit to Canada: some circles also questioned why no security protection was provided for him. From the available information and statements it appears that a mix-up occurred and led to lack of coordination among the Canadian security agencies concerned, thus contributing to the lack of protection for al-Turabi. Canadian newspapers picked up this aspect after the attack on al-Turabi and pointed to conflict among security agencies. In its 27 June 1992 issue, THE CITIZEN published an article entitled, "Unsuccessful Security Warning Behind Attack at Ottawa Airport." The article stated that Canadian intelligence had sent the police a warning of possible danger to al-Turabi because of the demonstrations and protests during his visit. However, when the NIF general secretary arrived aboard a commercial flight from Toronto to Ottawa the morning of 25 May 1992, the Gloucester police, who are responsible for the airport, were unaware of his presence there. They were not informed about it until later, when they learned indirectly from the Ottawa police that al-Turabi would leave for Toronto at 1800 that day. THE CITIZEN quoted Celine Boudrail, a spokeswoman for the Canadian intelligence service, as saying that the service "received information about possible danger to al-Turabi," and conveyed this information to the other concerned agencies. However, the spokeswoman refused to answer questions about the kind of danger, the agencies that conveyed the information originally, or those that were informed of it afterward. It seems that the complexities of the federal system were behind the mix-up. Inspector Phil Lockett of the Ottawa district police informed AL-MAJALLAH that they did not know of al-Turabi's arrival in Ottawa and that the information they received about it reached them very late. He added: "The mistake also stemmed from our not having been informed of the alias under which al-Turabi was traveling. When we searched the airport records for his real name, we did not find it." Inspector Lockett's words imply that instead of reporting the warning to the Gloucester police, who are responsible for airport security, the intelligence services reported it to the Ottawa police. Although the Canadian authorities considered al-Turabi's visit "private," they felt uneasy after the events that accompanied his visits to Britain and the United States, in addition to the protest demonstration in Toronto. They therefore tried to provide protection for him at the airport on his arrival and during his departure. However, the belated warning frustrated any preparations to arrange a security reception for al-Turabi when he arrived at Ottawa airport the morning of 25 May, just as the conflict between agencies frustrated protection arrangements during his departure that evening. At the suggestion of the Gloucester police, some police officers went to Ottawa Airport after having learned "belatedly" that al-Turabi would leave at six that evening from Ottawa to Toronto. There they looked for al-Turabi's name and did not find it on the passenger lists. Also, they were not informed that al-Turabi had changed his flight from 1800 to 1900. They therefore waited until 1830. When he did not arrive, the security alert was lifted, and the policemen involved left the airport. In this regard, Inspector Lockett said that his forces had not been informed that the demonstrators had broken into the lobby of the hotel where al-Turabi had been staying in Toronto before coming to Ottawa. He added in an interview published in Canada: "Had we known that problems had occurred in Toronto and that the person [al-Turabi] was well known and subject to security dangers, we would have taken other measures." Similarly, officials of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said that they had not tried to provide al-Turabi with personal protection because he was on a private visit. Thus, the procedures that the RCMP follows for official visitors were not applied to him. The RCMP did take charge of providing round-the-clock protection for al-Turabi during his stay in Civic Hospital after the attack. However, the OTTAWA SUN newspaper quoted Inspector Jerry Boucher of the RCMP as having said later that they would urge al-Turabi to leave Canada as soon as he was able. A Canadian member of Parliament, Eugene Belmer, summarized the events accompanying al-Turabi's visit by attributing the affair to lack of proper coordination among the security services.
