A statement by a spokesman for the KPA Panmunjom Mission. As has already been reported in its Foreign Ministry's statement on 28 April, the DPRK Government proposed to the U.S. side to hold negotiations on establishing a new peace arrangement that can prevent arms buildup and the recurrence of war on the Korean peninsula and practically guarantee solid peace. As a practical step for its realization, it has newly established a KPA mission in Panmunjom by recalling all members of our side from the Military Armistice Commission [MAC], which has failed to play its role in stabilizing the situation, as well as preventing arms buildup on the Korean peninsula. Such a step by our side is a realistic and timely one taken to tide over the present situation in which the Korean Armistice Agreement had been a mere scrap of paper and the MAC remained in name only due to the unreasonable behavior of the U.S. side. The U.S. side is aware of our such step. Even it has once expressed the position that it would make contacts with members of the KPA Panmunjom mission. Nevertheless, the U.S. side on 6 June suddenly made a proposal to hold a meeting of senior secretaries of the MAC, which no longer exists. Regarding this, our side, reminding the U.S. side of the fact that all the members of our side had been recalled from the MAC, notified that an official of the KPA Panmunjom mission might meet with the side of the U.S. Forces [migunchuk]. Then, the U.S. side showed up at the conference room alone and read a prearranged text and committed an act of issuing a so-called statement indicating that our side's act was a violation of the Armistice Agreement. Such an act by the U.S. side was nothing but a ridiculous drama aimed at evading its responsibility for destroying and systematically obliterating the Armistice Agreement and the armistice organization. In fact, the U.S. side, at this time, is neither qualified nor has the face to talk about the violation of the Armistice Agreement. It is the U.S. side that in June 1956 forcibly expelled the neutral nations inspection teams which had been supervising and controlling the introduction [panip] and removal [panchul] of military equipment by staying at appropriate entry ports of South Korea in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 3, of the Korean Armistice Agreement. It is also the U.S. side that unilaterally proclaimed in June 1957 that it would renounce the implementation of Subparagraph D of Paragraph 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement that stipulates the cessation of the introduction of combat equipment into Korea. It is the U.S. side that not only completely paralyzed the armistice organization by appointing a general of the South Korean Army, who has neither legal justification nor qualification, as the senior member of its side, but also is now beefing up the armed forces in South Korea. It is preposterous for the U.S. side, which had unilaterally wrecked the major articles of the Armistice Agreement and the armistice organization, to talk about an agreement between the two sides. What are the MAC and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which can no longer prevent arms buildup or the recurrence of war because of the U.S. side's plot, needed for. Whether or nor it accepts our new proposal will be a touchstone determining the fundamental question of war or peace [uriui saeroun cheanul chopsuhanunga anhanunga hanun kossun chonjaenginya pyonghwanya hanun kunbonmunjelul karunun sigumsoguro toenda]. It will be a wise behavior of the U.S. side to embark upon the road of establishing a new peace arrangement that can prevent the danger of war and definitely guarantee peace and security, instead of trying to revive the armistice organization, the function of which has been completely paralyzed by it. We will watch the future actions of the U.S. side.
