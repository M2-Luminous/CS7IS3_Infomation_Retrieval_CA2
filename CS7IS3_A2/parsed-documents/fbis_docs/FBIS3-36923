Chief Editors Talk in Different Languages"] [Text] Yesterday, representatives of some PRAVDA executives proposed to the State Duma that a draft law forbidding foreign control over the Russian mass media be introduced. It is to be recalled that on 4 February, members of the editorial office held a meeting of the work collective where Viktor Linnik was removed from the position of chief editor and Aleksandr Ilin appointed instead. Mr. Linnik and Mr. Ilin told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the split in the collective had happened over the difference of opinion on whether to continue cooperation with the PRAVDA publisher -- the Greek Stilayt Holdings Ltd [as transliterated]. As the former chief editor put it, a "Greek coup" had happened in the newspaper. Aleksandr Ilin for his part stated that "he and Mr. Linnik are like two heads talking in different languages." Viktor Linnik told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that in April 1992, when the newspaper PRAVDA experienced serious financial difficulties, its chiefs started looking for sponsors. It was then that the Greek company Stilayt Holdings Ltd offered its services as the newspaper's publisher. As a result, a joint venture "PRAVDA International" was set up in which the controlling block of shares (55 percent) belonged to the Greek side, and the rest belonged to PRAVDA work collective. Mr. Linnik points out that "It has already been 16 months since the joint venture was created but newspaper employees have not yet received their shares." According to Mr. Linnik, the newspaper kept appearing after the joint venture had been formed despite all the difficulties and small salaries (16,000 to 20,000 rubles). Relationships between PRAVDA chiefs and the Greek side were "tolerable" all that time. But only until the point where the Greek side demanded its inclusion among the publication's founders. Viktor Linnik stated: "I was against letting the Greeks have the newspaper." In his opinion, the Greek partners want to own the newspaper in order to get a big credit against it. According to Mr. Linnik, the Greek side had provoked a meeting of the work collective on 4 February where a decision was made on dismissing the chief editor. Mr. Linnik described the voting and the meeting itself as illegal because only 90 out of the 216 employees on the payroll voted to dismiss him. According to Viktor Linnik, he has information attesting that taking part in the voting were mainly employees of the Greek firm (bar women, cleaning women, and other service personnel). Mr. Linnik added that in his view, the meeting was illegal. He also stated that if the PRAVDA work collective themselves fail to resolve the conflict, he would go to court to resolve the dispute. Mr. Linnik noted that taking part in putting out the newspaper now are the part of the collective who had supported the appointment of Mr. Ilin to the position of chief editor right from the start of the conflict. Interestingly, members of the current editorial board do not wish this announced in the newspaper. Aleksandr Ilin, today's chief editor of PRAVDA, pointed out in an interview to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the Greek company had been the only one that helped the newspaper in its hard times. In his view, now "it would be unethical to break off relations with the Greek friends." Mr. Ilin said that Viktor Linnik had long been looking for Russian partners but that not all his efforts had been crowned with success. He stressed that subscribers who had paid their money do not care about whom the publication cooperates with, and the collective has no right to deny them the newspaper over their own internal conflicts. To your KOMMERSANT- DAILY correspondent's question on whether the Greek partners were going to become founders of the newspaper, Mr. Ilin categorically declared that this "was not, is not, and will not be the point." He also pointed out that PRAVDA's former and current chiefs made a mistake by airing their internal problems publicly. The chief editor said that despite their personal ambitions, the colleagues who "split off" continue to help put out the newspaper.
