This coincides with information AL-HAYAH has received in Algiers to the effect that the security situation has witnessed rapid deterioration in various parts of the country, and that 70 of the military have been slaughtered in a massacre carried out in an Army barracks in Sidi Bel Abbes province (west of the capital). Reliable Algerian sources told AL-HAYAH that military units supported by aircraft moved the day before yesterday to the suburbs of Tlemcen, west of the capital, following information they had received about the presence in the area of armed groups which participated in the attack on the barracks on the eve of 'Id al-Adha and seized large quantities of arms. Eyewitnesses told AL-HAYAH that they had seen helicopters moving between the barracks and Oran Hospital. The reliable Algerian sources said that two officers from the barracks are thought to be implicated in the attack. It is believed that they assumed the task of impairing the guards' arms (by emptying their magazines) before the gunmen launched their attack on the barracks, massacring the soldiers. About 70 soldiers were slaughtered with cold steel. Soldiers who escaped the massacre said the two officers fled with the gunmen. A week after the operation, security forces succeeded in locating the gunmen's whereabouts and are currently besieging them in Tlemcen suburbs. [passage omitted]
