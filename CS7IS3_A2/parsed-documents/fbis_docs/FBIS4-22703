Klimenko, chief of the Main Branch of the Russian Federation Central Bank for Kabardino-Balkaria, by R. Kronik; place and date not given: "Nikolay Klimenko: The Laws of Banks Are the Rules of the Road for Money"] [Text] This phrase in a conversation with Nikolay Alekseyevich Klimenko, chief of the Main Branch of the Russian Federation Central Bank for Kabardino-Balkaria, struck me in particular, perhaps because it presented money as something that is both alive and significant rather than as generic inanimate capital. Klimenko confirmed: "To me, this is indeed so. I have been working in finance organizations for 33 years. I was assigned to a job here upon graduating from the Saratov Economic Institute. I started out in the position of credit inspector at the Terskiy Rayon Branch of the bank, gradually climbed up all the rungs of the official ladder, and have been heading the republic branch since 1984. [Kronik] Has the work ever seemed dull to you? It is very specific, after all. [Klimenko] It never has. As it is, you can take different views of any job. I was always attracted by personal work with clients, even at the time of rigid restrictions imposed by all kinds of instructions, and it is even more attractive at present. [Kronik] You may find this offensive, but until recently we only recalled the existence of the bank twice a month, associating purely run-of-the-mill situations with it: "The cashier has gone to the bank." For this reason it is still difficult to get used to the fact that the bank has now become, in a way, the principal figure not only in economics but also in politics. [Klimenko] I could not agree with you more. We did indeed turn into a cashier's window for the payment of wages in a socialist planned economy, acting under instructions and directives. Certainly, reforms in the economy called for restructuring financial structures, too. Unfortunately, many hasty and ill-conceived steps were taken along the way. As a result of recurring reorganizations, our bank, which previously pooled the best cadres of specialists, was forced to start from scratch. [Kronik] Has your status been determined now? [Klimenko] As you know, a two-tier system has been created in Russia: the Central Bank and a network of commercial banks. Regardless of its name and structure, in all countries of the world there is one main bank which puts money into circulation and withdraws it, as well as accomplishes a number of other, highly necessary tasks. The Central Bank has been declared the main bank of the country, and has been charged with pursuing a uniform federal monetary policy, regulating monetary circulation, ensuring the stability and reinforcing the purchasing power of the ruble, and financing capital investment. The Central Bank establishes settlement procedures for the national economy, protects the interests of depositors, issues the banks licenses to perform banking operations, including those with foreign exchange, registers charters, and supervises the conduct of operations in foreign economic activities. The KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic] National Bank, which is a structural subdivision of the Russian Federation Central Bank, must also accomplish all of the aforementioned principal tasks. [Kronik] Incidentally, what is your attitude toward being made a member of the KBR government? [Klimenko] I view this as an expression of the recognition of the role and significance of the KBR National Bank in the development of the economy of the republic. This was a personal initiative of KBR President V.M. Kokov, who has an excellent idea and understanding of the operation of the banking system and wishes to take advantage of our closer cooperation to meet the needs of the KBR as much as possible. To be sure, participation in the work of the government takes extra time, but at the same time, interaction with the organs of state power makes it possible to resolve pressing issues jointly and more promptly. [Kronik] Nikolay Alekseyevich, the views of the second tier, the commercial banks, are most contradictory. [Klimenko] A market economy without commercial banks is impossible. Please recall that under the old system money was squandered right and left; it was frequently invested in patently unprofitable projects. Of course, no commercial operator who wants to survive would do this. [Kronik] How many commercial banks operate in the republic? [Klimenko] Eleven independent banks and four branches, including the Kabardino-Balkar Regional Branch of the Rosselkhozbank, with five offices in the rayons, and the Joint-Stock Commercial Savings Bank with a chain of branches. [Kronik] Is this a little or a lot? [Klimenko] I think that this is a sufficiently extensive network which is in a position to perform the entire complex of banking operations in the republic. The establishment of new subdivisions has now been suspended, although we do have 10 petitions; this is primarily associated with higher requirements for the newly established banks. [Kronik] Does the operation of commercial banks produce real returns? [Klimenko] The independent commercial banks operated in a stable manner and turned a profit last year. Proceeding from the requirements of the Russian Federation Central Bank, they increased their statutory capital to 100 million rubles [R] or more. As a result, even under the conditions of inflation, the banks were able to considerably raise, out of their proceeds, the level of interest rates on funds attracted from the population and be worthy competitors for the institutions of the Savings Bank. [Kronik] Is their role in investment in the national economy of the republic perceptible? [Klimenko] The KBR National Bank still plays a leading role in controlling funds from the budget which are earmarked as capital investment. In 1993 their volume came to R19 billion. The volume of credit outlays of commercial banks for the economy of the republic grew by a factor of 5.8 last year. However, centralized resources allocated by the Bank of Russia account for one-half in the process, and in some commercial banks--for 70 percent. These resources are provided primarily for the extension of loans to enterprises and organizations of the preferred sectors of the national economy of the KBR, in coordination with the Cabinet of Ministers. Last year, the increment of centralized credit resources in our republic came to 335.4 percent. It was higher than in the Russian Federation on the whole, and the highest in the North Caucasus region. The credit support provided by the state facilitated a degree of stabilization in production in the KBR. However, it is of course necessary for the commercial banks to attract the spare funds of enterprises as deposits in order to operate in a more stable manner. The banks themselves make a poor effort, while economic units are reluctant to give up their spare funds, preferring to use such funds for their own needs in the environment of continuously high inflation. As a result, the commercial banks use in their transactions the temporarily spare funds of economic units in settlement and current accounts, thus exposing to risk not only themselves but also their clients. [Kronik] You have mentioned that the National Bank has the right to monitor the operation of the commercial banks. [Klimenko] The monitoring of the authenticity of accounting and statistical reporting and compliance with economic norms is entrusted to us. In July of last year we established the inspections department. In the time since, two commercial banks and three branches have been audited. It came out that the monitoring of compliance with cash discipline by enterprises and organizations and the proper use of monies from the consumption fund is lax. The conditions and the principle of credit extension are violated. At times the resources issued are not used as earmarked, which brings about late repayment or the impossibility of recovering them, and ultimately creates losses to the banks themselves, as was the case with the branch of the Eurasia commercial bank. Violations were revealed in the conduct of accounting and operational work and the drawing up of monetary settlement documents. [Kronik] Can you take any enforcement measures? [Klimenko] Directives and warnings on the use of sanctions are forwarded based on the results of audits. The sanctions are substantial: If economic norms are not complied with, or operations that run counter to the law are conducted, we are entitled to raise with the founders the issue of taking measures to ameliorate the bank's financial situation, replacing its manager, or even reorganizing and liquidating it. However, the legislation in effect does not envision control over the operation of branches whose banking headquarters are located outside of the republic. In general, this legislation does not precisely specify the rights of banking commercial structures. So it turns out that everything that is not banned is allowed. Meanwhile, laws on banks are the rules of the road for money. Such laws may be good or bad, but they should definitely be the same for all. Otherwise, nothing will be in order in the country; there will be chaos. [Kronik] There is a reason they say "as safe as in a Swiss bank" when they want to stress the reliability of the safekeeping of valuables.... [Klimenko] Certainly, the reputation of a bank means a lot; it is built over centuries, not even decades. Please recall that in prerevolutionary Russia even the bank buildings themselves were imposing and respectable, underscoring how serious and significant the operations performed inside them were. [Kronik] In this reference, we would like to know how the notorious case in which a number of commercial banks of the KBR credited false transfers in April and May 1992 ended. [Klimenko] At the time a wave of crediting sums under forged transfers swept over Russia. Despite a warning from the Central Bank, no due attention and vigilance was shown here, which brought about forged transfers being credited to the accounts of commercial structures from Nalchik, Nartkala, and Baksan totaling R1,387,009,000 (the Nalchik commercial bank, a branch of the Rosselkhozbank, the Chegem, and the Savings Bank). A large proportion of such forged transfers was intercepted through the joint efforts of the KBR National Bank and the commercial banks of the republic. The remainder, approximately R300 million, still has not been recovered. The KBR law enforcement organs have instituted criminal proceedings based on all of these cases. [Kronik] What does the KBR National Bank do to protect banking documents? [Klimenko] We have implemented a system of up-to-date technical protection features for payments; we are using the method of data coding. A new system for transporting banking documentation within the KBR has been organized. Methods for the exchange of information between banks have been modified. We should note in particular that all work, even top secret work, is done by specific employees whom they tried and are still trying to bribe and whom they threaten with physical harm. In order to avoid unpleasant facts, personal chains for mutual and repeated control over the processing of banking documents have been established at all Clearing Centers. If a forgery gets through at one stage, it will certainly be detected at others. Of course, special attention is being paid to the selection of cadres, their reliability and integrity. [Kronik] What measures have you taken to speed up settlements in the national economy? [Klimenko] Our answer to this question should be divided into two parts. They are settlements within the KBR and settlements effected with other regions of the Russian Federation. Since the middle of last year our Clearing Centers have been effecting settlements between the banks of the city and in the rayons within the same day, with funds being credited to the accounts of clients on the following day. The introduction of a new method for the exchange of information on magnetic media (computer diskettes) and the extensive use of technical assets facilitated this procedure. Intrarepublic settlements with all rayons of the KBR are effected on the second or third business day, with funds being credited to the accounts of clients on the third or fourth business day. We have rejected postal services and deliver all correspondence there ourselves. Incidentally, such deadlines for effecting settlements are in line with commonly accepted foreign norms. [Kronik] And outside of the republic? [Klimenko] With a view to speeding up the movement of banking documents outside the KBR, solely the state courier service has been used since July 1992. The service delivers documents within two to five business days to all oblast and kray seats of Russia, with their protection guaranteed. Standard deadlines for cable and postal transfers have also been established. However, numerous instances of forged transfers, so-called "Chechen advice notes," being sent have unfortunately forced the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to establish special control over settlements effected, for the most part, in the region of the North Caucasus, where Kabardino-Balkaria is. This considerably delays the crediting of funds outside the KBR. However, practice indicates that such control is not at all in vain. In the last 1.5 years alone the employees of our bank and the Clearing Centers have prevented the theft of R10.307 billion, as well as detected forged advice notes ostensibly generated at the KBR National Bank for R52.067 billion. [Kronik] When will regular procedures for settlements of the KBR at the interregional level be restored? [Klimenko] This depends on the effectiveness of the efforts of law enforcement organs to put an end to forced transfers and, most importantly, on the speed of the introduction of a more reliable transmittal of banking information. Thus, the plan is to introduce the Bankir satellite communication system which should ensure interbank settlements in the territory of Russia on the same day before the end of 1994. A special-purpose program for information services developed by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is also being implemented. It is based on a system of electronic payments which makes it possible to exchange banking information without paper documents, through communication channels, with the necessary protective features. [Kronik] At the moment the banking system is frequently blamed for the existing, most complex situation involving mutual nonpayments. [Klimenko] This criticism is not leveled at the culprits. The liberalization of prices, the severance of economic relations, the introduction of prepayments for goods and services, and a multitude of other objective and subjective causes have brought about an "eating away" of the internal working capital of most enterprises and organizations. All of these have caused mutual nonpayments to snowball; in the KBR, mutual nonpayments exceeded R100 billion. Last year, the repayment of loans to the banks deteriorated. The defaulted debt increased sharply. A particularly difficult situation developed in the agro-industrial complex. The KBR Cabinet of Ministers resolved to conduct the offsetting of mutual claims in order to reduce the mutual indebtedness of economic units. However, it is necessary for the Government of the Russian Federation to allocate funds for conducting an offset throughout the territory of Russia because the enterprises of our republic also engage in settlements outside of its territory. If this is not done, the chain of nonpayments will in all likelihood reach commercial banks, which may drive them to the brink of bankruptcy. [Kronik] Residents of our republic are traveling abroad more and more often. For this reason, the foreign exchange policy is of special interest. Have there been any changes in the new year? [Klimenko] Without infringing on the freedom of commercial banks, the KBR National Bank monitors compliance with legislative and regulatory acts concerning foreign exchange operations. In January of this year new procedures were introduced for currency control over the receipt in the Russian Federation of foreign exchange proceeds from the exports of goods. All exporters now must draw up transaction profiles for contracts at authorized banks prior to the shipment of the freight abroad, and submit the profiles to the Customs Committee. Previously an exporter could leave foreign exchange proceeds at a foreign bank, whereas the new procedure which provides for three layers of control will make it possible to rule out the outflow of capital abroad. [Kronik] Where can foreign exchange be purchased and sold locally? [Klimenko] Seven authorized commercial banks in the republic hold licenses to conduct foreign exchange operations issued by the Russian Federation Central Bank: Nalchik, Bum-Bank, Prokhladnyy, Nart, Oshkhamakho, Namys, and Kavkaz-Inkombank, along with two branches: of the Rosselkhozbank and the Savings Bank commercial bank. Settlements in foreign exchange cash have been banned on the territory of Russia since January. Nonetheless, the demand of the population for foreign exchange is growing, and the reserves are being replenished in a timely manner. [Kronik] A majority of the population is concerned about regular rubles, after all. Will we receive them in a timely manner? [Klimenko] Unlike the year 1992, when a cash shortage was felt, the KBR National Bank and its Clearing Centers met the needs of the national economy of the republic for currency fully and without delays last year, including coins whose total weight came to about 108 tonnes, or almost two railway carloads. Therefore, all talk of the bank not issuing money is a result of a lack of funds in the settlement accounts of enterprises and organizations. [Kronik] However, are you not concerned with safekeeping this cash? [Klimenko] A reliable security and alarm system exists to this end. At any rate, there have been no emergencies so far.
