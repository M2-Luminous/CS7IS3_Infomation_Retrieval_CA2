Sha'th left the hotel at the end of the third round of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations today to meet Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat at his residence in the al-Andalus Palace. In his statement, Sha'th said that throughout the day, the two delegations exchanged working papers and are still doing so. It was noted during the seven-hour meeting that a Palestinian delegation member was in constant touch with 'Arafat.
