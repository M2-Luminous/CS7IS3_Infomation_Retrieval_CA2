The IFP Information Centre's Ed Tillett said Thursday the unprovoked attack came after six months of relative calm in the area. He feared it could mark a resumption of "African National Congress-spearheaded violence" and that Bruntville township would once again be plunged into violence. Police confirmed the shooting and believed AK-47 rifles were used. Captain Henry Budhram said the men were on their way from a Mooitex factory at about 10.40pm when bullets rained into the vehicle. Shot dead was Bethuel Phungula, 30, while William Dlamini, 30, was hit by four bullets, in the chest, knee, forearm and thorax. Alfred Dludla, 45, was hit in a lower leg and Jotham Lamula, 35, was struck in an upper arm and left eye. The wounded men are in estcourt hospital. No arrests have been made.
