In approved transfers, the Federal agency must grant its approval but property conveyance is accomplished by the Military Department. In sponsored transfers, the Military Department assigns the property to the Federal agency, upon request, and the Federal agency is responsible for conveyance of the property to its recipient. 2Property for shrines, memorials or other religious purposes is eligible for public benefit conveyance (PBC) only as part of a parcel transferred under another PBC mechanism. 342 U.S.C. §11411 designates uses for homeless assistance as a specific public health category under FPASA §203(k) and gives priority to such uses when considering PBCs. 4When the activities of a Federal agency result in the displacement of persons from their housing, the Federal agency may request surplus property for replacement housing. Transfer of property is directly from the Military Department to an eligible State agency.
