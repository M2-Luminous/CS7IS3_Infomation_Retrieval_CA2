The daily AFTENPOSTEN on 3 May carried a guest commentary by Iver Neumann, head of the foreign affairs/security studies department at the Norwegian Institute for Foreign Affairs Studies (NUPI), in which he contended that neither EU membership nor NATO "can in and of itself determine the country's foreign policy course." The issue is how Norway "best can balance" its relationships with the three major political centers of power: Norway must "work hard to be as close to the EU, the United States, and Russia as it possibly can without alienating any of the parties." The geopolitical picture is not the whole picture, however, because there are "fundamental" changes "in the distribution of power in the international system and in the development of new technology." The latter challenges are as significant as the geopolitical ones for Norway's choice of foreign policy. The international system is no longer founded on a balance of terror between the superpowers: The new system has a nucleus consisting of the "economic centers" of NAFTA, the EU, and Japan, with a "periphery of regional challengers such as China, Russia, and Iraq." According to Neumann, there are three immediate consequences. First, the significance of the economic order for security policy. At present the EU is the nucleus of economic Europe, hence also of political Europe. This means that it is "a security imperative for all European leaders to shepherd their regions, nations, and states as close as possible to the center of Europe, i.e., Brussels." Neumann compared the European situation to a series of orbits: the EU superpowers as the inner orbit, surrounded by the other EU members in a second orbit, then the EEA [European Economic Area] members in a third orbit, and finally the Central European countries (by virtue of their agreements with the EU) in a fourth orbit. He pointed out that Norway had some special leverage in this constellation: its energy reserves, which, "from a Brussels perspective are all the more interesting since alternative sources are primarily in a less stable periphery -- Russia and the Middle East." The second consequence of the new economic order is that Europe's relationship to "its challengers in the periphery" has become "regional." For example, Moscow's attempts at asserting influence in Central Europe will "clash with those of Brussels." The third consequence, according to Neumann, is that cooperation within the Nordic region is no alternative to a Brussels affiliation, because such cooperation would "not necessarily bring the Nordic countries any closer to Brussels." Norway's involvement in Baltic and Barents Sea regional cooperation, on the other hand, has viability because the cooperation "begins in the contested areas, and ties are made to both of the rival power centers, Brussels and Moscow." (Both in the Arctic Barents region and in the Baltic area, the Nordic governments, together with the EU, WHO, and other countries and international bodies are working with Russia and the former Soviet republics in such fields as nuclear safety, pollution, health, and commerce.) According to Neumann, this leads to "confidence-building, concrete work at the local level, closer ties with Brussels, a dialogue with Moscow, and a better domestic understanding of the fact that transnational and supranational political mechanisms have been added to the international ones." Neumann called this "significant, in view of Norway's historical trend of isolationism and noncommitting, abstract internationalism." Neumann pointed out that rapid advances in technology can have a limiting effect on a small country's defense policy. Regardless of what resources Norway devotes to defense, it will not be able to carry a full assortment of weapons: "There is no point in our trying to arm ourselves away from an unstable neighbor like Russia; we will have to find other mechanisms to tackle that challenge." In the past, through its NATO membership, Norway has "probably got as close to the United States as it could possibly get." But the U.S.-European relationship will "weaken in the future because the United States no longer is as interested in Europe and the northern regions as it was during the Cold War." Militarily, the shift is "out of NATO and over to the WEU." Norway's "current focusing on the EU is a consequence of the end of the Cold War. Its only competitor is a nascent isolationism." A no to the EU will still mean having to get "as close to Brussels as possible in as many areas as possible," nor are there any alternatives to Norway's present course in its policy toward an "increasingly regionally assertive Russia." NATO Shifting to WEU An AFTENPOSTEN editorial on 3 May pointed out that making a choice on membership in the EU is making a choice on "how we choose to protect our national interests, not the least of which are our security interests." The daily pointed out that although there may be no "immediate, acute risk, it would be foolhardy to preclude that we could find ourselves in a position of extreme danger in the coming years." The editorial recalled the short span, 10 years, from the "unbridled peace optimism" of Europe in the late l920's to a new world war. The editorial noted the need to have a perspective "beyond the next two weeks," given the "changes now under way" in the security policy pattern in Europe and in Europe's relationship to the United States. Because the United States "defines the EU and WEU as the European tools" in building a European pillar in NATO, Norway "does not have the choice between a North Atlantic or a European anchorage." Norway could, from an economic point of view, manage with the EEA agreement, the paper contended, "providing we always and without objection adjust" to the EU's decisions. In view of the "emerging pan-European security perspectives" Norway and the three other EU applicant countries, Finland, Austria, and Sweden, "need to find their place within the EU," the paper stated flatly. Not only is Norway "interested" in a common European approach to security challenges, it is "truly dependent" on it. As an example of the new regional approach to meeting challenges, AFTENPOSTEN pointed to the Barents Euro/Arctic project, initiated by former Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg and designed to "help bring much-needed stabilization to Russia." Such projects, the editorial concluded, "may become illuminating chapters in the area of peacekeeping, which in its time was the reason for establishing a European community." Helping Those Who Help Themselves In a guest commentary in AFTENPOSTEN on 15 May, entitled "As If Norway's Future Knew No Danger," Army Colonel Arvid Geirulv, chief of the Defense Geographic-Military Service, detailed the debilitating effects of the military reductions in the post-Cold War era, decrying the political leadership's stance that it "could not afford more defense." The minimum military force determined in the last Defense Commission Paper is not being maintained. According to Geirulv, it is "incomprehensible" that "responsible authorities dare risk having to send a few, undertrained conscripts" into battle against an "obviously overpowering enemy." With the U.S. reduction in forces in Europe and Norway's other NATO allies also cutting back, Norway "should not be overly optimistic" about the allies' willingness to come to its rescue, "especially if we have turned our back on that very Europe" by remaining outside the EU. Norway cannot expect others to rush "to help us any more than we are willing to help others, and, in particular, no more than we are willing to help ourselves." Geirulv warned that Norway must not repeat the pre-1940 mistake of believing that "it cannot happen here."
