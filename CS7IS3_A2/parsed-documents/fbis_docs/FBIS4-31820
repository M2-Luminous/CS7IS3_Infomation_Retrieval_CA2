Bunjac: "Smuggling as a Military Secret"] [Excerpts] Glina -- Military secrets often affect the fate of people in various positions, people with different professions, characters, affiliations, and intentions. The curious want to find out what these secrets are, the traitors want to reveal them, the strategists and military men want to use them to achieve an advantage over their enemy. As of recently, the Krajina's entire state and political leadership, as well as the public, have also been dealing with a "military secret." Milka Ljubicic, editor in chief of SRPSKI GLAS, the only Krajina newspaper, was banned from attending a political meeting that was recently organized by RSK [republic of Serbian Krajina] President Milan Martic. As was later explained at this informal meeting, they discussed issues "important for the defense of Krajina." In her earlier articles, Ljubicic had written publicly about these issues. Therefore, she revealed a military secret. This was in fact the reason for the open correspondence between Borivoje Rasuo, minister of information in the Krajina Government, and RSK President Milan Martic. Location of Corps' Command The allegations about treason are formally based on Milka Ljubicic's article in DUGA, entitled "Kilograms of Genuine DM [German marks]," in which, writing about smuggling, crime, and lawlessness in Krajina, Ljubicic also mentioned the location of the Kordun Corps' Command, which is the vicinity of "Sentilj," a well- known border area with the Cazin Krajina, an area in which profiteers sell various articles ranging from foodstuffs to arms of all calibers. Acting on the order of the Corps's commander, the communal public prosecutor asked the Vrgin Most court to conduct an investigation and file criminal charges against Ljibicic for "revealing a military secret," that is, revealing the location of the Corps' Command. The contentious article was published in DUGA in August 1993. Criminal charges were filed six months later, in February 1994. As we have unofficially learned, after the initial investigation, the communal court sent the case back to the relevant public prosecutor for reviewing. The public prosecutor now has to decide whether there are any grounds for further criminal proceedings or not. This offense, committed in wartime, carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years. [passage omitted] Unsolved Murders Supporting Borivij Rasuo, information minister in the RSK government, the more serious analysts and those familiar with the events in Krajina claim that this "case" has its own background and causes on a completely different side. In a series of articles in DUGA and SRPSKI GLAS, Milka Ljubicic revealed to the last detail the channels for smuggling and war profiteering in which both the current and former police, military, and political leaderships of Krajina were involved. In her article in SRPSKI GLAS, "Mile [Milan] Travels Through the Corridor," written on the occasion of the first anniversary of the corridor, the corridor is mentioned as a paradise for war profiteers and a hell for those who opened it. This was the first more serious tackling of the problem of illegal trade with the Muslims, conducted by the political and business circles in Belgrade, where certain individuals, considered to be social "cases" until not so long ago, as well as members of certain "structures," became millionaires overnight. In the incriminating article that was published in DUGA last year, Milka Ljubicic also mentioned several murders that have remained unsolved to this date. They were committed in Banija and Kordun and are often spoken about in connection with money laundering, or claimed to have political motives, as is the case of the late Dmitar Obradovic, president of the Vrgin Most Communal Assembly. The real reasons for anathemizing this journalist are purported to be her criticism of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Headquarters of the Krajina Army for the strange way in which they appropriated 760,000 German marks at the Moscenica border crossing. Ljubicic continuously insisted in her articles on the rule of law and criticized the authorities for not doing anything to prevent the anarchy and lawlessness that has taken deep roots in Krajina.
