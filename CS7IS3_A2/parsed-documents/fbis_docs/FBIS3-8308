Here is our special correspondent Klara Stejskalova with a summary of what happened at the conference. [Stejskalova] [passage omitted] Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec emphasized that the Czech Republic is interested in deepening cooperation in the area of migration and in contributing to the shaping of pan-European migration policy. [passage omitted] More controversial was, as usual, the question of ethnic minorities, which was brought to a head mainly by the Hungarian side. In this connection, Slovak representative Jozef Prokes emphasized that the Council of Europe session in Vienna did not reach any agreement on ethnic minorities. He reminded of the absence of a comparative study of the position of Central European minorities, something that is needed for an overall solution to this problem. At the same time, he firmly refused to accept that this problem is specific to our region. Josef Zieleniec stated his belief that the minority issue -- and other political problems -- should be dealt with by appropriate bodies, such as the Council of Europe. The CEI should rather concentrate on concrete economic cooperation. [passage omitted]
