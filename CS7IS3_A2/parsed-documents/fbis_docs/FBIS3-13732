He said that those who make these accusations are unscrupulous criminals who want to cover up their actions by accusing us. These accusations are rumors and are not based on evidence [words indistinct]. Ja'ja' said that under the pretext of investigations, an organized political campaign of suppression is launched. The campaign is now aimed against the Lebanese forces and it will be aimed against other parties tomorrow. According to press reports, Dr. Ja'ja' made two telephone calls to President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri inquiring about the reasons for the raids on the Lebanese Forces centers and requesting them to intercede to stop this campaign.
