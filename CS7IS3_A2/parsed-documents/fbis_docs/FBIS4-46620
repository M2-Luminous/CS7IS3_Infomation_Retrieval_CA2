Logs... Fire!" Designation "Top Secret" is as published in original Russian source] [Text] It is customary to believe that the Soviet military-industrial complex is something "cool," and that in contrast to everyday trash, equipment of exceptional quality goes to the troops. But in the country of the "biggest microprocessors" and "fastest clocks" it cannot be that one part of the economy does not work and another works. As it became known to MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI as a result of investigative journalism, a file is resting in the Main Military Procuracy under a "Top Secret" [as published] classification which overturns the impressions about our military-industrial complex. All this resembles an anecdote. The Americans contrived the Mk-48 dual-purpose supertorpedo capable of engaging both submarines at a depth of more than 900 meters as well as surface ships at a range up to 46 km. The torpedo was guided to the target by wires, i.e., its warhead had a television camera which transmitted an image of the target to the weapon operator. In addition to remote control, the warhead had the usual acoustic homing system, which switched on and locked onto the target on the approach. The torpedo had an onboard computer based on the microprocessors which had just appeared at that time and which controlled everything. The latest Soviet torpedo, also capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, evidently was being created to counterbalance the American one. The electronic circuit of the computer in the torpedo just did not begin to work and they gave up remote control right away. It proved incapable of it. Each time in testing the torpedo suddenly would change course and swim away in an unknown direction--toward our own cruiser, for example, instead of toward an enemy cruiser. It was necessary to place an old, antiquated guidance system on the new torpedo, i.e., guiding on its wake. They also had to forget about versatility--each time, the ship commander had to manually set the target, surface or submarine, against which to fire. But even this would have been a small loss. It turned out that the new Soviet torpedo did not know how to swim. Original, right? This is all the same as a missile which is unable to fly. Figure The statistics are as follows: 70 percent of these torpedoes sink hopelessly. Imagine, with a nuclear warhead at that! Only from ten to zero percent of the torpedoes hit the target. But the money for developing the torpedo already had been spent, eaten up, and... the new "superweapon" was made operational. Just think, it sinks--what nonsense! The entire Navy, including modern Tayfun submarines, which Americans allegedly especially feared, was outfitted with the innovation. True, you imperialists around the world should tremble: God forbid that our submarine should fire a torpedo with a nuclear warhead--you will wear yourselves out getting it off the bottom later. The nuclear torpedoes on the submarine Komsomolets, about whose corrosion so much is being said now, are of this very type. The Dutch refused to get them even for a billion dollars. But what about the military, you ask? The sailors of course were outraged. Each time they would receive "twos" in firings. The Northern Fleet even took the manufacturer, the Leningrad Torpedo Design Bureau, to court. The procuracy instituted proceedings. But this problem, too, was solved, and in our own way: the inspectors began receiving an order not to give "twos." CinC Navy Admiral Chernavin actually gave the okay for further rearming--the new dud torpedoes went to the fleets by the thousands and filled the depots. The old, rather weak, but reliable torpedoes were taken out of operation. Now they are unsuitable: their caliber (533 mm) is smaller and they will "rattle around" in the torpedo tubes. The criminal case was closed; from the very beginning they classified it and sent it off to the archives, where, as we were informed in the procuracy, it now safely abides. And seemingly everything is in order--no one knows anything. The Navy is fully armed, as they say. And so we rearmed with the new torpedoes. Even logs are better--at least they float. It is unknown how many such files are hidden in the motherland's storehouses. It turns out the state military-industrial complex, untouched by competition a single time in 70 years, comes from the very same page as "the freest health care." Only the appetites are different. The Ministry of Defense now demands increasing the military budget by 1.5 times, including for that same planned military-industrial complex for arms deliveries. And the public just was not given an opportunity to familiarize itself with items of the defense budget, as is customary in civilized countries. But the fact is, the fight is for R55 trillion! This of course is a good figure, half of a lemon from each Russian, including children and retirees. And it would be nice if the torpedoes swam.
