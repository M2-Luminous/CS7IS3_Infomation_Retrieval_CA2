He went on to say that this product is not included in the trade embargo imposed by the UN and the Organization of American States on the Haitian military regime which overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. Every month, the Dominican Republic sends (?650,000) pounds of beef, pork, chicken, rice, and other food products to Haiti, as well as gasoline, a fuel (?denied) by the embargo. Herrera stated that it was in the best interest of the Dominican Republic to attenuate [atenuar] the embargo because the worsening situation in Haiti is one of the factors that causes Haitians to seek refuge in the Dominican Republic.
