Thailand may lose its competitive edge to Vietnam due to the latter country's low property and labour costs, and the abundant natural resources there. The analyst suggested that Thailand will have to develop its auto industry in order to maintain its competitiveness. "The development of manpower technology and marketing, for continuous growth in this industry, needs to be taken seriously if Thailand is to remain the largest auto production base in Asean," the analyst said. Vietnam has the potential of be coming a very large market as the country has a population of 70 million people but only 200,000 cars. The increasing buying power of the Vietnamese will present a great marketing opportunity for Thailand, he continued. At present, Thailand's auto industry is more competitive than ever after the lifting of the high tariff on imported cars by the government in 1992. The lowering of the tariffs awakened local producers after 30 years of protection to the fact that they have to fight to keep their market, which in turn has led to healthy competition. The liberalization the country's auto industry has benefitted Thai consumers, as they now have a larger selection of cars to choose from at more competitive prices. When the tariffs first came down domestic auto makers seemed uneasy with the government's measures, but they've managed to adjust themselves to the changing environment. In the past few years, we've also seen changes in the automobile industry as a whole. Giant auto makers such as General Motors, are planing to invest in production plant here again; General Motors left Thailand in 1978. The American auto maker, in a joint-venture, is planning to build the largest auto plant in Asia, reflecting the market potential of Thailand. The Japanese auto makers, not to be outdone, are also planning to invest in assembly plants here with a combined production capacity of up to 600,000 cars a year by 1996, which is considerably higher than the current 460,000 cars per year. Toyota is also planning to turn out 200,000 cars per year by 1996 with a new plant located at the Gateway Industrial estate. The plant will be the company's largest one outside Japan and will require an investment of Bt [baht] 1 billion. These manufacturers recognise the potential growth in the country's automobile industry, but for Japan the relocation is partly due to the strength of the yen against other currencies. The growth of the domestic auto market stemmed from the rise of the middle-classes and the lack of a mass transit system in Bangkok. Auto sales in 1992 totalled 456,000, a jump of 26 per cent from the previous year. Experts say sales growth targets are expected to decrease but the sale of 500,000 cars is not an unattainable goal, even though interest rates and gasoline prices are on the rise. Auto makers are planning to make Thailand an export base, but exporting won't be easy since they will have to produce at least one million cars per year in order to achieve sufficient economies of scale to reduce production costs. Korea had developed the capacity to produce two million cars when it first began to export. In order for Thailand to become an export base, the industry needs to develop its manpower, technology and supporting industries, such as electronic parts production and plastic and aluminum production, as these are all needed by the automobile industry.
