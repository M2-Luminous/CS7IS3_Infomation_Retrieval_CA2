At a regional congress of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in Schwerin Chancellor Helmut Kohl called Scharping's tax plans "absurd." Scharping wants to present the draft of his government program to the SPD Executive Committee on Monday [21 March], after he has presented it to the public at a news conference in Bonn on Friday. Concerning the SPD program presented by Scharping, Chancellor Helmut Kohl told WELT AM SONNTAG: "The Social Democrats have not learned anything. If one puts a supplementary tax of 10 percent on those people who work hardest, and these are skilled workers, one must ask how the structural problems in our country are supposed to be overcome, if all who `push' the whole thing and also those on whom one relies are now punished, as is envisaged in the SPD program." Scharping's draft for the SPD government program envisages that high-wage earners are generally taxed more -- with, among other things, a 10-percent surcharge on payroll and income tax owed, which is to be levied from singles with a gross annual income of more than DM50,000 and married couples with a gross income of more than DM100,000. Deputy SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Rudolf Dressler rejects this point of Scharping's proposal and, instead, demands raising the computation basis for the planned supplementary tax to an annual gross income of DM60,000 for singles and DM120,000 for married couples. Dressler reminded Scharping that last year, on the occasion of the negotiations on the Solidarity Pact, the SPD had given higher computation bases. DGB Chairman Heinz-Werner Meyer also demanded raising the computation bases to DM60,000 for singles and DM120,000 for married couples as a minimum. According to Meyer, he would have preferred the SPD to agree on these limits. Then a dispute with the trade unions could have been avoided. Particularly harsh criticism comes from the Taxpayers' Association, which categorically rejects Scharping's plan for a supplementary tax. Deputy Chairman Dieter Lau called the SPD chancellor candidate's ideas an "infamous plan." The infamous thing is that it is pretended that there are enough high-wage earners, who can be burdened with this tax. In reality, the majority of the Germans are burdened with new taxes, he said. The CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group noted that the SPD chief obviously "does not leave anyone untouched." Its parliamentary manager, Juergen Ruettgers, told WELT AM SONNTAG, commenting on the demand for a 10-percent supplementary tax: "In short, this means that anyone who earns DM50,000 as a single -- in gross terms that is DM3,845 per month -- or DM100,000 as a married couple, is to pay 10 percent more in taxes. This affects more than 2.3 million working people in Germany. These include not only the so-called high-wage earners but also skilled workers, engineering and commercial employees, master craftsmen, traders, and self-employed people." Michael Glos, chairman of the CSU land group in the Bundestag, told WELT AM SONNTAG that the SPD's government program planned by Scharping makes it clear that Scharping wants to "force" the citizens under the "tax whip" with this supplementary tax. Glos: "Instead of promoting readiness to pay taxes, those who do most in our society are to be systematically plundered." For the FDP its economic policy spokesman, Otto Graf Lambsdorff, told WELT AM SONNTAG: "Scharping wants to soak people and he is making contortions like an eel to do it. He will have to begin with the skilled worker and the small retail trader, if he wants to get large amounts of money. Almost one out of five taxpayers earns more than DM75,000 per year. These `high-wage earners' are already paying 90 percent of the entire payroll and income tax."
