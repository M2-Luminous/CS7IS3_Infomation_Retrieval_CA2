Pending the initiation of legal action, checks on suspects' financial and economic activity, and property and financial status, shall be made only if reliable evidence is available pointing to the individual's or organization's involvement in criminal activity. Preliminary checks shall be made following the issue of a permit by inquiry bodies, approved by the prosecutor. Prosecutors, investigators and specialists involved in the implementation of the decree shall be warned about their responsibility for disclosing or mishandling state and commercial secrets. Banks and commercial organizations shall present documents on their financial and economic activity, and information about the deposits and operations of juridical entities and individuals involved in serious organized crimes, following the receipt of a motivated inquiry from the prosecutor, investigator or head of an inquiry body, based on a suit or results of a check. An individual suspected of committing a crime and detained for more than three days shall have full access to the rights envisaged in the constitution and the Criminal Code, including the right to have a lawyer.

The directive instructs the prosecutors to take proper measures to reveal and exclude instances of illegal detention of citizens without prior checks on their financial and economic activity, and property and financial status, particularly the suspects' and defendants' relatives, physical entities and public associations. They shall also exclude actions which can inflict damage on citizens' property or reputation, promptly respond to complaints, take urgent measures to restore violated rights and initiate legal action against criminals.
