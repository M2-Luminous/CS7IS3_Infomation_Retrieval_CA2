FR940804-2-00118 FR940804-2-00068 A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation. United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971). The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate every conceivable anticompetitive effect of a merger or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the future. The court may reject the agreement of the parties as to how the public interest is best served only if it has ``exceptional confidence that adverse antitrust consequences will result *␣*␣*'' United States v. Western Electric Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required for a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.''' 8 Under the public interest standard, the Court's role is limited to determining whether the proposed decree is within the ``zone of settlements'' consistent with the public interest, not whether the settlement diverges from the Court's view of what would best serve the public interest. United States v. Western Electric Co., 993 F.2d at 1576 (quoting United States v. Western Electric Co., 900 F.2d 283, 307 (D.C. Cir. 1990). 8 United States v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 150 (D.D.C.), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1982) (quoting United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. at 716); United States v. Alcan Aluminum, Ltd., 605 F. Supp. 619, 622 (W.D. Ky 1985). Clearly, there has been no showing that the proposed settlement constitutes an abuse of the Department's discretion or that it is not within the zone of settlements consistent with the public interest. The proposed Final Judgment would enjoin defendants' cable systems and other multichannel subscription television distributors from discriminating against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms, or conditions of carriage where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. Defendants also would be enjoined, with respect to their video programming, from refusing to license on nondiscriminatory terms to any competing multichannel subscription television distributor where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. The Department believes that entry of the proposed Final Judgment willfully remedy the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger alleged in the Complaint, by prohibiting conduct by defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video programming or multichannel subscription television distribution. ␣␣␣␣Respectfully submitted, N.
