Although the Council of Labor Affairs (COLA) has revised its regulations to allow foreign laborers to remain in Taiwan for three years, the regulations have not yet been approved by the Legislative Yuan, so the contractors say they will be unable to overcome the growing shortage. COLA first allowed the import of foreign workers to assist with major public works, manufacturing and construction industries in October 1991. The first wave of foreign laborers have already begun to leave Taiwan, with the exodus expected to peak in April. And as COLA has not yet announced any measures to fill the coming labor gap, contractors are worried that progress on the Hsinchu and Taoyuan sections of the second freeway will lag behind schedule, resulting in the suspension or downscaling of work. The contractors have expressed their hope that the Legislative Yuan can approve the COLA revisions soon and also suggested that COLA shorten the time it takes to process foreign worker applications.
