The NP was reacting on Monday to suggestions by Mr Mandela in his speech in Potchefstroom's Primoso township that "coloureds" and Indians who voted for the NP were "traitors". It said the ANC leader's words were a complete contradiction of his earlier call for all parties to be allowed free access to all communities. "This is once again proof that the ANC talks with a forked tongue. The sort of see-sawing contained in the ANC's pronouncements indicate to us that they intend to continue with a hidden agenda once in power. They are portraying typical communist tactics to appease the electorate they are about to pounce on." The NP demanded a reconfirmation from the ANC that it would not promote political intolerance.
