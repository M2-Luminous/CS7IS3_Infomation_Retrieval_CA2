Georgiyevich: "Computers and Neurocomputers in Artillery"] [Text] Creation of neurocomputers "is only a small part of Pentagon efforts to turn `intelligent' weapons into weapons of `genius'." From an ABC television report. The appearance of precision weapons fundamentally changed forms of warfare and allowed U.S. specialists to speak of a genuine S&T revolution in military affairs. The new weapons required sophisticated control, guidance and navigation systems, which must function at a rate and with a precision going beyond human capabilities. Electronics, which under present conditions is represented by sophisticated computer systems and automated command and control and weapon control systems, came to man's aid. Computer technology is the material and S&T basis of these systems. In creating it, engineers always dreamed of devices which would be able to solve not only complex mathematical problems, but also diverse problems of logic to perfection and at great speed. According to military specialists, a considerable gap presently has formed between the rapid development of missile and artillery weapons and the increased mobility and striking power of troops on the one hand and artillery fire control systems on the other. With the appearance of third-generation computer technology in the first half of the 1960's, West German military specialists began designing automated field artillery fire control systems, which became operational in the FRG Army as the Falke automated control system. Substantial deficiencies were revealed from this system's operation at the battery-battalion level because of the low degree of automation and imperfection of equipment being used. The FRG Ministry of Defense developed and began implementing a comprehensive program at the end of the 1970's for upgrading Army command and control and communications systems. New systems for automated control of tube artillery and MLRS combat operations also are being introduced within its framework. They include high-speed, fourth-generation digital computers and modern gear equipped with microprocessors. The main advantages of these automated control systems are a minimum reaction time of artillery subunits to new targets and increased resistance to jamming, survivability and operating reliability under combat conditions. It is proposed to include field artillery automated control systems in the Army HEROS-1 tactical command and control, communications and intelligence system. Much attention is being given to solving the problem of interfacing with similar systems of other armies. The foreign press notes that FRG automated artillery control systems also will interwork excellently with the French ATILA, U.S. AFADTS and British BATES. In the opinion of military specialists, this will significantly simplify collection, storage and generalization of intelligence, permit supporting a broad exchange of information on friendly and enemy troops, and if necessary enable using allied weapons for delivering mass strikes against enemy groupings. New automated systems for control of self-propelled [SP] artillery battery fire--IFAB, regimental and battalion artillery fire--ADLER, towed artillery fire--ABACUS, rocket artillery fire--ARES, artillery target location equipment--AOR, meteorological support--ATMAS and aerial reconnaissance assets are being developed within the scope of a program for gradual development (progressing over time) of the full equipment complex. We will dwell briefly on the first two. The IFAB (Integrierte Feurerleitmittel fï¿½ur Artillerie Batterien) is intended for calculating settings for fire for effect and fire control of a battery of M109A36 155-mm SP howitzers. It consists of the M1136A2 mobile artillery observation post, mobile fire control post, ground target acquisition radar, and Aurora, a system for automatically laying guns on the target. The IFAB performs tasks of reconnoitering the enemy and terrain and observing friendly troop operations; reconnoitering targets and determining their coordinates, nature, size, and degree of cover and protection; performing a topographic survey of each battery piece; receiving and transmitting data and calculating settings for fire for effect; preparing commands for commencing fire; and automatically laying guns on the target. In addition, the mobile observation post observes the battlefield and results of fire, adjusts fire and provides communications with supported infantry formations. A number of requirements are placed on the mobile OP depending on the combat mission to be performed, the main ones being short reaction time to combat situation changes, determination of target coordinates with high accuracy (up to 20 m) and in no more than 20-30 seconds, continuous determination of one's position, and automatic monitoring of the electronic equipment operation. The main electronic equipment units are an optical target survey system with built-in laser rangefinder, land navigation unit, data input/output devices, monitors, radio and intercom. The optical target survey system is regarded as the most important assembly of the mobile OP. This is what supports the computing of angles of gun elevation and deflection with the help of appropriate encoders. The periscope is coupled with a laser rangefinder controlled manually or by a knife switch. The land navigation unit is intended for measuring distance covered and for continuously determining the vehicle heading using a gyroscope and current coordinates of the mobile OP location. The heading sensor is powered and its signals processed using the gyroscope's electronic circuits. The navigational computer converts incoming signals on target coordinates and performs a topographic survey. All data necessary for this are input to the control device and light up on its display. The data input/output device is a control device with indicator, keyboard and data transmission equipment. It supports compilation and storage of all fire control data in the form of coded messages in a 64-bit format. The monitors consist of a control unit with display, an error light and two reflectors. The monitors automatically perform diagnosis and monitor correctness of operation of all electronic, electrical and mechanical systems. Errors and malfunctions in operation of systems as well as errors arising during data transmission are output in visual and audible form. The radio and intercom consist of two transceivers for communicating with the battery and battalion, a telephone line for communicating with a forward observer, a radio for communicating with troops and an intercom for four operators. The mobile fire control post includes the commander's control post and data processing post. The mobile fire control post supports artillery observers' communications with the tube artillery command post. The commander's control post is accommodated in a motor vehicle in which the following are located: Data input/output devices with buffer storage having a capacity of 64 alphanumeric symbols, radio communications equipment, and a place reserved for the ADLER automated control system terminal device. The data processing post is outfitted in a tracked M113CAI APC and equipped with the Falke (Falcon) TP-84 computer, dot matrix printers, data input/output devices, a teletype, communications equipment and monitoring equipment. The computer has an internal memory size of 32,000 18-bit words and a speed up to 200,000 operations per second. The ground target acquisition radar is one of the main components of the automated control system and is designed for collecting and processing intelligence on enemy ground targets. Information comes to the mobile fire control post and is communicated to appropriate artillery subunits using all the ADLER system command and control equipment. RATAC and RASIT radars also are included in the FRG Army set of technical reconnaissance equipment. It is planned to install these radars in aircraft, helicopters and special tethered platforms to increase their effective range. The Aurora autonomous automatic laying system was developed to determine location and automatically lay guns on a target in accordance with fire control post data. Therefore the guns are outfitted with navigational equipment and a gyrocompass. Repeated surveys are made when firing against moving targets, and the fire control post computer automatically makes corrections to commands for commencing fire. Use of the Aurora system permits a significant reduction in the time it takes for occupying battery firing positions and for commencing fire when moving on a march, and permits a substantial improvement in fire accuracy. Analysis of IFAB Automated Control System Functioning In accordance with the authorized German Army organization, an artillery regiment consists of three battalions of M109A36 155-mm SP howitzers (18 guns), a composite battalion of M110A2 203-mm SP howitzers and H70 155-mm towed howitzers (36 guns), and a battalion with 16 110-mm LARS launchers, to which 240-mm MLRS launchers will be introduced additionally. Military specialists and the Bundeswehr leadership state that each M109A36 155-mm SP howitzer is equipped with the DEA24A data input/output device for the gun commander, DA8A receiving display device for the gunner and DA12A display for the loader. Thus, a closed SP artillery fire control system is formed at the battery level which includes an artillery mobile armored OP, fire control post and gun. It is believed that such a system acquires very great importance in connection with the planned reorganization of 6-gun batteries into 9-gun batteries. It is presumed that each gun platoon (4 and 5 guns) will have its own control post, which will allow it to operate autonomously and substantially reduce the likelihood of damage from enemy fire. It is pointed out that the reaction time until counterbattery fire commences will be reduced fourfold. The ADLER (Artillerie-Daten-Lage und Einsatz-Rechnerverbund) system is intended for preparation of firing data for tactical employment of artillery, for communications with higher field artillery command and control entities, and for supporting interworking with the HEROS-1 tactical battle management, intelligence and communications system and with field artillery automated control systems of the U.S., British and French armies. It has been under development under Bundeswehr order by the firm of Elektrik System Gesellschaft (ESG) since the middle of 1985. While all IFAB, ABACUS and ARES battery fire control equipment is intended for improving accuracy and reducing time of preparing battery fire, ADLER equipment is used at the battalion-field level and must provide swift, comprehensive data evaluation and constant battlefield situation display and promptly monitor OP work using electronic data processing. The technical level of all elements of the ADLER automated control system permits not only accelerating the performance of large-scale fire missions, but also economizing on ammunition while simultaneously increasing the number of targets engaged. U.S. and FRG military specialists conducted field testing in June 1988 to determine the practical possibility of the ADLER automated control system interworking with the U.S. TACFIRE artillery fire control system. Prototypes of equipment, special software and a translator from one programming language to the other were used in the testing. To work out the interface of the two automated artillery fire control systems, 17 message formats, including intelligence and commence-fire orders, were transmitted between them over the communications channel. U.S. and FRG specialists gave test results high marks and drew a very reassuring conclusion that they were an important step in providing mutual fire support of ground troops of all NATO member countries. Full, comprehensive field testing of the ADLER command and information system were held in November 1988 and went very successfully according to Bundeswehr military specialists. The new automated control system is to become operational with FRG Army artillery subunits in the first half of the 1990's. It is proposed to outfit all artillery command posts with it at corps-division, artillery regiment-battalion and field artillery battalion-battery levels. The possibility of practical use of fourth-generation computers in the ADLER field artillery automated control system indicates the wide use of miniature processors in them. It is expected that the 1990's will become the years of creation of fifth-generation computers, which will considerably surpass existing models in basic characteristics, above all in power. The Illiac IV high-speed computer project being developed under a U.S. Defense Department order can serve as a typical example in this respect. Parallel operation of 256 processors with a capacity of a billion is planned in this machine. Human contact with the intelligent interface system in such computers will occur in conventional language and programming will be in logical programming language. Fifth-generation computers open up great opportunities for enhancing all spheres of human activity connected with information processing, including solving artificial intelligence problems. Announcements by the Japanese firm of Fujitsu about creation of equipment (a neurocomputer) based on a model of a neural network for solving artificial intelligence problems are reassuring in this respect. It operates according to the principle of a human brain and can process the same amount of data as a hundred thousand neurons. As a comparison we will note that modern supercomputers can perform operations to an extent inherent to capabilities only of six brain neurons. Western specialists assert that neurocomputers will be used widely in five years, above all in the military area in developing automatic systems for controlling spacecraft, troops, and modern weapons. In connection with this, a broad front of joint basic research by physicists, neurobiologists, electronics specialists, and specialists in brain theory and data processing has appeared in the United States, Japan, the FRG and other countries. All this indicates the objective reality of the appearance of a fundamentally new scientific direction whose practical realization will ensure a qualitative breakthrough in the area of developing and creating super-effective weapon systems.
