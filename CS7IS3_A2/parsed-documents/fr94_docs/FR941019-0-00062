Current rule 20a&hyph;2(b)(4) [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;2(b)(4)] requires disclosure of fee information for all funds advised by the same adviser. •eliminating the requirement that the proxy statement contain a certified balance sheet of the investment adviser. 32 32 In lieu of the balance sheet, item 22 requires that funds disclose in their proxy statements any financial condition of the adviser that is reasonably likely to impair its ability to fulfill its commitment to the fund under the investment advisory contract. Commenters generally endorsed these modifications, and the Commission is adopting them as proposed. 33 33 The Commission also is adopting, as proposed, an additional disclosure requirement concerning investment advisory fees. If a change in the investment advisory fee is sought, subparagraph (c)(9) of item 22 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fee for the last year, the amount the adviser would have received had the proposed fee been in effect, and the percentage amount of the proposed increase. The Commission is eliminating some of the requirements that funds provide information about brokerage practices because the requirements have not provided investors with information that is helpful in making a decision whether to vote for or against an investment advisory contract. The Commission continues to be concerned about fund brokerage practices. Recently, the Commission proposed amendments to Form N&hyph;1A that, if adopted, would require certain expenses paid by directed brokerage to be treated as an expense in fund financial statements and the fee table, and would require average brokerage commission rates to be disclosed in the Financial Highlights Table in fund prospectuses. 34 Thus, the Commission continues to be committed to improving the transparency of fund brokerage commissions, and has directed the Division of Investment Management to develop rules designed to improve disclosure about the ``soft dollar'' benefits advisers obtain from the use of their client brokerage. 34 Investment Company Act Rel. No. 20472 (Aug. 11, 1994) [59 FR 42187 (Aug. 17, 1994)]. The Commission received several comments on other of the proposed modifications. As discussed below, the modifications, as adopted, have been revised in some respects to reflect these comments. 1. General Partners of the Investment Adviser If the investment adviser is a partnership, the proxy rules have required disclosure of the names of all general partners in the proxy statement. 35 The Commission proposed to limit the disclosure to those general partners of the investment adviser with the five largest economic interests in the partnership and, if different, to those general partners comprising the management or executive committee of the partnership. The Commission requested comment on whether general partners that have significant management responsibilities relating to the fund also should be identified. Commenters generally supported limiting the disclosure concerning the general partners of the investment adviser but differed on the scope of the limitation. One commenter supported naming both the partners with the five largest economic interests, as proposed, and partners with significant management responsibilities relating to a fund. Upon reconsideration, the Commission believes that the names of partners with significant managerial responsibilities as well as controlling partnership interests is material to shareholders and has modified the partner disclosure requirement accordingly. 36 35 Rule 20a&hyph;2(b)(1) [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;2(b)(1)] incorporating rule 20a&hyph;2(a)(2). 36 Subparagraph (c)(2) of item 22. 2. Material Factor Discussion The Commission proposed to require a discussion of material factors considered by the board of directors in recommending that fund shareholders approve an investment advisory contract. As proposed, the item enumerated certain material factors that might be included in the discussion. Several commenters objected to enumerated material factors arguing that such a requirement would lead to formalistic and ``boiler plate'' disclosure and may tend to oversimplify the board's evaluation process. The Commission believes that the material factors discussion should reflect the board of directors' evaluation of the investment advisory contract and shares commenters' concern that enumeration of factors might lead to ``boiler plate'' disclosure. 37 Therefore, the Commission has decided not to include a list of material factors in the requirement for a discussion of the recommended investment advisory contract. 38 37 Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;15(c)] requires fund directors to request and to assess such information as may be necessary to evaluate the terms of an investment advisory contract. 38 The Commission is retaining, as proposed, the requirement to include a discussion of soft dollar arrangements benefitting the investment adviser in the discussion of material factors considered by the board of directors. Under section 15(c) of the 1940 Act, the responsibilities of directors in approving an investment advisory contract extend to monitoring of soft dollar arrangements of the investment adviser. See Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 23170 (Apr. 23, 1986) [51 FR 16004 (Apr. 30, 1986)] at §IV.B.3. F. Approval of Distribution Plan The Commission proposed to amend the proxy rules to set forth certain disclosure requirements for proxy statements seeking approval of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan and plan amendments. 39 These proposed requirements reflected, in many respects, disclosure currently made in proxy statements. Commenters generally supported the proposed express disclosure requirements for Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans, and the Commission is adopting item 22(d) substantially as proposed. 40 Item 22(d) requires: (i) a description of the proposed action and the reasons shareholders are being requested to vote on adoption (or amendment) of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; (ii) disclosure of material differences between the proposed and the current Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; (iii) disclosure about distribution expenses under the plan paid by the fund during the last fiscal year to the fund's investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, or any of their affiliated persons, and to persons receiving 10% or more of the fund's aggregate distribution fees; and (iv) disclosure about the factors the board of directors considered in recommending adoption of (or amendment to) the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan. 41 39 Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act permits the use of fund assets to finance the distribution of shares under certain conditions, one of which is shareholder approval of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or amendments to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan that would materially increase the amount spent for distribution. 40 See supra note 9 and accompanying text for a discussion of proxy statement disclosure concerning approval of Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans for multiple class funds. See supra note 13 and accompanying text for a discussion of the term ``distributor'' and related modifications to item 22(d). 41 In addition, when the effect of the action would be to increase fund expenses, item 22(a) requires inclusion of a comparative fee table showing the level of fees before and after adoption of the recommended Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan. Subparagraph (a)(3)(iv) of item 22.
