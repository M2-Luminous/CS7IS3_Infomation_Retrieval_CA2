He said the EEA has been able to dispel a number of fears. Thus, the freedom of movement for persons within the EEA has not burdened the Austrian labor market, and the introduction of common standards for food products has not reduced quality. But Schuessel also mentioned several "unfulfilled wishes" Austria has in the EEA. Talks between the EU and EFTA [European Free Trade Association] on a common zone of origin for the EEA and the Eastern European reform states have come to a halt. This means that a compensatory duty is put on goods exported to the EU that consist of Austrian primary material that is processed in Hungary. In the same way, Austrian textiles are discriminated against over EU material in the so-called "passive, across-the-border processing." Schuessel fears that the problem "cannot be settled before Austria joins the EU." The EU was also asked to reduce duties for certain food products. The industry that is hardest hit by this delay are Austrian jam producers, who still have to pay a 30-percent duty on exports to the EU, while jam from EU countries is exported to Austria at the reduced 10-percent rate. The 17 ministers also reviewed the implementation of EU documents in the five EFTA states participating in the EEA. Schuessel rejected recent criticism by the EFTA Supervisory Authority, which had blamed Austria for delaying the implementation of EEA regulations. Apart from two EU regulations on textile fibers and sewage sludge, Austria has "completely implemented" all EU regulations relevant to the EEA, Schuessel said. In connection with transition periods for environmental impact assessments of industrial plants and traffic- related projects, Schuessel said that all projects will be subject to such evaluations as of 1 July 1994.
