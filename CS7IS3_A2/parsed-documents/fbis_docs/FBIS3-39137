[Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli are being forced into a trial of strength that each must win, though they both pretend it will end in a draw. They are still in dispute over at least two issues -- candidates and symbols. Segni does not want anyone under investigation on the joint lists. Martinazzoli still has to decide what to do about Mattarella, on the assumption that De Mita will have the sense to withdraw on his own. As for [Interior Minister] Mancino, also under investigation, the attitude is that it is better not to attempt too many things at once, and that whoever prevails will decide what to do. It seems that the business of the suspect candidates has given rise to some grotesque episodes. "I will exclude so-and-so, even though he is not in trouble with the law, so that you too can be free of anyone who might be tainted." This is more or less the suggestion Segni is making to Martinazzoli. But the latter's response is to say that he is willing to forego standing for reelection himself, precisely in order to make a gesture of renewal. If Martinazzoli does stay home, however, Segni must do so too, after being on the political scene for the past five legislative terms. And so this entertaining dance of the Christian Democrats is marked by a succession of proposals made and denied. The disagreement is not confined to names, whether presumed or inferred. Segni is also demanding a single symbol -- his, of course -- for candidates for the proportional quota. In other words, it is clear that the promoter of the referendum wants to secure leadership of the group both de facto and de jure. As usual among Christian Democrats, there had to be a mediation proposal. This is being attempted by the philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, who has one foot in the Pact for Italy and the other in the Popular Party. His idea is this: that the popularists yield over the issue of those under investigation, and that the Pact permits Martinazzoli to use his own symbol in the electoral contest. It is only a compromise in a manner of speaking. In fact Buttiglione would succeed at a stroke in achieving De Mita's exclusion and at the same time not humiliating Martinazzoli. On the other hand, the issue of those being investigated is a matter of principle. Segni absolutely refuses to have them on the lists. The popularists, however, are urging that an exception be made for the crime of public funding of the parties. If money was appropriated for corrupt purposes, they say, then the veto remains valid. But when it was taken in violation of a parliamentary law governing public funding of the parties, then it is a different matter. Be that as it may, it is clear that the PPI is angry about their beloved Segni's stubbornness. Segni apparently went as far as to threaten resignation for the sake of "salvaging" the principle of excluding those under investigation. But at this stage it is difficult to distinguish between rumors, interpretations, and attempts to raise the stakes in the negotiations. A succession of very confidential separate meetings were held by Segni at his offices and by Martinazzoli's popularists at Piazza del Gesu [PPI headquarters]. Late yesterday evening the Popular Party's Vito Riggio acted as ambassador between Segni and Martinazzoli. There were diplomatic missions and external statements in an attempt to influence the talks. "A solution of the problem of candidates to be listed depends on common sense, humility, and realism," Rosy Bindi suggested, changing her role as "pasionaria" for that of the good and conscientious older sister. However, she still addressed the following sharp remark to Segni: "I would simply point out that the troops will be needed nevertheless." Basically, for once Bindi perfectly reflects the feelings of a party newly "reborn" that feels humiliated by Segni's diktats. Gerardo Bianco, the PPI's lower house floor leader, referred to this "pure obsession with the new." Martinazzoli was very resolute: "It no longer accepts this cursing of the old. This is a Popular Party which is contesting the elections for the first time. We are seeking alliances. It seems to me that what we are creating is politically significant. However, if the conditions are unacceptable, the minimum rules for a contract would be lacking." Martinazzoli warned his friend, Segni: "Nobody is sending me any messages." The PRI's [Italian Republican Party] La Malfa commented, somewhat enviously: "If [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto had received a notice of investigation, he would still stand as a candidate."
