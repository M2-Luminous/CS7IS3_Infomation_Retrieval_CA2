The Cameroonian foreign minister made that statement after a meeting here yesterday with his Nigerian counterpart, Babagana Kingibe, who arrived in the Cameroonian capital on 9 March at the head of a military and civilian delegation. Kingibe has said that he will go back for consultations with the Nigerian authorities on the conditions set by Cameroon which also wants the summit meeting to be held in a neutral country. The Nigerian minister told Cameroon Radio that talks between the two delegations were on course. The joint communique on the bilateral talks has not yet been signed although the Nigerian delegation is scheduled to leave the Cameroonian capital today. Fambare Ouattara Natchaba, Togolese minister of foreign affairs and cooperation, attended the meeting which examined the territorial dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula said to be rich in oil and natural gas. Last week, Togolese Head of State Gnassingbe Eyadema undertook to mediate between the two countries. In this regard, he visited Yaounde and Lagos [as received] to examine with Biya and Abacha ways and means of finding a peaceful solution to the dispute.
