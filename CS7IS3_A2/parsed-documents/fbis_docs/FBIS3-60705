Thus, Kazakhstan's joining of the system of commitments based on the START-1 treaty and the 1992 Lisbon protocol has been completed from the legal point of view. ``Russia regards this step taken by Kazakhstan as a major contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and to the ensuring of the nuclear arms reduction,'' he said. This is especially important now, because the non-proliferation regime has been jeopardized by the dangerous stand, taken by Ukraine. According to Karasin, Russia would like to hope that the resolution, adopted by the Kazakh parliament, will set a good example for Ukraine. Whether an impetus will be given to the spreading of nuclear weapons all over the planet, or whether the mechanism of significant nuclear arms reductions, envisaged by the START-1 and START-2 treaties, will be set into motion, depends very much on the policy pursued by Ukraine.
