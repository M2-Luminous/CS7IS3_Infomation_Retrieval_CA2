Ivanov said: Despite all the difficulties, the negotiating process will lead to tangible results. Holding another conference in Madrid will give everyone the opportunity to evaluate what has been realized and define the future outlines and formulas. However, this conference does not constitute an alternative to current negotiations. The Russian envoy said: Those who understood our initiative, as I have explained it, supported it and those who understood it to be an alternative to the negotiations rejected it. However, I do not believe that the initiative is categorically rejected although it needs time. Ivanov counseled alertness and vigilance to avoid undermining the negotiating process. He emphasized Syria's readiness to continue pursuing an active and effective role to reach a just peace. He said President Hafiz al-Asad welcomes such a role. On the two countries' bilateral relations, the Russian envoy said that an agreement has been reached with President al-Asad, who is held in high esteem in Russia, as he put it, to give a new push to bilateral relations in all fields. As for the Syrian debts to Russia, agreement has been reached to hold a meeting of experts from both sides to study the various options in light of the legitimate interests of both sides. On Russia's views regarding the limited international observers [in Hebron] and whether such a number is sufficient to protect a city of more than 120,000 Palestinians, Ivanov said that this is more a question of the efficiency rather than number of observers. Concerning the absence of the Russian role and its reemergence recently following the Hebron massacre, the Russian envoy said that this role did not disappear in order to reemerge, but that it is continuing without clamor unless the situation warrants otherwise.
