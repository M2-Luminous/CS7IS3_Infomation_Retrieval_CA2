Callers claiming to be APLA commanders have vowed to continue fighting in spite of PAC leaders' decision on January 16 to suspend the fight. "Various political decisions have been made and one of them is that we would stop armed operations. That is exactly what we have done," the Harare-based HERALD newspaper quoted Mr Phama as saying in a weekend interview in Windhoek, Namibia. The APLA leader said it was most unlikely that the claims were made by APLA members. "Specific instructions have since gone out to our members to cease all military operations as per the decision of our political leadership, and they have (ceased operations). Now we have all these people 'phoning newspapers in South Africa with so- called pre-arranged codes and claiming to be members of APLA, vowing to continue the armed struggle. Who are they? I can say with authority that they are not our people." Mr Phama was sure the claims were part of a campaign to discredit the PAC and APLA. He also dismissed charges that his organisation had been responsible for a spate of controversial attacks on civilians such as last month's shooting at the Heidelberg tavern in Cape Town which left four people dead. "There have been many attacks on innocent civilians and certain people claiming to be our guerrillas have occasionally claimed responsibility. I know which ones have been our operations and which have not...And I can tell you that we have not conducted any atrocities."
