Foreign Ministry sources say that four candidates are already knocking at the door to succeed him. An official stated that current Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos has expressed an interest in the job, thus somewhat reducing the chances of former Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens. A Portuguese candidate, Mr. Coutilheiro, author of a peace plan for the former Yugoslavia, and another Italian candidate are also in the race.
