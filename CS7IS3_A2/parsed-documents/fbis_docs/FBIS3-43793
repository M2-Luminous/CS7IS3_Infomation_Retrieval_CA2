He was a victim of the rising tension in Brazzaville. Gilbert David Moutakela has the details: [Begin recording] The situation deteriorated suddenly this afternoon in Brazzaville after the kidnapping of a presidential security officer. Lt. Jonathan Mabiela was kidnapped and executed by private opposition militiamen. Elements of the presidential guard, feeling that their pride was hurt, decided to avenge their colleague. Before they could attack, the directorate of the presidential security sent an ultimatum to the prime minister, mediators of the republic, and Bernard Kolelas. In a message announced on national radio, the presidential security directorate demanded the liberation of Lt. Mabiela. The ultimatum from the presidential security expired this evening at 1800, but the body of the dead lieutenant is nowhere to be found. All elements of the presidential security on leave were called urgently back to their units, and tough measures are expected. It must be noted that the places where the action will be focused essentially are in the southern part of Brazzaville -- Bacongo and Makele-Kele, where violence has continued despite many calls for calm by political leaders and the Congolese Armed Forces. It must be recalled that since the beginning of the Congolese crisis in July 1993, several officers of the Congolese Armed Forces, including a major and a colonel, have been kidnapped. Those who were not killed were released after being subjected to untold hardships. [end recording] [Brazzaville Radio Nationale Congolaise Network in French at 1830 on 16 January opens its regular newscast with the following communique issued and read and signed by the director of the presidential security service: "Elements of the presidential security have read an ultimatum in which they demanded the body of their colleague from Bernard Kolelas and his group. As director of presidential security, I declare that these soldiers have no business losing their calm, because the president of the Republic held talks this morning with the national mediators, who are the only people authorized to settle any disputes and conflicts between individuals and groups of individuals in the country. I would like to reassure the people of Brazzaville that suitable organs to ensure peace and national harmony have begun work since this morning on the orders of both the president of the Republic and the prime minister. I would therefore like to stress that the ultimatum read earlier is null and void because no authority conceived nor approved it previously."]
