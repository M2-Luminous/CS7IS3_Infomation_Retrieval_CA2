The process of the formation of the CIS and also of states which do not belong to this Commonwealth on the territory of the former USSR and the existence of contradictions within them and in some cases between them have led us to an understanding of the need to create peacekeeping forces. Under present conditions, when the European states that are CIS members are displaying no interest in resolving armed conflicts by their own efforts, Russia remains the only state with the military and technical resources to conduct operations to maintain and restore peace and is confirming this by its practice. Of course, Russia directs its main efforts toward settling crisis situations and armed conflicts in the regions directly adjacent to its borders, since stability in these territories is of vital importance for the Russian state and its citizens, 25 million of whom live in nearby foreign parts. It has been and remains the only force capable of separating the warring sides and sitting them down at the conference table. Life itself shows that no international organization or group of states can replace our peacekeeping efforts on the territory of the former USSR. At the same time we by no means rule out the enlistment of peacekeeping forces under the UN or CSCE flag if, in the world community's opinion, the need for that arises. Russia's responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council for maintaining international peace and security and as a state which bears the main brunt of peacekeeping activity on the territory of the former USSR is reflected in the Russian Federation Constitution, the law on defense, the military doctrine, and other normative acts which indicate directly that Russia assists the efforts of the world community and various organs of collective security to prevent armed conflicts and maintain or restore peace by the decision of the UN Security Council or in accordance with international commitments. Thus for the first time peacekeeping in Russia has been promoted to the rank of state policy. The history of our state's peacekeeping goes back to 1973, when the first 36 Soviet military observers took part under the UN flag in the operation to monitor the conditions of the cease-fire in the Near East. In subsequent years military observers have taken part in peacekeeping operations under UN auspices in Egypt, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, on the Iraq-Iran border, in the Western Sahara, Cambodia, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia. On two occasions Russian military observers have been in Abkhazia along the river Gumista where they confidently fulfilled their duties and the bloodshed was halted for a while. And only the warring sides' unconstructive policy prevented an end to the war in that region at the time. There was also a good chance of ending the war on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border in September 1992 when to implement the terms of the defense ministers' Sochi agreement, Russia, Georgia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan were to assign military observers to five zones of responsibility. But only Russia did this. To this day 105 Russian military observers are continuing this hard service in many of the planet's trouble spots. The failure to take decisive steps in nearby foreign parts could plunge former regions of the USSR into even greater bloodletting and the flames of war could move directly to Russian territory. In accordance with interstate agreements the Defense Ministry, without waiting for the adoption of a legislative base on the peacekeeping forces, formed nine battalions of Russian troops and sent them to South Ossetia, the Republic of Georgia, and the Dniester Region of the Republic of Moldova in the summer and fall of 1992. At the same time at the request of the Tajik Government units of the 201st Motorized-rifle Division were ordered by the Russian leadership to perform peacekeeping tasks and in the fall of 1993 CIS Collective Peacekeeping Forces from Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan were formed and introduced to the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The development of events in the south of Russia itself (the situation in Ingushetia) and the absence of legislative acts on the peacekeeping forces and the mechanism for activating them made it necessary in order to end the bloodshed and maintain law and order on the territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia in accordance with the Russian Federation President's edict to create a combined group of troops of about 12,000 men from the troops of the North Caucasus Military District and the Internal Affairs Ministry internal troops. Today the numerical strength of the Russian Army servicemen performing peacekeeping tasks is over 16,000. The experience of the Russian "Blue Helmets'" participation in settling military conflicts in nearby foreign parts enriches world experience of peacekeeping. Thus their introduction to zones of armed confrontation has been carried out under conditions of continuing fire and their mission included separating the warring sides. Another new element is that alongside Russian peacekeepers representatives of the conflicting sides and not only of neutral states are participants in the operation to restore and maintain peace. The establishment of Russia's peacekeeping forces is taking place under complex conditions. We realize that the settlement of armed conflicts is the common business of states of the relevant region and the world community as a whole. Consequently the burden of expenses should be shared between them. This principle has been reflected in a number of bilateral and multilateral agreements within the framework of the CIS. But most regrettably as of today in all trouble spots of the former Union. Russia, as the mediator in the solution of conflicts and with contingents of peacekeeping forces, which surpass all other participants in the peacekeeping operations in terms of personnel, equipment, and weapons, sometimes being several times larger, receives no compensation for its participation. Moreover, funds for conducting peacekeeping operations are not allocated from the federal budget and the financing of the participation of the military contingent in peacekeeping operations is through Defense Ministry funds. The question of compensating for expenditure on these purposes through subscriptions by states within the CIS framework in accordance with the protocol of the Tashkent meeting of heads of CIS states (May 1992) remains unimplemented. Many politicians in the West are now speaking increasingly frequently of our allegedly minor participation in peacekeeping operations, unfairly restricting the numerical strength of the peacekeeping forces to a battalion in Yugoslavia and observers. In our view the new but noble mission of preventing bloodshed should not be restricted to the political interests of individual states but should be determined by the quantity of the forces and funds used in humanitarian missions. It would be fairer to view expenditure on financing these operations as a direct proportionate contribution by Russia to the UN budget for peacekeeping operations and to grant these operations a UN (or CSCE) mandate). In connection with the well known events in our political life no legislative acts have yet been adopted on Russia's peacekeeping forces. Their status has not been determined. The armed forces contingents performing peacekeeping functions are only assigned as peacekeeping forces by orders of the defense minister. The mechanism for supplying (activating) these forces has not been regulated either. When planning operations to maintain and establish peace it is essential to proceed from the premise that peacekeeping tasks should be performed not by line units of the armed forces but by specially created professionally trained peacekeeping forces equipped for the purpose. Their numerical strength and composition, the procedure for their use, and a whole series of other questions must be precisely regulated by the state. Unfortunately not everyone in our country yet understands that the creation, staffing, and use of peacekeeping forces must be determined legislatively by the supreme organs of state power and not by the Defense Ministry. Therefore in our view the priority task is the elaboration and adoption of a Concept for Russia's participation in peacekeeping activity and a law "on the procedure for supplying peacekeeping forces for participation in peacekeeping operations." It is also essential to approve their status (position), that is to put a legal normative basis under Russian peacekeeping. At the same time one or two motorized-rifle divisions of the Ground Troops (15,000-16,000 men) must be transferred to a new organizational staff structure meeting the requirement for autonomy when subunits perform peacekeeping missions. We have now voiced proposals for putting these forces outside the treaty framework for conventional arms limitation. It is also necessary to create the appropriate material training base for training them. The first sections of the training centers for the 27th and 45th motorized-rifle divisions have already been virtually created. But for the higher quality training of personnel for operations in unusual conditions it is necessary to improve them considerably. And again the question is based on the financial famine which the armed forces chronically experience. The creation of Russia's peacekeeping forces should in our view be implemented on the basis of the principles of the compliance of their organizational structure, composition, and numerical strength with the requirements of military doctrine, with the concept of Russia's security, and with its international commitments, centralized leadership, the maximum use of the existing military potential and existing structures, and a consideration for the continuity of national traditions, the norms of international law, and the experience of other states. They must include Defense Ministry units and subunits (military contingents), military, civilian, and militia personnel (the leading staff of the mission, observers, and experts), and communications, support, and servicing and maintenance subunits. Staffing with privates and sergeants should be (and already is) only on a voluntary basis. Contracts should be concluded with people who as a rule have already served in line units. Today there are obviously not enough professional servicemen under contract in the peacekeeping forces units. That is the result of the discrepancy between material incentives and the risk to life and the conditions of service of the "peacekeepers." Peacekeeping forces' subunits must be staffed fully before their training for peacekeeping activity begins. Right now because of difficulties over staffing subunits often have to be "assembled" at the last minute before being sent to armed conflict zones. By a decision of the Russian Federation Government an Interdepartmental Coordination Commission has been created to pool the efforts of ministries, committees, and departments on questions of peacekeeping activity. Its organizational and legal documents are being drafted. A Sector [napravleniye] for Leadership of the Peacekeeping Forces has been operating in the Defense Ministry for over a year now and controls the training of peacekeeping forces subunits and their fulfillment f missions. Unfortunately, because of its small size a number of issues of a state law nature and of international and public peacekeeping activity are beyond the sector's purview. These questions are resolved by many directorates of the Defense Ministry but for more high-quality and effective work it would be desirable to unite these peacekeeping functions in a single body. In connection with the growth of the growth of the scale of the peacekeeping forces' participation in the maintenance of peace, in the United Nations the structure of the organs of management is being improved and a professional military staff is being formed for the operational control of forces assigned by the United Nations. A special committee for improving peacekeeping operations is being instituted under the UN Security Council. Theoretical questions of the preparation and implementation of peacekeeping operations are also being elaborated, in particular the NATO and U.S. concept for settling crises and armed conflicts and the concept of second-generation operations, and vigorous work is being performed to create UN "reserve forces." Russia is taking an active part in all these questions. In particular the question of including the 27th motorized rifle division in the UN "reserve forces" has been successfully resolved and consultations are under way on questions of peacekeeping activity between Russian representatives and international organizations (the United Nations, CSCE, North Atlantic Cooperation Council, NATO, and others) and on a bilateral basis. In July 1994 it is planned to hold the first joint Russian-U.S. command staff peacekeeping exercise. Russia's 27th Motorized-rifle Division and the United States' third infantry division will take part. Russia's "Blue Helmets" now stand between the warring sides in conflicts. By their activity they ensure cease-fires and create conditions for a definitive settlement of conflicts by political means. Despite a number of unresolved questions, they are honorably performing their hard service, so essential today in many regions.
