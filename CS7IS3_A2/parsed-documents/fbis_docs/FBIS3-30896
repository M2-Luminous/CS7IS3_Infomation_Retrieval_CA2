The routine meeting here came the day after NATO, reacting to Saturday's mortar attack, issued an ultimatum of February 21 for heavy artillery to be withdrawn from around Serb-besieged Sarajevo or it would launch air strikes. Karadzic had earlier threatened not to participate but then met with his Bosnian Moslem and Croat adversaries under the aegis of EC and UN mediators.
