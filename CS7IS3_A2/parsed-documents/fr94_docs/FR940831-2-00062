Information on Document Title: Revised Evaluation Plan for the Second Cohort of Comprehensive Child Development Programs (CCDP) and the Addition of a 60-Month Data Collection point for both the First and Second CCDP Cohorts. OMB No.: Revision of a currently approved collection (No. 980&hyph;0230). Description: Section 670N(a)(1) of the Comprehensive Child Development Centers Act (Public Law 100&hyph;297), authorized the development of projects designed to provide intensive, comprehensive, integrated and continuous supportive services to enhance the physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development of low-income children from birth to compulsory school age, including providing necessary support to their parents and other family members. Section 670Q(a) of the CCDP Act requires that ``the Secretary shall provide, directly or through grants and contracts, for the continuing evaluation of projects under this subchapter in order to determine their effectiveness in achieving stated goals, their impact on related programs, and their structure and mechanisms for delivery of services.'' Under contracts from the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), researchers from Abt Associates, Inc., have been awarded two separate contracts to conduct evaluations of both the First and Second Cohorts of Comprehensive Child Development Programs (CCDP). Data for the two related studies will involve the collection of information on the cognitive, socio-emotional and physical development of a participating and a control group of children through the administration of standardized test batteries and a series of annual interviews with the parents of the children in the studies, including the use of an instrument to measure the home environment; a series of interviews with CCDP staff and administrators of related programs providing services to the children and their families to determine procedures used in achieving program goals and objectives; and systematic observation of program service delivery to gather information for describing the types and effectiveness of services delivered. Data collection for the first group of CCDP projects (which is being conducted under the first evaluation contract-OMB # 0980&hyph;0230) began in December 1991 and will continue through 1995, pending the approval of the addition of an additional 60-month data collection point. Data collection for the second group of CCCDP projects (to be conducted under a separate contract that was awarded 9/30/93 and will utilize the proposed modified evaluation design) is scheduled to begin in 1994 and will continue until 1999. Number of Respondents: 16,086. Frequency: 3.65 average frequency. Average Burden Hours per Response: 2.1 hours/respondent. Burden Hours: 123,557 total hours (across 5 years). Dated: August 23, 1994.
