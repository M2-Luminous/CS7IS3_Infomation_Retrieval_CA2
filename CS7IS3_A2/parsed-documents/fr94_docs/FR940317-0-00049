ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Pacific cod by vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the allocation of Pacific cod for the inshore component in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), March 16, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Resource Management Specialist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii), the allocation of Pacific cod for the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area, GOA, was established by the final 1994 groundfish specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 28,125 metric tons (mt). The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง672.20(c)(2)(ii), that the allocation of Pacific cod total allowable catch for the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area, GOA, soon will be reached. The Regional Director established a directed fishing allowance of 23,625 mt, with consideration that 4,500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the Central Regulatory Area. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by operators of vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., March 16, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง672.20(g). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20.
