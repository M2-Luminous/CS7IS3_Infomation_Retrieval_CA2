The political report confirms that from now until the end of this decade, industrialization and modernization must pay special attention to the industrialization of agriculture and the rural economy. Where do we exploit the capital resources for our industrialization and modernization? To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with effective efforts to manage our capital, with domestic sources of capital being regarded as crucial and foreign sources of capital as important. We confirm that foreign sources of capital are important, especially in the first stage. It is necessary to introduce structures and policies to attract more foreign capital, put it to more effective use, and invite in modern technology and equipment. But foreign capital resources are limited and the demand on capital for the entire industrialization and modernization is very great, even in the intermediate period. The capital from development aid is not much and is normally attached to certain conditions. Moreover, in order to use foreign resources, it is necessary to have the same amount of domestic capital. In obtaining foreign loans, moreover, we must consider our repayment capacity and requirements to ensure our independence and economic and political sovereignty. Therefore, domestic capital is still a decisive factor. The newly industrialized countries, despite receiving much external financial support, still have to mobilize 70 to 80 percent of their domestic capital in the first stage and maintain a total investment of more than 30 percent of their GDP for many consecutive years. If we want to overcome the danger of further lagging behind in our economy, there is only one way: We must be diligent and economical in production, be thrifty in consumption, save for development investment, and increase the total annual investment to more than 20 percent of our GDP in the years ahead. 2. We must strive to implement the policy on developing the multisectoral economy consistently and give various economic components and business establishments more headway to develop quickly and attain strong economic results. Our party uniformly applies a policy of multisectoral economic development. It considers this a long-term strategic duty to encourage all sectors and people to invest for production and business. It protects the legitimate interests of all owners. At the same time, it strives to build and consolidate the state-run economy and develop the cooperative economy, giving the state-run economy a leading role and gradually turning the cooperative economy into a foundation for our economy as outlined by the party platform. All economic components are equal. That means they are equal under the law and are encouraged by the government to develop within the bounds of the law. That does not mean the roles of all economic components are the same in our new socio-economy. How does the leading role of the state-run economy manifest itself? The state-run economy is a force that controls all important economic industries, dominates the economy, and ensure the stable development of our economy. It is also a force that creates conditions and helps unite all economic components for common development. It has the ability to intervene and regulate the development of other economic components and of the entire national economy. It guides the market-oriented economy along the socialist direction. It sets examples of productivity and efficiency for other economic components. According to those requirements, at present the state-run economic sector is running enterprises in the most important production areas. Therefore, it is playing the leading role and dominating the national economy. But its leading role has many limits. First of all, its productivity and efficiency are still low. In some cases, they are worse than those of the individual economy. The state-run economy is not operational in certain business areas that it should be. These weaknesses need to be overcome in the future. What lines and policies need to be applied to continue rearranging and building a state-run economy sufficient to ensure its leading role in the national economy? In order to consolidate and build the state-run economy, on the one hand, we have to rearrange state enterprises and deal with those that run perennial losses with different measures. On the other hand, we have to build new enterprises. The most important thing is that we have to find measures to improve state-run enterprises' performance. We have to introduce the share holding system gradually, depending on the nature and field of the enterprise. We must, however, ensure the state holds the majority of shares. We have to sell a certain number of shares in different stages to people who work at the enterprise. We will also experiment with selling some shares to organizations and individuals outside the enterprise. We have to study, experiment, and gradually apply profit sharing in state enterprises (after paying taxes and allocations for production savings and the social welfare fund) with workers and officials at the enterprise. On the basis of introducing the share holding system, we will organize a board of management that includes representatives of the state, workers, and other share owners. We have to outline regulations and requirements for the board of management to select managers. We have to perfect and apply different contractual forms in state enterprises, gradually change federated enterprises and general companies to corporations, and slowly eliminate the systems of managing ministries and managing administration authorities and the distinction between centrally managed enterprises and locally managed enterprises. The aforementioned measures are aimed at: -- Making sure state enterprises and state properties are owned by a concrete and direct owner who has a definite responsibility for the efficient use of the property. -- Creating power for the worker to identify with the enterprise, participate in business policies, and prevent and eliminate corruption. -- Guaranteeing the enterprise's sovereignty and the state's control and attracting more capital resources.
