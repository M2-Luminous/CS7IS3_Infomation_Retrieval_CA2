(Mr. Barnevick) came to Ukraine for the first time. The purpose of his visit is to expand cooperation with our country, first of all in the sphere of nuclear engineering. This cooperation was initiated last year, during President Kravchuk's visit to Switzerland. What can it bring for us? President Kravchuk and Mr. Barnevick talked about this with the journalists after their meeting. [Begin Kravchuk recording] After we signed the tripartite agreement and the Supreme Council ratified START I and Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, the world's attitude toward Ukraine changed for the better. Last week, I had a telephone conversations with Bill Clinton, Mitterand, Kohl; and all of them, with no exception [words indistinct] heads of the state and governments said that the question is not whether assistance should be extended, but that it should be applied to specific programs. So, the task is to come up with specific programs. All those conversations had a common point: Our countries are ready to give you aid, but it is up to you to support your programs regarding their technical, technological, or legal aspects, and then submit them to those countries and the World Bank. So, ABB has a priority in this area, because we have been working with this concern for more than a year. I met with its president in Zurich last year in Switzerland. Since that time, we have been concentrating on the problems facing Ukraine. The concern has concrete proposals. They also include establishing an investment fund in nuclear engineering, and the Ukrainian engineering in general. The issue of hard currency investments is very important for us. Thus, the task of freeing Ukraine from dependency on energy is a leading priority. Another priority is agriculture. One should act very quickly here, but equipped with programs so that we could see things in perspective. To sum it up, I would like to say that such a powerful company as ABB can do very much for Ukraine. Following today's meeting, I am convinced that specific plans, programs, and intentions are on hand. [end recording] [Ukrainian translation of Barnevick's words] I think that improvement of reliability at nuclear power plants is one of the prime tasks, because nuclear plants will help reduce dependency on oil and natural gas. This was the topic of our conversation with the Ukrainian president. We were discussing not only the technical side of this issue, but also the possibility of creating a special investment fund. We have some experience acquired by the first joint venture. Now, we are considering setting up several more similar ventures in Ukraine. Ukraine is one of the countries where we could do a lot.
