Such a meeting "would help to consolidate the approaches" of the interested sides, he said at a news conference following talks here with Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. A. Kozyrev stressed the role of the EU in settling the Bosnian conflict, which he described as "a key factor." As a representative of an EU member country, the Irish minister supported the proposal to urgently sit down at the negotiating table. "Once we get down to directly discussing the problem it won't be so difficult to reach a common international position," D. Spring noted, replying to an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question on the closeness of the approaches of Russia and the EU to this regional conflict.
