As such, mere condemnation of the ugly crime will not do. The international community has to show resolve and vision in this part of the world too. But first it has to agree on the folly of keeping Jewish settlers in the midst of the Arab communities in the occupied territories. By placing Jewish zealots literally on the back of the Palestinians, the Israeli governments, past and present, have become accomplices in the latest manifestation of hatred against Arabs. There is every possibility that the massacre will draw violent reactions by the Palestinians, which would add to the cycle of violence, undermining in the process the entire peace effort. While a halt to Arab-Israeli negotiations should not be brought about by any violent act, regardless of how outrageous and wherever it comes from, the Israeli government nevertheless is duty-bound to take a number of immediate measures to help heal the deep wounds that yesterday's ugly massacre has inflicted on Arab and Muslim hearts and other human beings everywhere. The Israeli authorities should not content themselves with a thorough investigation of how the alleged killer got into the mosque and was able "single-handedly" to murder so many people at once. Israeli also has to release details of the truth of what happened and to reveal the full extent of any plot that may have well been hatched by more than the "lone" man in "mental crisis" who fired the shots. But beyond that, the Labour-led government of Yitzhaq Rabin has to outlaw extremist groups among the settlers and has to begin today the process of disarming them in a prelude to taking all neo-colonialists inside the "green line." Those settlers who want to leave the occupied territories have to be encouraged to do so. Prime Minister Rabin cannot procrastinate on this for tactical or any other reasons; and certainly those fanatic Jews who live with their arms and destructive ideology in Arab cities and towns, like Hebron, have to be evicted right away. There will be many questions on how the "lone" settler got into the mosque fully armed, started and continued shooting for several long minutes, without the Israeli army coming to the rescue of the helpless victims. There will be other questions on how the Israeli authorities provided or failed to provide timely medical assistance to the wounded, why they rejected all pleas for lifting the curfew against Hebron and troops went on to kill 10 more Palestinians on the streets of the occupied territories shortly after the massacre. The settlers cannot be allowed to go on the rampage in Arab towns and villages, erect barricades and block roads, humiliate young and elderly Arabs under the eyes and nose of the Israeli Army. If this situation continues to prevail, the cycle of violence will continue and can ultimately derail the whole peace process, unless of course the Rabin government acts firmly and fast to save the historic reconciliation that was started in Washington on Sept. 13. The seeds of yesterday's massacre were planted long ago when the Israelis brought in the settlers, the majority of whom are fanatics and religious zealots, armed them and in many cases unleashed them against the people of the West Bank and Gaza. The laxity and the carrot-only policy which the Israeli security forces have been pursuing with the settlers was bound to result in the kind of lawlessness and extremist acts that we witnessed yesterday. Everything now depends on the way the Israeli government handles the aftermath of the gross and terrorist act at Haram al-Ibrahimi. The international community can help heal the wounds, but only if it brings pressure to bear on the Israelis to do what is right.
