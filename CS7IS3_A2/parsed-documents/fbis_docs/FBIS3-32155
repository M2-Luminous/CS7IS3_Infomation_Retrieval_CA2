Three months ago, Jobim was elected rapporteur of the constitutional revision process--the corrections that are to be made in the 1988 Constitution. He has had not a moment's peace since then. After barely two weeks as rapporteur, he had to swap his cellular telephone with a friend and install an answering machine in his house. Jobim spends hardly any time at home now. He eats, drinks, and sleeps constitutional revision. "During the day, I even drink tea and coffee while talking about the revision," the deputy joked. The task is Herculean. The deadline for submission of amendments has now expired; there are a total of 17,000 suggestions. All of them will pass through a screening process coordinated by Jobim, who will have four deputy rapporteurs to help him with the job. So far, all this work on a subject as important as the constitutional revision has been obscured by the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee]. Legislators will have to work hard from now on, if the revision is to be finished by 15 March, the date set by Congress for promulgation of the revised text. The importance of the subject merits such an effort. "The country needs this revision," Jobim said. "The bottlenecks that hold back production and the economy are in the tax area, and in the concentration of monopolies in the hands of the government." At age 47, married, three children, an attorney on leave from his partnership in a law firm with offices in Brasilia and Rio Grande do Sul, Jobim will have even more work to do between now and 15 March. He wants to end government monopolies, change the social security system, establish an external control over the judiciary, and approve a tax reform package that will reduce the number of taxes and increase the number of taxpayers. Last week, in the midst of reading the proposed amendments, the deputy gave VEJA the following interview: [Costa Pinto] Are you sure we are going to get a revision? [Jobim] Yes, we will get a revision. All we need to do to make this more obvious to the general public is to agree on a minimum agenda listing the topics of the revision. Starting this week, I will hold separate conversations with all the party leaders to reach such an understanding. I am going to talk to parties that oppose the revision, such as the PT [Workers Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], and the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]. We will start the debate on the revision by discussing legislative immunity, a subject on which those parties cannot fail to express an opinion. Once we have given it an initial kick, the revision will get moving. [Costa Pinto] What will be on this minimum agenda? [Jobim] The agenda will represent a consensus of my conversations with the leaders. I see two blocs of issues. One--economic--includes tax reform, changes in the monopoly system, and restructuring of the pact between the federal government and the states. The other--political--concerns modifying the elections system. [Costa Pinto] Will the revision generate a revised and expanded, or a revised and abridged, edition of the Constitution? [Jobim] As rapporteur, I want to produce an abridged version of the Constitution. We have made a rule: no inventions. There is no room for unnecessary novelties, for creating new issues and new chapters. To the extent that more issues are placed into the Constitution, the powers of Congress are reduced and those of the judges, of the Judiciary, expanded. The constitutionalization of subject matter leads to the jurisdictionalization of politics, i.e., giving the Federal Supreme Court an opportunity to rule on everything that is done in this country, because everything becomes a constitutional matter; this curtails the freedom of the Executive Branch and the legislators. [Costa Pinto] How will the Congress find time to debate the merits of the 17,000 amendments submitted for the constitutional revision? [Jobim] We are not going to discuss the amendments one by one, only the topics of the revision and their merits. We have received 80 amendments that regulate the president's use of "provisional measures." I will not read all of them. We need to find out what the majority thinks about the subject and then draft consensus amendments inspired by those 80 original amendments. You would not believe how much repetition there is in those 17,000 amendments. [Costa Pinto] Is the 1988 Constitution that bad? [Jobim] I would divide the 1988 Constitution into two parts. The part on individual rights and guarantees, which is very good, and the part on the design of the State--which is faulty. We must redefine federalism and the system of government, because the Constitution is very unsatisfactory on those points. We have to do something about the Judiciary, an area where the 1988 Constituent Assembly made no progress at all. The way money is spent in Brazil is wrong, and the CPI's are proof of that. When we drafted the present Constitution, we were looking backward. Everything that the military had done looked wrong to us. That is not reality. [Costa Pinto] It is not for lack of laws that Brazil is in crisis. Do we really need this revision, which is, after all, a process of enacting new laws? [Jobim] We do. The bottlenecks that hold back production and the economy are in the tax area, and in the concentration of monopolies in the hands of the government. In 1988, we gave special favors to outmoded monopolistic protectionism, something very common in mercantile capitalism, and we forgot to protect the user, the consumer--in short, the taxpayer. We ended up creating an economy of special privilege, a monopolistic economy that leans toward statism, that does not protect the ordinary Brazilian. This habit of creating laws is a fault we inherited from the Portuguese. They thought they could resolve things that way, and even today they have one of the world's most complicated bureaucracies. But, on the other hand, you cannot modernize institutions without enacting laws. Our big mistake was to transform laws into speeches, making everything polemic. [Costa Pinto] In an election year, will legislators be capable of drafting a Constitution that reduces the size of the State, changes the tax system, ends retirement based on length of service, and redistributes the obligations between governors and mayors? [Jobim] Administrative decentralization is one of the strongest trends that is emerging in this revision. It is a way of redesigning the State by redoing the federative pact. The CPI on PC Farias concluded that the corruption of the Executive Branch was possible only because of the concentration of powers in the hands of the president of the Republic and the ministers. States and cities, which won more revenues starting in 1988, must now assume new obligations, and the federal bureaucracy that is entrenched in Brasilia opposes this, because it would curb Brasilia's power. The suppliers are another group that is rising up against decentralization. It is easier to corrupt a centralized State--you just go to Brasilia--than to travel around the country buying special privileges. With administrative decentralization, you also dilute the power of politicians, who love to propagate problems so they can sell solutions. This renovation of the State has to be part of the party discourse. One legislator cannot take an unpopular position like this because he will get burned, but the parties have an obligation to adopt this line. After all, if they expect to come to power, they need to be concerned about what they will inherit. [Costa Pinto] Why, and by whom, was the agreement made not to meddle with the so-called "social conquests" of the 1988 Constitution? [Jobim] I did that. Early last year, I was at a meeting of businessmen in Porto Alegre, attended by American economists, and everyone jumped all over the rights of workers as stated in the Constitution. I told them that if they thought the purpose of the revision was to take away worker rights, they were not only mistaken, but they would kill all chances of accomplishing anything. The revision would become ideologized, and centrist parties like the PMDB and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] would be shoved over toward the Left and forced to forge alliances with the PT and the communist parties. I made them realize that the important thing is to change the economic order and the social security system, end the monopolies, and modernize the federative pact. After that, the leaders of the PMDB and PSDB agreed to take a firm stand against changes in the social conquests. The PFL [Liberal Front Party] did not take a position, making it clear that it would go along with that agreement. [Costa Pinto] Two polls, one by Diap and another by MultiConsultoria, found that more than 70 percent of the legislators want to change the electoral system by instituting mixed district voting. What kind of election system is Brazil likely to have after the revision? [Jobim] The trend I have observed in the amendments submitted is toward the mixed district vote. Our election system has outlived its usefulness. It dates from 1932, which was the Getulio Vargas era, when Minas and Sao Paulo were taking turns electing the presidents, when there were no political parties. After this revision, we will probably have election of regional deputies and national deputies. The current election system is brutal: it induces the country not to think. No one gets elected on national issues. [Costa Pinto] Might the revision vote on only the most pressing topics now and leave the rest to 1995? [Jobim] No. There will be only one revision. The revision proposed by the 1988 Constituent Assembly has to begin and end without intermissions. And how could we carry out a revision in 1995, with a new Congress and a new president? If new the president has a majority, he would conduct a revision in his image and likeness. If he is weak, he would become a hostage to Congress. [Jobim] From what you have already read of the amendments in the tax area, what model of tax collection and how many taxes are likely to survive in the revised Constitution? [Costa Pinto] There are eight kinds of complete proposals for tax reform. Six of them retain the classic concept of taxation on income, consumption, and property. What almost all of them have in common is elimination of points of over-taxation, such as a reduction in the burden on payrolls, in exchange for a new withholding tax rate of 5 percent that would catch all wages and salaries. There are also two more radical proposals, such as the one by Flavio Rocha, which would leave Brazil with only three taxes: the IPMF [Provisional Tax on Financial Operations], the tax on foreign trade, and a tax on beverages and games of chance. Then there is a proposal by Deputy Luis Roberto Ponte that would leave us with eight taxes. [Costa Pinto] Will Brazil have fewer state enterprises and be free of the monopolies after 1994? [Jobim] The state enterprises are the thorn in the side of this revision, and this country. The State is no longer an agent of production as it was in the 1950's and 1960's. State enterprises are not a subject of the constitutional revision--monopolies are. Today we have three big state monopolies: petroleum, telecommunications, and nuclear energy. No amendments suggest changes in the nuclear field. As for petroleum, some amendments that would completely abolish the monopoly, leaving Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] with nothing to do. Others seek a middle ground--maintaining the monopoly on exploration and drilling for petroleum in the hands of Petrobras and privatizing the refining and distribution. Then there are amendments that would allow private enterprise to enter all phases, by government concession. The problems in telecommunications are exactly the same, and the proposals are similar. Now from what I have already seen and discussed in the Congress, I can say with certainty that the monopolies will not stay the way they are. How they will change, I cannot yet say. We need to get a feeling as to what kind of State the majority of congressmen want. An interventionist State? A regulatory State? A do-nothing State? This issue will split the body between neoliberals, advocates of greater flexibility, and statists. [Costa Pinto] Hasn't the attention paid to the Budget CPI cooled off the debates on the constitutional revision? [Jobim] Actually, it was a good thing that the spotlights were turned toward the CPI. Without unproductive debates on bureaucracy, the revision was able to get a head start on its deadlines and only now, when ideology and the different parties' plans for Brazil are coming to the fore, will we go back to discussing ideas. That is why the CPI did not hurt us, it helped. Now that the CPI's deadline has been extended to the 24th, voting on the revision could start on the 26th. [Costa Pinto] But the revision has to end on 15 March. And Carnival falls in the middle of that period. Isn't that too little time for the public to participate in the revision? [Jobim] The timetable is certainly tight, but the public should and will participate in the debate. But I must remind you that this is not a Constituent Assembly, and nothing is going to be invented. We are only going to rewrite and delete. Tax reform, which is perhaps the most controversial topic and the one that most directly affects the average citizen, has been under discussion for two years now. The rest are well-known topics--they may be controversial because they are ideological, but I do not see the general public mobilizing against the revision. The vested interests are against it, yes. But it seems to me that they are also against citizens and taxpayers. [Costa Pinto] How can a good Constitution prevent, or at least make it more difficult for thieves to get into the political machinery and how can it prevent reruns of CPI's like the ones on PC Farias and the budget? [Jobim] We can close the loopholes in the Constitution that are open to corruption. We do not need to stiffen the penalties against corrupt individuals, what we need to do is prevent corruption by reducing the size of the State. If Brasilia's power over the aspirations of Brazil is diminished and the oversight mechanisms are strengthened, we will have made a fine contribution to this country. Increasing the repressive machinery does not reduce corruption; on the contrary, it raises the stakes in the battle of good versus evil, and makes the corrupt more creative. [Costa Pinto] Will the revision tend to improve the relationship between the executive, judicial, and legislative branches, or will the three parties continue to clash with each other? [Jobim] The American Constitution created three branches of government so that they could share the power. Now--and this is not merely a Brazilian phenomenon--we have separate institutions that fight among themselves for the power to be a branch of government. The Executive Branch wants to be the Legislative Branch and get rid of the Judiciary. The Legislative loves to play at being the Executive, and the Judiciary likes to be all three together. In a democratic state, power exists only if those who hold it are responsible to the nation. There is a social duty to be accountable to the ordinary people, but none of the three branches permit administrative oversight and they do not have independent sources of revenue. When people talk about external control over the Judiciary, they are talking about the rendering of an administrative and financial accounting. On that point I will not yield. There is no justification for a superior court judge--in Brasilia for example--to take two years to write up the opinion on a decision on which the full court has voted. The decision is not valid until the opinion has been issued, so why is that judge holding back those opinions? I don't know. But that situation exists, and it is going on right now. [Costa Pinto] And the PMDB? Don't you feel uncomfortable belonging to a party that is the target of so many charges of corruption, one that has no platform? [Jobim] We must not confuse personal relationships with political ones. The problem with the PMDB is that we have no party line. We have nothing to say to the country. We have no platform and no model for Brazil. Having a platform is crucial to party unity. If it does not exist, then unity moves into the personal field. In 1994, we peemedebistaswill take refuge in our regional realities and will, in the last analysis, be absent from the national political debate. We in Rio Grande do Sul decided not to leave the party because southerners have a hard time understanding such changes. We decided to stay and fight to purge the party of the bad apples and give the party a purpose. [Costa Pinto] If Quercia or Sarney get control of the PMDB machine and become viable presidential candidacies, would you vote for them? [Jobim] There is no possibility of my voting for either of them. I would even work against them, and would urge the PMDB in Rio Grande do Sul to rebel against them. [Costa Pinto] Does the fact that the government has had no leader in the Chamber for three weeks now, and has not submitted proposals for the revision help, or hinder? [Jobim] The administration's absence from the revision is unfortunate. The logic of the presidential system of government depends heavily on the president of the Republic. He sets the tone for the opposition. We lack an opposition simply because there is a feeling that we also lack a government. Itamar has forgotten that he sits in a chair where one is supposed to think about the country. [Costa Pinto] And Itamar--does he help, or hinder? [Jobim] He neither helps nor hinders, and that's the worst of it. He is neglecting his duties. His administration lacks substance. It's spongy. One minister pulls the government to one side, wanting to enact a tax reform and balance the books, but another minister wants to rehire 100,000 civil servants. Itamar is the head of a government that lacks direction. Note that I am not questioning the president's intentions--only the way he is doing his job.
