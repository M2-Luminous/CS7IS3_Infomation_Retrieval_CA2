And so saying, Yoshikazu Hori, president of Japan Cray Company, the Japanese arm of Cray Research Company of the United States, instructed his man in charge of negotiations with government offices to ask the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] about the deal. This happened when Fujitsu's bid won the firm its first supercomputer contract under the first 1993 supplementary budget. MITI insisted "there was no problem" with the bidding, but Cray was not satisfied. Of the 11 sets of supercomputers bought by the government under the supplementary budget, six were U.S.-made. As this was more than the five Japan-made sets, one would have thought this would have alleviated trade friction, but there was still more trouble ahead. "Problems in Procurement Procedure" In tenders under the initial 1993 budget, Japanese manufacturers won all four bids to supply supercomputers. In July last year, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, complained strongly about this, warning, "U.S. concern is mounting." He said he would watch closely procurement done under the supplementary budgets. Results of procurement under the first supplementary budget show that even though Cray won only two, U.S. companies won six altogether. Cray argued that the reason it failed to win up to five of the contracts, as it had expected, was the result of problems with government procedure. President Hori of Japan Cray insisted: "The technical performance review should be done more strictly, through the creation of a third-party evaluation agency, and price ceilings should be set to prevent price competition from becoming excessive." Cray is concerned about Fujitsu, which won contracts to supply four sets in biddings this time around. Take, for instance, the bidding to supply Tsukuba University Academic Information Processing Center. In terms of technical performance evaluation, Fujitsu's product led Cray's slightly, but was a long way ahead of NEC Corporation's. Fujitsu offered its product at about 2 billion yen, way below the 3.5 billion yen cost quoted by Cray and lower, even, than NEC's price of 2.6 billion yen. An executive member of U.S. Cray, who was in Japan at the time of the bidding, was told of Fujitsu's price and said: "This is incredible." NEC managing director Akira Kobayashi said his company "could not have anticipated" such a low price. The contract is awarded on the basis of dividing technical performance points by price. NEC opted for a low-price bid in view of the known performance of its product. Fujitsu's product, not only high-performance but low in price, was a landslide winner. In other projects Fujitsu has won bids even when it was not the lowest bidder. Chairman Takuma Yamamoto said the "victory was due to good planning." To Cray, however, it "looks like a money-losing deal." Domestic Manufacturers Are Cool The U.S. Government and Cray had previously insisted that bidding procedures should be made clear, and that Japanese Government procurement was not clear enough. Since then, competition over price has intensified and, as a result, an ironic situation has developed -- Cray is at even more of a disadvantage. Japan Cray President Hori said: "If the price comes down too low, it becomes a precedent, and insufficient funds will be set aside in the budget for the next round of procurement." The first supplementary budget envisaged spending about 30 billion yen on supercomputers, but ended up spending only about 22 billion yen. Domestic manufacturers have little sympathy for Cray's position. NEC said: "The technical performance evaluation is something that should be done by the users, any third-party review agency is not necessary. Besides, they should not denounce efforts by manufacturers to bring their prices down." Fujitsu said: "The United States in its tenders applies the Buy-American clause, which gives preferential treatment to U.S.-made products. It does not make sense to complain about Japanese Government procurements only." These two Japanese companies -- Fujitsu and NEC -- sell their products in the United States, but neither has managed to sell to government offices. To find out why Cray has lost its previous market share within the context of a very good performance overall by U.S. companies, it is necessary to note that the supercomputer industry is now undergoing a new wave of technological reform called "paralleling." In the field of parallel computers, Cray and Japanese manufacturers have been laggard. Among the new, rising forces are Intel and Thinking Machines of the United States. In bids for parallel computers, three Japanese companies, including Hitachi Ltd., have participated in government procurement tenders in cooperation with these U.S. companies. Many "Japanese-U.S. alliances" have been born, and a Fujitsu official went so far as to say "Japan-U.S. friction centered on Cray is a thing of the past." Time To Find Common Ground To date, Cray supercomputers have represented the very essence of U.S. high-technology. And competition between Cray and Japanese manufacturers who have tried to catch up with its technological lead has led to friction. But that is coming to an end, and now Japan and the United States are reaching a state of equilibrium. An associate professor at a national research organization said: "Cray's difficulties are now due to its backwardness in paralleling technology." Total supercomputer demand in Japan amounts to about 40 to 50 billion yen a year. Even if U.S.-made products took the whole market, its contribution to reducing Japan's trade surplus would be small. It is only because the products were thought to be symbols of high-technology that Japanese and U.S. manufacturers been at each other's throats. Meanwhile, users have been given no say. Users in Japan and the United States should get together and exchange information and discuss procurement procedures to find common ground for competition between the two countries.
