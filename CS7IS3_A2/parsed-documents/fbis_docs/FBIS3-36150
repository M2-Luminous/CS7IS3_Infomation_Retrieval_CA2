Such a party could coordinate actions to defend civil rights, counter communist and fascist propaganda, and conduct election campaigns more effectively. Interfax has learned that Yegor Gaydar notes in a letter sent to the leadership of Democratic Russia that the December elections demonstrated what a broad base the conservatives and right-wing radicals have in our country. The present wavering government could kill the beginnings of stabilization and a new spiral of crisis could open the way to power for forces that would threaten Russia's very existence, Yegor Gaydar's message says. He also stresses that given the circumstances, all democratic forces needed to unite.
