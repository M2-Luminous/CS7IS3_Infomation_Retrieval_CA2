Veras said this process would be implemented this month. In addition to the elimination of 13 directorates, the name of DNOCS might be changed to National Department of Semi-Arid Zones [Departamento Nacional do Semi-Arido]. DNOCS allegedly drilled wells, in an irregular procedure, on a ranch owned by Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira (PFL-PE) [Liberal Front Party-Pernambuco State]. Four regional directorates -- Pernambuco, Ceara, Piaui, and Bahia -- will be eliminated. The central administration's directorates in Fortaleza, namely Water Resources, Fish Farms, Irrigation, and Administration-Finance, would be spared. DNOCS Director General Hildeberto Araujo has confirmed the revamping. DNOCS, established in 1909, now has 3,183 employees and a $240 million budget subject to approval by Congress. According to Araujo, President Itamar Franco will, within the next few days, form a commission to study a transfer of jurisdiction of the Sao Francisco River, which was proposed by the Regional Integration Ministry. Beni Veras proposed forming a commission to study the use and protection of the Sao Francisco River, a commission to be formed by 10 northeastern states. The jurisdiction transfer of the river would involve the states of Pernambuco, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraiba. The proposal includes the establishment of a national park to protect the river's headwaters vegetation on both banks. According to the planning minister, Bahia State, which has been benefiting from the river by using aqueducts, is being "selfish" in opposing the project to transfer jurisdiction of the Sao Francisco River to the northeastern states, where there are no permanently flowing rivers.
