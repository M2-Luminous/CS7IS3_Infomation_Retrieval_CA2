FR940831-0-00011 FR940831-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;07; Amendment 39&hyph;9011; AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;16] Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Aircraft Engines CT7 Series Turboprop Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) CT7 series turboprop engines, that currently requires a one-time ultrasonic inspection of a suspect population of propeller shafts for metallurgical defects, and if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. This amendment extends the compliance time for the required ultrasonic inspection on certain propeller shafts. This amendment is prompted by information indicating that the equipment necessary to perform the ultrasonic inspection is less available than originally assumed. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft. DATES: Effective September 15, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 15, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 31, 1994.
