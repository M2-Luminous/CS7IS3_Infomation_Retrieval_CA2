FR940429-0-00296 FR940429-0-00016 32. Comment: Some commenters believed that a guaranty agency should not be the party that mails a discharge application to a borrower identified under this subparagraph of the regulations. Instead, the commenters believed it would be more appropriate for the guaranty agency to mail the application package to the lender or servicer, who would then mail it to the borrower. The commenters believed that this change would assist the lender in determining when to cease collections and would also avoid any borrower confusion. Discussion: This provision of the proposed regulations requires a guaranty agency to ``*␣*␣* review its records of loans that it holds *␣*␣*'' (emphasis added). The lender is not the holder of loans held by the guaranty agency. The guaranty agency will mail the application package to a borrower whose loan is held by the agency. For loans held by a lender, the lender will mail the application package to the borrower. Change: None. Section 682.402(d)(6)(ii)(D) 33. Comment: Some commenters noted that, in the case of a loan held by the guaranty agency, the proposed regulations did not require the guaranty agency to inform a borrower that the borrower's loan obligation has been discharged. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenters. Change: The final regulations have been revised to require a guaranty agency, in the case of a borrower whose loan is held by the agency, to send written notification to the borrower no later than 30 days after the agency determines that the borrower has satisfied all of the conditions required for discharge of the loan. Section 682.402(d)(6)(ii)(E) 34. Comment: Some commenters believed it is counterproductive to set time limits that the borrower must meet if there is no penalty incurred by a borrower who fails to comply with those time limits. The commenters recommended a deletion of the prohibition against a borrower being denied a closed school loan discharge solely on the basis of the borrower's failure to meet any time limits set by the lender, guaranty agency, or Secretary. Discussion: There are no time-driven requirements with respect to the submission of information that a borrower must meet to qualify for a closed school loan discharge. Perhaps the commenters misinterpreted the lender's requirement in §682.402(d)(7)(ii) to resume collection efforts against a borrower who failed to submit, within 60 days, the written request and sworn statement necessary for loan discharge. However, that requirement only has the effect of reactivating collection efforts, and does not disqualify the borrower from later submitting a complete application for loan discharge. Change: None. Section 682.402(d)(7)(i) 35. Comment: Some commenters believed that a lender should not be permitted to suspend collection efforts against a borrower for whom the lender has received reliable information from a source other than a guaranty agency or the Secretary indicating that the borrower may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge. Discussion: The Secretary does not believe that either he or a guaranty agency will always be the first to know that a specific borrower may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge. For example, the school itself could notify the lender that it had closed, or a legal aid group working on behalf of students could notify the lender of students who it believed were eligible. The Secretary believes that it would be in the best interests of the borrower to permit a lender to exercise its judgment concerning the reliability of the sources of information it receives. Change: None. Section 682.402(d)(7)(ii) 36. Comment: Some commenters believed that a lender that resumes collection activity against a borrower who fails to submit the documentation required for a closed school loan discharge should be required to grant forbearance to the borrower to absolve the borrower of any delinquency status existing on the loan, including delinquency that occurred before the date the lender suspended collection activity. The commenters believed that the borrower's delinquency is generally the result of the borrower's inability to pay due to circumstances caused by the school. Discussion: The Secretary believes there is no reason to conclude that a borrower who did not qualify for a closed school loan discharge should, nevertheless, be presumed to have been harmed by the school to the extent that the borrower could not comply with the terms of his or her repayment agreement with the lender. Change: None. 37. Comment: Some commenters believed the 60-day administrative forbearance period permitted while a lender awaited the borrower's submission of documentation is too short. The commenters believed that up to 90 days would be necessary to address the borrower's questions and for the borrower to submit documentation to the lender. Discussion: A 60-day period is the standard administrative forbearance period permitted for purposes of awaiting documentation for other purposes e.g., death, disability, or bankruptcy cancellations. The Secretary believes that 60 days is more than adequate for the borrower to submit the request for discharge and sworn statement for a closed school discharge.
