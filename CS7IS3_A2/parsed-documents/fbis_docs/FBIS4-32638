After the talks Ivo Sanader gave the following statement: [Begin Sanader recording] It is true, as Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi said, we have met several times before, the last time at the Crans Montana forum in Bucharest where we exchanged our governments' official stands and viewpoints regarding the crisis in the entire territory of southeastern Europe. Our talks now were very pleasant and interesting and to us also necessary, because we will put forward a request to the UN General Assembly--as our public already knows--to include the peaceful reintegration of the UNPA [UN Protected Area] into the Republic of Croatia on the agenda of a session scheduled for the third week of September. For this item to be included in the agenda we will need help from all countries and all our friends. To this aim our Minister Granic sent Minister Serreqi a letter of support [as heard]. We hope-- and we discussed it today---that Albania will support this request by Croatia. I can say that the minister promised us something of this kind. This was one issue. Another one concerned bilateral relations and the situation in the region, in both Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosovo, and especially expectations linked with the plan that the Contact Group will present at the beginning of July. I briefed the minister on our stand regarding this matter and we agreed on the whole about the key issues and ways in which the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be resolved. [end recording]
