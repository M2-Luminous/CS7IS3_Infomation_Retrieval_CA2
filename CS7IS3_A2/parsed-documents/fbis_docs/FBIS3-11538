The president was reacting to an agreement reached in New York on Saturday, 19 March, between Netherlands Development Cooperation Minister Pronk, the IMF, and Surinamese Foreign Minister Mungra and Planning and Development Cooperation Minister Assen. After the meeting Pronk said that Paramaribo had agreed to IMF monitoring of the structural modification program which the Surinamese economy was to undergo. The IMF will report progress made each quarteron. The state of affairs and the Netherlands will decide on this basis whether or not Suriname will receive or how much money Suriname will receive as support for its balance of payments, the minister said. But Venetiaan refused on Sunday to commit himself. "We have not yet made any decision. First, we want to see what demands are made," the president said in his initial reaction to IMF monitoring. Paramaribo has always resisted IMF checks on the grounds that the institution would support excessively rigorous economic cuts. Suriname wanted the British Warwick Institute to follow up the process rather than the IMF. But the Warwick Institute indicated that it wanted to do no more than assist the IMF. In addition this was unacceptable to the Netherlands. The Development Cooperation Ministry was assuming yesterday that the agreements made on Saturday were valid. "If two prominent Surinamese Government ministers agree on something like this, then it is serious business," Pronk's spokesman said. He added that the agreements still had to be approved by IMF Director Camdessus and President Venetiaan. Before his departure for New York on Friday, Pronk said that Suriname had to decide in the near future about the monitoring of the recovery program. Elections would soon be held in the Netherlands, followed by the formation of a new cabinet, and according to the minister, that could lead "to a huge amount of lost time" in the resumption of aid to Suriname, Pronk's spokesman said. On the basis of the 1992 Framework Treaty, Suriname is still due approximately 1.2 billion guilders for items including balance of payments support, subject to the condition that it takes measures to boost the economy. If everything goes well, this support will be spread over approximately 10 years. It is separate from project aid, which is continuing normally and remains outside IMF monitoring. The Netherlands is providing this aid for social facilities, education, health care, and infrastructure.
