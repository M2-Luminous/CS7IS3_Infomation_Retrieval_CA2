[passage omitted] The hijacker's bomb turned out to be a vitamin can with three batteries, one nail and a matchbox inside, and wired with thin cable, said a government official. The couple told police they had been forced to seek asylum after the Chinese communists demolished their house four months ago. A government statement said Luo, holding the fake bomb in one hand, threatened the pilot while his wife showed a card on which was written "Go to Taiwan, or we will blow up the plane" to stewardess Zhang Wei. Pilot Zhen Shanming said he did not have enough fuel to fly to Taiwan, but agreed to do so after the hijacker threatened to detonate the device, the government statement said. The earlier attempted hijacking reported by the Broadcasting Corporation of China occurred near the neutral line separating airspace between China and Taiwan. [passage omitted] Tuesday's hijacking came only a day after China vowed to beef up security at its airports, which western experts consider to be lamentably poor. Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), Jiang Zhuping, said China would invest 200 million yuan ($35 million) next year to build a series of safety facilities, including "defensive stockades surrounding airports and equipment for safety examinations and fire prevention." Flight crew members will be "instructed to take action against hijackers," the report said, but only "on the supreme principle of ensuring the absolute safety of passengers and the planes," Jiang, quoted by the Xinhua news agency, said.
