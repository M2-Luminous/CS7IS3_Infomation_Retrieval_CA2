FBIS4-53795 "dreas098_d_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 21 May 1994 South Korea Papers Comment on DPRK's Economic Difficulties Papers Comment on DPRK's Economic Difficulties SK2005120894 SK2005120894 BFN [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers publish editorials and articles on 20 May in reaction to recent reports on North Korea's food shortage and economic difficulties. The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "North Korea is Hungry." The editorial writes North Korea's economic crisis is becoming more apparent citing the defection of the Yo Man-chol family and North Korean loggers from Russia, Kim Il-song's request to an Indian provincial governor for emergency food aid, and the news that North Korea is not participating in the Hiroshima Asian Games. The editorial comments that "although South Koreans undoubtedly want to help compatriots when they even send aid to Somalia, some people are concerned that the aid may only help the Kim Il-song regime." Therefore, the editorial asserts that "North Korea should convince the South that economic support will benefit the people, not the party or the Army, by resolving the nuclear issue as soon as possible." Stressing that chaos in North Korea is not desired either by the South, the editorial urges the North to withdraw the confrontation policy and reconstruct the economy. The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word article by reporter Yu Sung-u analyzing the background of Kim Il-song's request of food aid to India. Recapitulating North Korea's decreased crops since the eighties, the article stresses that the question is whether North Korea's system can endure the food shortage. The article cites an intelligence report stating that "North Korea began to release reserve grain" and a contrasting analysis that "North Korea is trying to secure enough food to prepare for international and UN economic sanctions." The analysis notes the fact that North Korea recently purchased low-quality rice from Thailand but resold it to European countries and thus, the food shortage is not so serious as to bring about a collapse of North Korea's establishment. Noting that the critical period will be before the corn harvest in July and August this year, the article concludes that we still have to wait and see if the slogan "Rice is communism" will be paradoxically proven by the collapse of the system due to food shortage. HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Grievous Situation of North Korea." Listing the series of recent incidents proving the economic difficulties, the editorial deplores that Kim Il-song and his son are still playing the nuclear game. The editorial warns that if the diversion of nuclear material is proven by the International Atomic Energy Agency's ongoing inspection, the UN Security Council will impose economic sanctions worsening the situation. The editorial ends by urging Kim Il-song to provide nuclear transparency as soon as possible to save his establishment as well as his people. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The North Korean Nuclear Issue and its Food Crisis." Referring to North Korea's food shortage as a result of North Korea's own style socialists economic system and to North Korean defectors' remarks on the food crisis there, the editorial says, "North Korean President Kim Il-song's request for food aid and medicine from India shows that the North Korean food situation has reached a serious point." Referring to North Korea's decreased crops since the nineties and to South Korea's data on its worse crop production last year, the editorial says, "North Korea says its food shortage is due to cold weather and harmful insects, but the major factor is its collective farming method. It is certain that if North Korea continues to maintain the collective system, its agricultural production will not be increased any more in the future." Noting the North Korean Government's commitment that it will make its people eat rice with meat soup, the editorial says that if North Korea really wants to resolve the issue, it must remove a wall of closure and join the international community to seek a way for coexistence with others. Referring to North Korea's decision not to participate in the Hiroshima Asian Games, the editorial says that "this clearly shows that North Korea faces serious food shortage problems." Also, the editorial says, "if North Korea abandons its nuclear program and accepts the denuclerization on the Korean peninsula, it can receive food and economic aid from South Korea and other Western countries. North Korea should no longer adhere to the nuclear development program, but return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Also it should solve the people's clothing, food, and house problems first." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word entitled "North Korea's Increasing Food Shortage Problems Show an Ominous Sign." Referring to North Korea's serious current situation caused by its food shortage and lack of foreign currency, the editorial says, "South Korea must be prudent in dealing with North Korea's situation, while making efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue." Referring to the major background of North Korea's failure in its agricultural policy and to its lack of foreign currency, the editorial says that South Korea can provide grain aid to North Korea if the nuclear issue is resolved as was done in 1991. Predicting the bleak prospect of North Korea's grain production for next year and noting the need for the ROK Government to consider providing food aid to North Korea in the future when North Korea abandons its nuclear development program, the editorial then added, "the food shortage situation is not only serious to the North Korean Government, but also to us. It is highly possible that whether we want or not, North Korea may collapse suddenly. Therefore, we must be thoroughly alert to North Korea's possible provocation to plunder rice and oil from Seoul.
