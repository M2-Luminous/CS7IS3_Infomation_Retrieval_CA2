Tom Holloway has the story: The South African Police investigations concern flocks of ostriches from South Africa which (?smugglers) are swopping with ostrich flocks in Namibia, but illegally exporting to Swaziland and then reexporting to lucrative markets overseas. Mr. Reilly explained that as South Africa has the largest population of the most productive ostriches left in Africa, it has banned the export of its ostriches which are most wanted overseas, in order to conserve and build up South Africa's ostrich population. The fact that Namibia's ostrich industry has been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the birds) by South Africa, have increased the value and demand for ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry. Swaziland, however, said Mr. Reilly, does not want to be used in a racket which could damage its own ostrich industry, as well as the protected ostrich industry of its neighbor, South Africa. He said he had therefore agreed to assist the South African Police in their investigations concerning ostrich flocks in Namibia and a certain ostrich farm in Swaziland, currently engaged in exporting ostriches to overseas markets.
