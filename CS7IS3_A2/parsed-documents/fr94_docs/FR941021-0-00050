(e) Effective date. These provisions are effective with respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989.

Par. 3. Sections 301.6334&hyph;2, 301.6334&hyph;3 and 301.6334&hyph;4 are revised to read as follows: §301.6334&hyph;2 Wages, salary, and other income. (a) In general. Under section 6334 (a)(9) and (d) certain amounts payable to or received by a taxpayer as wages, salary, or other income are exempt from levy. This section describes the income of a taxpayer that is eligible for the exemption from levy (paragraph (b) of this section) and how exempt amounts are to be paid to the taxpayer (paragraph (c) of this section). Section 301.6334&hyph;3 describes that sum that will be exempt from levy for each of the taxpayer's pay periods. Pay periods are described in §301.6334&hyph;3. For the amounts exempt from levy, see §301.6334&hyph;3. (b) Eligible taxpayer income. Only wages, salary, or other income payable to the taxpayer after the levy is made on the payor may be exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages, salary, or other income that is paid to the taxpayer before levy is made on the payor will be so exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following example: Example. Delinquent taxpayer A, an individual, is employed by the M Corporation and is paid wages on Friday of each week. Accordingly, A is paid wages on Friday, February 16, 1990. On Saturday, February 17, A deposits these wages into his personal checking account at Bank N. On Tuesday, February 20, a notice of levy is served on the M Corporation and also on Bank N. Amounts payable to A as wages on Friday, February 23, 1990, and any payday thereafter may be exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages A deposited in his account at Bank N on February 17, 1990, is exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). (c) Payment of exempt amounts to taxpayer_ (1) From wages, salary, or income from other sources where levy on all sources not made. In the case of a taxpayer who has more than one source of wages, salary, or other income, the district director may elect to levy on only one or more sources while leaving other sources of income free from levy. If the wages, salary, or other income that the district director leaves free from levy equal or exceed the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9), computed in accordance with §301.6334&hyph;3 (and are not otherwise exempt), the district director may treat no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income on which the district director elects to levy as exempt from levy. In such a case, the district director must notify the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served that no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income is exempt from levy. The employer or other person upon whom the levy is served may rely on such notification in paying over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the absence of such notification from the district director, however, the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount exempt from levy pursuant to §301.6334&hyph;3 as if that employer or other person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, salary, or other income. Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(1) may be illustrated by the following example:
