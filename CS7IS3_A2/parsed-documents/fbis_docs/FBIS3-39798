[passage omitted] We know that Russia played an important role in the diplomatic breakthrough of the last 24 hours. The Moscow mediation has offered the Serbs an honorable face-saving device. Alain Juppe has welcomed the prospect of sending Russian peace-keeping forces to Sarajevo. Interviewed by Harry Sago, the French foreign minister explained that he was asking for such a measure: [Begin Juppe recording] For nearly 10 months I have been asking the Russians to join us in the field. It is not about asking the Russian soldiers to be [word indistinct] buffer. It is about putting contingents from as many countries as possible under the UN banner, under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command -- which is led as you know by a French general for the whole of the former Yugoslavia, by a British general for Bosnia, and by another French general, General Soubirou for Sarajevo. I will be pleased if a Russian peace-keeping contingent is included. We are told it [latest diplomatic breakthrough] is a Russian victory, I say it is a European victory. We have never ceased to ask for it. I am happy from the bottom of my heart because this could be an element that would facilitate the settlement of the problem. [end recording]
