Simmonds made the appeal ahead of Wednesday's start of a new session of parliament. Simmonds went on ZIZ, the state-owned radio and television system, Monday night to urge restraint in the face of a planned protest demonstration by the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP). Simmonds said his opponents should pursue the parliamentary process and the courts to settle their grievances. The Labour Party, like Simmonds' People's Action Movement (PAM), captured four seats in the November 29 poll but a larger majority of the popular vote. PAM teamed up with the Nevis Reformation Party to form a minority government. The Labour Party has been canvassing support across St. Kitts for a show of strength on Wednesday. The successful SKNLP candidates say they will not be taking up their seats in parliament, but would instead protest the swearing in of the minority government. The installation of the government led to clashes between the police and Labour Party supporters on December 2. Prime Minister Simmonds said the police had given no permission for a demonstration on Wednesday and warned: "Those who break the law will be dealt with appropriately." Referring to the December disturbance, which hurt the tourist industry, Simmonds said: "...We cannot afford or tolerate any similar disturbances now or in the future. We saw how quickly our country was set back and how abruptly the cruise ship trade dried up. Our economy is strong now and we need to keep it that way, but it can only remain so by the maintenance of law and order. But the Labour Party has threatened to close down town. Dr. Assim Martin, one of Labour's successful candidates, said the price for freedom and democracy was high "and we are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, not just for ourselves, but for all the people. We are prepared and ready, just like the people of South Africa who will get the choice of majority rule in April," said Martin.
