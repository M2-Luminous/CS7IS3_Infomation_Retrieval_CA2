Government establishments in Saana and some other parts of the country were subjected to bomb strikes, and clashes are occurring in the Aden area. Large-scale forces are involved in the fighting, and tanks, artillery, and aircraft are being employed. This is stated in a Russian Federation Foreign Ministry statement which has been received by ITAR-TASS. "These developments to all intents and purposes nullify the efforts that have been undertaken recently by many countries, including Russia, with a view to averting an escalation of the conflict between the northerners and southerners, and to inducing the Yemenis to seek mutually acceptable solutions and the preservation of the country's unity. In effect, the threat has arisen of the conflict escalating into civil war, which will inevitably bring the Yemeni people fresh suffering, large-scale casualties, and political chaos. Stemming from its traditional friendly relations with the Yemeni people -- in both the north and the south of the country -- Russia urgently calls on the opposing sides to cease hostilities immediately and to find within themselves the courage to settle their differences peacefully. Moscow considers that, whatever the reasons motivating those involved in the conflict, nothing can justify the killing of people, bloodshed, and destruction. Despite the depth of the internal differences in Yemen, Moscow believes in the political wisdom of its leaders, who have in the past shown their ability to tackle the most complex problems on the basis of the interests and aspirations of the Yemeni people," the Russian Foreign Ministry statement says.
