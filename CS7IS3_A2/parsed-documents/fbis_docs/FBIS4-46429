Right at the end of a party rally in the centre of Thessaloniki, the attacker had approached the speakers' stand and suddenly pulled out the 12-inch (30 cm) knife. Eurodeputy Vasilios Efraimidhis, Greek General Confederation of Labor (YSEE) secretary Ioannis Theonas and KKE Central Committee member Mikhail Spiridhakis were rushed to the nearby AHEPA [American-Hellenic Educational and Progressive Association] hospital, with deep stab wounds in their hips and thighs. The assailant was later identified as Manolis Theodhorakis, 54, a Greek emigrant worker who had recently returned from Germany, and his suspected accomplice, ironsmith Evangelos Radhos, 26. Immediately after the attack, outraged supporters beat Theodhorakis who is now in critical condition in hospital. All parties condemned the attack and demanded a full investigation, the apparent motive for the brutal attack still unknown.
