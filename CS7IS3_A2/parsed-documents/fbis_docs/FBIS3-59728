Introduction Concerning the problem of CO<inf> 2</inf> , several studies on the feasibility of the direct removal of CO<inf> 2</inf> from fossil fuel power plants have appeared<sup> 1)</sup> . As a CO<inf> 2</inf> removal technology, one which comes to our mind involves techniques of low-temperature processing, absorption, adsorption, and membrane separation. In this report, we deal with a system designed to absorb and remove CO<inf> 2</inf> by using a combination of hollow fiber membrane and liquid absorbent and to recycle the liquid absorbent through the use of the conventional heat dissipation type recycling method. This method has found its application in the fields of study of medicine, artificial lungs<sup> 2)</sup> , and the closed system of the universe<sup> 3),4)</sup> , as well as in the basic research of the various types of gases<inf> 5),8)</inf> . Recently, its application has been extended to the field of research aimed at removing CO<inf> 2</inf> <sup> 9-13)</sup> . In our previous report, we covered the analysis of CO<inf> 2</inf> mechanisms, selection of liquid absorbent, the evaluation of various types of membranes by absorption tests using hydrophobic porous membrane materials, and a test combined with a recycling part designed to verify the possibility of developing this method into a system. Also reported was the result of basic test we conducted using the direct current small module, constituting a film module used in the actual equipment--namely, the high-efficiency removal of CO<inf> 2</inf> and reduction in absorption component size. In this report, we will deal with results of the evaluation test aimed at improved performance and durability of the membrane, which plays a central role in this method and of feasibility study when this method was applied to the actual machine. 2. Experiment In our previous report, we pointed out that the porous material's mass transfer coefficient is approximately 10 times larger than that of the composite membrane, and, therefore, the porous membranes are more suited to our system<sup> 12,13)</sup> . In this report, we examined the optimization of the porous membrane and its durability. Moreover, in order to provide a clear picture of the characteristics of the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system, we conducted an experiment on CO<inf> 2</inf> -N<inf> a</inf> OH system. 2.1. Experimental Equipment We used the nine types of porous membranes shown in Table 1 as specimen membranes. They consist of Membrane No.1 polypropylene(PP) and Nos. 2-5, polyethylene (PE), used as specimen mainly in the CO<inf> 2</inf> NaOH system experiment; Nos. 6-8 membranes polytetrafuloroethylene (PTFE); and No.9 membrane, a surface-reformed PE membrane produced by applying the coating of fluorine group monomers, mainly used as a specimen for CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system. For a specimen gas, assuming the use of coal firing, we used a cylinder gas (consisting of CO<inf> 2</inf> =15%, O<inf> 2</inf> =5%, and N=80%) saturated with moisture. Temperatures used in experiments were 50°C for membrane durability test and 25°C for the optimization test of porous material membranes, because of the availability of abundant material property data when we wish to make comparison with the previous report or to conduct analysis. Moreover, for this experiment, we used the equipment shown in the previous report<sup> 11-13)</sup> , together with its method of testing and measurement. Table 1. Specimen Membranes 2.2 Results and Considerations (1) Optimization of Porous Membrane The main factors related to transfer properties of the CO<inf> 2</inf> -NEA system requiring our consideration are membrane thickness &dgr;, hole ratio &egr;, and hollow fiber diameter d<inf> i</inf> . Of these, since d<inf> i</inf> is determined principally from the standpoint of resistance to liquid flow and increase in temperature by reaction heat, and separated from the transfer characteristics, this paper will deal with only the effects of &dgr; and &egr;. 1) Membrane Thickness &dgr; The resistance of porous gas membrane is given in the following equation: (1) R<inf> M</inf> =(k<inf> M</inf> x d<inf> 0</inf> /d<inf> 1</inf> <sup> -1</sup> The material transfer coefficient of the gas membrane, K<inf> m</inf> is written as follows: (2) k<inf> M</inf> =D<inf> G</inf> x &egr;/(&dgr; x &khgr;) We conclude from equations (1) and (2) that the smaller the &dgr;, the smaller the R<inf> m</inf> will become,. However, if this is to be evaluated by the experiment, it is necessary to have a membrane with a constant &egr; and a variable &dgr;. It will be extremely difficult to obtain such a membrane; moreover, what actually matters is the ratio of R<inf> m</inf> to the entire resistance R<inf> &tgr;</inf> shown in the following equation: (3) R<inf> T</inf> =(K<inf> exp</inf> x H)<sup> -1</sup> Consequently, we computed R<inf> m</inf> /R<inf> &tgr;</inf> of highly porous membranes Nos. 6-9 in order to obtain their relationship with &dgr;. Moreover, in Equation (3), K<inf> exp</inf> is an experimental value of an overall material transfer coefficient K of the inside diameter, and H denotes a henry constant of CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system. Using the following equation<sup> 14)</sup> , we used the compensated H<inf> 2</inf> O's henry constant H<inf> w</inf> : (4) log(C<inf> A</inf> /C<inf> AW</inf> =0.3C<inf> B</inf> (1+xC<inf> B</inf> In this equation, for &kgr; we used value 0.95 contained in the reference source<sup> 14)</sup> , and for bending ratio x in Eq. (2), also using the reference source<sup> 15)</sup> , we assigned 3.0 to bending ratio x in Eq. (2). Results of computations are shown in Table 2. R<inf> m</inf> of the membrane No. 8, characterized by a large :gd (350&mgr;m) and small &egr;, is 96.6s/m, while R<inf> m</inf> of the membrane No. 9, characterized by small &dgr;, viz., 120&mgr;m, and large &egr;, viz., 0.8, is 18.4s/m. The former is approximately 5 times the latter. However, the ratio of R<inf> m</inf> to the total amount of resistance ([R<inf> m</inf> /Rt]x100) in the case of membrane No. 8 is 4.896%. In the cases of membranes Nos. 6, 7, and 9 (&dgr;=120-122&mgr;m), ranging from approximately 1.7 to 3.4% t also is fairly small. In other words, with the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system, membrane resistance R<inf> m</inf> for the most part can be disregarded. Table 2. Membrane Resistance (Computed Values) 2) Hole Ratio &egr; In our previous report<sup> 12)</sup> , in order to study the relationship between K and &egr;, we used 9 types of PE membranes in the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system and reported on its result. However, in the case of PE membranes, because of moisture produced in the membranes by MEA, we no longer were certain whether we still had the specimen membrane on which accurate evaluation could be based. In order to resolve this problem, we reviewed the experiment using highly hydrophobic PTFE membranes (Nos.6-8) and a reformed-surface membrane (No.9). Moreover, using the membranes (Nos.2-5,8) with a wide variety of &egr;, we experimented with the CO<inf> 2</inf> -NaOH system, a system of reaction absorption which is similar to the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system but on which moisture has little effect. This was intended to provide supplementary data in resolving the problem created by the characteristics of CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system. Fig. 1 shows the relationship between K and &egr;. With the CO<inf> 2</inf> -NaOH (1 mol/l) system, data on the relationship between K and &egr; are relatively well defined, as the larger the &egr;, the larger K will become. With the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA(5mol/l) system, on the other hand, few data are available to elucidate relationship between K and &egr;; consequently somewhat less well defined in comparison with those in CO<inf> 2</inf> -NaOH system. However, its tendency for the most part is similar to that of CO<inf> 2</inf> -NaOh system, another reaction absorbing system, in that the larger &egr; is, the larger K will become. With the CO<inf> 2</inf> -H<inf> 2</inf> O system, on the other hand, the situation is completely different. K exhibits no relationship to &egr;, and is related only to R<inf> eL</inf> (currently obtaining detailed data). It appears that this largely is due to the thickness of the liquid boundary membranes of both CO<inf> 2</inf> -H<inf> 2</inf> O system (physical absorption) and the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system (reaction absorption). We hope to present reason for this in detail at the next opportunity. Fig. 1. Relationship between Comprehensive Material Fig. 2. Relationship Between Comprehensive Material 2) Comprehensive Material Transfer Coefficient and Liquid Flow Condition In connection with the relationship between CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system's comprehensive material transfer coefficient K and liquid flow conditions, we conducted several experiments using PP and PE membranes. Because of the effects of moisture produced by MEA on the membranes, we have not been able to identify a clear tendency. In the experiment presented in this paper, we used the PTFE membrane (No.8), in which any effect of moisture can be disregarded, to examine relationship between K and R<inf> eL</inf> . As indicated by the test result shown in Fig. 2, K is only slightly proportionate to R<inf> eL</inf> <sup> 0.07</sup> , showing almost minimal effects of Re<inf> L</inf> . As reference, we showed in Fig. 2 data<sup> 3)</sup> generated when CO<inf> 2</inf> -H<inf> 2</inf> O system was used. In this case, K is proportionate to Re<inf> L</inf> <sup> 0.33</sup> , exhibiting definite effects created by Re<inf> L</inf> . The reason why the dependence of CO<inf> 2</inf> 's K on Re<inf> L</inf> differs between CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system and CO<inf> 2</inf> -H<inf> 2</inf> system may be stated as follows: since the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system absorbs reactions, its liquid boundary membrane is thin and therefore it is difficult for ReL to impact it, whereas the CO<inf> 2</inf> system is a physical absorption system, its liquid absorption membrane is thick and therefore it can be easily impacted by Re<inf> L</inf> . (3) Durability of Membrane Fig. 3. Properties of Comprehensive Material Transfer Fig. 3 shows changes K had undergone during many hours of experimentation in which No. 3 membrane (material: PE) and No. 8 membrane (material: PETE) were used under the following conditions: temperature T=50°C and MEA concentration C<inf> B</inf> =5 mol/l. Although No.3 membrane's K falls rapidly with passing of time t, with No.8 (PETE), hardly any change was noted in K for a long period of time, viz., t=approximately 6000 hours. In Fig. 4, angle of contact cos &thgr; by Kaelble, et al.<sup> 16)</sup> and a surface tension &dgr; are plotted. MEA(50°C)'s &dgr; is 0.059N/m (a value actually measured), and the PEFE's angle of contact cosign at this value is cos&thgr;=-0.2 and the PE membrane is cos&thgr;=0.1. Consequently, PEFE membrane has a large negative value. That is why moisture does not affect PEFE membrane. Fig. 4. Relationship between Angle of contact and Surface 3. Feasibility Study An example of a feasibility study of a CO<inf> 2</inf> removal system using a membrane method is described below: 3.1. Summary of Study (1) A 1000MW system designed to remove 50% of CO<inf> 2</inf> from coal fire boiler's exhaust gas is being examined. The conditions are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Conditions of Feasibility Study (2) Relationship between a CO<inf> 2</inf> recovery rate and a membrane area will be examined below. The diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 5. This system is based on a chemical absorption method using a hollow fiber membrane in the part which absorbs CO<inf> 2</inf> . In an absorption fluid recycling part, a heat radiation-type recycling tower, the kind used in the conventional chemical absorption method, is being used. Fig. 5. CO 3.2 Results of Study (1) The result of the study when a CO<inf> 2</inf> recovery rate was set at 50% is shown in Table 4. In this system, the absorption part was established on the assumption that a gas flue would be expanded somewhat. Moreover, a draft loss on the gas side of the CO<inf> 2</inf> absorption part was approximately 100mmH<inf> 2</inf> O. When the expansion of the duct work is taken into consideration, a loss probably will be in the range of 1/3-1/5 of that produced by the conventional chemical absorption method. Moreover, since absorption fluid will free-fall on the basis of the membrane's inner static differential, a pressure loss on the absorption side of the membrane part is approximately 0.6kg/cm<sup> 2</sup> .

Moreover, In this study, since MEA and CO<inf> 2</inf> [produce equimolecular reactions], we set a MEA/CO<inf> 2</inf> molecular ratio as a constant. 3.3. Considerations The conventional methods of filling columns and wetted wall columns require a well-designed installation space and duct placement because the absorption part becomes a column type. With our method, however, it is possible to install the absorption part by somewhat expanding a horizontal gas duct. Moreover, since our method is expected to reduce a loss in gas-side draft from one-third to one-fifth of the draft loss produced by the filling column and wetted wall methods, with the power of the exhaust gas fan, it can be controlled at around 2000-5000kWh/h. Moreover, as considered in the previous section, with an increase of CO<inf> 2</inf> recovery ratio, a membrane area will increase at a rapid rate. Consequently, a scale of equipment, also, will be enlarged. For instance, if we are to take a viewpoint that an amount of CO<inf> 2</inf> emitted from a certain power plant a year is to be reduced, rather than aiming for high recovery ratio using one boiler, as shown in Fig. 7, we can consider a method of using two boilers with low-recovery rate. Consequently, in selecting CO<inf> 2</inf> recovery ratio, it will be essential that we consider and examine fully the amount by which CO<inf> 2</inf> emissions can be reduced in addition to the method of plant operations and economic factors. Fig. 7. Relationship between CO 4. Conclusion Concerning the removal of CO<inf> 2</inf> from thermal power plant's exhaust gases through the method of gas absorption using hollow fiber membranes, we had conducted a series of experiments and a feasibility study and were able to obtain the following results: (1) With the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system, the smaller the value of a membrane thickness &dgr; is, the larger the comprehensive material transfer coefficient K will become; still its effect is quite small, no more than 5%. To the liquid Reynolds number Re<inf> L</inf> , K is proportionate to Re<inf> L<sup> 0.07</sup> </inf> and its effect is very slight. The hole ratio &egr;, however, greatly affects K, as the larger the value of &egr;. the larger K will become. (2) With the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system, although wetness of the membrane caused by MEA greatly reduces its durability, if a hydrophobic material (for instance PTFE) is used, we can eliminate this problem. This fact was verified by the continuous processing test lasting for approximately 6000 hours. (3) It was verified that, in order to enlarge and stabilize the porous membrne's K when the CO<inf> 2</inf> -MEA system is involved, we must use highly hydrophobic membrane materials so that &egr; can be enlarged as much as possible. (4) We applied this method to a system designed to separate and recover 50% of CO<inf> 2</inf> from gas emissions from a 1000MW coal fire boiler and compared its results with those produced by the conventional chemical absorption method. We found that with the new method we were able to reduce exhaust gas fan power to around 5000kWh/h. We wish to thank membrane makers and their associates who provided us with specimen membranes and valuable information concerning those membranes and membranes in general. We also are greatly indebted to those at university research laboratories who so generously contributed their advice and valuable information.
