They were trying to go to the United States. On the morning of 28 January, a group of five who reached land in the vicinity of Nuevitas explained that they had wrecked off the north coast. The rapid mobilization of vessels of the Border Guard Troops and other institutions permitted us to rescue another five people, two of whom had to be hospitalized quickly. An infant just a few months old was also hospitalized, and his life is in danger. The individuals who risked their lives and those of innocent children were attracted by the criminal propaganda from the United States that encourages them; now, in addition to whatever legal responsibilities may befall them, they will have on their consciences the tragic results of their actions. This is the result of the work of those in the United States who are doing everything possible to encourage an illegal exodus and who welcome as heroes those who, risking their lives, take to the sea -- while the U.S. authorities apply an ever more restrictive policy in granting visas to people who take steps to travel legally. It has also just been reaffirmed in Havana that the United States has repeatedly failed to comply, by a big margin, with the agreement signed with Cuba in 1984 under which they were supposed to authorize the legal immigration of up to 20,000 people each year. Therefore, Washington must shoulder its share of responsibility for incidents such as this.
