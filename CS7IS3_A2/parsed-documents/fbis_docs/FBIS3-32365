The firm carried out its survey at 100 voting centers throughout the country, and the results show that Figueres -- the candidate of the opposition National Liberation Party (PLN) -- obtained 51.6 percent of the votes. The same poll shows Miguel Angel Rodriguez, the candidate of the ruling Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC), with 46.2 percent of the votes. The difference of 5.4 percent (some 80,000 votes) places the results outside the 3-percent margin of error that Borge and Associates, along with similar companies such as CID-Gallup and Unimer, uses as a guideline. The results show a clear victory for Figueres in the provinces of San Jose, Heredia, Cartago, and Puntarenas. They show a virtual tie in Alajuela, and a loss for Figueres in Limon and Guanacaste. The specialists say the trend continued through noon and it is not possible for it to change. Victor Borge, the president of the polling firm, reiterated that the poll has a margin of error of 3 percent and added that the remaining five political contenders received a total of only 2.3 percent of the votes. Elections were held today in Costa Rica to chose a president, two vice presidents, 57 deputies to the Legislative Assembly, and 1,000 councilmen. The electoral process concluded at 1800 hours (0000 GMT 7 February), and the official results may be known at 2000 GMT.
