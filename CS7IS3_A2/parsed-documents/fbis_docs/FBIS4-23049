However, the published data on ionite fibers is not systematized and often has a qualified character. This is especially true in the case of treating drinking water, where several heavy metal ions may be present simultaneously. In the present work the quantitative characteristics of the adsorption of copper ions from aqueous solutions on VION KN-1 (sodium form) chemosorption fiber, and the sorption capacity of the fiber under both static and dynamic conditions were determined in the case of aqueous solutions containing also mixtures of copper, lead and manganese.
