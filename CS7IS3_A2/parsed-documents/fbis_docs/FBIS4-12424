He failed to bring Washington's and Beijing's viewpoints on human rights any closer. Contrary to his expectations, the U.S. Secretary of State encountered firm and intransigent stances by the PRC authorities in the course of his 10 hours of intensive talks with them as they rejected his recommendations outright. What is certain is that Christopher visited the PRC in order to deliver a final warning to the PRC leaders and to convince them to accept Washington's conditions on human rights issues. He said: The issue of human rights and the Most Favored Nation [MFN] status were the salient features of the talks between the two sides. Christopher went to Beijing in order to exert pressure on the basis of its chronic ploy, the MFN treaty which the United States uses in its tactics to put pressure on the PRC. Ever since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, the United States has raised the extension of the MFN trade law and linked it to progress in the field of human rights. In fact, it is really seeking a way to extend it. The PRC has realized by now that the United States stands to gain equally if not more from the extension of MFN status. According to Li Peng, the PRC prime minister, if the United States were to revoke this clause, it would lose as much if not more than the PRC, and U.S. companies would not be able to enter or remain in the PRC's extensive and capacious market. Accordingly, the PRC authorities, in an unprecedented action, very clearly and firmly stressed to Christopher that they will not be pressured by the United States, particularly by Washington's viewpoint on human rights and the MFN. It is a fact that the United States is not really concerned about the human rights situation in the PRC and merely intends to use this ostensibly humanitarian issue to reap political and commercial capital from Beijing. The U.S. mass media, which acts as the right arm of the White House hierarchy in whipping up a propagandistic atmosphere, had embarked on their campaign a few days before Christopher commenced his trip and gave extensive coverage to the talks between Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck and some opponents of the PRC regime on the issue of human rights, including Wei Jingsheng and various similar interviews. This was aimed at provoking the sensibilities of the PRC authorities so that they would reveal an absence of democracy in the PRC. Following the meetings between the U.S. officials and the opponents of the PRC government precisely one week before Christopher's visit, the PRC security officials summoned Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan and some other dissidents who had been released in the past six months; they were released again after 24 hours. The news coverage by the U.S. satellite networks and the swift reaction of the White House authorities, including Clinton, against this move by the PRC Government proved that the U.S. had acted solely to put the Beijing hierarchy on the defensive, especially with regard to human rights issues prior to Christopher's visit. Simultaneously, the United States tried to motivate the UN Human Rights Commission [UNHRC] in Geneva to make a fuss over the human rights situation in the PRC on the eve of Christopher's visit to Beijing, thus trying to internationalize the PRC's human rights situation and to put the PRC at a disadvantage before it came to the negotiating table with the U.S. Secretary of State. Washington's plan to use the UNHRC to exert pressure on the PRC also met defeat. On the other hand, hardline PRC Prime Minister Li Peng's articulate remarks in parliament only a day before Christopher's visit with regard to the human rights situation in the PRC and the meaningful statement by the PRC foreign minister rejoicing at the West's defeat due to the [UN's] failure to approve the plan to debate the human rights situation in the PRC portended the fruitlessness of Christopher's visit beforehand. However, at his very first round of talks with Christopher, the PRC foreign minister, disregarding political considerations, openly expressed his rancor and criticism of the meeting between the assistant secretary of state for human rights, John Shattuck, with Chinese dissidents. On the same day, two American journalists were arrested in Beijing for a few hours on charges of illegal activity. The PRC security officials also tightened security around the U.S. Embassy and the residence of Warren Christopher before his arrival and kept the comings and goings at these places under strict surveillance. The PRC's actions prior to the visit and during it confused the U.S., according to a U.S. spokesman. However, it is certain the Chinese authorities intended by these actions to show the United States categorically that they would not succumb to any kind of pressure from it. Even though Christopher explained that his visit was aimed at insuring that the PRC comprehended the importance of human rights from the U.S. viewpoint and in the context of the MFN, the Chinese side stated that it had noted the U.S. stance in this regard. However, it is obvious that U.S. policies--especially with regard to exerting pressure on the pretext of human rights in the PRC--ran aground and Warren Christopher returned to the United States with nothing to rejoice about. During the course of his visit, Christopher handed to the PRC officials a list of Chinese political prisoners but he did not receive an positive response in this regard. The PRC officials stressed that their country has an independent legal system and it acts according to its own laws. Of course, it may be mentioned that the PRC does have some problems related to its adherence to human rights with regard some cases involving ethnic minorities. Regardless of the human rights issue, to which the major part of Christopher's talks with the PRC officials was devoted, this visit provided the two countries with an opportunity to discuss topics of mutual interest such as trade and military cooperation in arms control, especially of missiles, the DPRK's nuclear program and other important regional and international issues. In the course of this visit, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on importing and exporting products made by prisoners, which ensures the implementation of the agreements reached in 1992. The PRC and the United States agreed to resume their military contacts after a hiatus of five years and agreed that a joint committee on the arms industry and for transforming military industries into civilian industries will be set up and its first session will be held in Beijing this year. In any case, Christopher's visit to the PRC and the defeat of his talks with the Chinese officials, especially with regard to human rights--the main U.S. lever in pressuring the PRC for the past few years--proved that even after more than a year since his entry into the White House, Clinton has not been able to formulate acceptable diplomacy toward Beijing and that Washington-Beijing relations will encounter unforeseen highs and lows in the future.
