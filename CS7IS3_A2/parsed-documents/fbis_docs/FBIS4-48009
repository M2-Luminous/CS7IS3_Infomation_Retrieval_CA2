At a Johannesburg news conference on Monday [9 May], the committee said it was particularly concerned about constitutionally entrenched market-related compensation for farmers whose land might be expropriated. If it was calculated at "market value" then farmers would be enriched for the second time -- first they were enriched through apartheid when they bought their land cheaply -- when the state bought back the land, spokesperson Lydia Mariha said. [sentence as received] The committee said the market-related formula would leave no resources to continue with an effective redistribution programme. The national land committee said it was a pity the African National Congress had not attained the required two-thirds majority to change the constitution. It felt hopeful, however, that the ANC would review the property rights and restitution clauses, as promised by President-elect Nelson Mandela in his meeting with community representative in March this year. Turning to redistribution, the NLC said it welcomed the ANC's commitment to redistribute "30 per cent of the land in the first five years" as set out in its Reconstruction and Development Programme. As the ANC had said state land alone would be used for the purpose of redistribution and restitution, the government's ability to fulfil its commitment would be severely limited. The World Bank's figures of available arable state land, about 250,000 hectares, would not be nearly enough for these objective, it stressed. By the South African Agricultural Union's own admission only 20 per cent of farmers produced 80 per cent of the country's present agricultural produce. The land owned by the remaining 80 per cent should therefore be used for redistribution and for aspirant black farmers, the committee said. Although it welcomed the land claims court proposal unveiled by the ANC, the committee said the court would work only if it ran alongside "broader processes of land redistribution, agricultural reform and restructuring of the administrative structures in local government". The cases the land claims court had been set up to deal with represented only "the tip of the iceberg" and a comprehensive land reform process would be needed to resolve the problems of groups who would not benefit from the court, including communities with no land and those that did have claims to a specific piece of land. The Land Committee also expressed fears that landless people's expectations would be pushed aside in favour of white farmers' expectations and that unaccountable officials might be appointed in the government's land ministries and departments. Communities were expecting the new government to protect them from evictions and to guarantee security of tenure. In particular they demanded the moratorium on evictions, which was drawn up by the Transitional Executive Council, be extended through the transition period. The NLC warned that if a new government shied away from tackling the issue of land reform, and was seen as siding with the white farming community, then rural communities would "feel forced to reoccupy their land". Transvaal Rural Action Committee spokesman Star Motswege added communities were organising themselves already and if their demands were not met within a certain period, a number of them would forcibly reoccupy land. The National Land Committee's Brendan Pearce said 11 communities in the Northern Cape had taken a resolution before the elections to go back to their land by force if necessary. One such community had already done so and 150 people were arrested for trespassing. Mr Pearce said if there was no substantial progress then more communities would resort to the same action. Mr Dave Husy, of the farmworkers resource and research programme, said if the constitution could not be amended because of the ANC's failure to achieve a two-thirds majority, a crisis situation might erupt in rural areas and parliament would be forced to change the property and restitution clauses for the sake of peace in these areas.
