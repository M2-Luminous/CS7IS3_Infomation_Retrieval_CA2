[passage omitted] Relying on the special characteristics of the district, a number of bad groups have in the past spread propaganda slandering the policies and plans of our party and have seduced and deceived some ignorant members of ethnic minorities into being their lackeys, whom they used to create disorder in the localities and cause difficulties for the people in making a living. Since 1993, in order to bring the peace and stability of a base area to the entire district, the party committee and administrative committee of the district as well as its military headquarters and public security service have worked together closely both in planning and actual operations. [passage omitted] Then they mobilized the able-bodied LPRYU members to volunteer to serve the nation. They mobilized the multi-ethnic people and various mass organizations such as the LPRYU, the women's organization, trade unions, and the united fronts in each village to put their material possessions at the disposal of the cadres and combatants who were maintaining the peace in the localities at various points. The guerrilla forces, self-defense forces, police and district soldiers, in addition to coordinating closely in inspecting and defending the peace in their localities, also improved their political and military skills. [passage omitted] In particular they set up a security service for each village to be on duty 24 hours a day which inspected the papers of people entering and leaving and inspected for gamblers and other dangers to society. When something bad happened, they quickly coordinated their activities and reported in a timely fashion. Because the party committee, administrative committee, and the district military headquaters always recognized the importance of public security activities and because the multi-ethnic people throughout the district were very patriotic and had a tradition of brave struggle and unwillingness to submit to the enemy, the unrest in the district has now been overcome, and we can now say that the entire district has the peace and stability of a base area.
