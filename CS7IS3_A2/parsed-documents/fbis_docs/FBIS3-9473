Speaking in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serb leader urged the lawmakers "to reject out of hand all participation in the new Croat-Moslem federation." But he said he "did not rule out the possibility of establishing various types of ties with the newly created state, but not federal ties." An agreement to create the federation was signed last Friday in Washington by Bosnian Croat and Moslem leaders. It is designed to put pressure on the Serbs, who control most of Bosnia after nearly two years of war, to end the fighting. Karadzic said the Bosnian Serbs wanted "a sovereign and independent state" and would consider at some point in the future their relations with the former Yugoslav republics. He said he was willing to recognize the new federation "so long as the Serbs obtain access to the sea." This was seen as signaling willingness to give up conquered land. The United States and Russia have been trying to get the Bosnian Serbs to join up with the new federation as a way of maintaining Bosnia as something resembling a unified state. The federation is currently designed to cover half of Bosnia's land, but the Serbs control around 70 percent of the republic's territory.
