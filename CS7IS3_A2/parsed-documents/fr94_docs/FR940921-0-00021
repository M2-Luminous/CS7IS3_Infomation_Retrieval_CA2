FR940921-0-00021 FR940921-0-00010 B. Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories Total CO emissions were projected from 1990 base year out to 2005. These projected inventories were prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. North Carolina will not continue the Oxygenated Fuel program in Winston-Salem. The projections show that calculated CO emissions, assuming no oxygenated fuels program after 1993, are not expected to exceed the level of the base year inventory during this time period. Therefore, it is anticipated that Winston-Salem will maintain the CO standard without the program, and the program would no longer be implemented following redesignation. In case of an air quality problem, the program may be implemented as a contingency measure. C. Verification of Continued Attainment Continued attainment of the CO NAAQS in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area depends, in part, on the State's efforts toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The State has also committed to submit periodic inventories of CO emissions every three years. D. Contingency Plan The level of CO emissions in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the CO NAAQS in the future. Despite the State's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient air pollutant concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Also, section 175(A)(d) of the CAA requires that the contingency provisions include a requirement that the State implement all measures contained in the SIP prior to redesignation. Therefore, North Carolina has provided contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future CO air quality problem. The plan contains triggering mechanisms to determine when contingency measures are needed. The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County contingency plan's primary trigger will be a violation of the CO NAAQS. A secondary trigger will be activated within 30 days of the State finding either: (1) The periodic emissions inventory exceeds the base inventory by 10 percent or more, or (2) a monitored air quality exceedance pattern indicates that an actual CO NAAQS violation may be imminent. A pattern will be deemed to indicate an imminent violation if: (a) One exceedance of the standard per year has been monitored at a single monitor for two successive years and those exceedances are at least greater than 20 percent above the standard (i.e., 10.8 ppm or above) or (b) the monitored air quality exceedance pattern otherwise suggest that a CO NAAQS violation is likely. Within 45 days of the trigger, the State will activate the pre-adopted regulations discussed below to become effective at the beginning of the next CO season. When other measures are needed to ensure that a future violation of the CO NAAQS does not occur, the State will complete the adoption process within one year of the secondary trigger. As the State has demonstrated that the area will continue to maintain the standard without the Oxygenated Fuels program, the State will make that program a contingency measure that will be implemented in the event of a trigger being activated. In case of a primary or secondary trigger, NCDEM will implement an oxygenated gasoline fuel program or expand an already-existing program's coverage. In addition, NCDEM may do one or a combination of the following: expand the I/M program coverage; upgrade to an enhanced I/M program; institute transportation control measures; or implement an employee commute options program. EPA finds that the contingency measures provided in the State submittal meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the CAA. E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions In accordance with section 175A(b) of the CAA, the State has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional ten years.
