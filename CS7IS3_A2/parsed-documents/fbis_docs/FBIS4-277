Eighty-eight people have died in the area since the state of emergency was declared last month. Seven hundred members of the Citizen Force Unit have arrived in Ladysmith and 150 more are expected tomorrow. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Veronica van der Westhuizen] Citizen Force members arrived at the Ladysmith base early this morning. They were called up and mobilized within two weeks. The men will be joining other troops in northern Natal and Zululand. Welcoming the troops later in the day Brigadier Deon Ferreira of Natal Command emphasized that their main task was to help restore peace and stability. Brigadier Ferreira said there was a perception that the army was against the Zulu nation. This he said was not the case. He added that a lack of tolerance had resulted in the callous murders of people. The army was deployed to help stop this ongoing tide of violence in the area. Ninety percent of the Citizen Force come from Natal. [A-Company Commander Maj. John Rutherford] We are all family people. We are here basically so that there is stability -- to ensure stability in the country so that there can be free and fair elections at the end of the day and then go home and then be happy again, really. [Van der Westhuizen] The force members wasted no time in making sure their vehicles were in tip-top condition. The troops will leave for Eshowe tomorrow from where they will be deployed in volatile areas. With the arrival of the 850 members today and tomorrow there will be over 2,000 additional troops in kwaZulu- Natal. [end recording]
