Konstantin Sarkisov, director of the Center for Japanese Studies at the Institute of Oriental Studies, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that democratization in Russia has made it possible for opponents of the former communist regime to air their views. He said this has made a solution to the territorial dispute more difficult than it might have been when Russia was part of the Soviet Union. The disputed islands, known in Japan as the northern territories, are Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets. The islands, which lie off the northernmost main Japanese island of Hokkaido, were seized from Japan by the former Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Sarkisov, 51, an Armenian educated at Leningrad State University, said the new Russian Constitution ensures that President Boris Yeltsin has the final say over foreign policy decisions in Russia. But he said the December election in Russia in which conservatives, including ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, scored a big success, had made it more difficult for Yeltsin to take a strong stand on a controversial issue like the disputed islands. Sarkisov said this could result in the present administration leaving any decision on the islands "to the next generation of politicians." Sarkisov predicted there will be no dramatic change in Russo- Japanese relations under the current Yeltsin administration. "It is just a matter of keeping up our contacts on a daily basis," he said. The territorial dispute remains a stumbling block to normalization of relations between the two countries. Tokyo maintains it will not conclude a peace treaty with Moscow unless the territorial dispute is resolved. Sarkisov said Russia has a "duty" to return at least Shikotan and the Habomais under the terms of a 1956 Japan-Soviet joint declaration to return the two islands on condition that the actual transfer would take place after the signing of a bilateral peace treaty. Sarkisov said a settlement to the dispute would include the return of at least these two islands as well as a number of possible other options which he described as lying between "zero and the return of the remaining two islands." He said the options could include United Nations administration of the islands, or even their joint economic development. "It's a problem of Russian pride," Sarkisov said. "First you must explain the facts to the Russian people."
