"As the bonding between Guangzhou and Hong Kong intensifies, Shanghai is becoming increasingly vital to Beijing," the EIU says in its report "Shaping a business in Shanghai". As Beijing's latest darling, Shanghai has the leverage to set a 10 to 12 per cent growth target, significantly higher than the nine per cent national ceiling. Also, it has the autonomy to approve foreign investment of up to US$30 million, whereas other cities are limited to US$10 million. Bigger projects need Beijing's green light. In return for these privileges, Beijing keeps a firm grip on Shanghai, more unbending on rules than in Guangzhou, but because of its trading heritage, it is less officious than the capital. Although Shanghai's bureaucracy can be tedious, it is more consistent and less corrupt than that of southern China. Still, the report notes that "bribery has now begun to invade the traditional guanxi (personal connections) domain, and corruption is definitely on the increase ... most Shanghai corruption is masked as fees or taxes". Foreign companies should be aware of these practices and adopt a clear anti-corruption policy before putting money in the city, the report says. Support from Beijing notwithstanding, Shanghai, like most Chinese cities, is plagued by infrastructure bottlenecks, which are aggravated by the rising inflow of foreign funds. Unlike Western cities, which set aside about 20 per cent of urban land for road systems, Shanghai allocates only five per cent, and its road system caters to only half of the city's needs. Despite official statements to the contrary, Shanghai is also desperately short of power, although it is making great efforts to prevent severe shortages. Sources in the business community estimate supply meets only 85 per cent of demand, although it is managed astutely to accommodate economic zones, priority foreign enterprises, and foreign residential and office complexes. "The prognosis for the future is not bright," the report says. Demand for power in Shanghai-Pudong is estimated to be rising by about 15 per cent a year, and the figure could well apply to the Yangtze Delta. The shortage of land and labour is another concern. Wage inflation, staff turnover, and dearth of office space are particularly worrying. Availability of top-notch office space declined from 15.2 per cent in December 1992 to 1.1 per cent of total stock by March this year. Despite the bottlenecks foreign investors are flocking to the city because of its vast potential consumer market, where discretionary income among urban workers is estimated to be 43 per cent, among the highest in the world. Foreign ventures in Shanghai producing goods for the domestic market have a range of distribution options, including the state distribution system and government wholesalers. "All promise unbeatable distribution networks. All require careful inspection," says the report.
