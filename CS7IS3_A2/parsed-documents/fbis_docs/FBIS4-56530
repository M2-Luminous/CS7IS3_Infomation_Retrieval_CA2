Viva Omar Torrijos! [applause] Oh, how many happy memories bring back to me this Cinco de Mayo Plaza. I can recall the rally for what represented the culmination of our generational struggle -- the Canal Treaties, as notorious people have labeled the treaties that we know as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. [applause] I want to tell the spirit of Torrijos, who is here with us, this: Those of us who picked up your flag are here; those who gave your Panamanian flag the kiss of dignity and those who will not rest until we have the free, independent, and sovereign country you dreamed of are here. [Crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"] Friends: In 1990, we initiated a substantial reorganization of our political movement -- the political movement of Omar Torrijos. We have come a long way. We have brought our original concepts back to our party. We have regained the love and the affection of the Panamanian people. Now we solemnly swear never to betray the goals marked by Omar Torrijos Herrera. The campaign has been one of proposals and decency. We have not and will not hurt any opponent. We will never hurt anyone. We have already forgiven those who have offended and insulted us. Let them not be worried: People who are united do not have time for foolish retributions. [applause] We are going to be the best government the Republic has ever had, because we have a historic commitment and vision. We also have a commitment to the children and the young people of this country. We, for their sake, will create the best government in the history of the Republic. [Unidentified supporter shouts: "Viva Toro Balladares! Viva Panama! Viva Omar Torrijos!" Crowd responds: "Viva!"] This will be a government with no hatred and no discord; a government that will not return to past models; a government in which all Panamanians will feel they have equal opportunities; a government under which there will be no first class, second class, or third class citizens; a government under which the children of all Panamanians -- whether black, white, or Indian -- will have equal opportunities. [Unidentified supporter shouts: "Viva the Panamanian women, the youth, the children!" Crowd chants: "Toro, Toro"] We are going to have a government that will respect the rights of all groups; a government that will properly appreciate teachers, because they deserve not to be mistreated or despised; a government that will not use the tools of the transportation workers to harass them; and a government that will be committed to opening the doors of the 21st century the way we Panamanians want them open -- through the efforts of the people and the government working together. Recently, there was an incident in which a Public Force officer dressed as a civilian pulled out a weapon. We do not know what his intentions were. Today, while standing here, I want to tell Juan Bautista Zapata this: Regardless of your intentions, my family and I have already forgiven you. There is no problem. [applause; crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"] Not only will we forgive him morally and spiritually, but I will also ask my party to withdraw whatever charges or lawsuit it filed against citizen Zapata. [Unidentified supporter shouts: "Long live Toro Balladares! Long live the PRD!"] This is the type of government we will truly have: not a government of false pledges, hatred, or a return to the past, and not a government of old commitments. Instead, we will have a government that is looking to the future and committed to our children. We will advance toward this goal --- all of us, united -- because people who are united... [pauses] [crowd shouts: "Will never be defeated!"] We will all go, together, and recover for these people their health, reopening health centers that have been closed; again stocking those health centers with medicine; providing dignified education for our sons and daughters; and building true homes instead of the dismal rooms -- rooms that insulted the dignity of the people of Colon. Friends: In sum we will work together as a country to recover our Panamanian pride and dignity, which has been trampled on by this puppet government! [applause] I also want to tell you that this is hardly a sample of the total number of votes the United People have decided to cast on Sunday. There is no doubt in any of the polls that we lead the next closest candidate not simply by 4, 5, or 6 percent, but by thousands of votes more than anyone else we will get! [Crowd shouts: "Long live United People!"] Shortly after Sunday, shortly after Sunday [repeats himself] we will truly begin the real work -- in other words, working on specific proposals with our elected community representatives, with our elected mayors, and with our elected legislators, all of whom will comprise a team that on 1 September will not have to sit down and carry out a survey at the provincial level, because we will already have it. We only have to implement the measures, solutions, and proposals that we already know of! [Unidentified supporter shouts: "You can feel it! You can feel it!" Crowd responds: "President Toro!"] It is a young team and a team into which we want to invite, as my teacher Omar Torrijos did, all Panamanians, but most of all, those who have the greatest ability, without asking their surname or even taking into consideration their political affiliation, because this is what the homeland demands at the end of the 20th century. Friends: I am aware of the capacity of our party's followers, and I know you will not be forgotten or cast aside. On the contrary, you must be our government's backbone, and you will be because you are the memory of Omar Torrijos Herrera. [crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"] But in order to do all of this we must first get past Sunday, 8 May. I want you to accompany me and the vice presidents in spirit because at 0630 we will be in line to vote so no one gets the idea they can scuttle our decision. Our vote must be first; our vote must be early -- one more early morning wake-up call for the sake of Torrijos and for Panama to overwhelmingly win. [applause] I cannot fail to mention something very important: Our United People alliance comprises three parties. Regardless of your party affiliation, make sure your vote is an alliance vote from top to bottom. [applause] Friends: On Sunday a new era for the Republic of Panama begins, and the end of the era of this century begins. Our commitment begins with those who will replace us on 1 September 1999, which we hope will be other Torrijos followers. They will find a united country, an independent, free, and sovereign country, with an outlook toward the future; a country which will work with its children for their children and grandchildren; and a country, my friends, where everyone without exception can feel proud and full of patriotism and may sing that stanza of the national anthem, which I invite you to sing along with me: We have at last reached victory in unity! A united people will never be defeated. Many thanks, friends. Push ahead so that victory is ours.
