Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu and provincial Governor He Zhiqiang both delivered important speeches at meetings held yesterday morning and afternoon. In his speech, Secretary Pu Chaozhu first and foremost analyzed the current excellent rural situation across the province, saying that the province is now confronted with another round of drastic industrial structural readjustment. He emphatically pointed out: Under no circumstances should we overlook the fundamental position and important role of agriculture. The basic ideology guiding rural work in the new historical period should be boiled down to emancipating the mind; grasping opportunities; deepening reforms; expanding opening up; promoting development; and maintaining stability. We should strive to work out new rural reform measures suited to the ongoing socialist market economic development; embark on a new road of rural economic development; and resolve such existing problems plaguing rural economic growth as insufficient investment in and huge debts regarding farmland capital construction, water conservancy, communications, electricity supply, and infrastructure construction. We should devote more energy to educational, scientific, and technological development and labor quality improvement in the province's rural, mountainous, and ethnic minority areas. The leading organs at and above county level should work out plans and goals aimed at bringing about a comfortably well-off livelihood and make a comfortably well-off livelihood a common goal for all. Speaking of the ongoing profound rural reform, Secretary Pu Chaozhu pointed out in no uncertain terms: We should strive to readjust the existing unitary economic structure and ownership structure; transform the existing rural production and operational patterns; develop socialized production; reform the existing rural operational structure; and actively publicize successful experiences in integrating and unifying three key links, namely, production, operation, and marketing. Speaking of the ongoing rural economic growth, Secretary Pu Chaozhu cautioned against overlooking grain production and called for continually readjusting rural industrial structure; fostering superior rural industries; increasing investments in rural infrastructure facilities construction; actively assisting township and town enterprises; vigorously pushing ahead with township and town enterprises development; maintaining the high development speed seen in the last few years; invigorating the rural economy with advanced science and technology; expanding opening up to the outside world; and promoting rural growth by incessantly opening up to the outside world. Secretary Pu Chaozhu emphatically noted: A pressing task at the moment is to mobilize the whole party to make a success of spring plowing production in order to reap another good agricultural harvest this year. To this end, we should earnestly strengthen the party leadership over rural work. The party committee members with special responsibilities for different types of work at all levels across the province should show concern for, find out about, and study rural work; contribute more to rural development; and guide the people of all nationalities across Yunnan to achieve a comfortably well-off livelihood. Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang delivered at yesterday afternoon's meeting an important speech in which he pointed out: Yunnan's rural reform tasks at the moment are as follows: 1.
