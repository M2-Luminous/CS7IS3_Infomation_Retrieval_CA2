This was the day of the deadline for the GATT Uruguay Round. On 7 December, Chairman Denis' revised proposal arrived, and Prime Minister Hosokawa accepted the proposal according to which "we will agree to a six-year deferral of total tariffication [on rice imports], and during this period we will allow minimum access (a minimum volume of imports, 4 percent [of the market] the first year, 8 percent the last year)." This is an old, shopworn method by which "one officially opposes, but in the end gives in to gaiatsu [external pressure] and reluctantly agrees." But the prime minister himself cannot shift responsibility since he has repeatedly said that he would abide by the "Diet resolutions." The Diet resolutions advocate a "totally domestic supply." Besides rice, there is the problem of countermeasures to improve business conditions, with which in particular an increase in the consumption tax is combined. The widespread argument is that a 5-10 trillion yen consumption tax [increase] would be an effective measure to improve economic conditions. As a source of revenue, a deficit-covering national bond is popular within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). But the Finance Ministry, as well as Shinseito and Komeito, argues that "it is irresponsible unless, at the same time, we decide the income tax reduction, we decide to raise the consumption tax rate at some specific time a few years from now." They fear that if we do not raise the consumption tax rate, there is the prospect of "eat and run" [a situation where one takes the benefit first and does not pay the price]. In the background, there is also an ulterior motive of "letting Hosokawa take care of all the difficult issues, such as rice and the consumption tax." The Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) took the combination of rice and the consumption tax most seriously. The SDPJ is, due in part to being the inheritor of the farmers' movement, sensitive to the rice issue. The three senior party officers, headed by Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, declared their opposition on 7 December, saying that "the acceptance of partial liberalization is contrary to the agreement of the eight parties which formed the coalition government." Moreover, as the budget is drawn up, if a consumption tax rate hike is included, the SDPJ's resistance will be even stronger. It was only a few years ago when the SDPJ experienced an overwhelming victory in a national election under Chairperson Takako Doi who opposed the consumption tax, saying that "when it will not do, it will not do." One of the Komeito executives said that "this is a crisis under which the SDPJ could split up, but at the same time, there is a chance it could leave the coalition government. To begin with, there are some people in the SDPJ who have an allergic reaction to Ozawa. The party, which essentially stands for demilitarization and neutrality, could never go along with revision of the Constitution and the overseas dispatch of Self-Defense Forces. A desire to change the party to avoid being controlled by Ozawa exists naturally in the left wing of the party, but also in the right wing." Would the SDPJ still cling to government power and choose to stay on, holding cabinet posts? Or would they dissolve the coalition? It is not necessary to explain how severe the blow would be to the Hosokawa Cabinet, if the SDPJ, the largest party in the government, were to pull out. Passage of Political Reform Bill Will Be Difficult The end of the extraordinary Diet session is 15 December. It is also the deadline day the Hosokawa Cabinet, which publicly promised the "passage of a political reform bill before the end of this year." As of 8 December, the bill, which passed the House of Representatives on 18 November in an ordinary manner, remains in the House of Councillors without even recitation (explanation of purpose) taking place. Probably they will not be able to start actual deliberation until the 15th. The biggest factor for such a delay is that in the House of Councillors, the LDP and SDPJ conspired behind the scenes and adopted joint efforts in an attempt at delay. Especially in the proportional districts of the SDPJ, there is strong opposition to the single seat election district system and to the House of Representatives' proposal on proportional representation, which is identical to that of the House of Councillors. Moreover, the speed of the drop in business conditions has far exceeded the Hosokawa Cabinet's forecast. It was reported that the unemployment rate in October jumped up to 2.7 percent, and is still showing an upward trend, according to a Labor Ministry study. The Hosokawa Cabinet was thinking that "first, we will complete political reform, then we will start on economic countermeasures." But it has become clear that there is no progress on political reform, and they have been slow to respond with countermeasures for the economic conditions. Voices have been heard within elements of the government regretting that "they made a mistake in priorities." WARNING: JAPANESE MEDIA PROJECT Moreover, two unanticipated incidents occurred which stopped discussions in the House of Representatives Budget Committee. One was the comment Defense Agency Director General Keisuke Nakanishi made concerning revision of the Constitution. Director General Nakanishi resigned mainly on the pretext that he could not delay deliberations. The other incident involved Prime Minister Hosokawa's relationship with Sagawa Express. A fuss was raised about the "composition of the repayment" of 100 million yen Hosokawa borrowed from Chairman Kiyoshi Sagawa. At first, Prime Minister Hosokawa answered that "I took the cash and repayed it. I used 40-50 million yen out of 70 million yen separation pay from my governorship." Mr. Hakuo Yanagisawa of the LDP took a point by saying that "the Prime Minister said he had repayed in full by the end of January 1991, but he served as governor until February, and did not receive his separation pay in January." The prime minister further submitted a document on 7 December stating that "he paid it back 10 million yen annually over 10 years." But the LDP objected that "it differs from the answer he gave before," and sought further detailed explanation. So deliberations were delayed until the 8th. There, many people who say in the LDP that "Hosokawa insists the money he was given as a gift was a loan, and he says he repayed it even though he has not. That is where the inconsistencies come from. This is similar to the case of Finance Minister Miyazawa. Mr. Miyazawa made a false reply that he did not receive Recruit stocks, though in fact he did. He was cross-examined and pressed into resignation." There are also voices that "we can get Hosokawa's head any time" [to get him to resign]. Secretary General Mori and the party executives have not yet made up their minds." But the LDP executives' plan seems to be as follows: "Because the supplemental budget is an important countermeasure for dealing with economic conditions, we must get it passed through the House of Councillors by 15 December, which is the end of the session. For that reason, we will not pursue Hosokawa further, even though we are not satisfied with the answer he has given. Besides, if the supplemental budget does not pass this session, it will result in giving an excuse for the coalition government to extend the session." This makes it appear as if the LDP, which secretly conspired with the SDPJ, has taken the leadership for Diet management. The LDP, which only 20 days earlier was in terrible shape, plagued with a number of rebellious members and facing the crisis of a possible split, is now filled with a triumphant mood because the chance for passing the political reform bill before the end of this year is completely gone. Ozawa and Takemura Debate Over "Cross-Year" [extending the Diet session so that it carries over from 1993 into 1994] It has been reported that in early December, Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, senior Shinseito representative, and Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, met for discussion and had a clash of opinions. Mr. Takemura insisted as follows: "There is a severe downturn in business conditions. We want to designate the political reform bill a matter of deliberation to be carried over and to close the curtain on the extraordinary Diet session. We want to pour our full efforts into countermeasures to boost economic conditions and into developing the budget for Heisei 6 (1994)." Mr. Ozawa was said to be furiously opposed to such an argument. "What are you talking about? The carry-over [of discussion] of the bill is the same as abandoning the bill. As we publicly promised, we must get it passed, whatever it takes. We can open the regular Diet session on 30 January. We can extend the [extraordinary session] until 29 January. We should be able to concurrently handle the bill on the political reform and the formation of the budget." This is Mr. Ozawa's argument for the crossing-over the year extension. Mr. Takemura's is the common sensical argument. Mr. Ozawa's is a strong-armed, unprecedented plan. The following House of Representatives Administrative Office comment shows that. "Since last year, the ordinary Diet was to be convened in January. But prior to that, it was convened in December and in the latter part of the month entered into a regular New Year's recess. It was reconvened in the latter part of January when the budget was printed. They almost never had any actual deliberation in January. The exception was that year before last (1991), on 18 January, the regular session was convened to deal with crisis countermeasures related to the Gulf war. Other than that, there has been no precedent for actual deliberation before 20 January." It seems that the Diet is always in recess during the New Year's period, and the politicians participate in various activities and meetings in their districts. I do not believe that the House of Councillors will respond to January deliberations. Then, why do Mr. Ozawa and others in Shinseito venture to advocate the crossing-over the year extension? Frankly speaking, that is because they are aiming at dissolution in the latter part of January. Shinseito Secretary Hajime Ishii explains as follows: "If we start on 10 January, we have as much as three weeks left. We should give up the year end and the New Year holidays and tackle the political problems. First, we should propose a large scale tax cut for the benefit of better business conditions. With the budget's current scale, prospects for the immediate future are dismal. We must bravely fight for the benefit of better economic conditions and adopt good measures for it, and then dissolve the Diet. By dissolving the Diet, the second realignment in the political world will occur, and the way to political reform will pave itself." They believe that the passage of the bill in the House of Councillors will be difficult even if the session is substantially extended. What worries them additionally is the recession's continuation. Criticism is expected to the effect that dissolution of the Diet at this time "will delay the passage of the regular budget by nearly two months. This is against the wishes of the Japanese people, which is that [the government work on] measures to tackle the recession. Then they are to "come up with countermeasures for the economy, namely, a large scale tax cut and a third supplemental budget." But even if they put up an "ad balloon," actual implementation will be delayed during that period [nearly two months needed for the dissolution, election, and formation of a cabinet]. There are also many questions, such as where the source of revenue to make up for the tax cut will be found. Among the government parties themselves, there are many critical voices against this long extension of the session. One of the Komeito leaders says the following: "One of the issues is that the budget will be made in January and passage will be [further] delayed. As a consequence, it will have to be a provisional budget. I question the wisdom during such a time of recession. Second is that in the midst of the Diet session, the preliminary plan made out by the Finance Ministry for the 1994 budget will be submitted, so each committee [in the Diet] will have to deliberate on this. In the past, the LDP Policy Research Council meddled with the Finance Ministry plan, but this time the Diet committees will make demands. The preliminary plan will be greatly altered. Despite the fact that the government has the right to make the budget, the Diet will interfere. The government cannot respond to this. It is impossible to simultaneously handle political reform deliberation and budget making." Mr. Ibuki's Argument for Early Dissolution of the Diet The argument for the cross-over the year extension also contains the strategy for a January dissolution in the event the political reform [bill] fails to pass. As if to respond to this, within the LDP there is also a voice for a January dissolution. That is the pet theory of Mr. Bunmei Ibuki, the deputy chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee. He has also been advocating early dissolution to Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato. But Mr. Ozato wonders about this, saying, "I do not understand his point very well." When I questioned Mr. Ibuki, the following answer came back: "There is a phenomenon of distortion in the political world today. Mr. Ozawa of the coalition government and Mr. Michio Watanabe of the LDP share conception and policies, but Mr. Ozawa, Prime Minister Hosokawa, and SDPJ Chairman Murayama do not. Because of this unnatural and unfortunate distortion phenomenon, they [in the coalition government] also can not agree on an economic counter-plan and can not take any effective measures. If nothing is done, the situation will develop into the Heisei Panic. It is not fair to the Japanese people. Therefore, I propose that the coalition government should take a temporary truce on political reform and seek cooperation from the LDP outside the cabinet. The LDP also proposes that it will cooperate on a counter-plan for the recession." I understand up to this point. "There are various arguments concerning political reform, and in both the coalition government parties and in the LDP there are distortions. It is also necessary to solve this situation to build a healthy two-party system. Today, numbers mean everything. The coalition parties have not formed the government because of their compatible policies. I want this to be straightened out. That is why I keep insisting that we should keep the medium size electoral district system and go for dissolution. If we go into election with the single constituency electoral district system, then the distortion will never be corrected." It appears that his argument for the dissolution has an ulterior motive for realigning the political world. What Mr. Ibuki left unsaid, Mr. Jiro Kawasaki, another deputy chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee, supplemented as follows. "Mr. Ibuki is racking his brains on how to realize Michee Watanabe's assumption of the prime ministership. I wonder if he would leave the party, with Watanabe in the lead, using dissolution as the opportunity. I wonder if he is considering a government by Watanabe, Ozawa, and Ichikawa." His surmise is that they cannot wait out President Kono's two- year term and that their strategy is to bring Mr. Watanabe in as candidate for coalition chief after Prime Minister Hosokawa has failed. There are many people who doubt this theory. One Komeito senior official points out the following: "In addition to his ill health, Michee Watanabe's image is just too different from that of Mr. Hosokawa. He could become a prime minister with popularity of nearly zero." A Shinseito senior official concurs: "It is no longer Watanabe's time. His face, constitution, and career are just too old. Beside, can he get out [of the LDP] taking 20-30 people? If 20-30 people leave, then it is significant that the LDP will become a permanent opposition party." Thus, with the cross-over the year extension debate and January dissolution argument at the center, the counter-plan for dealing with the recession, rice, and the consumption tax are all tangled together. And the political situation is creaking as it turns.
