The guerrillas accused the Colombian Government of "irresponsibly and deceitfully" blaming the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a member of the CNG, for the 35 deaths on 23 January. In a text entitled "Infamy or Cynicism?", the CNG said this is not the first time there has been killing in that area, "which has become the center of a dirty war and state-sponsored terrorism." The CNG adds: "It has been proven that violence is being promoted by the Army and paramilitary groups working for Fidel Castano, a drug trafficker who donates land for military bases and the founder of the deadly `Persecuted by Pablo Escobar.'" The guerrillas noted that the Colombian Government's expressed goal is "to isolate the guerrillas politically through lies and slander and by blaming them for actions linked to the dirty war." The CNG concluded: "We know the people of Uraba will overcome this night of terror caused by the government through the Army and its offspring, the paramilitary. The people will punish the culprits for the blood shed by their children."
