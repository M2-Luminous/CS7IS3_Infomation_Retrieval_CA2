FBIS4-15802 "drsov070_e_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Russian Report of Odessa Incident `Provocation' Russian Report of Odessa Incident `Provocation' LD1104174594 Kiev UNIAR in Ukrainian 1515 GMT 11 Apr 94 LD1104174594 Kiev UNIAR Ukrainian BFN [Text] Kiev, 11 April -- Reports by the Black Sea Fleet press center on the course of events in Odessa on 10 April accuse Ukraine of an armed attack on Garrison 318 of a fleet division belonging to the Black Sea Fleet conservation which, as the Black Sea Fleet press center stresses, was in the "best traditions of the SS Galicia division." The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry states that the reports of the Black Sea Fleet are a provocation and an outrageous lie. There was no "attack" in Odessa. In reality, a group of officers was detained: Oleg Feoktistov, Dmitriy Starikov, and Aleksandr Zelenko, but they were detained for unlawful actions during an incident concerning the piratical seizure from Odessa of valuable navigational equipment on 9 April by the Black Sea Fleet hydrographic vessel Cheleken. Apart from refusing to heed an order from a senior naval officer, the abovementioned officers called on their subordinates, who had arrived on board the Cheleken, to "aim their weapons at the Ukrainian seamen; to prepare to fire; and to fire at will." The statement from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense press center states that such actions by the officers led to the emergence of a real threat to the security in the port of Odessa. The actions of the command of Garrison 318 were directed at provoking an armed conflict between the servicemen of the Black Sea Fleet and officials of the port of Odessa, the border guards, and the personnel of the Ukrainian Navy. Officials of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and law enforcement bodies are investigating the circumstances of the incident, which could have caused the deaths of the personnel. All the actions are taking place in accordance with the current legislation of Ukraine. There were no cases of violence in relation to the division's personnel and none whatsoever in relation to members of their families. The statement says that there is no doubt that it was a planned provocation aimed not only at seizing valuable equipment but also designed to disregard Ukrainian laws. The press service of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense categorically rejects the untrue information that is being circulated by Russian mass media. Not only does it not conform to reality, but it also undermines trust and sows hostility between the friendly peoples of neighboring countries. Ukraine has proposed that Russia's Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs send their representatives to take part in investigating the incident.
