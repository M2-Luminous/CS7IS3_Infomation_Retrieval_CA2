FR941221-2-00009 FR941221-2-00007 [A&hyph;475&hyph;703] Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin From Italy; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on granular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resin from Italy for the period August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Ausimont S.p.A. We have preliminarily determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the FMV. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Copyak or Richard Herring, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 12, 1992, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (57 FR 36063) of the antidumping order on PTFE resin from Italy (53 FR 33163; August 30, 1988). On August 31, 1992, Ausimont S.p.A. and Ausimont U.S.A. requested an administrative review of the order for the period August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992. We initiated the review on September 28, 1992 (57 FR 44551). Verifications were conducted in Milan, Italy, September 13&hyph;16, 1993, and in Morristown, New Jersey, November 22&hyph;23, 1993. The Department is conducting this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of PTFE resin which is classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 3904.61.00. PTFE dispersions in water and fine powders are not covered by this order. The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The order on PTFE resin from Italy also covers PTFE wet raw polymer exported from Italy to the United States (see Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Italy; Final Determination of Circumvention of Antidumping Duty Order (58 FR 26100; April 30, 1993). However, because the Department issued its preliminary affirmative determination of circumvention and ordered the suspension of liquidation of wet raw polymer entries after the review period, entries of PTFE wet raw polymer are not subject to this particular review ( see Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, dated September 10, 1993; The Third Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Italy, which is on file in the Central Records Unit (room B099 of the Main Commerce Building)). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of Italian PTFE resin to the United States, Ausimont S.p.A., and the review period is August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992. United States Price (USP) The Department based USP on exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act, because all sales to unrelated parties were made after importation of the subject merchandise into the United States. We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, brokerage and handling charges, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight in accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act. We made further deductions, where appropriate, for rebates, credit expenses, warranties, technical services, and indirect selling expenses pursuant to section 772(e)(2) of the Act. We also adjusted USP for taxes ( i.e. , value-added taxes) in accordance with our practice as outlined in Silicon Manganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value (59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994). Foreign Market Value (FMV) The Department calculated FMV using home market prices, as defined in section 773(a) of the Act, since sufficient quantities of such or similar merchandise were sold in the home market to provide a basis of comparison. When possible, we compared sales of identical merchandise in the two markets. For each instance in which identical merchandise was not sold in Italy during the relevant contemporaneous period, we selected the contemporaneous home market sale or sales of the product that was the most similar to the merchandise involved in the U.S. sale. See 19 U.S.C. 1667(16). We then compared the U.S. sale to the selected sale or sales and, if appropriate, made adjustments for differences in merchandise.
