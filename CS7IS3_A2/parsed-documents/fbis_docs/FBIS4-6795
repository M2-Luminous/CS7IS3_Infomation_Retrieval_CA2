Baterna Hubert] [Text] Brussels, Belgium -- The Ramos Administration has swept away all chances of a peace accord between the government and the National Democratic Front (NDF), said Luis Jalandoni, NDF vice chairman for international affairs, during a talk before a small group at the Centre International over the weekend. Jalandoni assailed the declaration of an executive order which "imposed the Philippine Government Constitution as the framework of the peace talks." "For the NDF, the political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), this is a violation of the government-NDF Joint Declaration signed in The Hague (Netherlands) last September 1992," Jalandoni said. "This imposition of the rule of law will never be accepted because it will be synonymous to surrender and it fails to recognize that the revolutionary movement has its own constitution, programs, and processes." Jalandoni, now a Dutch citizen based at the NDF headquarters in Utrecht, The Netherlands, also cited the NDF's opposition to President Ramos' amnesty proclamations which, he said, "grant a license to kill and encourage the same people who were responsible for salvaging and the disappearance of persons to commit more crimes while extending amnesty to renegades and corrupt officials who profit from false surrenders." He disclosed that an NDF communique was sent recently to former Ambassador Howard Dee of the government negotiating panel that "with the amnesty proclamations and the executive order, the Philippine Government has put huge obstructions in the peace process." "A possible meeting between government and NDF representatives cannot take place as long as these obstacles, which Ramos himself had placed, remain," he said. Meanwhile, Philippine Ambassador to the Netherlands Romeo Arguelles confirmed that former Ambassador Dee had direct communication with the NDF. "They are still talking, although no agreement has yet been reached on the venue for the second round of exploratory talks," Arguelles said. "As far as Manila is concerned, the government is still open and is prepared to negotiate." Jalandoni, guest speaker of a conference with slide presentation and photo exhibit organized by the Centre International in collaboration with the Ligue Anti-Imperialiste and the Groupe Philippines de Belgique, related the "25 years of resistance in the Philippines" in commemoration of the 25th year anniversary of the New People's Army (NPA). Connie Ledesma of the Makibaka [Makabayan Kilusan ng Bagong Kababaihan -- Nationalist Movement of New Womanhood] Women's Front, who spoke on the "Role of Filipino Women in the Armed Struggle," joined Jalandoni on the panel. "Despite Ramos' predictions that the NPA would self-destruct in December 1993, the NPA is still here, large, strong, and flourishing. It will continue to be so long after the Ramos Administration have left the scene. With the support of the masses, the NPA is invincible," he said. Tanada [Subhead] Senate Minority Leader Wigberto Tanada asked President Ramos to recast his conditional and limited amnesty into a general and unconditional amnesty as recommended by the National Unification Commission (NUC) to encourage rebel groups to surrender with honor and justice. In a privilege speech, Tanada said that the two amnesty proclamations are a "virtual trap" that would discourage instead of encourage the rebels to apply for amnesty because the approval or disapproval of amnesty applications is open-ended. "I am for amnesty. But I am for amnesty at the proper time and after the proper preliminary steps have been taken; not the amnesty in the form, spirit, and substance the administration is foisting," Tanada said. He added that the government and the rebel groups should have first sat down over the negotiating table to ensure the success of any amnesty proclamation. Tanada said that he has been informed by all the armed rebel groups -- leftists, rightists, and secessionists -- of their blanket rejection of a unilateral amnesty outside of negotiations. "Without the active participation of these rebel forces, Proclamation 347 and 348 will not be workable and will generate more problems than they will resolve," he said. "Let us remember that the commitment to negotiate goes with the commitment not to take any action that will be seen to sabotage or endanger the negotiations." Tanada expressed his strongest objection to the "dangerous and unacceptable" Proclamation 348 extending amnesty to applicants from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) personnel who may have committed human rights violations in connection with their counter-insurgency operations. "It is dangerous and unacceptable," he said. "It is amnesty, or forgiveness, being extended by government to its own agents against the very people that government is supposed to serve and protect." He argued that the only ones who are in a position to forgive human rights violators are the human rights victims, not the government.
