FBIS4-34076 "drlat115_s_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-115 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 Uruguay Abreu, Argentina's Di Tella Sign Dam Accord Abreu, Argentina's Di Tella Sign Dam Accord PY1406202294 Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 4 Jun 94 p 9 PY1406202294 Montevideo EL PAIS Spanish BFN [Text] Our government will begin to receive about $100 million per year in revenues from the Salto Grande hydroelectric dam project following the signing by Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu and Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella yesterday in Buenos Aires of an agreement on the exchange of notes on financial streamlining, a new rate system, and a future reorganization of the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission. This agreement marks the completion of one stage of this joint hydroelectric project, which began on 1 April 1974, and the opening of a promising cooperation stage in the field of electric power interconnection as it follows existing efforts toward full electric power integration between Argentina and Uruguay. The agreement complements an act signed a few days ago within the framework of an agreement on electric power interconnection. Under this act, Argentina will purchase Uruguay's surplus electricity from its Salto Grande dam at 80 percent of the Argentine spot [preceding word in English] market prices. The financial streamlining of the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission is the main outcome of the agreement. Thanks to the compensation [not further specified] on its loans and debts, the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission will have no liability whatsoever. The agreement also provides for the payment of a debt arising from compensation that Uruguay had to honor, involving unpaid dam construction loans and UTE [General Administration of State Electric Power and Telephones] bills totaling about $380 million. These bills will be paid directly by UTE to the Argentine Republic, which has granted an 11-year deadline. This financial streamlining paves the way for the hydroelectric project to immediately yield about $100 million per year in revenues for our government. This agreement also opens a negotiations stage for reorganizing the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission. The negotiations will seek to reorganize the commission's jurisdiction, concentrating its activities in electric power output and distribution and the adjustment of its operation costs. The agreement establishes the formation of a working group, coordinated by the two Foreign Ministries, to submit within 60 days a report on the binational agency's institutional reorganization.
