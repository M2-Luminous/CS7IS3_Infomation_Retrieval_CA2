As of today, 521 cases of the disease have been noted. In the opinion of epidemiologists, the current growth in the number of patients is directly linked to the unjustifiable sensation over diptheria vaccine that occurred several years ago. Because parents refused to have their children vaccinated, the rising generation's immunity against a number of diseases, including diptheria, is extremely low.
