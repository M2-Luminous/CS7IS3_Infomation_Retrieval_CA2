FR940323-0-00093 FR940323-0-00023 Response: Overcollection of plants with unusual coloration or showy flowers is a real threat. Horticulturists and rare plant enthusiasts are constantly looking for new plants for commercial use. Locality information for this species is available in the scientific literature; however, the Service does not wish to attract additional or undue attention to the exact location of Holy Ghost ipomopsis populations by publication of maps in the Federal Register . An analysis of economic impacts is required for critical habitat designation, but cannot be considered for the species' listing itself. Nor can a decision not to list a species be based on economic considerations. A decision not to list a species or to delist a species can only be made if the Service determines, based on the best scientific and commercial information available, that listing is not warranted. Because the Service has determined that critical habitat designation is not prudent, no economic analysis is required. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that Holy Ghost ipomopsis should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus Wilken and Fletcher (Holy Ghost ipomopsis) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. The Holy Ghost ipomopsis occurs in an area that has been heavily used for recreation for at least the last 50 years. This use includes approximately 36 recreation cabins and a Forest Service campground. A nearby trout stream receives significant use by anglers. These high-use recreational values have been protected by the almost complete exclusion of timber harvests and forest fires. As the forest has become more mature and natural openings less numerous, the majority of the known population of the Holy Ghost ipomopsis has become associated with the manmade disturbance associated with the Forest Service road. Road maintenance poses a potential threat to the species. An example is a nearby Forest Service road that was graveled using crushed waste rock from an abandoned mine. The sulfides in this mine waste created highly acid road runoff that killed the surrounding vegetation. If this or other toxic materials were used for the Forest Service road occupied by Holy Ghost ipomopsis, those portions of occupied habitat would no longer be suitable for the species. Although Forest Service roads in the area are not presently sprayed with herbicides, this type of weed control could be a future maintenance threat. The Forest Service road occupied by Holy Ghost ipomopsis was straightened and paved in 1989. The 111 plants that would have been destroyed by the activity were moved in mid-June of that year to similar habitat at Elk Mountain. None of the transplants survived. The control of spruce budworm is a potential threat to pollinators of Holy Ghost ipomopsis. The spruce budworm is a moth larva that can defoliate large areas of spruce and Douglas fir. When infestations occur in residential areas, the State of New Mexico receives numerous requests for large area aerial broadcast of Bacillus thuringiensis as a pesticide. This pesticide kills not only the spruce budworm moth, but all other lepidopterans including those that serve as pollinators for the Holy Ghost ipomopsis. If this treatment were repeated for more than one year, it might have a serious impact on seed production and population recruitment for this short-lived species. B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. No economic uses for the Holy Ghost ipomopsis are known. However, the low population numbers make the species vulnerable to harm from both scientific and non-scientific collecting. The species produces a very attractive flower, which may make the plants more likely to be picked by visitors to the canyon. If the plants become well known, there may be interest in propagating the species for commercial purposes.
