"A bad thing has been turned into a good thing," Jiang was quoted by official media yesterday as telling the Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. "As a result, our reform and opening programme has forged ahead with steadier, better, and even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into fuller play." Jiang said the communist leadership had no choice on June 3-4, 1989, but to crush the mass protests. "History shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good," said Jiang, who rose to power with the removal of Zhao Ziyang as party leader. "Without the resolute measures taken then, China would not have enjoyed today's stability. In the past five years, China has enjoyed economic development, social stability and improved livelihood of the people, thanks to our consistent efforts to take stability as an overriding priority. Facts prove this is absolutely correct." But Robin Munro, the Hong Kong director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, questioned whether the suppression of June 4 has really made China more stable. "The increasing number of strikes and peasant protests suggest a social pressure cooker that has all the signs of being dangerously unstable," Munro said. "By crushing the Tiananmen protests, they enforced a short-term stability, but evidently at a higher long-term cost." Jiang's comments -- carried in the Communist Party's official mouthpiece, the People's Daily, and other newspapers -- are likely to be repeated in coming weeks as Chinese people and the world media reflect on the deadly collision of hope, chaos and force five years ago. Hong Kong legislators were dismayed by Jiang's comments. Lau Chin-shek, a United Democrat, said he believed those who committed the massacre would be held responsible "sooner or later". "Jiang's hardline remarks will only remind people to commemorate the massacre and rekindle people's hatred," he said. Cheng Kai-nam, the general secretary of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, urged the Chinese government to recognise the "mistake" of June 4. "If people are not happy with their government, they have every right to express their feelings," he said. "There is no way the government should use violent means." Frederick Fung, the leader of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, said it showed that Beijing had not modernised in the past five years. "To have a good economic performance is the basic obligation of a government. "It is no big deal and should not be linked up with the philosophy of political repression," he said. The Liberal Party's Henry Tang also questioned the justification for the use of force. "There could have been other means to solve the problem like the use of plastic bullets and water cannon instead of tank and guns. That is not the only way of crowd dispersement." An independent legislator, Andrew Wong, said there was a simple explanation for Jiang's remarks. "China and Malaysia see eye to eye on the philosophy of feeding their peoples first. The two leaders share the same culture," he said. "Second, China has to show that they do not buy the Americans' concept of human rights. They made it clear that the renewal of MFN must not be linked with human rights."
