According to our correspondent, the majority of the journalists' questions referred to issues related to the recent visit to Greece by the head of the Romanian state. Talking about our country's stance regarding the embargo imposed on Yugoslavia, Chebeleu said that in Romania's general opinion, considering the fact that the embargo, in the way it was implemented, did not help to extinguish the conflict, all measures intended to slacken the embargo are to be saluted. Answering a question related to the trade unions' request that President Ion Iliescu should intervene again as a mediator [in their negotiations with the government and the employers], Chebeleu reasserted the readiness of the head of state to intervene in various dialogues, whenever necessary, including the current case.
