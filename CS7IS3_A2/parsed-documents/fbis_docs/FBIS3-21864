The intelligence agents later arrested the smugglers as they emerged from the railway station, and they have registered a case against the superintendent of customs. The production of heroin was initially started by the CIA in Afghanistan to creat money for supplying weapons to the forces opposing the Soviet Union. For about a decade the United States looked the other way. Now it considers appropriate to ignore all its own "actions" and prefers to accuse Pakistan of it. Against this background, if we review this incident of seizure of chemicals used in making heroin, it is clear that India is also involved in this drama to give Pakistan notoriety for making heroin. The law enforcement agencies should keep all this in mind and arrest the involved persons.
