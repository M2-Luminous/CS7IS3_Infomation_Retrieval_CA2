Mayor Gheorghe Funar has announced that the archeological excavations around the statue of King Matthias in the center of town will begin today. He also promised to take legal steps against demonstrators, after the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in Romanian] mobilized the population for a protest meeting at 1300. We are aware of the fact that the planned archeological excavations in the center of town do not serve scientific purposes. It is a political provocation aimed at dismantling the statue of King Matthias, reads the appeal of the Kolozsvar county organization of the RMDSZ to the population of the town. According to the RMDSZ, the planned action against the town's main square and the famous statue is the last straw in violation of the national dignity of the ethnic Hungarians in Romania. The RMDSZ called upon the entire population of Kolozsvar to participate in a protest rally organized on the main square at 1300 on 22 June in order to defend the statue and the St Michael Cathedral. The mood in Kolozsvar has become extremely tense in the wake of the planned excavations, the removal of Josef Bem's memorial plaque, and the latest nationalist anticultural and anti-Hungarian provocations. In view of this fact, the operative council of the RMDSZ has been convened in Kolozsvar for this afternoon. Given the fact that the municipal council failed to gather the necessary votes to allocate 30 million lei to finance the excavations, Gheorghe Funar proposed to postpone the debate. However, they announced that they would begin the excavations, even without the approval of the municipal council because the Historical Museum of Transsylvania allocated 10 million lei for this purpose. Museum Director Gheorghe Lazarovici pointed out that the excavations are meant to "prove the continuity of the Romanian people" because the archeological excavations that began at the beginning of the last century were discontinued in 1943, and the scientific evaluation of the results took place in Budapest. If we cannot prove our thousands-of-years presence here with written documents, then we will dig in the main square of Kolozsvar for as long as 20 years to find the proof from the earth, Lazarovici said. In the municipality meeting on 20 June, Funar pointed out that he would erase everything that refers to this town's Hungarian character and, at the next municipal council meeting, he would propose to change the name of the town to Napoca. Nicolae Ruja, an adviser of the Romanian National Unity Party, expressed the opinion that the statue in question should be located in the Hunedoara Castle rather than on the main square of Kolozsvar. At a news conference on 21 June, Funar declared that the excavations would commence on 22 June. He said that it is impossible for this plan to generate any tension. If, however, those who are displeased decide to, nevertheless, demonstrate on the main square, he would use the legal stipulations regarding unannounced demonstrations and the offenders would be arrested. According to Funar, the Roman Catholic Church should not hinder the excavations because the National Council for the Protection of Monuments has already approved them. In the Hungarian-language daily SZABADSAG published in Kolozsvar, Roman Catholic Dean Arpad Czirjak drew the attention of the Hungarians in Transsylvania to the fact that the Romanian nationalists are preparing for a final showdown against King Matthias' successors. Both Hungarians and rationally thinking Romanians argued a lot for giving up the aforementioned plans in recent weeks. However, it seems that arguments no longer help. There is a pogrom mood in Kolozsvar.
