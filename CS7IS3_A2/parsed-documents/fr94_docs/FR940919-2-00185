FR940919-2-00185 FR940919-2-00081 II. Competition and Universal Service 11. The Federal government and many States have made a fundamental commitment to introducing and expanding competition in telecommunications markets. The benefits of that commitment are increasingly apparent and show no signs of diminishing. There is also some concern, however, about the effects of competition on universal service. While those concerns merit attention, there is much evidence to suggest that competition and universal service are not incompatible goals. Market rivalry both drives prices towards underlying costs and reduces underlying costs by forcing competing firms to operate more efficiently. Competition thus tends to reduce prices for goods and services, making them more affordable for more consumers and ultimately reducing the need for subsidies. At the same time, competition also increases the range of services and products available to consumers and, potentially, their geographic reach as well, further promoting universal service goals. 12. The potential effects of competition on rates and consumer choice can be gleaned from the recent history of the long distance and CPE markets in the United States. Prior to the break-up of the Bell System in 1984, most of the United States was served by a single long distance network operated by AT&T. Today, after a decade of government efforts to facilitate entry in the long distance market, there are more than 500 long distance carriers in the United States, offering a wide, ever-changing array of services and pricing options. 13 Due in part to this active rivalry among firms, long distance rates have declined more than sixty percent since 1984 by some estimations, making long distance calling more affordable for more Americans. 14 13 Industry Analysis Division, Common Carrier Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Trends in Telephone Service, at 31 (May 1994) ( Telephone Trends ). AT&T now captures less than 60 percent of all long distance revenues. Industry Analysis Division, Common Carrier Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Long Distance Market Shares_Fourth Quarter, 1993 Table 6 (Apr. 1994). 14 See, e.g., Letter from Gerald J. Kovach, MCI, to Clarence L. Irving, Jr., NTIA, Attachment 1 at 1 (June 9, 1994) (long distance rates, adjusted for inflation, have declined 66% since 1985). As a result of the sharp decline in long distance rates, long distance calling has surged in recent years, especially relative to local calling. Toll calls (measured in minutes of use) comprised 26.6% percent of all calls in 1992, as compared to 19.9% in 1984. Telephone Trends, supra note 13, at 25 and Table 16. 13. Similarly, when the Bell System controlled the CPE market, customers could lease (but not buy) any telephone they wanted, so long as it was a black instrument that delivered unadorned voice service. Today, customers can choose their phones from a wide variety of colors, sizes, shapes, and designs. Modern telephones also include a variety of features (e.g., speed dialing, re-dial, memory programming) that greatly increase usefulness of that equipment for many customers. In addition, its cost has declined considerably in the last decade (as much as 50 percent in ``real'' terms). 15 15 See National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, NTIA Special Publication 91&hyph;26 The NTIA Infrastructure Report: Telecommunications in the Age of Information 204&hyph;205 and n. 707 (1991) ( Infrastructure Report ). 14. The impact of competition on universal service can be examined more directly by reviewing the development of local telephone service after expiration of the original Bell telephone patents in 1893/94 unleashed a twenty-five year period of competition in the provision of local telephone service. 16 In 1895, after nineteen years of the Bell System patent monopoly, there were only 251,994 telephones in the United States, or one telephone for every 276 of the nation's 69.5 million people. By 1920, at the close of the competitive era, there were some 13.4 million telephones in the United States, or one telephone for every eight of the nation's 105.7 million people. 17 Moreover, fifty-five percent of all telephone subscribers were residential customers, as compared to only ten percent in 1895. 16 The following discussion is taken from Mueller, supra note 2, at 356&hyph;358, 360&hyph;361. 17 In 1895, the number of telephones in the United States was growing by five percent annually. Id. at 356. At that rate, the nation would have had fewer than one million telephones by 1920.
