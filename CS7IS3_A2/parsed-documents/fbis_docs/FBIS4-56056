The command of the Sarajevo-Romanija corps of the Bosnian Serb army specified that Moslem forces fired 13 82mm-calibre mortar shells on the Srednje district on the Sarajevo-Olovo road and that one shell fell near a bus. The shell explosion killed one woman and injured 13 passengers, two of them seriously. The woman was the 32nd victim in Serb-controlled areas of Sarajevo since a truce for Sarajevo was signed on February 9 this year and the city was proclaimed an exclusion zone under protection of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Bosnian Serb military sources said. The sources also said that 79 people were wounded in Moslem attacks, mostly from small arms, rifles with telescopic sights, and grenade launchers. The Moslem side is constantly violating the truce, primarily as a result of the complete lack of action by UNPROFOR who have not once reacted to warnings sent by the command of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps of the Bosnian Serb army, the command said.
