FBIS4-51731 "dreas085_c_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 North Korea Anti-U.S. `Struggle' by People in South Hailed Anti-U.S. `Struggle' by People in South Hailed SK0305042894 Pyongyang Radio Pyongyang in Korean to South Korea 0935 GMT 29 Apr 94 SK0305042894 Pyongyang Radio Pyongyang Korean BFN [Unattributed talk: "The Just Struggle of South Korean Youth and Students"] [Text] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The South Korean youth and students have played a vanguard and leading role in promoting the South Korean people's just anti-U.S. struggle and their struggle for independence, antifascist democratization, and national reunification. Our nation is proud of their heroic struggles. Today youth and students are vigorously struggling to pull out outside forces and their nuclear weapons from South Korea. As has been already reported, the United States has largely reinforced and deployed its arms of aggression to South Korea under the pretext of the nuclear issue and has aggravated tensions on the Korean peninsula along with the puppets. Such a criminal act by the United States has aroused the indignation and protest of the South Korean youth, students, and people from all walks of life. On 19 April, approximately 500 youth and students waged a harsh anti-U.S. demonstration in front of the U.S. Cultural Center in Taegu, shouting slogans that they oppose the introduction of Patriot missiles to South Korea, as well as the National Assembly's ratification of the opening of agricultural product markets. On the same day, when they failed to occupy the U.S. Cultural Center because of the violent oppression by the combat police forces, the demonstrators continued to bravely fight against them, thus throwing stones at them. On 18 April, youth and students in Taegu held a rally in front of the Taegu department store to mark the 34th anniversary of the 19 April people's uprising and condemned the nation-selling and treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique's antinational and flunkeyist act. The National Alliance of College Students Organization [Hanchongnyon], a mass-oriented struggling organization which is made up of the South Korean youth and students, declared that it would reaffirm that the anti-U.S. struggle is particularly a basic road to the nation's democratic movement, saying that the movement for independence, democracy, and reunification must be earnestly carried out. Thus, it has bravely risen up to participate in the just struggle of the South Korean youth and students under the resolution that it will take the lead in promoting the nation's just anti-U.S. struggle and their struggle for independence that will defend the nation's existence and dignity. On 20 April, approximately 150 Hanchonnyon students penetrated into the building of the puppet Defense Ministry in which the U.S. secretary of defense and the puppet defense minister had plotted together a war conspiracy and waged demonstrations under the placards entitled "We Oppose the United States and the Visit by William Perry; We Don't Want a War; and Yankee Go Home." Also a group of youth and students in Seoul waged demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul by breaking through a tightly-guarded siege of police, shouting the anti-U.S. slogans "We Hate Patriot Missiles" and "We Hate William Perry." The anti-U.S. struggle vigorously waged in South Korea has been further reinforced along with the antigovernment struggle. Participants in the struggle have denounced that the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is more treacherous and flunkeyist than any other South Korean rulers in the past. According to a decision by Hanchongnyon, students in Pusan -- who resolved on 8 April to go on strike, hold rallies, and stage demonstrations against the National Assembly's ratification of the opening of the agricultural product market -- continued struggles even until later that night and, thus, made the nation-selling and treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique shudder. Approximately 1,000 students, who participated in the struggle waged during the daytime, carried out an offensive and defensive battle against the combat police force units for nearly three hours from 1900 to 2200 that day. Youths and students -- who are infuriated at the South Korean authorities' antinational opening of agricultural product markets -- even attacked the branch offices of the Democratic Liberal Party in Kwangju and in Taegu. In Kwangju, approximately 400 youths and students staged demonstrations in front of the South Cholla Provincial local branch of the Democratic Liberal Party and continued struggles by throwing some 50 paint bottles at its branch building and shouting slogans that called upon the government not to sign the Uruguay Round accord. The students of Myongji, Yonsei, and Hongik Universities, who belong to the western district branch office of the Seoul District Federation of General Students, have also waged the just struggle. On 26 April, approximately 700 students held rallies and demonstrations to mark the 3d anniversary of the death of student Kang Kyong-tae, thus raging against the fascist murders. Participants in rallies prayed for the bliss of their fellow student who sacrificed himself in the sacred struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification and then strongly condemned the military fascist elements who had mercilessly killed the young patriotic student. Through their practical struggles, the South Korean youths and students have been clearly aware that the aspiration of the youths, students, and people for independence, democracy, and reunification can never be achieved as long as there are outside forces remaining in South Korea. The outside forces will be also doomed to a greater disaster. Therefore, the South Korean youth, students, and people are now vigorously conducting the anti-U.S. and antigovernment struggles to save the fellow countrymen's lives -- which are more important than their youth and lives -- even under a warlike atmosphere in which the fascists act rashly. The wise and brave youths and students in South Korea -- who strongly call for the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South Korea despite the fascists' clubs and bullets -- will continue to fight on until the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea are fully withdrawn from this land. This is the will and vigor of our youths and students in the colonial South, as well as the unanimous voices of the South Korean youths, students, and people. Thanks to the struggle of the wise and brave youths, students, and the people, South Korea has been turned today into an anti-U.S. struggling place where the struggles are waged more harshly. The puppet South Korean clique should be clearly aware of the will and faith of youths, students, and people who aspire for independence, democracy, and reunification. They should act with discretion. The wise and brave youths, students, and people in South Korea should firmly cooperate with each other under the anti-U.S. and antiwar banner. As a result, they will more vigorously carry out the struggles to achieve independence, democracy, and national reunification.
