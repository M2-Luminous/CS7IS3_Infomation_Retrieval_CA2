He does not like public personal promotions, he does not speak in phrases, he is not entirely serious even when he explains the most serious moves of the government, he does not act to please, and he is not a political pawn. He knows what he wants, and he knows how to get it. People trust him; he is an authority and would be considered one even if he were discussing the spiritual life of mosquitoes, for example. However, apart from the respect that he inspires when you talk to him, you feel as if you were sitting with a childhood friend who had suddenly appeared. We hardly managed to fit into his crowded schedule. Prime Minister Valentic works 16 hours a day every day. Who knows if he will get at least the first 10 minutes of the New Year to spend with his family?! It Is Hard To Assess Oneself [Crnjakovic] It has been nine months since you were appointed, which is long enough for an inventory. What could you say that you pride yourself on, without false modesty? [Valentic] It is really hard to assess oneself, and that is not just a cliche. We are all subjective. However, when you do this kind of work, you have to do it with a certain amount of criticism, which we do. With all the self-criticism, I think that we deserve a favorable judgment for what we have done so far. I am not making excuses for myself when I say that we inherited a difficult situation. There was a war on, and then there were the consequences of the war, which, naturally, "gave birth" to the 30-percent inflation, heading toward 40 percent. We were quite aware that if we reached 50 percent per month, there would be no basis for recovery, and we would lose credibility. People did not believe that we had the strength to do anything radical, and they were nervous, but a week after taking over we started working on the stabilization program. Do you remember the troubles in April? That was when we took over. [Crnjakovic] Do you mean the energy collapse in Dalmatia? [Valentic] Yes, I am referring to the darkness in Dalmatia, which is only one of the many consequences of the war, not of the negligence of my predecessors. I am referring to the time when everything had to be done, the most important thing being to abolish the selective loans from the primary currency issue, so that the preparations for the sowing, the harvest, and the crop purchases could be made. For six months we worked on the basis for the stabilization program. The commodity and foreign exchange reserves had to be improved, and the disparity of the prices of electricity, oil, and gas eliminated.... We also created the minimal basis for the program in the banking system. When I list only some of the things offhand, it now seems that they were easy to do. However, they demanded a lot of energy and radical moves. In expert circles it is believed that spring, or the beginning of the year, is the ideal time for stabilization changes, but we had no time to lose, because in three months inflation would have reached 100 percent. [Crnjakovic] In the last three months of this year you have managed to curb inflation. Was it perhaps done in an artificial way? [Valentic] There are no surrogates in economics. We brought inflation down to zero, and it may even become negative in the future. There is no artificial inflation, since we have not frozen anything, either salaries or prices. The only question now is whether we will manage to keep public expenditure in check. Croatia has inherited a huge public debt, from old foreign currency savings accounts to bonds, the losses and the rehabilitation of the electricity generating industry, and the health system. We have managed to reorganize all these sectors to a large extent. The electricity industry is no longer suffering great losses, and we have prevented the health system from collapsing. At present, we are keeping all the important sectors under control. We cannot have another collapse of the electricity system, and we are now considering the means for providing energy for next winter, since we have taken care of this one. [Crnjakovic] What about production, the main precondition for long-term economic stability? [Valentic] We do not expect a drastic drop in production next year. It has dropped by 40 percent in the past three years, but that is because of the war. There Is No Magic Wand [Crnjakovic] Are you expecting a wave of bankruptcies, and, hence, strikes? [Valentic] There will be some bankruptcies, but no major ones. [Crnjakovic] However, many people will lose their jobs. Has the government prepared any preventive measures? [Valentic] Yes, we have secured funds to provide the incentive for creating new jobs, for the reorganization of banks, the shipbuilding industry, and some agricultural estates. My estimate is that there will be more "internal cleanings", reducing capacities, than bankruptcies. However, this is normal in any system. What is important is that the state prepares a social program, which we have done. In any market economy you have certain companies going bankrupt, and new ones opening, so people are on the labor market, and they get new jobs. The structure of the Croatian economy is to a great extent socialist, and changes always bring negative consequences too. However, that is a pattern that one cannot change. [Crnjakovic] There is an impression that the government gives too little incentive to small entrepreneurs, a process which the sluggish bureaucracy ardently helps. To start a firm, you need to stand in line for hours just to get a stamp. [Valentic] You are exaggerating. Anyone can open a firm in two days; there are no bureaucratic, customs, or tax barriers there. These are people who basically know nothing about economics, but interfere anyway. I accept criticism, but one should not exaggerate. We must simply realize that we were in a complete collapse, and that several governments will have to succeed one another before we create a stable economic system. There is no magic wand. If you push one lever, another comes up. As far as small entrepreneurs are concerned, I have to tell you that they are in a better position because they can cheat the state more easily than the big corporations, and we will have to put a stop to that. Do you imagine that we do not see that owners ostensibly pay workers 100 German marks [DM], so that they can provide fewer benefits, while they pay them another 200 "under the table"? We are not so naive. [Crnjakovic] Is there a political consensus for the stabilization program -- does your team work together, or is there any banging under the table? [Valentic] The government is a closely knit team. There was no dissenting voting at any of the many sessions, and we made all the decisions, after they were carefully gone through at coordination and working groups, by consensus. There have been some serious confrontations, because each ministry would like to get as much of the cake as possible, but this government will be remembered for being a team. If this were not so, the program would not have been successful. Anyone can attack the government, but it will not be easily shaken. A political consensus really does exist. Even the opposition, which, by definition, simply has to attack, offers significant support. There have been no significant reproaches to our work, from either expert circles or the trade unions. I am happy with the support that we have. The Time of People Being Worn Out Quickly [Crnjakovic] Considering this general affection, we suppose that this government will last quite a long time. How long do you expect it will be in office? [Valentic] Everything depends on future results. For the time being, we have a positive balance. The average salary used to be DM140, and now it is DM280. Our foreign exchange reserves were DM1.2 billion, and now they are DM1.3 billion. The commodity reserves have been increased by several hundred million German marks. Are these improvisations or facts? Our energy reserves have been increased, the situation with the supply of electricity has been stabilized, the health system has been reorganized, and the retirement fund is doing even better. The government will last as long as it endures according to market principles. At present we have a stable situation, there are no demands for anyone's resignation, and we have full political support. However, we are not deceiving ourselves. I am not saying that we can last very long. In our situation even several months is a long time, and a year is an eternity. This is the time in which people are being worn out quickly. We had four government sessions in just one week before New Year, there was a parliament session, and another session was held, and on Monday we are starting again at full force. We will even be working on Epiphany [6 January]. This is a crazy pace. [Crnjakovic] This pace will probably make your life as prime minister shorter? [Valentic] This is not an excuse, but many know that I have serious arthritic problems. This is not an illness from which you die, but one with which you die. My illness demands a lot of rest, treatment at spas, and a quiet life with no travel or frequent changes of climate. But I will certainly not run away and leave those who trusted me, and gave me the support without which we would not have been able to implement the stabilization program. However, it is a fact that one cannot take this pace very long even when one is completely healthy. We work 16, even 18 hours a day. Let us go back to the question, though: I believe that we will last six more months, which means that we will maintain production at this level, that there will be no inflation, social unrest, or strikes. If we succeed in that, then we will have done a great deal of work. I Am Not Buying a Company [Crnjakovic] When you leave, will you remain in politics? [Valentic] Never. When I am done with this job, I will go back to private business. [Crnjakovic] What kind of business? [Valentic] Some combination of law practice and modern financial transactions. I think I am one of the rare people who can organize a group of top experts -- lawyers, attorneys, financial specialists -- that can work on infrastructure and construction. I have no political ambitions; I am not going to buy any company. It is easier for me to start from scratch than buy old trash. Many will regret buying companies with old technology, and there are hardly any Croatian factories that have modern technology at the European level. This is at the same time a reply to the attacks of some who have bought up factories: Let them buy them! All those who lack competitiveness will fail. As for me, I will start from the beginning. If you are a little late in the beginning, you can make up for it by not having old organization, so when you start you are much faster. [Crnjakovic] What is your comment to the claims that 10 businessmen have bought Croatia? [Valentic] These 10 people hold no more than 2 to 3 percent of the social capital. At present there are 100 strong industrialists in Croatia, and tens of thousands of rich ones. Over 50 percent of Croatia has not been privatized at all. However, the property that has been bought is yet to be put into operation. I am not afraid that Croatia could become a "banana republic". There will be hundreds of industrialists, but there are also about 400,000 small stockholders. Even if half of them fail, there will still be 200,000. Unfortunately, some stratification will occur. [Crnjakovic] You have recently said that it is better to have property belonging to someone than no one. Will we not wake up one morning to discover that our country is in someone else's hands? [Valentic] When we open up completely, when there is a stock market, owners will change daily, so that the worker will not even know who he is really working for. This is also normal. We cannot have foreign capital and control over everything at the same time. However, we will not sell our property for next to nothing. It Is Impossible To Return Everything [Crnjakovic] I must ask you the topical question: Will you be the prime minister who will start the process of denationalization? [Valentic] I will start it, but I will not finish it. It is a very complex process. I am not one of those who think they can work miracles; I cannot promise such things. We will probably accept the Hungarian model of monetary restitution. How do you return someone's property that was taken away 70 years ago, when you can not even return the property to someone from Vukovar? It is impossible to return everything. There will most certainly be no spectacular moves in that area. [Crnjakovic] Are there going to be any spectacular moves in the tax system? Everybody is complaining that the taxes are too high, but no one can explain precisely what the essence of the new system is. Could you tell us? [Valentic] Not in this kind of conversation. [Crnjakovic] Could you at least say how it will influence the small man? [Valentic] It will have almost no influence on him, as the rates are low up to certain incomes. Higher incomes are taxed. Even we, who have been working on introducing a new, internationally compatible tax system, are not quite certain in practice, and we expect difficulties in the first three months. Tax reforms are in fact revolutions; countries usually take 10 years to prepare for them. There will be nervousness in the beginning, but in a year we will have a well established system. Its essence is that the total income is added up, and this amount is then uniformly taxed. It is impossible to explain all the taxes. I do not like giving interviews. I do not like to be superficial, and it is impossible to be serious and explain thoroughly. This is why I will give no more interviews. [Crnjakovic] So I got in at the last moment? [Valentic] Yes, you did. You reporters take sentences out of context, and then they are transferred, and put into the headlines. The State Will Pay as Much as It Can [Crnjakovic] However, at least you know who to blame. What would you politicians do without reporters?! [Valentic] Now, you do know that I understand your profession, and you also know that I am self-critical and that I accept part of the blame. However, it is simply impossible to resolve a problem in one conversation. You can discuss politics, but economics is a trade. [Crnjakovic] You have had numerous interviews with trade union representatives, university students, old age pensioners... which one was the most difficult? [Valentic] With disabled veterans, for emotional and moral reasons. We must do absolutely everything for these people. [Crnjakovic] Will you? [Valentic] They will come first; we have assigned DM163 million for our defenders. I am also sorry for old age pensioners, who keep attacking me. We can start printing money, but then their pensions will amount to DM5, as in Serbia, instead of the DM200 that is the average pension now. I was advised not to attend the interview with the university students because they would whistle me down. However, that is also part of the job. I am one of those people who face problems, not avoid them. [Crnjakovic] So did they whistle? [Valentic] No, they greeted me with a round of applause. We had a very open conversation. [Crnjakovic] One more topical question: What will happen to the old foreign currency savings accounts? [Valentic] Whether the state should take over the public debt is a question. The state will pay as much as it can; we are servicing part of the interest. The state can not return a couple of billion dollars overnight, but we will do it in several years. We will reduce the public debt. [Box, p 13] Like a Drill in the Stone [Crnjakovic] Will Nikica Valentic be remembered in history as the prime minister whose term of office saw the kuna [currency in use in fascist Croatia 1941-5] reintroduced? [Valentic] Money is the reflection of the power of the economy. We must not jump the gun. An orderly economic situation greatly depends on the political situation, on the resolutions for these areas. However, I assure you that even if things get worse we will not give up our program, and will not allow the printing of money, so that we get the same situation as in Serbia, where monthly inflation is 400,000 percent -- in the Weimar Germany it was 30,000 percent. If the political situation remains as it is now, we will make more radical moves. If there is no more war and the situation gets better, we have the chance of keeping inflation below 3 percent per month. If production does not fall, and there is no social unrest, we could introduce the new Croatian currency by State Day. This is, I repeat, if there is peace. I believe that I will be prime minister until then. I will consider my part of the job -- the first part of the second stage of rehabilitation and restructuring -- done. After that it is important that my successor continues where I started. You know, it is important not to keep changing the program all the time. I always compare myself to a drill in the stone: Sooner or later the bore will break, but it is not the same if it breaks at the first or the 20th centimeter, and if drilling the same hole continues, or a new one is opened. This time there will be no new holes; whoever comes after me will continue drilling. [Box, p 13] The Mercep Case Should Not Be Politicized [Crnjakovic] Could you give me your political comment on the following: Dr. Greguric, a former prime minister, questioned the credibility of the press report on Mercep's troops. Certain information from one of the ministries, that is, the office headed by Mr. Manolic, obviously leaked straight to the press. What is this all about? [Valentic] I am not familiar with the details, since I have not discussed it with anyone, but have only heard the representative's question and the minister's answer, like yourself. However, I can comment on it. It is up to the state attorney's office to start the proceedings within their authority and jurisdiction. In principle, I am against such cases being solved in the papers instead of in court. Information can be published, but in a legal way. However, regardless of the press and the representative's question, the proceedings are under way, and all the material facts will be established -- the information in question is not a fact but circumstantial evidence. The government can not state a political position on this; it is up to the court to establish the truth and justice, and justice is always attainable, even if it is slow. Only the court can establish the facts. I will insist on making the process faster, so that the case is not politicized any further.
