[Fini] We are only interested in programs.[passage omitted] [De Luca] But after the programs, the ministries... For example, do you have some interest in the Postal Communications Ministry? [Fini] The telecommunications sector will be strategic in the near future. [De Luca] And what about the Ministries of Internal Affairs and Justice: Have you thought about these? [Fini] All the ministries without exception are important, because if one is not important there is no reason to keep it. [De Luca] But some are more important. Or not? [Fini] If a government coalition that includes us is formed we will evaluate this with our allies. [De Luca] Will there also be Minister Fini at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's seat]? [Fini] I personally do not hold a claim to any candidacy. I have no intention of assuming any government position. [De Luca] And who will be the National Alliance men in the government? [Fini] I have a duty to speak to my men first. However, there are many that are up to the task. Names? None for the time being. [De Luca] RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. Must it change? [Fini] Certainly.... [De Luca] How do you see the new RAI? [Fini] It must guarantee a public service in respect to pluralism. It must be managed and administered in a transparent manner. It must cost less, a great deal less than what it costs now. It must act in the market under the same conditions. [De Luca] But should it be privatized or can it remain public? [Fini] It must be a public company but managed with private sector measures. [De Luca] Will the three channels remain? [Fini] As far as I am concerned, yes. However, they cannot remain three channels subcontracted out to three parties or as was the case recently, to only one. [De Luca] Umberto Bossi keeps on shouting in your face that you are the reactionary Right and that he will never form a government with you. [Fini] Each barrel gives the wine it contains... [De Luca] But what game is Bossi playing: Is he merely raising the stakes or is he serious? [Fini] We will see in a few days' time, be patient... [De Luca] But what is Fini's opinion? [Fini] Bossi is entirely unpredictable, it is his virtue but also his vice. Venturing any forecast on his behavior is always a risk. Everything, however, leads one to think that he is only playing at raising the stakes. [De Luca] What are your conditions for accepting the League in the government? [Fini] Three conditions that we cannot renounce: national unity, solidarity between north and south, and a prime minister who cannot be one of them. The latter because the League is a regionalistic political force and therefore not representative of the country. [De Luca] If Bossi does not let go, will there be an institutional government? [Fini] If I have read the numbers correctly, no institutional government can be formed, unless there is a chance that the League will forge an alliance with the Italian Popular Party and the progressives. But at that point Bossi would lose 99 percent of his supporters, it would be a blatant case of betrayal. [De Luca] If the League does not change his mind, back to elections then? [Fini] I think so, but I believe that this very evaluation of the facts will induce Bossi to change his mind. [De Luca] The other night in Piazza del Popolo, your victory was celebrated with some Roman [Fascist] greetings. This is not a laughing matter... [Fini] At a moment of joy like that, some boy raising his arm cannot worry anybody...I hope.
