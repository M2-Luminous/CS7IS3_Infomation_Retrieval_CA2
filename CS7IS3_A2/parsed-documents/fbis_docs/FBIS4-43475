Issued by the Italian Foreign Ministry because Italy is the CSCE's duty president, the statement said a meeting of the CSCE's committee of high-ranking officials in Prague decided that a top CSCE official would be sent to central Asia for a year on a "permanent liaison" mission. This posting and the mission to the Crimea were designed as an act of preventive diplomacy, the CSCE's "primary and qualifying" task, the statement here asserted. According to the Foreign Ministry, the permanent mission's aim was also to act as backup for the experts as they seek to ease talks between Kiev and the authorities in Simferopol, the capital of the Crimea which became an autonomous republic within the Ukraine in 1954. The aim of the talks is to improve power sharing and joint moves to improve the Crimea's economic growth prospects. In the last couple of years, the Crimea, a peninsula on the Black Sea with a major naval base at Sevastopol and place names such as Balaklava and Yalta, has been seeking its independence, or at least closer ties with Russia from which its ethnic majority comes. A major stumbling block has been the ex-Soviet naval bases at Sevastapol and other ports. Both Russia and the Ukraine have laid claim to the ex-Soviet Black Sea navy, but now negotiations to divide it seem to be on the right path. Early this month, CSCE High Commissioner for Minorities Max van der Stoel was shuttling between Moscow and Kiev when Crimean and Ukrainian delegations were negotiating on the problems raised by an April referendum in which Crimeans voted by a large majority for closer relations with Russia, and by the approval in May of a 1992 constitution with apparently secessionist provisions, among them one allowing for dual citizenship. "The ways and possibilities for finding a solution are sufficient, the only problem is to want to use them" said Van der Stoel, who was also full of praise for the Ukraine's policy on ethnic minorities. Negotiations are still going on to reconcile the new Crimean constitution with Ukraine's, without touching Ukrainian territorial integrity, a basic principle reasserted today by the CSCE, which reiterated its commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the inviolability of its frontiers. According to the statement here, the CSCE also called on the Crimean authorities to avoid any act that could aggravate the situation and endanger negotiations. The meeting in Prague also began preparations for the CSCE summit to be held in Budapest in December, an occasion to which South Korea will also be invited as an observer. (Italian Ambassador Paolo Bruno, who chaired the meeting in Prague, told reporters there that other decisions and recommendations covered joint CSCE-Commonwealth of Independent States monitoring missions in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh as well as CSCE monitoring in Moldova and Bosnia.) (He said the meeting also decided to return the missions to Voivodina and Kosovo.) (The Vatican delegation asked for Serbia-Montenegro's readmission. The federated republic was suspended because of the Bosnian war.) (The ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia was also kept in its status as observer due to Greek opposition to full membership.)
