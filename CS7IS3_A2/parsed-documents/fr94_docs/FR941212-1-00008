FR941212-1-00008 FR941212-1-00006 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWA&hyph;4] Proposed Modification of the El Paso International Airport, TX, and the Lincoln Municipal Airport, NE, Class C Airspace Areas and Proposed Establishment of the Lincoln Municipal Airport, NE, Class E Airspace Area AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would modify the El Paso International Airport, TX, and the Lincoln Municipal Airport, NE, Class C airspace areas. This proposed action would amend the effective hours to coincide with the associated radar approach control facility's hours of operation, but would not change the designated boundaries or altitudes of these Class C airspace areas. Class C airspace areas are predicated on an operational air traffic control tower (ATCT) serviced by a radar approach control facility. In addition, this action proposes to establish Class E airspace at Lincoln Municipal Airport, NE, when the associated radar approach control facility is not in operation. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket [AGC&hyph;200], Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWA&hyph;4, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. The official docket may be examined in the Rules Docket, Office of the Chief Counsel, Room 916, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. An informal docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the office of the Regional Air Traffic Division. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William C. Nelson, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9295.

Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11&hyph;2A, which describes the application procedure. The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the El Paso International Airport, TX, and the Lincoln Municipal Airport, NE, Class C airspace areas by amending the effective hours to coincide with the associated radar approach control facility's hours of operation, but would not change the designated boundaries or altitudes of these Class C airspace areas. In addition, this action proposes to establish the Lincoln Municipal Airport, NE, Class E airspace area to provide controlled airspace for instrument procedures when the radar approach control facility is not in operation. The FAA would establish the Class E airspace to identify, protect arrival departure extensions and the appropriate air traffic service available in that surface area. Class C and E airspace designations are published in paragraphs 4000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class C and E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
