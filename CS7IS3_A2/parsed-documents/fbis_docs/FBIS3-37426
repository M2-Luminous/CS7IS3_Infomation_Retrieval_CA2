[Horyn] I believe that there are no grounds for grave concern, although certain forces will probably want to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and tension. In my opinion, the situation could be normalized if the executive bodies take preventive measures now. [Reporter] Will the electoral law affect the results of the elections? [Horyn] The electoral law was meant to limit the influence of parties on political life in Ukraine. We hoped that the elections would be a great chance for many young parties to grow, become stronger, and form the political basis of a democratic society, but this has not happened. The majority system has in fact put an end to hopes for a multiparty society. This has happened, although all of Ukraine's democratic forces demanded that a mixed proportional system be introduced. [Reporter] How many candidates will the Republican Party field? [Horyn] According to preliminary calculations, we will have more than 100. [Reporter] What is your opinion about holding a referendum on the main provisions of the draft constitution on election day? [Horyn] This would only complicate the electoral process. I would rather propose that this issue be resolved by the new legislature. It would be very unwise to vote on the main provisions without a preliminary discussion of the draft by either the newly elected Supreme Council or the Constitutional Assembly. I am against doing this. [Reporter] Could you briefly outline your election platform? [Horyn] Our economic, political, and military programs were drafted as early as 1992, because we were the first registered democratic organization and the first alternative to the Communist Party of Ukraine. We believe that Ukraine should be a multiparty parliamentary republic. Private property, coexisting with other forms of property, should be the driving force of the economy. We want the privatization program to provide equal opportunities for all Ukrainian citizens. [Reporter] What is your opinion regarding the tripartite declaration signed in Moscow by Presidents Kravchuk, Clinton, and Yeltsin? [Horyn] I believe that this is a very important document which requires thorough analysis. [Reporter] How can this document affect Ukraine's national security? [Horyn] In my opinion, the adoption of the current version of the document would deal a heavy blow to Ukraine.
