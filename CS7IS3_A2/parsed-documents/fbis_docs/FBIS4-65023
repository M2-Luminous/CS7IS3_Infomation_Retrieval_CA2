Yesterday, the candidates on Dominique Baudis' UDF [French Democratic Union]-RPR [Rally for the Republic] list for the European elections often referred to symbolic events during the official launch of their campaign for "a Europe of peace and employment." It was under the model of a satellite, between models of the Ariane rocket and the IFREMER [French Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea] submarine Nautilus, that the representatives of the majority list met in the La Villette Science Park late in the morning. Dominique Baudis, who never forgets that he is mayor of Toulouse, did not fail to praise the success of the Ariane and European aerospace projects. After the praise, he regretted the fact that there are only four researchers for every 1,000 workers in Europe, compared with eight in the United States and nine in Japan. In his view, therefore, Europe's future depends on an increase in the effort to promote research and on strengthening cooperation among European nations. Since individual member countries would not be able to withstand this budget strain, who other than the Twelve in a joint effort could help the 40 nuclear power stations of the Chernobyl type which are currently operating in the former Soviet empire? Similarly, in the race against the AIDS virus, he pointed out, "we will win more quickly if the Twelve work together." Christian Jacob who, in taking fourth place on the majority list, has taken leave from his role as president of the National Union of Young Farmers, took the opportunity yesterday to assert that the agricultural world is also "enthusiastic," and places its future in the European impetus. "The world is dangerous and France needs all the strength of Europe for its security and the security of French people," Dominique Baudis said. Although European security depends on employment, the fight against AIDS and countering nuclear dangers in the former Soviet bloc, this security must obviously be based on the limitation or even banning of old conflicts. New Beginning After employment, the mayor of Toulouse turned to the second theme of his campaign: A Europe of peace. The day after the celebrations to commemorate 8 May 1945, it was easy for him to reaffirm that developing European unity was begun after World War II in the hope of preventing further conflicts among the European nations. The war in Bosnia, Mr. Baudis stated, is there to remind us that nothing is ever fully achieved and that the ambition of the early Europeans -- Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet -- should not to be abandoned. Helene Carrere d'Encausse, the number two of Dominique Baudis' list, took up this subject, stressing that in East Europe the victory over the Nazis was won one day later, on 9 May 1945 when the Soviets entered Berlin. The academician, who is an expert on Russia and the "other Europe," wanted to regard this one-day "lag" behind the West as a symbol too. This original lag must now be made good and "Europe must be expanded," she explained, expansion in her view being "the fruit of the miracle of the collapse of the Berlin Wall." In "this Europe which needs to be rethought," Mrs. Carrere d'Encausse said, "France must play a decisive role" to remain faithful to the French founders of European unity and to the historical ties which bind our nation to the countries of East Europe. She cited the example of the Pact for Stability in Europe, which is so dear to Edouard Balladur, and stressed that France should now make "a new beginning" on this path of peace. "Our united list," Mr. Baudis also said, "is not focused on certain past divisions." Following this reference to the debate between supporters and opponents of the Maastricht Treaty, he stated that his "role" and that of his fellow candidates on the list "is not to be the advocates of the Brussels administration to the French people, but to be the French representatives in the Strasbourg Parliament in order to control Brussels more effectively." Jean-Louis Debre, the deputy secretary general of the RPR, once again stated that "the RPR unreservedly supports" the campaign led by Dominique Baudis. "It is a young team which is not focused on the past and which transcends the divisions of the past," he emphasized, addressing the Maastricht opponents within the RPR ranks. It was left to Yves Galland, president of the Liberal caucus in Strasbourg, to more specifically name the majority list's opponent: the Socialists. In particular he criticized the Socialist European deputies for systematically defending the Commission's regulatory powers. In the UDF and RPR, Mr. Galland declared, "we do not want an administrative Europe which interferes with and wants to have a say on everything."
