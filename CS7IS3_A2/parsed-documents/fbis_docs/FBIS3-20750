According to TV Polonia's "Wiadomosci" program, the new digital system will permit the transmission of encoded messages by telephone and radio within the Polish military and government, as well as to compatible foreign systems. The development of the encryption system was financed by the Ministry of National Defense and the Committee for Scientific Research. Deputy Communications Minister Marek Rusin told "Wiadomosci" that "this system is three times cheaper than similar ones used in the West, and its quality is competitive with NATO standards."
