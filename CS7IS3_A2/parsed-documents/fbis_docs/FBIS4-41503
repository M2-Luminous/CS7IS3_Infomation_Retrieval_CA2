They pointed out that the recently signed presidential decree runs counter not only to the norms of criminal procedure legislation but also to major provisions of Russia's Constitution. The message is signed by representatives of the Khabarovsk regional branch of the Economic Freedom Party, the territorial organisation of the Peasant Party, and the "Land and People" social foundation. The signatories believe that the presidential decree will not protect the population against organised crime but would bring society back to the times of universal angst, people's suspiciousness with regard to one another, and would lead to violations of human rights and unfounded repressions.
