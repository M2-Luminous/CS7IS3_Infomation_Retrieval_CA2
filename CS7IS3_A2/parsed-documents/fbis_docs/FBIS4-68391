Soon Russian citizens will also have the chance to make transactions on the international financial market through "their" banks. Yesterday Washington was the site of a meeting of a committee formed to establish a new international network of banks to serve the needs of Russian entrepreneurs for high-quality banking services abroad. There are plans to open the first "Russian" bank in the United States this year. The idea of establishing a network of "Russian" banks abroad was put forward by Aleksandr Konanykhin, former president of the All-Russian Exchange Bank, who has been in Washington since the widely-publicized scandal that erupted within that bank's highest-level administration the year before last. Taking part in the project along with Mr. Konanykhin are the heads of a number of Russian banks which have not yet been named publicly. The founders refused the services of foreign investors who offered to help finance the program. On the whole, the idea of establishing a network of "Russian" banks abroad is quite justified. Many Russian entrepreneurs are still unable to find a bank that suits them from the standpoints of quality of service and reliability. For a number of reasons (the unpredictable political situation, the high crime rate, and a certain mistrust of banks) it has been extremely difficult to find the desired combination of qualities in Russia. As for foreign banks, they are clearly not eager to work with Russian clients. Among the serious obstacles to the establishment of stable partnerships between a Russian client and a foreign bank are differences in business standards and the language barrier. On the other hand, the return on deposits offered by foreign banks (in the United States or Switzerland, for example) as a rule does not exceed 4-6 percent annually. Furthermore, Russian companies are often unable to manage their funds abroad efficiently. The new banking network, establishment of which will begin with the United States, England and Switzerland, is intended to solve precisely those problems. Firstly, even though a majority of personnel at the new banks will presumably be comprised of foreign specialists (who have a wealth of experience with banking in their own countries), the personnel who work directly with clients will know Russian. Secondly, Russian customers will be able to able to manage funds on account with those banks quickly and efficiently. The necessary instructions could be given by phone, telex or fax, and in the entrepreneurs' native language. Thirdly and finally, the new banks intend to offer their customers a relatively high interest rate on accounts (of course, not the same as in Russia -- 50-60 percent annually -- but at least two or three times higher than the world average). As envisioned by the project's organizers, the operations of "Russian" banks will involve not only depositing Russian companies' fund and managing their assets, but also financing foreign business transactions, participating in investment projects and providing accounting services. Specifically, during the first stage in the operations of the "Russian" bank in the United States, according to Mr. Konanykhin everything possible will be done to help attract Russian investment in the American economy (ownership of property in the United States is one of the essential conditions for obtaining a residence visa in that country). True, at this point it is unclear how Russian monetary oversight agencies will feel about the appearance of a new channel for capital flight from Russia.
