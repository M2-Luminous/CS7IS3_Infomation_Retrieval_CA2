The "armchair strategists" who are demanding indiscriminate strikes do not want to understand this, the foreign minister said sarcastically. Following two years of shelling by the Serbs of the six Bosnian cities which form the UN safe areas, what "political plan" are we talking about? For Mr. Juppe, the aim is first to secure a common stance by Russia, the United States, Europe, and the United Nations. The minister found the period of one month "rather long" for convening an international summit on Bosnia, which Washington and Moscow have agreed in principle and which has been welcomed with "satisfaction" by Francois Mitterrand. However, Mr. Juppe stressed that such a summit should be "conclusive;" it must be prepared by meetings at the level of ministers and experts. Use of Force Mr. Juppe added: "We are permanently on the edge of the abyss. We must move more quickly in seeking a political solution to the conflict." The theme has constantly dominated the many conferences (Geneva, London, or Athens) for two years, "peace plans" (Vance-Owen, Stoltenberg, and so forth), and other "joint action programs" which have been dreamed up by the international community to restore peace to Bosnia. We have seen how successful they have been. He admitted that NATO "was wrong" not to strike in Gorazde. But he also repeated that "there was no question of engaging in a military reconquest of Bosnia." Alain Juppe is therefore arguing for a veritable "sanctuarization" of the safe areas. The minister chided that "sanctuarization" is probably a word which would not have been used by the "armchair strategists." But these "armchairs" are also to be found in New York: in the UN Security Council where France has a permanent seat, with the right of veto. It is at least one year since that body was supposed to have defined a policy for Bosnia. By its Resolution 836 of 4 June 1993, the Council authorizes the use of force to protect the safe areas which it had instituted a month earlier. On 31 March 1993 (Resolution 816), the Council had also authorized the use of force to ensure respect for the "air exclusion zone" decreed six months earlier. This second resolution has been violated more than 1,000 times. One essential question remains unanswered. Is there also an "armchair policy?"
