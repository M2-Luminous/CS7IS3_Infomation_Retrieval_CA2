On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, state president, and chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Li Peng, State Council premier and Standing Committee member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, extended New Year's greetings to everyone present, a happy new year to the people of all nationalities in the country and the compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as Overseas Chinese, and cordial greetings to international friends who care for and support China's modernization drive. The banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People was brightly lit and decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Hu Jintao, and other party and government leaders, responsible comrades of all central party, government, Army, and mass organizations; retired veteran comrades who have contributed to socialist revolution and construction, officials from the democratic parties and patriotic figures without party affiliation, foreign friends who have helped China's socialist construction, and representatives from all walks of life in the capital -- totaling some 4,000 people -- attended the get-together. They exchanged festive greetings and celebrated the new year with jubilation. Jiang Zemin officiated over the get-together and Li Peng made a speech. [Li Peng's remarks were excerpted out of first version published in the 10 February DAILY REPORT] Li Peng said: The year 1993 was one in which we implemented in an all-round way the 14th National Party Congress guidelines and triumphantly marched along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We have made important achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. A new situation has emerged in all fields of work. He pointed out: The year 1994 will be one in which the national economy will maintain its momentum of sound development. It will also be a year crucial to our efforts to push forward reform. We must take as our guide Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, implement in an all-round way the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; safeguard political stability, and promote social progress in an all-round way. He said: The main tasks of reform this year are: 1) to effectively organize the implementation of major measures for fiscal, taxation, financial, investment, and other reforms, and to establish and improve the system of macroeconomic regulation and control; 2) to continuously change the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises and to seek effective ways to establish a modern enterprise system meeting the requirements of the socialist market economy; and 3) to appropriately advance price reform after giving full consideration to the tolerance of the different sectors of society, and to develop and perfect the market system. Li Peng emphasized: Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the overall interests of the work of this year. All fields of work must be subordinated to and serve these interests. We should promote the reform of the economic structure during the rapid growth of the national economy; at the same time, we should also maintain the steady growth of the national economy during the transformation of the economic structure. Therefore, we must conscientiously and properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. We should uphold the principle of "grasping two links at the same time and putting stress on both links." While concentrating our efforts on economic reform and development, we should continue to do a good job in strengthening the building of the CPC, and we should vigorously strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization. We should develop socialist democracy, strengthen the legal system, deepen the anticorruption struggle, and effectively solve public-order problems in a comprehensive way to create a favorable environment for reform and development. Li Peng said: Let us -- guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and led by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core -- unswervingly implement the party's basic line, strengthen the great unity among all nationalities in the whole country, be of one heart and one mind, wage hard struggle, and strive for new victories in socialist modernization!
