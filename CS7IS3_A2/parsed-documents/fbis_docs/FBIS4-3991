She was optimistic about the most-favored-nation [MFN] issue, saying that "no matter how Sino-American economic and trade relations develop in the future, the Chinese Government will try every possible means to maintain the prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong economy." Herbert Liang Hin--ying, president of the Chinese Manufacturer's Association, gave a banquet for Wu Yi, PRC minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and her party of six at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Central District yesterday. Wu Yi also listened to their views on trade issues, about which the attendees were concerned. Wu Yi pointed out at the banquet that she had met U.S. Government officials, Senators, Congressmen, and entrepreneurs during her visit to the United States. U.S. Government officials still stressed that a precondition for renewing China's MFN status was to improve its human rights situation. However, over 30 Senators, Congressmen, and entrepreneurs unanimously extended their support for the unconditional renewal of MFN. She said that during her visit to the United States, she found that most of the Senators and Congressmen had changed their stand on the issue of renewing China's MFN status, which was largely attributed to the policy of inviting U.S. Senators and Congressmen to visit China to observe the development situation there personally. She stressed that to settle trade problems between China and the United States, it is very important to enhance understanding between the two countries in all respects. Wu Yi stressed that no matter how the MFN issue develops, China will try every possible means to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, because this is the Chinese Government's paramount policy. She said: "After its return to China in 1997, we believe that Hong Kong's economy will achieve greater development than at present." Wu Yi said: "MFN treatment is the most appropriate agreement on developing trade relations reached between China and the United States since the establishment of diplomatic relations, as well as the foundation of economic and trade development between our two countries. It has never been a favor bestowed by one side on the other, but a mutually beneficial arrangement. Hence, I hope that the United States can handle this issue properly. It will be to the detriment of both China and the United States if our two countries confront each other on the issue of MFN treatment." As far as the United States is concerned, 200,000 people will become unemployed if China's MFN treatment is revoked, enterprises specializing in Sino-American trade will face severe damage, the competitive power of U.S. commodities in the China market will be greatly weakened, U.S. consumers will have to pay $14 billion more to buy commodities to replace Chinese products, and U.S. investment in China will be severely damaged. At present, there are over 12,000 U.S.-invested projects in China, and the total amount of investment agreements signed between the two countries exceeds $14.4 billion, while over $5.2 billion of capital has been invested. Not long ago, Paul Cheng Ming-fun, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, led a delegation to Washington to lobby for the renewal of China's MFN treatment. He pointed out at the banquet that there should not be any problem in renewing China's MFN treatment this year, but whether or not renewal will include conditions depends on the development of events. Raymond Chien Kuo-fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Industries, also went to Washington to lobby for renewal. He pointed out that after his visit to the United States, he felt that the U.S. Government intends to separate human rights from the MFN issue, but the key to the solution lies in how the U.S. Government devises an appropriate justification. Wu Yi said that Sino-American trade relations have always made progress along with friction. She said that although the two countries often squabbled with each other, Sino-American trade has still grown at an annual rate of 20 percent over the past few years. Hence, she believes that both sides will finally reach an agreement and join hands with each other in economic development and trade. However, she stressed that China would not be afraid even if the United States, due to certain political needs, confronted China on the MFN issue. She said: "The door of China is open wide to the whole world. At present, China has established economic and trade relations with 228 countries in the world, and we will unswervingly pursue the line of reform and opening up. The sky will not fall even without MFN." During her visit to the United States, Wu Yi also conveyed to U.S. officials and concerned figures China's stand on its reentry to the GATT. She pointed out that most of the 118 GATT members supported the resumption of China's membership of the GATT, but the United States had erected obstacles by saying that it did not recognize China as a developing country. Wu Yi said she could not accept the U.S. attitude of going back on its word. She said that as far as the current economic strength of China was concerned, it was unacceptable that China was considered as a developed country in the GATT talks. She said: "China has made a lot of efforts in applying to re-enter the GATT, and the central leadership is very enthusiastic about it, but we will not accept excessive demands at any cost." Among those invited to attend yesterday's banquet were Ulanmulun, deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, Chen Keqiang, director of the economic department of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, and Hong Kong industrialists and businessmen, such as Sir Quo-wei Lee, Paul Cheng Ming-fun, Raymond Chien Kuo-fung, Ngai Shiu-kit, Wu Man-han, Fang Heng, Lo Wing-chan, Yip Hing-chung, Wong Ka-chit, Ding Hok-shou, Shao Yan-chung, Chau Man, Yeung Sun-sai, Lo Man-sui, Luk Tsang-yong, and Ding Ng-shou.
