It has also caused serious idle productivity in the consumer goods industry as well as heavy stockpiling of finished products. The survey called for the early adoption of effective measures to coordinate economic development in urban and rural areas with the eventual aim of solving the growing serious economic contradictions between the urban and rural areas. The report revealed that from 1979 to 1984 when rural income increased to a great extent, purchases of expensive consumer goods including watches, bicycles, sewing machines, radio sets and black-and-white television sets showed a sharp gain. Urban income has since 1985 posted a rise and continued to grow at a rate higher than in rural areas. A shopping spree for high-grade consumer goods took place. Consumption of expensive items tended to go further in urban areas after 1988, but most consumers in rural area saw their consumption capability lagging behind their urban counterparts mainly because of their slow gain of income, thereby constituting a gap between the urban and rural areas regarding consumption patterns. The survey indicated that the per capita net income in rural areas was RMB [Renminbi] 784 in 1992. When taking into consideration price fluctuation, the rural income was equivalent to RMB 454.49 as it was in 1980 and to RMB 431.77 after taking into account a reduction of five percent from the income for expansion of production. It then struck a balance with the urban income of RMB 439.4 as it was in 1980. Judging from the figure, the current consumption capability in rural areas is just the same as that in the urban areas in the early stages of reform. This means that the rural areas have lagged behind for 12 years when compared with the urban areas in terms of consumption capability. The report suggested that the authorities should adopt measures to narrow the gap.
