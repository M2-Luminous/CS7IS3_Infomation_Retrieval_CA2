FBIS4-10173 "drlat068_i_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Nicaragua Assembly President on Talks With Gen Ortega Assembly President on Talks With Gen Ortega PA0804021294 Managua Radio Corporacion in Spanish 2310 GMT 7 Apr 94 PA0804021294 Managua Radio Corporacion Spanish BFN [News conference by National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman with unidentified reporters; place not given; from the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast; broadcast in progress -- recorded] [Text] [Reporter] ...Humberto Guzman, General Ortega emphatically stated he will not step down under the current circumstances. What happened? Did he negotiate with you? What did you talk about? [Guzman] I do not know if he emphatically stated he will not step down. He said he is perfectly aware of the temporary nature of his mandate; he knows it is for a fixed period of time. It seems to me he is aware of the temporary nature of that mandate. [Reporter] Do you agree with the military organization law being debated in the National Assembly? [Guzman] It is obvious that movements and deployments by the Armed Forces should be in accordance with the law. [Reporter] Ortega said an agreement could be reached within 15 days and that there are problems with the executive branch at present. What can you say about this? [Guzman] He told me there are various criteria regarding the military organization law, but it seems to me that these differences do not pertain precisely to the nature of his mandate. [Reporter] If the military organization law is not presented, if a consensus is not reached between the executive branch and Armed Forces, will the National Assembly present its own draft bill? [Guzman] According to the Constitu?ion, the National Assembly is the country's legislative branch, and it must do its duty. [Reporter] Will it? [Guzman] Of course. [Reporter] Are any draft bills ready? [Guzman) Yes, there are a few draft bills pertaining to military organization. I would like to say, however, that the National Assembly is not trying to create unproductive and useless crises in the country. We are not setting a deadline for the government to submit its draft bill. I must say, however, that we cannot wait indefinitely. We have promised the country that we would pass a military organization law during the first half of 1994, and the National Assembly will keep its word. [Reporter] Doctor, you stated emphatically that Gen. Ortega should step down before the year ends, as President Chamorro said. Do you still hold that opinion? [Guzman] I maintain that public posts should be temporary. That includes the post of Armed Forces chief. [Reporter] The general spoke of a 15-day deadline. Has the National Assembly reached an agreement with the general regarding that 15-day deadline? [Guzman] He told me he expects and hopes that within the next 15 days he and the cabinet will reach an agreement concerning a draft bill for the military organization law. [Reporter] The general said the Assembly cannot prepare a draft bill without reaching a consensus with the military. [Guzman] The National Assembly obviously consults with the people who are affected the most by any given law, just as it invites bankers to discuss the general banking law or to discuss the advantages or disadvantages of certain laws. Obviously it must do the same with the Armed Forces on the military law. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] working on certain topics, according to Gen. Ortega. [Guzman] That was the gist of the conversation. He told me there were difficulties with certain issues on which agreements had not been reached but that, in his opinion, this debate should not extend beyond the next two weeks. [Reporter] He spoke of (?vital) topics. (?What are those vital topics) [words indistinct] after eight hours of talks. [Guzman] They involve the Armed Forces' general functions, but I would like to say that I do not believe the deadline on the issue of Gen. Ortega's remaining in the Army were among the issues discussed.
