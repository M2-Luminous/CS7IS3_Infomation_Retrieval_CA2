Sa'id Leylaz, head of the public relations office and an expert of the Organization for Expansion and New Building of Iranian Industries, who spoke in the opening ceremonies of the Management Seminar for the Planning and Control of Cash Funds, made this statement and added: Hence, from foreign currency revenues alone, calculating 1,750 rials[R] to the dollar, the figures in the government budget proposed to the Majles will see a deficit of more than R6,600 billion. He added: Also, tax revenues for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] have been projected at R6.4 billion. However, considering the decrease in revenues, at least R1 trillion of the projected tax revenues will not be attained. Leylaz described a significant part of the proposed government budget for the government companies in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] to be questionable and said: Of the total R7,313 billion projected as banking loans to the government companies, about R5,630 billion (that is, 77 percent) is allocated to 15 giant government companies active in oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, steel, meat, and the Tavanir sectors, and the remaining R1,683 billion is set aside for about 2,000 other government companies.
