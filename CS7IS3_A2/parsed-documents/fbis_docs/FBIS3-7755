[Ganic] This has restored credibility to the United Nations. To put it briefly, this [word indistinct] is beginning to act more efficiently. This is not only good news for our state but also for other, even smaller states in the world, which have always seen the United Nations as a savior and have expected the organization's collective protection. Of course, this is a positive operation and proof that the United Nations -- once it decides to do something -- has the technology to implement (?its decisions). [Tenjovic] One of the two UN resolutions was implemented this morning. It was said yesterday that from now on, UN convoys would be setting out without previous notice and would be travelling with an armed escort throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Can we expect that in the future, the United Nations will have a more active attitude toward its own documents on Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] Yes, we can because the UN's credibility and historical responsibility was extremely threatened. Moreover, the carnage is immense and, therefore, the [UN] course has changed. The Serbian regime in Bosnia is actually using weapons that are killing civilians -- women and children -- destroying private houses, yet it does not possess a technology that could be a challenge to NATO planes or other NATO equipment. Therefore, the only real, effective force on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory -- in terms of intervention from the air and on the ground -- is the UN force, since we are observing the cease-fire. I expect that the Serbian regime, following an old recipe, will try to proclaim this to be another of its victories, and perhaps (?more significant breakthroughs) will occur. Perhaps these planes will be shot down not only over Banja Luka but also in places where they are maintained and where they prepare for their sorties. [Tenjovic] The message for the aggressor is clear. There can be no more joking with the United Nations. What would be the message for the Bosnia-Herzegovina citizens? [Ganic] Better times are coming -- Tuzla airport will soon be opened and convoys will come more often to (?encircled) territories. We cannot relax, however, because the aggressor will try [changes thought], you know that crimes against the civilian population are (?still going on) in all areas, the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army must be alert, it must defend its positions at all times, it must do everything to help things function on the ground, iron out problems between communes, in traffic.... However, we must also fight back with our efficiency in the sense [words indistinct] of the United Nations. Therefore, the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its borders are again on the international (?map), and the world realizes that partitioning a state, handing over a state to the aggressor whose objective is expansionism, simply leads to instability not only in these regions but to chaos in international diplomacy. Owing primarily to our Army's [word indistinct] on the ground, and partly owing to our political activity, we have succeeded in channeling many things. [sentence as heard] Things will now be somewhat easier, but you must know that we cannot afford to relax, [words indistinct].
