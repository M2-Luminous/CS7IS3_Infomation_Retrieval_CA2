The Russian Pacific Fleet has made a request for Japanese Government financial aid to construct ground facilities for its storage. The request was conveyed during an interview with two officers of the Russian Pacific Fleet by NHK's Vladivostok bureau. [begin recording] Danilyan, captain 1st rank, chief of the Radioactive and Chemical Defense Operations Department: Since this is a decommissioned tanker, we suspect that what we already have are micro leaks. In other words, radioactive waste leaks out and settles on the bottom of Bolshoy Kamen Bay. We suspect this is so. [end recording]. [Begin recording] Chishisenko, captain 1st rank, chief engineer of the Technology Bureau: Therefore, we believe the waste should be transferred to other containers in the shortest time possible. [end recording]. In connection with this, the Russian Pacific Fleet plans to construct by May this year ground facilities to store liquid radioactive waste at Sysoyevo Bay in the eastern part of Vladivostok, and other ground facilities to dispose of radioactive waste at Bolshoy Kamen Bay where tankers are presently berthed. The Russian Pacific Fleet, which estimates the cost of constructing the facilities at around $50 million, wants the Japanese Government to provide financial aid. The Russian Pacific Fleet feels a strong sense of crisis as the Russian Government is not showing any eagerness to use funds from Japan to resolve the radioactive storage issue. The request comes shortly before Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's 19 March visit to Moscow. It is believed to be aimed at explaining the situation to the Japanese Government before he arrives in Moscow.
