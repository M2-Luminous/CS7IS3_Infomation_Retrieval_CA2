In a statement signed by Chairman Tribuana Said and Secretary General Parni Hadi, PWI expressed its worries that demonstrations as a follow up of the recent closure of three Jakarta weeklies might only ruin efforts still being worked out by the association to solve the banning problem. PWI noted that demonstrations have been used as a means of expression of various aspirations which might further complicate things. Therefore, the association called on all of its members to always uphold previous statements which among others expressed concerns over the banning. However, at the same time, the statements expressed understanding as well over the government's reasons behind such a decision. PWI, the Tuesday's statement said, had encouraged the government to issue a new press publication permit so that all PWI members previously affiliated to the three banned weeklies would not be left without employment for too long. It further said that as long as legal and professional mechanism are upheld by all the concerned parties, revocation of press publication permit would not take place again in the future.
