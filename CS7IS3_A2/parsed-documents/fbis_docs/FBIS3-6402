Zhu said in an arrival statement: "We came here to expand friendly ties with the Korean people as well as the DLP. I think exchanges and cooperation between the Chinese Communist Party and the DLP will contribute much to the development of ties between the two countries. "President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China slated for March 26 will have important meaning in bilateral relations and will serve as momentum to lift the ties a step higher. Our party and people are anticipating President Kim's tour to Beijing wholeheartedly." Asked about the date of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Seoul, Zhu said, "I think Jiang will surely visit Seoul sometime and the issue will be decided through consultations between Kim and Jiang."
