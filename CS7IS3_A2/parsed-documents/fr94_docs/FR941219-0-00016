Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent a high pressure turbine (HPT) or low pressure turbine (LPT) disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure, accomplish the following: (a) Perform a one-time inspection for cracks and corrosion pitting in stage 1 and stage 2 HPT disks that on the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD) have completed 40% or more of their published Group ``A'' lives, in accordance with the procedures and schedule described in R-R Service Bulletin (SB) No. Sp72&hyph;1044, dated September 1992, at the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD.
