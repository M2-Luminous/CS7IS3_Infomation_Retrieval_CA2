FBIS3-28153 "dreas023__a94009" FBIS-EAS-94-023-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 February 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI Plans Multimedia Information Centers OW0302011894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 31 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0302011894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] plans to set up "multimedia information centers" in several parts of Japan in a bid to nurture the multimedia industry, which deals with combined technologies for computers, communications devices, and home electric appliances. The centers will collect various kinds of information in the form of images, voice, and letters, and provide them to local businesses and schools. Moreover, they will help nurture information specialists and will be the pillar of a new social infrastructure. MITI also plans to improve information networks in government offices and public research institutes at the same time as the establishment of the information centers. It has demanded that 30 billion yen [Y] be allocated in the third supplementary budget for establishing the centers and Y50 billion for improving information networks. Multimedia technology makes it possible for computers to process, send, and receive several kinds of data such as letters, figures, still images, and moving images at one time. The technology is expected to be used widely in such areas as education, information searches, and entertainment. MITI is to set up several multimedia information centers. Each center will collect information on regional culture and local businesses in the form of images and save them in the data base. It will be equipped with a device to search for the necessary information and project it onto a screen. The centers will also have a device to composite and edit images and voice information. This device will enable teachers to make their own teaching materials for such purposes as scientific experiments and English conversation, and enable businesses to produce image software such as advertisement pictures. They will also give lectures regarding multimedia as a means to nurture information specialists. Last year the government decided to establish a "multimedia support center." The decision, made as a measure to give all-around support to the development of multimedia software, was included in the government pump-priming package announced last year. The Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA), a MITI-affiliated organization, is currently in the course of selecting a location where the multimdea support center is to be built. The support center is to retain data amassed by the IPA. In the future, MITI will establish an information network connecting the multimedia support center and multimedia information centers so that localities will be able to make effective use of information from Tokyo. MITI has demanded the government appropriate Y5 billion in the third supplementary budget for expanding the functions of the support center. Moreover, it has demanded: 1) Y5 billion for creating a research data base for the New Energy and Industrial Development Organization (NEDO); 2) about Y4 billion for establishing LAN (local area network) in public research institutes; and 3) Y3 billion for developing educational-use software. According to some calculations, the domestic information and communications market will expand and be worth approximately Y67 trillion at the highest estimate by the year 2000. The figure is about three times larger than the current market value. MITI has concluded that to encourage recession-plagued private firms to invest in the new business, it is necessary to create circumstances favorable for the information-related business.
