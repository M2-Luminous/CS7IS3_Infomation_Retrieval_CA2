Her changed view follows an interview this morning by "The Echo" program with Kaarlo Pitsinki, party secretary of the Finnish Social Democrats in the Sixties, who himself also took part in the secret military cooperation between Finland and Sweden. Kaarlo Pitsinki, party secretary of the Finnish Social Democrats in the Sixties and provincial governor until 1982, told the "Morning Echo" that he himself had worked for Swedish military espionage in Finland directed against the Soviet Union. But he also confirmed that the chiefs of Finland's own espionage and counterespionage were those who handled the regular military intelligence cooperation with Sweden. "The Echo" has reported on this three times in the past, with the help of Swedish sources. Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn has three times put her own defense chiefs against the wall in order, as she says, to find out the truth. Her own defense chiefs have three times denied all forms of hidden military cooperation, even with Sweden. After this, they declared that if the information obtained by "The Echo" turned out to be true, it would be such a scandal that either the defense leadership or she herself would have to resign. This is what Kaarlo Pitsinki had to say about that this morning: [Begin Pitsinki recording] She is speaking against her better judgment (?or) she is in the wrong job. [end recording] [Larsson] This is what Elisabeth Rehn tells "The Echo" today. [Begin Rehn recording] I must again come back to what Pitsinki is saying, namely that I am evidently in the wrong job since I am not familiar with my own military and my own defense force. Yet, I would like to claim that among the defense ministers in Finland I am probably better informed than many of how we work. [end recording] [Larsson] Now, for the first time, the Finnish defense minister is also beginning to back down from her previously categorical position, which was that there was never any hidden military cooperation in any form, even with Sweden, during the Cold War. [Begin recording] [Rehn] I might perhaps not be surprised if one thing or the other occurred in the fifties between persons with different interests, but as for later periods, I would be very surprised if anything like that could be documented, if it happened. [Larsson] The sixties, seventies? [Rehn] Very surprised. [Larsson] But do you want to rule it out? [Rehn] I have learned that you must never say never about anything, but I would like to say that I find it extremely alien [words indistinct] claimed here, but as I say, I am no expert. I find it very strange to have to speculate about something I am definitely not an expert. Ask me about today's defense and that of the future and I will be very expert on that. [Larsson] And nothing is going on today? [Rehn] There is no established cooperation between our defense and foreign nations. Whether there is any individual -- no one can know. [end recording] [Larsson] That was Elisabeth Rehn. Kaarlo Pitsinki has himself many times wondered why official Finland continues to pretend that there was never any regular intelligence cooperation, even with Sweden. [Begin recording] [Pitsinki] I have been wondering about that, I have been wondering about precisely that. She must know about the regular cooperation. [Larsson] Why is it so important, then, to deny this cooperation? For the sake of the Russians? [Pitsinki] That is the only reason. [Larsson] Does anybody believe that this is unknown in Moscow? [Pitsinki] No, I don't think so, it is part of the act. [end recording]
