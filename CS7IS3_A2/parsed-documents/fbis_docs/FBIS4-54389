The result of this election showed the desire of the entire Burmese citizenry for democracy. The SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] military clique has denied this desire for democracy and continued to refuse to hand over state power to the elected civilian representatives. Moreover, the SLORC has also detained Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other parliamentarians and democratic activists. The SLORC military clique is not only violating human rights by arresting civilians as forced laborers, but it has also conducted cease-fire negotiations while isolating the ethnic and democratic forces with the help of some neighboring countries. The Thai Government is also strongly prohibiting the democratic activities of the anti-SLORC groups inside Thailand. The rank and file from the Defense Services, except the SLORC military leaders, are also suffering from poverty like ordinary civilians. In respect to [words indistinct] and various situations, the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma has made the following demands: Avoid giving legal recognition to the SLORC military clique and the National Convention organized by the clique, stop the SLORC human rights violations, find ways to hold (?a meeting) that will allow Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other nationality leaders to participate in it, and make SLORC comply with the UN General Assembly resolution on Burma and the International Human Rights Charter. The statement also said the American Government must lay down a clear-cut policy on Burma. It also called for the cancellation of Thailand's invitation to Burma to attend the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting, continued denunciation of the SLORC (?by countries which helped pass the UN resolution on Burma and by other countries), and urged the UN secretary general to appoint a special Burmese envoy soon.
