He considered the visit to four South American countries positive; he had a chance to explain the Cuban situation and to learn something of the situation on the continent. Upon returning to Havana, Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that this tour has permitted the opening of new channels in Cuban communications with Latin America, which he defined as the first Cuban priority in the world. Latin America is important to us, not only to the extent that we politically agree to a dialogue or trade, but also to the extent that we may find a way to develop our economic relations with the world, Robaina said. Answering a question on the debt of the American continent, Robaina said that most countries are today trying to renegotiate their debts, but that Cuba has neither the necessary money nor the possibilities of paying it, he said. Returning to the country last night after his successful tour of South America, Robaina said that among Cuba's possibilities, there is nothing more important than promoting the country's economic reactivation and increasing exports to help the country recover from its current situation. He added that although some government structures of the countries he visited wanted to discuss the debt issue, the businessmen decided to discuss other matters they considered more important. The Cuban foreign minister met with hundreds of businessmen who expressed interest in investment possibilities, legal and financial guarantees, and areas that could be negotiated with our country. Concerning his visit to Argentina, Robaina said that relations between Cuba and Argentina have not changed, especially because Cuba has remained unaffected by any public statement by Buenos Aires officials.
