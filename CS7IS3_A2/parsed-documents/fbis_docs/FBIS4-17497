The Russian delegation returned to Moscow without holding the concluding meeting with the Ukrainian delegation. [passage omitted] "We cannot agree to the staffs of the fleets of two states being based in the same town," Grachev emphasized at a news conference before flying for Moscow. The Russian defense minister believes that the Ukrainian side's position on the basing problem diverges from the accords that have been previously reached and with Leonid Kravchuk's statements. "Sevastopol should be the main base of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. We cannot and do not have the right to undermine its combat readiness as an integral part of the Russian Federation Armed Forces," Grachev declared. Although no specific documents were signed on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet, the sides reached fundamental accord on the parameters of dividing it up. The delegations agreed that the force composition of the Black Sea fleet numbers 833 combatant ships and vessels. According to preliminary calculations, 669 craft should go to Russia and 164 to Ukraine. Given the accords reached previously on a 50-50 division of the Black Sea fleet, Russia should pay Ukraine compensation for 252 ships. At the same time, Grachev pointed out, over the recent period Ukraine has unilaterally privatized 126 Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels that should have been taken into account when the fleet was divided up. Grachev also said that, apart from Sevastopol, the Russian Federation side intends to base its subdivisions in Balaklava, Feodosiya, Kerch, and Donuzlav. Inter alia, it is planned to locate about 70 percent of Russia's part of the fleet in Sevastopol, 10 percent in Donuzlav, 5 percent in Balaklava, and 7 percent each in Feodosiya and Kerch. When the talks started, the Ukrainian delegation was insisting that Russia could have only one base for its fleet, in Donuzlav. Unless the issue of bases for Russia's Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy is settled, it is inexpedient to start the process of dividing up the ships of the fleet, since without a land-based infrastructure it cannot exist, Grachev said in conclusion.
