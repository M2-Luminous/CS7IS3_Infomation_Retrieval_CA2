According to the ruling party, the fishing agreement will be instrumental in boosting our country's export revenues by $121 million. This and other arguments brandished from the floor by Deputy Florencio Acenolaza (PJ) [Justicialist deputy for Tucuman Province] were vigorously refuted by speakers representing the other blocs, during a heated debate that went beyond the framework of the said agreement. The blocs opposing the ratification of the agreement insisted that it be returned to the committee for further study, but the ruling majority managed to defeat this motion. The treaty, which was signed in 1992, was ratified with the opposition of the Radical Civic Union, the Socialist Party, the Grand Front, the Movement for Independence and Dignity, and the Democratic Progressive Party. Justicialist Deputy Rafael Flores said that "this agreement is not a panacea for the fishing industry, and its benefits will depend on the controls we manage to implement." [passage omitted] The ratification was carried by 119 votes in favor, 65 against, and two abstentions. The ruling party welcomed the result with applause.
