Amendments to the Citizenship Law have been passed, too. Vesna Burnik reports: [Begin Burnik recording] [passage omitted] Let us now concentrate on the most important decisions of today which will also have political consequences. The funds for education are known -- 27.5 billion tolars will be spent over the next six years on educational buildings, improvement of computer literacy, textbooks, school food, and foreign languages. [passage omitted] The State Chamber has irrevocably ruled that not more than 76.6 billion tolars will be spent on investments in defense over the next 10 years. It was also decided that the Defense Ministry will be allowed to spend a maximum of 8.8. billion tolars per year. This decision was supported by present deputies of the United List, the Liberal Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and the Ecological Party, who also opposed the government proposal of defense funds which would amount to slightly less than 85 billion tolars that will be mostly spent over five years. The government coalition has again split on this issue, as the Christian Democrats and Jansa's Social Democrats voted in favor of the government proposal and against the lower sum. [end recording]
