Regarding the northern territories, which is a pending issue between Japan and Russia, he explained his intention to maintain a hard-line stance, saying that "Russia will never hand over the territories." On the other hand, he proposed a plan to improve ties between Japan and Russia through economic and industrial cooperation, and by mutually allowing people of both countries to work in both countries. On the new Federal Assembly, which will start on 11 January, he explained his view that he would not insist on winning the post of the National Assembly (lower house) chairmanship, saying that he would deal with the new Federal Assembly session in a flexible manner. The following are questions and answers at the interview: [Ikeda] You were repeatedly making hard-line remarks regarding the northern territories. Do you still maintain the same attitude even after the elections? [Zhrinovskiy] We are not opportunists. We like the Japanese people. The Kuril islands have been and will continue to be Russian territory. If Japan wants to jointly develop the islands, we will welcome it. However, we will never hand over the territories to Japan. We must not do that. We must not hand over Karelina to Finland, Kishinev (capital of Moldovia) to Romania, and Tajikistan to Afghanistan either. [Ikeda] Are you against the idea of improving ties between Japan and Russia? [Zhrinovskiy] We do want to cooperate with Japan by all means if it wants to have joint economic development with us. We will buy unlimited number of Mitsubishi, Honda, and Toyota cars. We can sell airplanes in return. Is it not true that Japan needs our coal and oil? Moreover, we would like to allow 100,000 Russians to study in Japan and 100,000 Japanese in Russia. We will make Japanese language the second mother tongue on the Kuril islands so that the Japanese people will be able to freely visit and work there. We should create such an environment. We want Japan to create an environment in which Russian people will be able to freely work in Hokkaido. Why do you have to stick to the territorial issue? If your goal is to catch fish, then we will catch fish together and eat it together. [Ikeda] What are you going to demand at the new Federal Assembly meetings, which will start on 11 January? [Zhrinovskiy] We won the election. This victory is enough for me. I will be pleased to accept the post of the lower house chairman if it is offered to me. However, I will not insist on it. We are preparing bills, designed to actually improve the domestic economic situation, for the new assembly session. [Ikeda] What about the possibility of cooperating with other parties? [Zhrinovskiy] Basically, we do not have close ties with other parties because they are either radical democrats or leftists. Middle-roaders, like us, should not make compromises with them. On the contrary, radical political groups, like them, should make compromises with us. However, we are ready to cooperate with all forces. [Ikeda] Some people are talking about relations between the LDP and the KGB. [Zhrinovskiy] They are telling complete lies. I was acting as an interpreter. But, they distorted the story. I am merely a Russian citizen. They are also saying that my father was a Jew. It is also lie. Everything they are saying is propaganda designed to distort what we legitimately won.
