In a telephone message to the South, North Korea said that at the contact they would deliver messages recently adopted by a joint session of the North Korean Government, political parties and social organizations. The messages are addressed to the South Korean Government, political parties, social organizations and some individuals, it said. A Unification Board official hinted that the South would not send a liaison official to Panmunjom as suggested by the North. "The message is apparently part of their united front strategy. A dialogue for political propaganda's sake is something not desirable," the official said.
