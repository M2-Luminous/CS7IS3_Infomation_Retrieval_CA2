The hint came as pressure intensified on Sinn Fein to issue a definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration. The leading republican Martin McGuinness yesterday welcomed the Government's response to Sinn Fein's 20 questions. He called it "a small step in the slowly evolving peace process," and said Sinn Fein's reply would come within "a few short weeks." But while Mr McGuinness said he did not know whether an IRA ceasefire would result, the Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, called for an immediate cessation of violence by republicans and loyalists. In a significant statement aimed primarily at loyalist paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux said the declaration made no distinction between various terrorist groups, which would become eligible -- three months after a permanent renunciation of violence -- to enter exploratory talks on participation in the democratic process. Amid reports that senior Unionists have been involved in secret talks with loyalist paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux denied knowledge of "high-level" contacts, but admitted that party representatives had met "people close to the paramilitaries." The Belfast Telegraph reported that Unionist politicians hoped the Combined Loyalist Military Command, an umbrella body of the illegal Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force, would consider entering talks. Mr Molyneaux said it would be a small step for the loyalist paramilitaries to enter the democratic process. "There is no bar now to any paramilitary body terminating violence after a period of three months entering into exploratory discussions." Sources close to the loyalist leaderships said that Mr Molyneaux's request would be given serious consideration and hinted at a "gesture." But they also said they were studying the Government's response to Sinn Fein's questions and expressed reservations about Dublin's involvement.
