Jiang Chunyun gave a speech at the gathering. He said: The past year was very unusual. It was a year during which we advanced courageously on the road to socialist modernization. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, people across the province conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, deepened reform, expanded the degree of opening up, and actively promoted the building of two civilizations, thus giving rise to an excellent situation of political and social stability, economic development, and invigoration in all fields of work throughout the province. This is the result of the united efforts and hard work of the broad masses of party members and cadres across the province to overcome serious natural disasters and all sorts of difficulties and to advance and make progress in a pioneering spirit. Let me extend festive greetings and cordial regards to the broad masses of party members and cadres working on all fronts on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: This is a crucial year for comprehensively promoting reform and building the socialist market operational mechanism. The tasks will be glorious but arduous. During this year we should rally more closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, persist in taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guidance, act in line with the work principles defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council, deeply implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic structure, and maintain a sustained, speedy and sound national economic development. It is necessary to realistically strengthen the building of the party, clean politics, spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system, maintain political stability, and promote a comprehensive social progress. In the course of building the two civilizations, all levels and all trades and professions across the province should be subordinated to and serve the overall situation of seizing the opportunity to comprehensively deepen reform, expanding opening up, and promoting the development of the socialist market economic structure, further emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, engage in arduous struggle, exert vigorous efforts to make the country strong, and strive to win a new victory in socialist modernization with new ideas, a new attitude, a new work style, and new achievements.
