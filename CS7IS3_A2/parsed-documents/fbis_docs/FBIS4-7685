Here is a telephone report by our correspondent, Leke Musolli: [Musolli] At the beginning of today's news conference, the president of the republic of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, welcomed the visit of Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha to Great Britain and considered it as very important, as it focused on the situation in the region and particularly on the grave situation in Kosova. Our political project on Kosova, which is supported by all the Albanian political parties, is clear and derives from the 1991 plebiscite on Kosova as independent and neutral state. Rugova said that despite attempts to prevent the internationalization of the Kosova question, even this week Kosova was at the center of attention of the international community and forums. On this occasion, he greeted the report of Amnesty International, which objectively describes the torture and recent imprisonments in Kosova and will help the world to understand the repressive and police situation in Kosova. Rugova also greeted the report of the Helsinki Committee of the U.S. Congress on human rights and the bill presented by U.S. Congressmen Angle and Molinari, which seeks a solution for Kosova, precisely to stop the repression in Kosova. Rugova also welcomed all the rallies of Albanians all over Europe, which helped to sensitize people to the Albanian question. At today's news conference, Rugova informed reporters about the police repression that the Serbian authorities has recently been causing in Kosova. Asked whether there are any indications of an Albanian-Serb dialogue, Rugova stressed that for the moment there are no such initiatives, but added that the Albanian side is ready for unconditional dialogue, internationally supervised. Another reporter asked Rugova how he would comment on the threats by a parliamentary group from the Russian Duma, members of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party, who visited Kosova a few days ago. Rugova said that he considered such threats as a manifestation of Russian extremism but expressed his conviction that it did not present any serious problem. On the contrary, such forces are distressing for Yeltsin's power itself. At today's news conference, the president of Kosova welcomed the agreement on the cease-fire between the representatives of Knin and the Croatian authorities. However, no parallel can be made between the problem of Knin and the Kosova question, the president of the republic of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, said at the end of today's news conference.
