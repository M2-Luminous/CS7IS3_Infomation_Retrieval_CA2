This directive established the procedure for merging and consolidating check investment funds which should be implemented in coordination with the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia or with the corresponding committee on administration of state property which has issued the license to the fund. This directive practically removes the problem of bankrupt funds which for one reason or another are unable to continue their activity in the future but have obligations to their shareholders who have entrusted them with their privatization checks. In practice this directive implements the procedure for coordination of any reorganization of check investment funds with the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia or its territorial agency regarding questions of deciding the future fate of the fund and its shareholders, thus protecting their rights as stipulated by law. The text of this directive is given below. Directive No. 44-r of 10 January 1994: On Procedure for Coordinating the Reorganization of Check Investment Funds In compliance with point 45 of the Statute on Specialized Privatization Investment Funds Accumulating Privatization Checks of Citizens, approved by Edict No. 1186 of the President of the Russian Federation of 7 October 1992, the following procedure shall be established for reorganizing check investment funds: 1. The reorganization of the check investment fund (hereinafter--fund) during the first three years of its activity may be effected only through merging or consolidation in coordination with the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia or the corresponding committee for administration of property that issued its license. Moreover, all funds participating in the consolidation or merger shall be reorganized. 2. The reorganization of the fund shall entail a transfer of the rights and responsibilities of the fund to its successor. 3. Reorganization in the form of merger shall be effected through merger of the assets of one fund and the assets of the other with an equivalent exchange of shares and merger of the balance sheets. Reorganization in the form of consolidation shall be a unification of the controlling blocks of shares of the funds and transfer of the property rights and responsibilities of each of them to the fund that appears as a result of the consolidation. 4. In order for the question of the reorganization of a check investment fund to be considered, the applicant must submit to the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia or the corresponding committee for management of property the following documents: --an application with an indication of the justification and conditions for the reorganization signed by the chairman of the council of directors; --the license issued to the fund by the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia or the Committee on Administration of State Property; --the resolution of the general meeting of shareholders concerning reorganization of the fund adopted by a simple majority of votes of those present at the meeting of shareholders with a quorum; --the original founding documents of the reorganized fund; --properly prepared copies of agreements with the manager and the depository of the reorganized fund; --a financial report of the reorganized fund as of the moment of the submission of the application on a form approved by the Statute on Specialized Privatization Investment Forms Accumulating Privatization Checks of Citizens, and verified by an independent auditor. The aforementioned documents shall be submitted by the funds participating in the consolidation or merger. If funds are consolidated, the existing licenses of various committees on administration of state property and an application from them shall be submitted to the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia. In the event the documents or applications are not submitted at the same time or if even one of the aforementioned participants submits documents in violation of the requirements enumerated above, the applications of all the funds participating in the reorganization shall be returned without being considered. 5. The State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia or the committee on administration of property shall be obligated to consider the application and make a decision on acceptance or rejection of the reorganization of the fund no later than 25 days from the day the application is submitted. In exceptional cases this time period may be extended by a decision of the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia or the committee on administration of property that considers the application. When handing down the aforementioned decision the committee shall conduct an inspection for: a) observance of the rights and legitimate interests of the shareholders of the reorganized funds, taking into account the restrictions envisioned in point 4 of the Statute on Specialized Investment Privatization Funds; b) possible concealment by the funds of the result of their reorganization of their bankruptcy or credit indebtedness. In the event of the discovery of such cases the committee on administration of property shall have the right to refuse to allow the fund to reorganize. 6. The consent for reorganization of the fund shall be documented by a directive of the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia or the corresponding committee on administration of property, which shall reflect the following issues: --the annulment of the license and the public prospectus for emission of the consolidated or merged funds; --merger of the assets and balance sheets of the fund with the corresponding instruction to the reorganized fund; --time periods and procedure for exchange of shares of the consolidated or merged funds; --the corresponding changes and additions to the founding documents and also, if necessary, to the prospectus for emission of the reorganized fund; --forwarding of the original founding documents of the fund with changes and additions to organs that conduct state registration. 7. Upon receipt of permission to reorganize, the fund must within 10 days: a) submit to state registration organs the corresponding application for making changes and additions to the founding documents and a copy of the directive on its reorganization; b) notify shareholders in writing of its merger or consolidation and publish the corresponding notification of this in the open press. The notification and public notice of the reorganization must indicate the location of the successor of the fund and the form (means) of exchange of shares or certificates of the reorganized fund for shares or certificates of its legal successor. 8. The committee on administration of state property must, within three days after the publication of the directive specified in point 6, send to the Main Administration on Invested Funds of the State Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia the following information in order to make changes in the consolidated register of investment funds: --the name of the consolidated fund; --the number and date of the cancellation of the license; --the form or reorganization; --information about the fund to which it has been joined; --a copy of the directive. In the event of a consolidation, information is provided on all consolidated funds and the newly created fund resulting from this consolidation. 9. The fund shall be considered reorganized from the moment it is removed from the state register. [Signed] First Deputy Chairman A.I. Ivanenko
