FR941206-0-00069 FR941206-0-00011 Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities because: (1) In all industry categories except the contract sterilization industry, there is not a substantial number of small entities, and (2) contract sterilizers should experience an increase in demand for their services as other facilities switch from in-house to contract sterilization (see Docket Entry II&hyph;A&hyph;22). As a result, contract sterilizers will not be adversely impacted by this rule.
