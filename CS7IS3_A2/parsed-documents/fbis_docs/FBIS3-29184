After the military dictators came to their doom a so-called civilian-led regime emerged. The so-called civilian-led regime has babbled about so-called military reform and the like. However, the so-called military reform is nothing but an ostentatious slogan, and the puppet army still remains a colonial, hired mercenary army for outside forces. The prerogative of supreme command of the puppet army is still in the hands of the United States, and even the puppet army officers' manual books stipulate that the puppet army's imaginary enemy is precisely the North, following the U.S. strategy of aggression against Korea. There are many armies in the world. However, there is no army in the world, the prerogative of supreme command of which has been completely divested of by outside forces and the nation of which has been prescribed as an enemy. A newspaper published by the Korean residents in a foreign country wrote: The South Korean puppet army is not a national army but an antinational army because it is the army which does not serve the interests of the nation but exists only for outside forces. Even a former commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea himself confessed that the South Korean Army is a hired mercenary army of the United States, that it is an army protecting U.S. investments in South Korea, and that it is an army which can bear maximum effectiveness with minimum expenses. The South Korean puppets themselves admit that their prerogative of supreme command has been divested of and that their army is nothing but a hired mercenary army controlled by outside forces. That the South Korean puppet army is aiming its rifle at fellow countrymen is because it has become cheap cannon fodder for outside forces. The South Korean puppet Army was used and is being used as a shock brigade for outside forces' aggression overseas because it is a colonial, hired mercenary army. According to a recent report of the South Korean Munhwa Broadcasting System, the South Korean puppets dispatched as many as 312,850 South Korean puppet troops to Vietnam during the Vietnam War as demanded by the United States, and among them over 4,600 troops were killed in vain. Of course, this was the figure reduced to the minimum by the puppets. How can these hired mercenary troops which opposed fellow countrymen and took part in slaughtering another nation according to the aggression policy of outside forces be regarded as an army for the country, for the nation, and for the people? The South Korean puppets are propagating that although it had the disgrace of being the plunderer of power in the past the army will not meddle in politics in the future nor will it be used as riot- quelling troops [chinapkun] for political purposes. However, the people never believe this. The Kim Yong-sam ring clamored that the puppet army should not become riot-quelling troops. However, this is, in fact, an out-and-out lie. The Kim Yong-sam ring is brutally suppressing those people calling for reunification and, because of this, has been branded as a civilian-led fascist ring. The civilian-led dictatorial elements have gone so far as to designate the people calling for the right of survival as the target of their suppression. Today the people still vividly remember the fact that the previous South Korean dictators barbarously murdered thousands of Kwangju citizens by mobilizing the puppet army troops when the United States issued them directives to brutally suppress the Kwangju resistance in a bid to rescue the colonial fascist ruling system from a crisis and to prevent civilians from attacking its (?nuclear) base in Kwangju. As his predecessors did, traitor Kim Yong-sam is playing the role as a running dog and a guard protecting the colonial rule by outside and nuclear weapons storehouses. The puppet traitor committed the treacherous crime of selling the rice market, which is closely related to the destiny of the six million South Korean farmers, to his U.S. boss in return for his so-called international cooperative system formed to do harm to fellow countrymen. He is now brutally suppressing the struggle of farmers and young students against the opening of the rice market. There is no guarantee that this pro-U.S. flunkyist and national traitor will not trigger a war against fellow countrymen by mobilizing the puppet army. There is also no guarantee that he will not impose again such a bloody tragedy as the Kwangju incident on the South Korean people. Officers and men of the South Korean Army: You cannot escape the digraceful destiny of being the colonial, hired mercenary troops as long as a pro-U.S. flunkyist traitor and a nation-seller such as traitor Kim Yong-sam keep hold on power in South Korea. Officers and men of the South Korean Army should not be treated contemptuously as colonial, hired mercenary troops for outside forces, being forced to endure a disgraceful destiny, but should struggle against [pandae haeso ssawoya] outside forces and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, their running dog, to regain the divested national sovereignty and to seek the kind of life a human being should lead.
