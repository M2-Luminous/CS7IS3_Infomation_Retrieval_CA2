He joined the Nabil Bura'i-led organization in 1967. Ayman al-Zawahiri was also one of the group's cadres. Al-Hillawi was the fourth defendant in the case known as the Technical Military Academy case in 1974 but he was acquitted. He then participated in establishing an organization that attacked a foreign consulate in Alexandria in 1977. Al-Hillawi was sentenced to seven years. But he escaped and spent 16 years abroad. It was reported then that he was one of the major financiers of terrorist operations in Egypt. He was arrested by the Saudi intelligence service in May and is now a guest of the Turah Prison. We met him there. He said he had renounced terrorism. He declared his new ideas renouncing terrorism and refuting the ideas of those who kill innocent men, women, and children. Salah: What are the motives behind your statements condemning terrorism and lashing out at the group of which you were a principal founder? Al-Hillawi: My main motive was that I wanted to defend the true image of Islam. The current actions of these groups, which they attribute to Islam, distort the image of Islam and the Muslims. It is one of my religious dutiesm -- I am a graduate of the al-Azhar University -- to tell the truth and show that these actions are not linked with the pure religion, Islam. These groups, which carry out acts of violence, should not be attributed to Islam. True, we called on people in the past to abide by and defend religion but we never asked them to form organizations or jihad. At first, we called for jihad in defense of Egypt, not to spread corruption in it. Religion demands that we carry out jihad to promote the country and defend sanctities. Jihad is not sowing discords or shedding blood unjustly. That is sedition. How could I kill Muslims or even non-Muslims who are defenseless and who are not our enemies? How could I kill them and still call it jihad? That is a crime. Salah: Is it not strange for you to say this when you were one of the founders of this movement and the principal financier when you were abroad? Al-Hillawi: I took part in founding the movement that called for real jihad, not for shedding blood falsely. How could we approach the people now with their hearts imbued with indignation after satan sowed sedition and used some groups affiliated with Islam? How could we face the people now that every bearded person and every veiled person reflects the image of a treacherous killer? As for the talk about me financing these groups, this is wrong. It has never taken place. Salah: But what made you stay quiet all these years? What made you declare these new ideas after your arrest? Were you subjected to specific pressures, for example? Al-Hillawi: I was not silent. But travel enabled me to survey the situation carefully. I wrote a book in which I refuted their ideas. I recorded this opinion and several sermons made in Saudi Arabia on tape. I swear that my writings and announcements were not shaped under pressure. I also swear that I offered nothing in return for my release from prison. All my ideas have been prompted by what I have seen of ugly actions, which they attribute to Islam falsely. I know they say I have become weak and sick. But this is not true. It is only the horror that is inflicted on every preacher and ourselves by the shedding of the blood of Muslims or non-Muslims. God forbids such actions. Salah: In your view, what has led these groups to all this violence and terrorism? Al-Hillawi: They have never consulted the ulema but followed their own deficient interpretations until they reached the current state of confusion. Had they gone back to the scholars and those who issue religious decrees in Egypt, they would not have reached this state. They sought their own interpretations although they are not qualified to do so and cited legal religious texts in the wrong situations. For example, they kill innocent people with their explosions and assassinations and then say they did not mean to kill them. If we ask them what these people did to be killed, they would reply that they were killed by mistake and that the killers will be made to answer and judged [by God] according to their intentions. Take the verse: "If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than) wrongdoers" [Koranic verse]. This is the verse on which they establish most of their ideas and deeds. They became so general in their interpretation that they thought simply that they are the Muslims and the rest are infidels. This is wrong because the correct interpretation of the verse is that any one who does not accept God's rule, thinks there is a better rule, and says so is an infidel. But even the rulers of Egypt and Arab and Islamic countries do not say this. Everyone, including the rulers, knows that Islamic shari'ah is the greatest and most revered thing. They always declare this but believe that there are circumstances that impede its implementation to the full. Such circumstances may be acceptable to some and not to others and this is something that should be interpreted, because it is a contentious issue and no judgment can be passed on it in this unjust manner. Salah: They do not only level charges against the rulers but also describe the entire state as ignorant. Al-Hillawi: This is an erroneous statement because Imam al- Shafi'i [late Muslim scholar] said every country conquered by Muslims will remain an Islamic state until doomsday. How can this be said today? All the Arab countries are Islamic and the people in them are Muslims and non-Muslims, as is the case in every society where there is good and bad. Even these societies include the reformer and the corrupt and the believer and the hypocrite. Everyone is judged by his deeds. Egyptian society in particular is an Islamic one and no one can say it is not. Salah: Do you have an alternative to the call for change under these circumstances? Al-Hillawi: I have no Islamic line except to follow the ulema and listen to them. Talk of senior ulema must be heeded. As for gathering around youths who have imperfect culture and think they truly understand religion, any act they commit is imperfect and closer to ignorance. All Muslims must follow the renowned ulema who are known for their knowledge and piety. Salah: Do you think the groups that practice violence in Egypt are financed by foreign states? Al-Hillawi: God knows. Some quarters may want to harm popular activity in Egypt. I wonder from where those groups brought the money and weapons. Undoubtedly, some individuals or groups have an interest in spoiling our affairs. I believe there are many sources of finance but I have no details. Salah: Are there people in the movement who have begun to accept the ideas and joined your call? Al-Hillawi: Yes, thank God. There are hundreds, including 'Abd-al-Nasir Durrah, who was one of the suspects in al-Jihad incidents in 1981 and who was sentenced to five years in prison. The number is increasing daily. Hundreds of members abroad are convinced. But there is a need to spread the call and expand the new understanding. Those people felt they were breaking free of wrong concepts and realizing that right is different from what they thought. Many young men who effectively understood the truth have begun to explain things to others and to call them to the right path. If we are given a better chance, these groups' problems will be solved, God willing. Salah: What is your comment on recent political assassinations and attacks against tourism committed upon orders from leaders abroad? Al-Hillawi: Like the Islamic ulema, I see in them a kind of corruption on earth; they are religiously unacceptable. Not one religious scholar condones this corruption. It is against the shari'ah and a product of inept, misleading minds. I think those movements were good at first. But I ask them now: Are you emulating any model from our virtuous early Muslims? I challenge them to say yes. Salah: You said the ulema have a role to play in expanding the understanding of religion but those groups do not recognize the ulema; they refuse to listen to them and they describe them as government ulema. Al-Hillawi: Their talk of government ulema is wrong and misleading. Egypt is full of honest and virtuous ulema. If they do not listen to the advice of the ulema, they will continue to listen to the ignorant and their sedition will continue. Of course, there is a problem here, because they view themselves as mujahidin, and their dead as martyrs. They consider their displacement a kind of a patience along the road of jihad. This is a real problem. It is our duty to be patient with them and to lead them to the right path. Salah: How? Al-Hillawi: What is happening in Egypt is a kind of sedition among Muslims; there must be a conciliation and a truce. There must be room for dialogue and the ulema must have the chance to explain what is right and to calmly let those people know that they are far removed from God's shari'ah. If they still reject this explanation, this understanding, and this willingness for reform, then they must be confronted with all the methods they deserve! We discuss the issue from a religious point of view; we discuss religious texts and how they should be understood. If they answer in a political or an argumentative manner, then their arguments are unacceptable. I knew that some of them, such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, wanted to respond to my statements. Al-Zawahiri is a man of medicine, a surgeon who is not specialized in religious texts; let him talk about medicine, not religion. If he mixes medical surgery with religious texts, the bleeding will be endless. I tell al-Zawahiri: Fear God. Enough corruption on earth. Salah: Aren't you afraid of an attempted assassination in the context of their desire to continue the violence under the slogan of "preserving the propagation?" Al-Hillawi: They know I say this out of love and concern for them. There is no hatred between us and I explain to them what is right and that what they are doing has benefited no one except the enemies of Islam and Egypt both inside the country and abroad. By the way, I was subject to an assassination attempt at the hands of Shukri Mustafa, the founder of the Repudiation and Renunciation Group, inside jail 18 years ago. God saved me. I believe the devil might applaud them for this act but it will only bring them evil in this world and punishment in the next. I am not afraid of saying what is right. Almighty God says: "Ye who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin" [Koranic verse] Salah: Do you think the Kaliphate system applies now? Al-Hillawi: This is one of the shari'ah's duties and the way to this is as the ulema define. But the Muslim ulema did not speak about this clearly and we follow them. It is a duty, if possible, like pilgrimage. If it is not possible, God does not demand that anyone do what is beyond his capability. Numerous groups advocated the reinstatement of the Kaliphate system and the call was right. But who gave them the mandate to set up such groups for this purpose? This is a violation of the rights of all Muslims and such a mandate cannot be used without consulting the authoritative people. Establishing groups to achieve this goal is impermissible, even the Muslim Shaykh Ibn-Taymiyah [former prominent Islamic scholar] did not call for setting up such groups. How do you compare such groups with the organizations of Ibn- Taymiyah, Imam al-Shafi'i, and Ahmad Bin-Hanbal [former Islamic scholars]? I reiterate to them: "Show me just one similarity with the deeds of the good ancestors." Where are the organizations of the prophet's companions, imams, and ancestors? These are ideas they grasped as they emulated other world organizations, while Islam does not advocate this at all. Salah: Do you intend to continue advocating these ideas after you leave prison? Al-Hillawi: I intend to continue until the young men know their rights and duties. I will flatter no one in this regard -- be they senior officials, rash youths, or any others. Returning to what is right is better than pursuing ignorance and confusion and I implore God to guide these people to righteousness. Salah: Do you believe they still have the strength to continue? Al-Hillawi: I believe many of them will soon realize what is right and anyone who remains outside this genuine understanding will have no value or effect. Salah: How do your inmates who are members of these groups treat you in prison? Al-Hillawi: Thanks be to God, all those I have spoken to were convinced by the talk. I asked some factions to introduce their ulema and cadres so that they might be confronted but they were afraid of such confrontation and rejected debate and discussion. Salah: Do these factions include anyone you believe to be more right and closer to understanding? Al-Hillawi: These factions are many and all their differences and disputes resemble pre-Islamic contentions. They are personal and tribal. The best one is the one who decides to heed only the words of the ulema.
