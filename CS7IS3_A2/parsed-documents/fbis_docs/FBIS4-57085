In a message delivered to the Cuban leader by state government officials upon arriving in this city, Franco recalled his personal meeting with Castro during the third Ibero-American summit of 1993 and expressed his satisfaction that they will meet again during the fourth meeting of this forum to be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June. In a reply note, Fidel Castro was deeply grateful for the welcome given by his counterpart and noted he and the delegation accompanying him felt good to be surrounded by the warmth and unrivaled friendship of the Bahia people. I carry with me the unforgettable memory of our days in this city that hosted the Latin American summit, and I will gladly greet you again in Cartagena de Indias, the statesman noted. My stay has been brief but my fondness for this friendly, exceptional, and extraordinary country will be eternal, Castro added.

They discussed the U.S. embargo on Cuba, which the Brazilians flatly rejected, matters of bilateral interest, and other issues. The Brazilian media highlighted the brief visit by the Cuban head of state, who has visited this South American country on three previous occasions.
