ACTION: Proposed rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This proposed rule invites comments on the establishment of salable, reserve, and export percentages for California almonds received by handlers during the 1994&hyph;95 almond crop year, which commenced on July 1, 1994. Based on the recommendation of the Almond Board of California (Board), the agency which locally administers the almond marketing order, and other available information, it is proposed to establish salable, reserve, and export percentages of 90 percent, 10 percent, and 0 percent, respectively. This proposed rule is authorized under the marketing order for almonds grown in California and is intended to promote orderly marketing conditions and avoid unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices. DATES: Comments must by received by September 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this proposal. Comments must be sent in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456, FAX (202) 720&hyph;5698. Comments should reference the docket number and the date and page number of this issue of the Federal Register and will be available for public inspection in the Office of the Docket Clerk during regular business hours. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathleen M. Finn, Marketing Specialist, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, Room 2536&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;1509, or FAX (202) 720&hyph;5698; or Martin Engeler, Assistant Officer-in-Charge, California Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102&hyph;B, Fresno, CA 93721; telephone: (209) 487&hyph;5901, or FAX (209) 487&hyph;5906. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 981 [7 CFR Part 981], both as amended, hereinafter referred to as the ``order'', regulating the handling of almonds grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposal is not intended to have retroactive effect. The proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempt therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary will rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 115 handlers of almonds who are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately 7,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California almonds may be classified as small entities.
