Sponsored by the Central People's Broadcasting Station (CPBS) and the State Language Commission (SLC), "The Third National Putonghua Broadcasting Contest" is being staged to further spread the standard tongue and eliminate communication difficulties between people speaking different dialects. The contest will be open to participants from 30 provinces and regions. Each will be allowed to put forward two candidates to compete in the finals to be held in Beijing in October. Entrants from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will also take part in the competition. Due to the huge expanse of the People's Republic, many regional dialects exist. With the development of a more integrated national economy, the problems created by people speaking local dialects has become ever more conspicuous. "As the economic and personnel exchanges among regions increase, the need to learn Putongua has become acute!" said Zhong Zheming of the SLC, noting that many individual businessmen are trying to standardize their oral ability. Furthermore, with the advent of speech from computer software, Putonghua is also needed as the basis for communications between machines and men.
