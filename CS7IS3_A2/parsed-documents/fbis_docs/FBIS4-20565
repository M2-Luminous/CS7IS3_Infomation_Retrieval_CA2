Kuriyama, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.] [Text] In this paper, we present existing and potential applications of CFD in designing automobiles by supercomputers, and outline the necessary CFD methodology. In recent years, CFD has been used to better understand internal and external aerodynamic flows, the intake and exhaust flows of engines, and air circulation within cars. In this paper, we also discuss what the requirements are for designing automobiles with CFD, and finally, say something about future trends and outlooks. 1. Introduction In 1986, the automobile industry in Japan started using supercomputers to assist in doing structural analysis and collision analysis. In the last few years, a lot of companies have started using CFD (computational fluid dynamics) in areas where large memories are involved. The reason for this we believe is that collision/safety analysis has reached more or less the same level in companies, so companies are now turning their attention to the use of CFD in R&D on aerodynamics, engine combustion, and air-circulation analysis in order to achieve better fuel consumption, lower exhaust emissions, and better driving comfort, thus, CFD is steadily being used more and more in the design stages of automobiles. In this paper, we discuss the role of CFD in designing automobiles, and at the same time describe how supercomputers have been used over the past few years in CFD-based R&D and design. 2. CFD Applications and Characteristics As we can see from Figure 1 [figure not reproduced], there are a lot of important areas in which CFD applications can directly affect the performance of a car. In the last few years especially, companies are turning to CFD as a design tool for achieving lower fuel consumption, lower exhaust emissions, and better driving comfort, and are now using it to a greater degree in design departments for doing R&D. The cycle in which car models change has shown a tendency to grow from five to six years, but it is also important that new models be put out quickly that meet the needs of users, therefore, we find that there are more demands now then ever before to shorten design and development time. One of the ways suggested to deal with shorter turnaround times is to use CFD in design to shorten development time, reduce prototype cost, and improve performance. When developing a new automobile, we also want to have an analysis method that we can easily use to do routine analysis work that is unrelated to designing automobiles, so even in computational flow dynamics, standard analysis techniques must be developed that enable comparative studies to be done in areas such as complex mixed flow analysis. 3. Role of CFD in Design If we were going to use CFD in design in its present state, it would be inadequate in terms of reliability, accuracy, cost-performance, and ease of use. The main problems are as follows: (1) It has no computational ability to accurately capture mixed flows. (2) It cannot produce a mesh of complex shape very easily. (3) It takes a long time to do calculations and requires a large memory. Below, we list the roles that CFD could play: (1) It could be used to analyze complex flows with a simple generalized computation method. (2) It could be used to do inexpensive high-speed output even in a large analysis. (3) It could be used as necessary to establish reliable calculations and evaluation methods. The problem areas and possibilities described above tend to run counter to each other, therefore, it is essential that an ample study of approaches and methods be taken in CFD R&D. With that in mind, we at Daihatsu Motors have adopted the following methods/approaches to make CFD analysis more practical: (1) Use a k-_e_ mixed flow model (2) Reduce computing time to less than 20 hours with one CRAY computer (3) Show a sizable reduction in analysis error to less than 10 percent In order to create a balance between three elements, namely, producing computation meshes, doing fluid computations, and visualizing flow, we purchased some high-quality market software and put together a supercomputing network (cf. Figure 2 [figure not reproduced]). At present, we are using a Cray supercomputer at the rate of about 500 hours per month for CFD analysis. In Figures 3 and 4 [figures not reproduced], we show supercomputer applications by analysis field and use. 4. Different Types of Analysis and Design Output 4.1 Aerodynamic Analysis At Daihatsu, we have adopted two different approaches to analysis in the design stage. The first is aerodynamic analysis of the vehicle periphery using the SCRYU code[.sup](1)[/] in a BFC coordinate system as shown in Figure 5 [figure not reproduced]. The aim of this approach is to produce a Cray model having no unevenness in the air flow to the engine compartment, the door mirror, and the floor. In approximately 20 hours of computing time, we were able to analyze the resistance coefficient and lift coefficient to a less than 5 percent margin of error, and have been using this approach in developing body designs having little resistance and dynamic lift. The other method is heat flow analysis within the engine compartment using the STREAM code in a Cartesian coordinate system[.sup](2)[/] as shown in Figure 6 [figure not reproduced]. Investigating the effect of the fan, we were able to analyze the average rate of flow through the radiator in two hours of computing time to within a 10 percent margin of error, and at the same time, find the temperature distribution within the engine compartment. There has been a tendency over the past few years toward higher engine compartment temperatures due to new freon substitutes and the engine undercover used to reduce external noise, so this approach has been used a lot as an analysis tool to study design openings and engine compartment layouts in the design and planning stage. 4.2 Engine Flow Analysis As we can see from Figure 7 [figure not reproduced], we have been using CFD in a three-dimensional analysis[.sup](3)[/] of flows within the engine cylinder using a special engine analysis code (AVL-FIRE) that is able to use both the BFC coordinate system and a non-structural mesh coordinate system. The calculations we do from the dead points on the intake to the dead points in the compression at every 0.25ï¿½ crank angle take approximately 15 hours of computation time. With this analysis, we have been working on the shifting boundary problems in the valves and pistons and the rezoning of the mesh within the cylinder. Engine flow analysis has proved useful in optimizing swirls, tumbles, mixed energy flows, and intake resistance, etc. that largely influence the shape of the scavenger port, and it has also proved useful in developing engines with high output and low fuel consumption. It is particularly challenging, indeed, to use it in analyzing flows within the engine cylinder even experimentally, so in that sense, CFD can help to optimize the shape of the engine in the design stage, and after prototyping, can be useful in doing detailed analysis by experimentation. 4.3 Air-Conditioning Analysis As is shown in Figure 8 [figure not reproduced], we are using the STAR-CD code in a non-structural mesh system to analyze window defrosting by a defroster nozzle.[.sup](4)[/] There is a strong correlation between window defrosting and surface velocity, so if we can predict the surface velocity on the glass based on the output flow from the defroster nozzle, we will be able to estimate window defrosting. Used with an EWS, this code enables high-speed computations in 20 hours time. Moreover, taking a view toward ergonomics, we are also analyzing interior air flows to get an idea of the velocities near the heads of passengers in hopes of developing an optimum air-conditioning system. 5. Conclusion In order to further improve the effectiveness of CFD in design, the following problems need to be tackled: (1) Standardizing analyses by an auto-mesh system (2) Achieving more accurate computation by an improved mixed flow theory (3) Achieving inexpensive high-speed computations using a super high-speed parallel computer In the foregoing sections, we described the present situation at Daihatsu Motors in which we are actively promoting the use of computational flow dynamics in R&D and design using supercomputers. There are a lot of areas where CFD is an unknown, so we can expect to see it play a larger role in the future. We believe the time is coming when software will undergo the same kind of technical revolution as hardware, and that there is a good possibility that we will see codes then that are unthinkable now.
