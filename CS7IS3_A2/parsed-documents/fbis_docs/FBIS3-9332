After having welcomed three former members of the Civic Movement (OH) to his party on Friday [18 March], Zeman was already fishing in other waters on Monday [21 March] -- for the first time he called on former Communists not to create new parties such as the Democratic Left Party (SDL) or the Left Block Party (SLB) but to join the Social Democrats, thus strengthening them. Zeman has put, however, two conditions -- former Communists will have to have "clean hands" from the past and they must "sincerely distance themselves from the communist ideology." It will apparently be the CSSD local branches who will judge who of the former Communists have distanced themselves from the communist ideology and how sincerely and whether or not their hands are clean, the paper says. It is thus not surprising that SDL Chairman Josef Mecl promptly reacted to the proposal, arguing that "he did not want to let himself be dragged into `screening trap of the Social Democrats'." SLB deputy chairman Jaroslav Ortman was more cautious, merely noting that he did want to doubt the correctness of the SLB as a political party. However, both Mecl and Ortman made sure that their remarks about the necessity of cooperation between left-wing parties be noticed. Ortman said that such cooperation would be untenable [as received] during the senatorial elections and that leftist parties should offer a joint slate in the local elections in the Czech Republic in November. Zeman could therefore be satisfied with the first reaction of both the SDL and SLB. And as regards the abolition of the two parties and transfer of their members to the CSSD, here Zeman is clearly playing for time. The former Democratic Party of Labor (DSP) opposed a similar fate tooth and nail and look how active its former deputy chairman and parliamentary deputy Michal Kraus is in the CSSD now, the paper writes.
