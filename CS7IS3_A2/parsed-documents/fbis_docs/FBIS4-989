The decision was made at Renamo's special congress, which closed yesterday. About 400 delegates and guests to the congress, which began on 12 April, also adopted the electoral strategy and adapted Renamo's structures to the ongoing political situation, some six months before the first multiparty elections are due to be held. Speaking at a rally in Maringue yesterday afternoon, Dhlakama said Renamo has definitely made the transition from an armed to an unarmed party. Dhlakama urged the whole world to stop regarding Renamo as an armed movement as of yesterday. He pointed out: We no longer have arms and I have been demobilized. He said it was against his will that he was reelected Renamo president and candidate to the presidential elections. He added: I am very tired. I wanted to take a break. He said his continued leadership is a vote of confidence on the part of his colleagues in his political ability. Dhlakama revealed that Renamo's electoral strategy will be based on two principles -- namely, the massive registration of voters and the education of sympathizers so that they may vote for his movement in the October elections. Renamo's electoral campaign will be run by a foreign enterprise whose name he declined to reveal. He admitted, however, that it is Portuguese and includes experts from other nationalities. The Renamo leader said he felt surrounded by powerful adversaries, but is convinced of a victory for him and his movement. The Renamo leader once again accused the government of transferring thousands of troops into the police force, and of training youths in Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Niassa to fight his movement should it win the elections. He said private security companies are specifically designed to intimidate the people. He added: those problems pose a threat to peace in Mozambique. Also a threat was what he described as the continual support for Frelimo by several neighboring countries which he did not identify. He said such countries plan to send about 500,000 of their citizens to vote for Frelimo in the October elections. Dhlakama said he believes Mozambicans will know how to make the best choice. He said those problems could be resolved at the negotiating table between President Joaquim Chissano and himself. He said: I need to talk to Frelimo to guarantee that there will never be war in Mozambique. He urged neighboring countries to assist in Mozambique's democratization process. At its special congress, Renamo adopted a new flag. In addition to the old colors, the new flag shows a guinea fowl and three arrows, though these are displayed horizontally. According to Dhlakama, the arrows stand for passive resistance. The guinea fowl is a bird that refuses to be tamed, and once in captivity commits suicide. A resolution adopted by the congress says Renamo now has provincial, district, and location councils. The National Council remains. New tasks have been allocated to all delegates and to advisers serving with provincial governors. It appears that Afonso Dhlakama and his followers have bet on the influence that former traditional leaders may have among the rural electorate, in view of the large number of chiefs who attended the congress. Dhlakama introduced to newsmen the ministers of Renamo's shadow cabinet. He said if it wins the elections, Renamo's cabinet will include members of other political parties, including one from Frelimo.
