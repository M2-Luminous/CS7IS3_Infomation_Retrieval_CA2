The present mission report, issued in December last year, notes with deep concerns the prevalence of several commonly recognized pre-famine indicators. These conclusions, based on observations and interviews in several areas of the country, confirm the presence of such indicators as very high food prices, collapse of private incomes, depletion of personal assets as well as rapidly increasing numbers of the destitutes. Following is the fourth part of the FAO mission report: The shortage in water supply has led to severe problems in hygiene. According to health authorities outbreaks of lice, typhoid, and cholera continue to be serious public health problems in al-Basrah and throughout the country (department in al-Basrah, personal communication). Moreover, sanitation has become a common problem in schools that now have 2-3 shifts a day leading to facilitated transmission of water-borne diseases amongst the primary age school children. Care International reported that in 1954 [year as received] it plans to rehabilitate school lavatories. Although the extensive vaccination supply system and the cold chain broke down completely immediately after the war, immunization rates are back well above 80 per cent, better than pre-war levels in certain areas (UNICEF 1993, personal communication). The Ministry of Health has received substantial assistance from UNICEF/WHO in maintaining the cold chain and in the provision of vaccines for immunization. The mission noted adequate stocks of vaccines in Maysan and Irbil Governorates. In addition, many mothers when asked, knew about the BCG vaccination. Although little is known about the incidence of acute respiratory factions (ARI), drugs to treat infections in children remain inadequate. The mission noted that several cases of ARI in the pediatric wards of Saddam City Hospital in Baghdad. These cases were receiving antibiotic treatment but physicians complained of shortages, especially during the later winter months when ARI is a more frequent occurrence. WHO does provide drugs and other medical supplies, but the total amount is insufficient to meet the needs of the population. In July to March 1993, 780,000 U.S. dollars worth of drugs were provided under the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Programme. However, drugs to treat chronic diseases, anesthesia to perform basic surgical procedures, nitrous oxide for birthing facilities as well as antibiotics to control infection after surgery are virtually unavailable as reported by several hospitals and the minister of health. This was offered as the explanation of why hospitals are now functioning at 40-50 per cent of their original capacity in spite of the reported increase in infectious disease and severe malnutrition. Only severely ill cases are now being treated. Even when drugs are available, their price on the free market may be 200 times greater than the government rationed price, thus making them virtually unobtainable for the poor. In summary, food insecurity at the household level, inadequate water and sanitary system, and the shortage of drugs to treat infections are likely to result in more serious malnutrition. A small scale study was conducted in collaboration with the Nutrition Research Institute in one of the least privileged areas of Baghdad Saddam City. The objective of the study was to observe first hand the household food security situation in a disadvantaged subsample of the urban population and to assess their nutritional status using simple anthropometric measures. All members of the family present at the time of the home visit were measured and their age ascertained utilizing whenever possible the subjects health cards, eight of the 13 clusters in Saddam City canvassed during the 1991 international team survey were selected for the study to permit a comparison. Although the study was carried out by five teams, results from only 4 teams are reported. These teams were supervised by mission members. Each team included two technicians and one professional supervisor from the Nutrition Research Institute and one member of the mission. One hundred and twenty one households were visited and a total of 506 subjects were measured; 194 were children under 5 years of age, 136 children between 5 and 15 years of age, and 172 persons 15 years of age and older. Mission member observed that a number of households had sold most of their family assets: Furniture, refrigerators, television, jewelry, and other items. Some of the children and adults wore tattered clothes but most households appeared to have access to kerosene for heating, tap water, and electricity. The study had a number of limitations. The sample was not representative of Baghdad as a whole; it was purposely chosen to assess the situation among an underprivileged urban group but results cannot be extrapolated to a defined sector of the Iraqi population. The study had other limitations; the bathroom scales to weigh the preschool children were designed to weigh adults and therefore lacked precision when used to measure children. It should be noted, however, that although these scales were not calibrated and standardized because of lack of time, they were SECA manufactured and used for the first time. They were provided by UNICEF for use in anthropometric measurements. Baby balances (SECA) were used in weighing very young infants below 10 kg weight. The height boards and tapes were all new and perfectly suitable for the purpose. The enumerators included persons with variable degrees of experience in taking anthropometric measurements and there was no time to train them or to standardize their techniques.
