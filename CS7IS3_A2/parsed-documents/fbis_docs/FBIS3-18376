"The partly real and partly imaginary sick man, which is how our neighbors sometimes perceive our country, is beginning to gain ground again," Stihl said at the annual reception on the eve of the DIHT general assembly in Bonn. Stihl said that the overall image has been lightened by the positive economic signals from the United States, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Foreign demand was gradually increasing, and in some branches the order books are becoming fuller again, while domestic demand was benefiting from the diminishing tendency to price increases. Germany was seeking and finding new paths to keep its position in the increasingly stiffening international competition and to overcome the structural crisis, Stihl said. Due to the high public debts of almost 2 billion German marks [DM], it is still necessary to keep spending low. Wage agreements must not be concluded for those who still have work without solidarity with those looking for jobs. More permeability and competition are necessary in the education system. Moreover, "naive debates" about modern technology must no longer be conducted. People must cease taking advantage of the state as a self-service market, Stihl said. "There is no longer a balance between the hunt for individual advantage and the support for the commonweal in Germany." As official speaker at the DIHT annual reception, French Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery expressed his support for the German-French partnership and for European monetary union. For more than 10 years, France has pursued a policy of stability and is more than ever ready to put monetary union into practice. Alphandery pleaded for a more resolute political commitment to reach progress regarding the convergence in the European national economies. The common struggle against rising unemployment was of preeminent importance, the French minister said.
