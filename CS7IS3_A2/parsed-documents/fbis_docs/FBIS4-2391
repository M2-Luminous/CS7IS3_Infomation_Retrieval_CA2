Addressing the fourth national conference on cracking down on activities of illegal entrepot trade of textiles, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said that in the recent period, the Chinese Government has strengthened its work on striking back at illegal entrepot trade activities. He added that leading members of departments of foreign trade and economic cooperation, customs and departments for inspection of import and export commodities throughout the country as well as various textile companies have strengthened their leadership over the work and have laid down a series of rules and regulations on it. Meanwhile, Vice-Minister Shi said, many documents are being distributed and the mass media are being used to publicize the significance of the work to allow more enterprises to understand the severe harmfulness of illegal entrepot trade of textiles. He explained that illegal entrepot trade of textiles refers to those activities of enterprises or individuals trying illegal methods to bypass the administration of textile rations and export Chinese-made textiles through a third country or region to those countries and regions which ration the quantity of imported Chinese-made textiles. Vice-Minister Shi stressed that China will continue to actively cooperate with the governments of countries and regions concerned to crack down on activities of illegal entrepot trade. The current conference was sponsored jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs and the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities. Zhou Keren, director of the Department of Trade Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, announced at the conference today that four enterprises in Liaoning, Fujian and Guangdong Provinces have been severely punished for their activities in illegal entrepot trade of textiles. Shankou Company under Dongmao Industrial Co. Ltd. in Shenyang, Capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China, signed in August 1993, with a Hong Kong company to export 6,200 dozens of cowboy shorts and 1,980 dozens of pajamas for ladies to Singapore. The products were made by three factories in Shenyang, in Guangdong Province and in Yingkou city. However, they were labelled Fijian- made and were transited to the United States in October and November in the same year. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has decided to confiscate all the earnings from the business of Shankou Company, cut off all its quotas of export textiles from the business, and deprive it of its right to apply for such quotas in 1994. Besides, the ministry also ordered the Shenyang city committee of foreign trade and economic cooperation to have all the business activities of the company suspended. The ministry also suggested that the departments in charge of the company should sanction disciplinary actions for those people who are responsible for the illegal business. The other three enterprises punished were Guangyu Xiamen Co. Ltd. in Fujian Province, and Shifa Garment Co. Ltd. and Yongjia Garment Co. Ltd., both in Shantou city, south China's Guangdong Province.
