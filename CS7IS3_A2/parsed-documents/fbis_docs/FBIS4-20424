"A gale has risen and is sweeping the clouds across the sky; with more force throughout the country it sweeps people back to their native places." In the Han Dynasty, after Liu Bang had achieved success and gained fame, the first thing he did was return to his native place and show off. The traditional idea of bringing honor to one's ancestors is deeply ingrained in people's consciousness, and it influences their behavior. In the period of his work outside his native place, a peasant of Fuyang City learned the skill of making pickled vegetables. When he returned to his native place he took the lead in setting up the Huatuo Pickled Vegetable Plant. Its annual output value is now over 10 million yuan and its profit more than 10 million yuan. He has been selected to be a special representative of the city's CPPCC and NPC. Gao: Objectively, the existing household registration system and land system, I'm afraid, are also important factors in the return to their native places by those who have engaged in trade or work outside their native places. The dual social structure, in which city and county are separated and which has been extant in China for a long time, although in recent years being made somewhat more flexible and being somewhat weakened, has fundamentally not changed. The peasants who went to cities to work do not enjoy the social welfare and insurance benefits that the city's staff and workers do; at present, one cannot obtain a permanent right to reside in a city soley by economic means. Tai: Even if this precedent were to be set, one would have to pay the city's land-use fee, basic facilities fee, employment placement fee, and other economic costs; and they are very high and also constantly increasing. Our investigation of typical cases showed that, faced with the choice of paying a large sum of money to obtain the right of permanent residence in a city or using this money to return to one's native place and set up an enterprise, more than 90 percent of the people chose the latter. At the same time, in accordance with the existing land contract system, those who go outside their native places to work must pay taxes and fees in line with the contract. The idea that the peasants' land cannot be put out of cultivation at the same time also influences their desire to return. Gao: Speaking of certain peasants who have returned to the "Yellow Earth" to continue to engage in agriculture, the state's support policies, e.g., raising the grain purchasing price, I'm afraid, is also an inducement that cannot be overlooked. Tai: That's natural. If they could gain wealth by tilling the land, why would the peasants leave their villages and crowd into cities? In the process of the return by peasants who went outside their native places, market mechanisms and policy levers have played an important role. Gao: Specifically, for certain returnees the exciting cause could be the joint effect of the above factors, and also could be the result of the effect of certain factors among them. It is not necessary to get to the bottom of this question. The value of the investigation and analysis of the exciting cause for their return lies in understanding and grasping this phenomenon and correctly guiding it. Tai: This viewpoint is very important, and we are pursuing this train of thought. The reason for investigating and analyzing why the peasants return is to make the formulated policies and measures more scientific. In doing policy and management work, I advocate that we not examinue minutely why other people return. We must look at objective results, and use the three "is it favorable or not" questions as the criteria for judging whether people's behavior is right or wrong, advantageous or disadvantageous. New Growing Points Gao: What those who engaged in trade or worked outside their native places obtained was not only a sizable economic income, skills, and business insight, but also they unconsciously absorbed the new ideas of modern life in the developed areas. Those who return bring back the culture and civilization on the outside; through their various ways of behaving they influence peasants around them, thereby pounding at the old, backward concepts and producing an exemplary effect on people's lifestyle. Tai: The depth and the breadth of this effect far exceed those of radio, television, the press, and other mass media. A young woman from Jidong Village, Quanyang Town, Jieshou City went to Beijing, where she became a nurse. She was gradually influenced by the modern lifestyle. At the Spring Festival she returned home. Her ideas, concepts, and ways of behaving produced a big effect on the other young women in her village. When the Spring Festival had just ended, about a dozen young women requested that she take them to Beijing to become nurses. At the beginning of the 1990 Spring Festival, she set up in her native village a labor export organization and conveyance center. Over the past several years she has organized and conveyed to Beijing more than 1,200 person-times of young women. These women are now spurring on and influencing changes in the thoughts and concepts of even more women. Tai: The pioneering activities of those who have returned home have mitigated the social problems brought by the transregional flow of labor forces and their crowding into cities. After World War II, in some independent developing countries, during the process of industrialization there appeared, to different degrees, the "urbanization transition syndrome." Brazil, the national condition of which approximates that of China, is a typical example. In the period 1940-1983, the proportion of Brazil's urban population in its total population rose from 31.9 percent at the beginning to 70.7 percent at the end. The rural people who flowed into the cities, unable to find employment, roamed the streets. And the labor force that we originally exported but that returned to their native places and set up enterprises absorb the surplus labor, thereby causing the on-the-spot transfer of the rural surplus labor and really advancing this situation in a realistic way. Gao: In solving the problem of the transfer of rural surplus labor, the government and academic circles have explored many ways in various places, e.g., through adjustment of the internal structure of agriculture, achieving the split-flow way of "not leaving the land and not leaving the native place" through guiding peasants on the spot to shift to secondary and tertiary industries; thus, the ways of "leaving the land but not leaving the native ploace" and "leaving the native place but not leaving the land" have been incorporated into the rural industrial structure, while some peasants have been organized and guided to take the way of "leaving both land and native place" by being labor exports to cities outside their native places. The idea of on-the-spot transfer was put forward long ago, and the abrupt rise in transfers provides a realistic way for doing it. Undeveloped areas are basically places where township-town enterprises have not yet been developed. Those who return and start an undertaking may be called a contingent of "fresh troops." In this sense they constitute not only a new economic growing point for the development of township-town enterprises in undeveloped areas, but also a new growing point for the development of rural society; they may even be said to be a new growing point for the social and economic development of China, a country in which 90 percent of the population lives in the rural areas. If we observe the now surging "tide of rural labor" with this kind of eye, we get another impression. Tai: Being mobile is not their objective; what, in the end, they pursue is returning and starting an undertaking. Speaking of the local governments, those in this transregional flow of rural surplus labor do not, in reality, require a school education, a factory in which investment has been made, and a credit bank. New Theme Gao: The contingent of those who return and start an undertaking will, following the increase in the number of people flowing out, expand proportionally. Compared with the "tide of rural labor," the phenomenon of "regression" is of a more constructive nature, and thus constitutes a more important theme. Tai: We already understand this point. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee formally used the term "labor market," and for labor as a commodity with the market as the intermediary, to have both a flow and a reverse flow is natural. For local governments the most realistic theme is: how, in policy, public opinion, and other aspects, to create an environment and conditions for taking effective measures that guide more people to return and start an undertaking. I feel that we should treat this theme from the height of attracting, discovering, developing, and using talented persons. Gao: This is very far-sighted. There are bright prospects for local governments in this aspect. What measures have you taken or are preparing to take? Tai: First of all, all our types of labor-export organizations are doing everything possible to make widespread contacts with economically developed areas and with some enterprises with good economic returns, and they are conveying to them in an organized manner high-quality rural surplus labor and purposefully, through export, training the various types of talented people urgently needed for our economic development. Second, through finding out the real situation by frequent investigations, particularly grasping the opportune time of the Spring Festival period when they return home to visit relatives to make use of symposiums and other ways to investigate and get a detailed understanding of the situation with regard to the exported labor's quality, direction of going, service life, and occupation in order to discover talented people. Third, with regard to the difficulties in funds encountered when returning and starting an undertaking, we require that financial departments, on the basis of conscientious inspection, give support in the form of loans; with regard to tax revenue, we require the tax departments, within the scope permitted by policy, as much as possible grant reductions or exemptions. Fourth, we are considering giving a double award to those who return, start an undertaking, and obtain outstanding results -- good economic returns and good social benefits -- and put them in leading posts at the village level, and let them lead more of the measses to make money and become well-off. Finally, we hope you news and propaganda departments will adopt many forms to publicize them in the mass media, forming in all of society a good atmosphere conducive to guiding those who return to make great contributions and accomplish great tasks. Gao: We have thought of this point. The press has the responsibility for publicizing typical examples of those who have returned and started an undertaking, and for forming in society a general mood of admiring and valuing this activity.
