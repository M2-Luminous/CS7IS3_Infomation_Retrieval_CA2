On Tuesday he appeared before the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee for approval of his designation as Venezuelan ambassador to the U.S. The future ambassador explained relations between Venezuela and the United States are of a broad and diverse nature. One of the major elements of relations is the economic relationship. This economic relationship is evidenced by the export of energy products and nontraditional exports such as those manufactured by the state's basic enterprises, as well as investments by Venezuela and the U.S. in each other's economies. Regarding the proposal that the envoy in Washington also hold the post of ambassador to the OAS and other international organizations with headquarters in that city, Echeverria replied it is worth considering. "I think the OAS will undertake major tasks in the coming years. It would be a great amount of work, but I think with good organization a well-structured embassy could handle those commitments in the future." Although he supports the proposal to improve the expenditure structure abroad, Echeverria feels that under the current circumstances that cannot be done because the topics to be discussed in the OAS in the immediate future require the active presence of an ambassador.
