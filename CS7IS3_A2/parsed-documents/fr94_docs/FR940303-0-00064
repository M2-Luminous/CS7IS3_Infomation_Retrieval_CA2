ACTION: Disposition of comments to final rule. SUMMARY: On July 24, 1991, the FAA issued a final rule concerning part 157 of the Federal Aviation Regulations that deleted an impending requirement to provide 90 days advance notice of construction, alteration, activation, and deactivation of certain temporary airports and heliports located within a specified distance from another airport; revised the applicability section of part 157 to exclude proposals involving the intermittent use of sites that are not established airports; and clarified that telephone notice for certain emergency or unreasonable hardship situations be directed to the appropriate Airports District/Field Office or Regional Office. The final rule revised certain provisions contained in a previous amendment to this part before the effective date of that amendment. The final rule became effective on August 30, 1991. The public was invited to submit comments on the final rule by November 21, 1991. Based on the comments received, the FAA has determined that no further rulemaking action is necessary. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joseph C. White, Air Traffic Rules Branch, ATP&hyph;230, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267&hyph;8783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On October 4, 1988, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (notice No. 88&hyph;15, 53 FR 39062) that addressed certain safety issues concerning the construction, alteration, activation, and deactivation of airports. On August 27, 1990, the FAA published a final rule (amendment No. 157&hyph;4, 55 FR 34994), based on the proposals contained in Notice No. 88&hyph;15 and the public comments to that notice. Amendment No. 157&hyph;4: (1) Established a requirement to provide notice to the Administrator prior to establishing or changing a traffic pattern or traffic pattern altitude; (2) defined a new term, ``private use of public lands or waters;'' (3) eliminated the term ``personal use'' as an airport use designation; and (4) revised the applicability section of part 157 regarding notice criteria. Prior to Amendment No. 157&hyph;4, part 157 notice criteria applied to any proposal to construct, alter, activate, or deactivate a civil or joint-use (civil/military) airport except for those proposals involving: (1) Certain projects for which Federal aid had been requested, and (2) a ``temporary'' airport or aircraft landing or takeoff area. The term ``temporary'' meant that the airport or aircraft landing or takeoff area was intended to be used solely in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions for less than 30 days, with no more than 10 operations a day. Amendment No. 157&hyph;4 revised the temporary airports exclusion from the notice requirements of part 157. The amendment provided that only the following temporary airports and heliports would be excluded from the part 157 notice provisions: (1) Temporary private use airports for fixed-wing aircraft and ultralight vehicles that are located beyond specified distances from other airports, and (2) temporary private use heliports and helicopter landing areas that are located outside a control zone, a residential, business, or industrial area, and beyond specified distances from other airports and heliports. After the publication of Amendment No. 157&hyph;4, and before its original effective date of February 27, 1991, the FAA received comments from aviation organizations and operators regarding the potential impact of the revised notice requirement for temporary airports and landing areas. To provide time to review and possibly revise Amendment No. 157&hyph;4, the FAA delayed its effective date until August 30, 1991 (Amendment No. 157&hyph;5, 56 FR 8674, February 28, 1991).
