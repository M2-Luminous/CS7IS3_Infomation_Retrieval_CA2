Our correspondent Joao Ligio has further details. According to observers here in Lusaka, the course of the peace talks has reached such a stage that only a greater international intervention can give it a favorable image. The two parties view any concessions at this period as capitulation. On the remaining points on national reconciliation, a few days ago UNITA received the government proposal on its peaceful integration in the nation's political life. UNITA has not yet given its final reply. On the news media, UNITA does not say yes or no to the integration of its radio, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, according to the existing legislation. It says however that it intends to maintain its editorial line. On the return of property, it says that it is waiting for new guidelines from its leadership, because it does not agree with the way it would be processed. On the reimposition of the state administration, UNITA wants eight provinces and 50 districts in central and southern Angola, with the exception of Lunda Norte and Uige, to fall under its administration. The government does not want to be diverted from the legal framework. Before concluding discussions on national reconciliation, the parties are also expected to discuss UNITA's role in national and local administration and Jonas Savimbi's status.
