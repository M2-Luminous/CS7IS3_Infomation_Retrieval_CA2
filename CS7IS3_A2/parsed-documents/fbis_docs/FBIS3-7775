The analyst of the British Jane's defence military magazine in an interview to the VOA monitored in Belgrade, said that the Bosnian Serbs not only possessed missiles with a 40-km range and a number of anti-aircraft and shoulder rocket launchers, but also a completely new Russian system called SA-16. NATO says the system is difficult to counter. Beaver said Bosnian Serbs possessed a large number of anti-aircraft cannon and added that most of the aircraft in the Gulf war as well as in the Falklands war 12 years ago, were known to be shot down by the infantry fire from the ground. The analyst thus warned that the West should not be led into believing that the war planes would be able to launch attacks on the Sarajevo surroundings without being exposed to danger. He said that on top of that NATO did not have the best trained pilots in the world. Last Wednesday NATO threatened the Bosnian Serbs and Moslems they would be bombed unless they withdrew their heavy artillery in and around Sarajevo or place it under U.N. control. Although the NATO ultimatum concerns all three sides to the Bosnian conflict, many Western politicians and media regard the ultimatum as directed to the Bosnian Serbs alone.
