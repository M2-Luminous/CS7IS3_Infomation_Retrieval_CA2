We also like to point out that the Russian delegation's visit to China was widely reported in detail by the media of Eastern and Western countires. At the beginning, some Western media doubted that Russia might have an intention to develop bilateral military technology cooperation with China. Such cooperation will be developed under the condition that the two countries fulfill their international obligations -- this should not cause anyone to be suspicions. During the talks, the two sides stressed the importance of reaching an agreement on taking measures as soon as possible to reduce their troops and armament and military trainings in disputed areas. They believed this will not only enhance mutual trust and understanding between the two countries, but also will contribute to preserving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. During their talks, Chernomyrdin and Li Peng also discussed international issues of common interest. The two countries' identical and similar stands on some major international issues were confirmed. This will be the foundation for the two countries to strengthen their constructive cooperation in regional and world affairs. In short, the dialogue between the two governments has yielded good results. Currently, the two sides are preparing for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia. The two countries believe that positive dialogues at all levels, including the highest level, are prerequisites for promoting neighborly and friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between them.
