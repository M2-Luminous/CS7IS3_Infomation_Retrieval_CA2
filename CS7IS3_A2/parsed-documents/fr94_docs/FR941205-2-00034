FR941205-2-00034 FR941205-2-00029 Pathology and Physiological Research Branch (HCC33) (1) Provides research into new ways to identify disease mechanisms, develops pre-disease early warning systems, identifies methods for repair or resolution of disease, and develops and applies new imaging techniques; (2) examines in an applied and preventive research mode the effects of workplace exposures on human and animal body functions and cellular response-receptors in the development of disease/disfunction, mechanism of action, early functional markers of detection, and recommendations for prevention and control/intervention; (3) provides advice and collaborative service for NIOSH investigators interested in physiological/pharmacological effects of workplace exposures on field-based and animal/cellular systems; (4) examines the alteration of function based on pre-existing disease, induced-disease, or cellular/organ structural impairment in the context of responses to occupational exposures, both actual and laboratory-generated; (5) assists HELD and other NIOSH divisions by providing animal exposure and pathological support in the development, use, and evaluation of exposure systems that mimic the occupational situation, reach the target organ, and results in sensitive models of change, structural or functional; (6) provides animal pathology support to researchers through the development of sensitive animal-specific tools, molecular probes, or recognition techniques that can be modified or used for animal models of occupational disease/exposure. Exposure Assessment Branch (HCC34) (1) Provides research methods for the Division to develop and improve methods for environmental measurement of aerosols; (2) develops and evaluates real-time personal and area direct reading instruments for chemical, biological, and physical agents; (3) develops techniques for measuring human responses to workplace exposures; (4) provides new research techniques in the areas of aeromicrobiology, particle characterization, molecular characterization, micro sensors, advanced sampling and instrumentation, electronic monitoring, and electrical and mechanical engineering; (5) coordinates with other NIOSH laboratory-based research (particularly the toxicology and molecular biology research), as well as NIOSH field studies and health hazard evaluations to advance exposure assessment methods; (6) develops new methodologies for exposure modeling of current and past exposure for use in applied research (epidemological and molecular epidemiological studies). Engineering and Control Technology Branch (HCC35) (1) Provides research capabilities for developing and establishing engineering solutions for the control of occupational disease; (2) coordinates with the Exposure Assessment Branch to develop engineering techniques to solve problems in measuring and monitoring programs; (3) develops and utilizes techniques in computerized workplace simulations and mathematical models; (4) develops passive protection devices and systems for preventing or minimizing worker exposure to hazardous chemical, biological, and physical substances; (5) develops sophisticated personal protective equipment to provide workers with information about their working environment. Analytical Services Branch (HCC36) (1) Provides environmental and biological analytical laboratory services such as immunotoxical, pharmacological, molecular and cellular biological analysis, identification, qualification, and other requested characterizations for all NIOSH research and service programs; (2) provides analytical services such as multi-chemical mixture analysis, particle size analysis, component identification, quantification, and other requested characterization; (3) develops state-of-the-art analytical methods for the evaluation and control of newly identified workplace hazards and exposures that could lead to occupational disease. Biostatistics Branch (HCC37) (1) Provides experimental design and support of laboratory-based research to address the statistical aspects of projects in the Division and throughout the Institute; (2) verifies the statistical quality, both in the design and analysis phase of all experimental research in the Institute; (3) develops and directs the application of new statistical methods as well as the design and analysis of field research projects for the Institute; (4) develops computerized methods for independent research initiatives in statistical methods to advance basic research in experimental and observational studies; (5) collaborates in the design of laboratory and field research studies, providing consultation through the course of the research on computerized methods of data collection and interpretation of results. Health Communication Research Branch (HCC38) (1) Designs, implements, and evaluations effective communication strategies for the Division using expertise in health education, and communication; (2) develops messages, materials, and methods to clearly and effectively communicate risks and prevention recommendation to those at risk and those that can most effectively implement or promote prevention activities; (3) evaluates the effectiveness of the Division's health communication to determine the impact and contribution to prevention of workplace injury and disease; (4) coordinates with others in the field of health communication to form coalitions to advocate prevention activities.
