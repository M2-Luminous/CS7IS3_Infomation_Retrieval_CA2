This runs counter to inferences of nuclear experts of the West, who have claimed that India may have anything from 6 to 20 weapons. In fact, the general belief that India is only "days or weeks away from fabricating a nuclear weapon" also appears to be false. While it is likely that India does have a stockpile of weapons material in the form of plutonium (Pu-239) -- western analysts give a figure of about 200-300 kg -- India is far away from being able to put together an efficient and deliverable weapon at short notice. If this is indeed true, the likelihood of which is high, the bubble of India's nuclear ambiguity stands completely blown. In short, India is `nuclear naked'. In this context, the Prime Minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao's statement in his concluding address at the Delhi session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Saturday, that India will keep its nuclear option open as long as there is universal nuclear disarmament, begs the following question. Can India exercise the nuclear option if it wants to at a short notice? The nuclear test by China on Friday is only likely to heighten the demands of the likes of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] that India should go nuclear forthwith. Mr L K Advani has reiterated his call at the Baroda session of the BJP's national council meeting. The bare critical mass required to sustain an explosive chain reaction in a bomb configuration, a sphere of weapons grade plutonium (which has about 6 per cent Pu-240 in addition to Pu-239), is about 15-17 kg of Pu-240, a weapons poison because it spontaneously emits neutrons, causing the bomb to "pre-detonate" or fizzle out. Reactor-grade material, however, contains about 20 per cent Pu-240. Therefore, usually, plutonium from research reactors, where material can be drawn before the higher isotopes, like Pu-240, form over time in the core, is used for weapons purposes. To maximise the explosive yield of a weapon, bare material is never used. The fissile core in a weapon is surrounded by a thick blanket of a reflector material, which scatters the neutrons emitted during fission back into the core so that they are not lost out into the environment but cause more number of plutonium atoms to fission and increase the energy yield. A suitable reflector material is that which scatters neutrons much more than it absorbs them and, at the same time, is light so that it does not add greatly to the weight of the weapon. Beryllium metal (density 1.85 gm/cc) fits the bill admirably. So, all nuclear weapon designs incorporate a thick beryllium shell around the weapon core. For an efficient weapon, and not a crude "fizzle" variety, a beryllium (Be) reflector is a necessity. With a Be reflector, the critical mass comes down to about 4.5-5 kg. Data on Be production in the country over the years, and its off- take by the department of atomic energy (DAE), has been recently given by this year's report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on scientific departments. It is from this that one is able to conclude that no proper weapon could have been fabricated in all these years after the Pokharan experiment in 1974. That is, to know whether the emperor who is not seen in public has clothes or not, you look at the royal tailors' orders. The Pokharan device perhaps used Be imported long ago because, at that time, the country had no beryllium production facility. Establishing such a facility became essential for various strategic needs of the country in the areas of defence (for light weight components), space (for light weight gyros), atomic energy (for various nuclear applications) and electronics (in the form of copper beryllium alloy products), because export of beryllium has been embargoed since then by the key Beryllium producing countries of the world. Fortunately, India has one of the largest deposits of beryllium ore in the world and the idea of such a facility was a feasible one. Based on feasibility studies done by the DAE in 1977, a beryllium pilot plant (BPP), with a facility for producing vacuum hot pressed (VHP) blocks was commissioned in the year 1982 in Vashi near Bombay. Its originally envisaged annual capacity was 250 kg of VHP blocks and 10 tonne of copper-beryllium (Cu-Be) alloy (for electronics applications). Later, this was revised to 200 kg of metal and 8 tonnes of Cu-Be. An memorandum of understanding signed among the DAE and its principal users, namely, the department of space (DoS) and the department of electronics (DoE), required that the DAE would set up the plant and operate it while the DOS and the DOE would share the capital costs and running expenses according to a formula. As per this MoU, the DoE would lift the entire produce of Cu-Be and 50 per cent of Be metal while the other 50 per cent would be lifted by the DoS. Herein lies the curious element. If there had been a post- Pokharan policy to produce weapons, the DAE would have been slated to lift a certain fraction of the Be produced, but it was not. Indeed, according DoS sources, after the plant was commissioned, the DAE seemed to have lost its interest in beryllium. There is only one interpretation for this. That the DAE did not need the metal for want of a directive from the government on the weapons front. Further, even though, according to the DAE, technical and operational viability of the plant had been demonstrated by continuous production and supply, the total quantity of metal and alloy produced from 1982 to 1993 was 5.87 per cent and 5.33 per cent, respectively, of the envisaged capacities. The cost of production was also very high. The CAG has given figures of production and off-take for a 11- year period from 1982. Of a total installed capacity for this period of 2,200 kg of Be metal, only 129.17 kg had been produced. Of this, the DoS lifted a total of 101.43 kg while the DAE lifted only 10.05 kg. The total stock of Be in balance in BPP, till 1993, was 17.69 kg. During 1982-89, as per the MoU, DAE's off-take was supposed to be zero. But, when in 1989 the DoE pulled out of the MoU for envisaged electronics demand for Be not materialising, the DAE lifted 8.04 kg. During 1989-93, however, DAE's requirement was projected at 12.63 kg but it has finally lifted only 2.01 kg, thus totalling its off-take over 11 years to 10.05 kg. The other important use of Be is in its use as beryllium-oxide blocks in research reactors like Purnima-I, II and III. The metal is also used in the fabrication of neutron sources for nuclear research and technology. The DAE, in recent years, has started fabricating such sources and a substantial amount of Be metal is likely to be used there. Even 10.05 kg is not sufficient material for one weapon. So, if we account for all these uses, fabricating a deliverable weapon with what would be left with the DAE out of the 10.05 kg is out of the question. A rough estimate for the amount of Be required, even for a not too good a reflector, for a critical mass of, say, 8 kg of plutonium would be about 20 kg in the least. Even if the DAE commandeers all the stocks of Be that is in the plant's stocks, it may be just enough for fabricating one efficient weapon. So, the scenario that the above analysis indicates is that there is no bomb in the Indian basement, unless, of course, the figures of production provided to the CAG are not the actual ones. Whether this policy of nuclear restraint in the post-Pokharan phase is deliberate or is willy-nilly a result of inefficient beryllium production at BPP, only the DAE knows.
