Before introducing this report, Dorenko briefly commented on the Crimean crisis, saying: "The Crimean Supreme Soviet today restored the peninsula's Constitution, a highly autonomous Constitution, and everyone was expecting a response from Kiev and possible clashes. But the day passed off without clashes. We spoke to Crimean Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov over the telephone and he, in contrast to us, said that he was more interested in the problem of Crimea's sewerage system, and that he did not share our fears today."
