In the light of the great importance that these relations have for the wider stability in the region, the West is continually insisting on a speedier solution of the disputes and on normal cooperation. In doing that, one must bear in mind that Greece, as the farthest part of the European Union, has a special role in this region in assisting and facilitating the Macedonian options for approaching Europe. Without the establishment of more stable communications between the two states, it is impossible to make any attempts at a further process of Balkan consolidation. Totally aware of the importance of such a cooperation, Macedonia never misses the opportunity of expressing its readiness for a mutual dialogue with Athens. It believes there are no problems that cannot be solved if there is good will, and that the best and most efficient way, tested and affirmed in international practice, is to sit at a negotiating table and review all the disputable questions between the two states, without any prejudices. The greater number of the hitherto Macedonian initiatives have, unfortunately, remained without an answer from Athens. The Greek side, hesitating and laden with various nationalist prejudices, is simply exhausted when looking for excuses; thus, it is conditioning the dialogue with unilateral requests that, from the aspect of international relations, are totally groundless and unjustified, and their treatment depends on the will and readiness of both sides. Those requests are imposed by the internal political and propaganda needs of Greece for which the Papandreu government tried to urge European support, but in their essence they can only be solved with the agreement of the two states. The Athens government is not ready to face that fact, although it has become perfectly clear that it does not have any other choice. At this moment, the most bitter problem of the ruling Greek group is making that known to its own people. The requests made hitherto by Greece also prove it to be true. Once it requested the rejection of the name Macedonia, then it suggested prefixes to that name (the Greek propaganda itself has prepared a whole list of proposals: Vardar, North, Central-Balkan, Slav, New Macedonia and so on), now it mentions the state symbols, the borders, the Macedonian Constitution. All this discrepancy and uncertainty in the Greek policy has a common characteristic: fear or shame to admit an unavoidable fact! To admit something it has ignored for decades, something it presented as a nonexistent and manufactured question, as an artificial state, a manufactured state, a manufactured language, a fabricated history and culture. However, it is aware that admitting these facts will mean uncovering other questions that it has been hiding. The method of unilateral conditions and dictates, as a bad excuse for postponing dialogue and for blaming the "unyielding Skopje" and the "stubborn Gligorov," has evidently become stale and counterproductive. There are few in the world who can believe in such cheap tricks. The reputation of Greek policy has been devaluated to such an extent that even its closest allies are worried and placed in an awkward position. Their efforts to place Athenian foreign policy on normal European tracks are not hidden. It did not pass the first test in the dispute with Macedonia: the test of democracy! The Macedonian policy, nevertheless, believes in a positive outcome. It firmly believes that Athens will become more realistic and gather enough strength to overcome the passions. However, one must not forget that the Macedonian leadership has also not been spared from various internal pressures and resistances. The strength of a policy is assessed by the realization of great goals, by the main and the real interests of the people. No one can ask anybody to be nationally humiliated and betrayed, and nobody has the right to keep nations in conflict and without mutual respect and understanding. The hitherto policy of the two states, aside from spreading mutual mistrust and hostility, has not produced anything good for either state. Sincere and overall cooperation between them will, in any case, be of greater value not only for the two states, but it will also demonstrate that the Balkans are fed up with divisions. In order to achieve all this, discussions are necessary. Without mutual disdain, without conditions from a position of power. History does not recall any dispute solved without mutual compromises. The other alternative is violence: The stronger wins the dispute. However, that is the philosophy of war. Macedonia has had too many experiences with such justice throughout its history. For the first time now, as a member of the United Nations, it is in a position to conduct equal negotiations and decide on its own destiny. This is the only status it can have in the dispute with Greece. The moment that they sit at a negotiating table will reveal who is more ready for negotiations, for a successful solution of the disputes, for the possibilities of mutual compromise and concessions. In a direct dialogue, it will not be enough only to deliver personal requests, but discussion of the requests and remarks of the other side will also be needed. The terminology of the United Nations and International Law states: dialogue between equal partners. Certainly, the problems that have piled up over decades will not be solved overnight. Nevertheless, the basic thing is that both sides start negotiations with the wish for success, in order to realize principles of mutual confidence that will establish a climate conducive to results. Then the problems regarding the symbols, the flag, the borders, and the Constitution will be treated adequately, as will, for instance, the question about various discriminatory laws toward Macedonia and the Macedonians that are still valid with our southern neighbor, and that represent an anachronism in modern international law, such as the problems of human rights and liberties in which lie the framework are minority rights, the property rights of its one- time citizens of Macedonian origin, the bans they are exposecd to when they try to visit their birthplaces, the destruction of historical and cultural monuments of non-Hellenistic character, whose protection and maintainance have been proclaimed in UN acts. These are, briefly, only some of the disputed questions between the two states that require solutions, and today or tomorrow, the governments of Macedonia and Greece will have to sit down and agree if they wish to establish modern, civilized, democratic solutions to their mutual relations, or, to be more precise: if they want to enter modern-day Europe. Macedonia has chosen that road and it believes it is the right one. It expects support from Greece and wants to have friendly relations with it. It is ready for a dialogue on an equal footing. Perhaps athens will reply tomorrow. Let us hope it will be a positive reply.
