China would like to have the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong settled in the form of bilateral negotiation between the Chinese and British Governments as the term of office for the would-be members of the Legislative Council and of district and urban councils will go through 1997, the year for the transition of power in Hong Kong, said Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY after attending a local public gathering. But the fact has been known to all, the British side had announced, unilaterally, the termination of Sino-British talks and put it into action by submitting Governor Chris Patten's political reform bill to the Hong Kong Legislative Council, Zheng said. Under such circumstance, the term of office for members of the three-tier councils will have to terminate on June 30, 1997 no matter what resolutions to be passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council, the deputy director stated. The Chinese side will have the three-tier councils re-elected by July 1, 1997 in accordance with principles provided by the Basic Law of the Future Government of the hong kong Special Administrative Region, he added. Zheng's speech was made after the Hong Kong Government decided to gazette tomorrow a new regulation which sets out the procedure for the registration of electors in geographical constituencies for the three-tier elections. China stated this consistent position time and again over the past months. The Chinese side passed on the message to the British side when the governor gazetted part of his political reform bill on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements and reiterated its principle stand when Patten introduced his partial bill to the Legislative Council. He expressed that the Chinese side would speed up preparations for the resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and called on the broad masses of Hong Kong people to take part in the matter. He assured local residents that China will adopt a positive attitude in cooperation with the British-Hong Kong authorities and in the solution of matters relating to the everyday life of local residents.
