FBIS4-20072 "drweu080_n_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Sweden * Economic Aid To Concentrate on Northwest Russia * Economic Aid To Concentrate on Northwest Russia 94P20676A 94P20676A CSO [Editorial Report] The majority of Swedish economic aid to East Europe will go to the northwest part of Russia and will focus on small-scale projects. According to a report by Mikael Holmstrom in the 10 April SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 13, Swedish aid to East Europe had previously concentrated on Poland and the Baltic republics. Now, however, Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas, who just returned from a visit to northwest Russia, declares that "the Baltics are on the right path, and it is time to increase efforts in Russia." Currently, the region receives 10-12 percent of the total 1 billion kronor earmarked for East Europe; this is expected to increase quickly. The aid will be concentrated on individual projects instead of large-scale government plans. Holmstrom notes that this support "from below" makes it easier to tailor efforts to the individual needs of the eight northwestern regions. The city of St. Petersburg will receive the most aid followed by the other seven regions: Murmansk, Novgorod, Pskov, Kaliningrad, Karelia, the Leningrad Oblast, and Arkhangelsk.
