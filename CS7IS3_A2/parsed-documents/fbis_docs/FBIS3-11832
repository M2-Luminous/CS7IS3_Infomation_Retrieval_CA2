Representatives from New York, Illinois, and California reported in the United States that they witnessed the courage and perseverance of Salvadorans, as well as widespread confusion and irregularities in the elections. The observers' spokesman said that the problems in electoral registries must be corrected by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] so that the run-off election, scheduled for 24 April, can be clean and credible. In addition, the group asked that the United States link the delivery of $55 million in economic aid to the correction of errors detected in the electoral registries. Such a request prompted diverse reactions among the presidential candidates who headed Sunday's election results: Armando Calderon Sol noted that the request lacks any basis. Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora said that it was a normal reaction in view of the expectations placed on the electoral process. The discontent of certain U.S. legislators, who observed the number of errors that marred Sunday's elections, became evident today, when they asked that the economic aid to El Salvador be retained until the anomalies in the electoral registry are corrected. The presidential candidates interpreted this petition differently: [Begin recording] [Zamora] Everyone was told that this was the election of the century, and yet, 47 percent of the people could not vote. Locally, this was frustrating to many people. But, internationally, it was also disappointing for many people and thus, they are reacting. [Calderon Sol] I think that this lacks any basis. I do not know the gentlemen who made this request, but when they hear what the United Nations and the international community said, I think they will change their minds completely. [end recording] The two candidates met with TSE magistrates on Wednesday. At the meeting they explained their points of view with regard to Sunday's elections and their proposals for the correction of irregularities to speed up the final count. [Begin recording] [Zamora] There are problems that, obviously, cannot be solved in one month, such as the approximately 300,000 people without voter registration cards. However, we can again begin a period to issue cards. But there is also the problem of what to do so people can find their names on the lists. [end recording] [Calderon Sol] I think that we should be pleased that the TSE has taken the attitude of welcoming our help and to show a will to overcome the problems. [end recording] The candidates trust that the TSE will correct the mistakes made on Sunday so that the run-off election can be carried out normally. They also suggested that a new period to obtain voters' registration cards be established.
