A positive answer to this question was given by Ukan Atabayev, president of Karatau, the republic's largest holding company, to [Kazakh President] Nazarbayev who paid a working visit to Zhambyl Oblast yesterday and today. The head of the republic was greatly interested in products manufactured by the joint Kazakhstani-Israeli venture set up at the Khimprom production amalgamation, namely corrugated and smooth-surfaced pipes made from polypropylene. Nazarbayev expressed his satisfaction with the hard work of the Zhambyl chemistry workers. In a difficult situation they did not begin to complain and pin hopes on the government to tackle all their problems. Their products are of high quality, competitive, and highly profitable. The head of state had a lively and interesting conversation with workers who felt very much at ease with him. First of all, they talked about strengthenning ties of friendship between representatives of various nationalities. Unfortunately, this friendship has been lost in a number of the former USSR republics. Traditionally good interethnic relations are maintained in Kazakhstan, but it does not mean that one can sit back and allow such an important issue to be developed on its own. They also discussed dual citizenship. The president said: "My opinion in this case is very unequivocal. Let the people themselves freely choose which country they want to live in, and then that country must give them citizenship quickly and without any obstacles. This would be better than having two passports and being indecisive for all of one's life where to reside." The president also had a warm meeting with orphaned children from the Ulan orphanage in Zhambyl. Children told him about their life and performed a concert. Nursultan Nazarbayev left for Kyrgyzstan today.
