Are you not apprehensive about that possibility? [Valeryan Viktorov, Federation Council deputy chairman] Oh no, I am not apprehensive. You must have noticed that we have very independently-minded people sitting in this hall, and I believe it would be difficult to put them in someone's pocket. For instance, the head of our chamber is Vladimir Filippovich Shumeyko, who is also a very independent person. He will not blindly follow instructions, be it from the president or from the head of our government, but on the other hand I am absolutely convinced that he will not enter into unnecessary confrontation between the president and the government.
