First of all, the political reform bills were killed today. What do you think of this? Especially, what do you think of the fact that many members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] voted against the bills? [Hosokawa] First, I regret that the four political reform-related bills were defeated in the House of Councilors plenary session. I truly regret it. It is very regrettable that we could not respond to the expectations of many people. They had hoped the reform bills would be enacted as early as possible. But I am determined to make an all-out effort for the enactment of the bills, since there are about 10 more days before the end of the current Diet session. I plan to ask the Diet to decide, in accordance with constitutional procedures, how the reform bills should be handled from now on. Fortunately, Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and other LDP members have clearly stated that they will seek to realize political reform during the current Diet session. Thus, I hope negotiations between the LDP and the ruling coalition will start immediately. Now, you mentioned that some members of the SDPJ, the largest force within the ruling coalition, voted against the bills in line with their convictions. It is very regrettable, but I believe the party will continue to give full support to the ruling coalition. I strongly expect the party to do so. [Dean of press corps] There seem to be big gaps between the government-proposed reform package and the reform plan put forward by the LDP. Does the government plan to make great concessions in negotiations with the LDP? Taking this stand, will the government negotiate with the LDP in accordance with constitutional provisions? [Hosokawa] I am not quite sure how the negotiations will be promoted. I am not sure whether both sides will negotiate at a meeting of the conference committee of both houses. At any rate, this is basically a matter of Diet procedures and the lower house's choice. The government will have thorough discussions with the ruling parties. [Dean of press corps] You said earlier you will ask the ruling parties to discuss the issue with the LDP in an attempt to have the bills passed during the current Diet session. I want to ask again how you will take your responsibility if you fail to have the bills passed during the current session, and I also want to ask if you have the possible dissolution of the House of Representatives or the resignation of the cabinet en masse in your mind? [Hosokawa] Let me answer the latter question. I am not thinking about it. There are some days remaining. My biggest task now is to do my best to have the bills passed. [Dean of press corps] Now, other reporters can ask questions. [Unidentified reporter] The opposition camp points out that in a series of Diet deliberations, the ruling coalition's way of managing the Diet has been high-handed. Mr. Prime Minister, in your view, do you think the ruling coalition should conduct self-examination about some aspects of its management of the Diet? [Hosokawa] Since the bills have been sent to the House of Councilors, about 70 days have passed and nearly 70 hours were spent on discussions. In view of this fact, I naturally think the Diet has been managed properly in accordance with parliamentary rules. My view is that the ruling parties' management of the Diet was not heavy-handed. I feel the ruling parties have respected the rules of Diet management as much as possible in managing the Diet. [Unidentified reporter] You said earlier you will study possible negotiations with the LDP after seeing through moves within the ruling parties. In fact, a general view is that it is impossible to have the bills passed without the cooperation of the LDP either at the conference committee of both houses or at the House of Representatives. Basically, when negotiating with the LDP, do you intend to take a stand of making further concessions? [Hosokawa] Well, I have no idea. But since the bills were rejected, I think the room for compromise has widened more than before. [Unidentified reporter] I want to ask questions about this point. You have said discussions will be held at the conference committees of both houses, which means talks among representatives from each party or group. But are you considering holding a summit meeting with LDP President Kono immediately -- which, incidentally, I heard has been canceled -- before or after the discussions of the conference committees of both houses? [Hosokawa] I have been saying it is a good idea to hold the meeting if the time is ripe, and my position is unchanged. But I need to see how discussions between the ruling parties and the opposition parties will develop. If the situation requires, in the process of the discussions, I will be willing to hold a summit meeting. [Unidentified reporter] There are many remaining proposals, such as budget compilation and the issue of income tax reduction, which have to be discussed. Are you going to change the Diet schedule because the final decision on political reform will not be made until next week? [Hosokawa] Well, the government, with the Economic Planning Agency at the center, is trying to draw up economic measures as soon as possible. We will start work on the third supplementary budget as soon as we finish forming the economic measures. However, we need to incorporate the economic measures in a budget. Moreover, some days will be needed for printing the budget. We will try to form the supplementary budget by shortening these processes as much as we can. We will continue our process of forming the 1994 budget. My feeling has not changed at all. I feel that we need to introduce economic measures as soon as possible in order to avoid creating apprehension about the current economic situation. There are many difficult issues, as you have pointed out. However, the government, regardless of the circumstances, will try to shorten the process as much as possible. I am sure we can shorten some clerical work. [Unidentified reporter] I would like to ask you again about your political responsibility. You explained earlier, in response to a question regarding the possibility of dissolving the lower house in case discussions with the Liberal Democratic Party end up in failure, that you were not thinking about dissolution. Then, what kind of responsibility are you going to take should the discussions end in failure? [Hosokawa] As I have said earlier, my task is to do my best during the remaining Diet session. We have more than 10 days left. I know I am repeating what I said earlier, but this is what I feel now. [Unidentified reporter] When you became prime minister, you said you would take political responsibility should political reform not be realized before the end of the year [1993]. Now, you are saying you will realize it during the current Diet session. What are you going to do if you cannot do it before the end of the current Diet session? [Hosokawa] We still have more than 10 days left before the current Diet session ends. I am saying that I will do my best during this period. [Unidentified reporter] You have been trying to pass the four bills all at the same time. But, could you not separate the bill on prevention of political corruption from the other bills, and approve it first? [Hosokawa] I do not think so. It is not a good idea to separate the bills. The LDP has been saying that too. Measures regarding prevention of political corruption are incorporated in the four bills. For example, the issues of transparency regarding relations between politics and money, and strengthening penal regulations are included in the bills. Moreover, I believe these measures will become effective when the political and electoral system reform bills are approved. Therefore, I do not think it is a good idea to separate the bills. This has been my fundamental stance and it has not changed. [Unidentified reporter] The bills were not approved because some members of the Social Democratic Party voted against the bills. Do you think this will change or have some impacts on the coalition government? [Hosokawa] I cannot say anything at this moment. I have to wait a little while. I hope what you have said will not happen.
