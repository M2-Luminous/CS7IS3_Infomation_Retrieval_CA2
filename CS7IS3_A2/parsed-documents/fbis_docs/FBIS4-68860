Hotovchyts and other officials: "Mr. President! Put a Stop to a New Chernobyl!"] [Text] Dear Leonid Makarovych! We feel compelled to write to you concerning Edict N0. 64/94 "On Urgent Measures Regarding the Development of Nuclear Power Engineering and the Formation of the Nuclear Power Cycle in Ukraine"--an Edict signed by you and dated 23 February 1994. It must be acknowleged that this Edict was not coordinated or reconciled with the departments concerned, and this has led to several contradictions between its provisions and the legislation now in effect. This fact has also led--correspondingly--to the impossibility of carrying out certain decisions. First of all, that part of the Edict which pertains to the burial of radioactive wastes contradicts the "Concepts of the State Regulation of the Safety and Administration of the Nuclear Industrial Sector in Ukraine," as adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Council on 25 January 1994. The principal questions in this problem concern the burial of radioactive wastes. In the "Concepts..." adopted by the Supreme Council, as well as in the draft laws "On the Utilization of Nuclear Power and Radiation Protection" and "On Safety Procedures With Radioactive Wastes," which were officially submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers to the Supreme Council for examination and consideration, it is specified that the utilization of nuclear power and the burial of wastes are to be carried out based on the principle of delimitation between these sectors of activity. Nor can we deem feasible the instructions with regard to the tasks of creating a medical-santitation administration within the Derzhkomatom [State Committee on Nuclear Power] and subordinating the medical-sanitation sections of the AES's [nuclear power stations] to it, for this would violate the existing system of health care in Ukraine and would inflict substantial damage to those measures which are carried out in direct subordination to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, taking into account the existing shortcomings, as well as the practical experience gained in eliminating the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl AES. The Derzhatomnahlyad [State Committee on Nuclear Power Oversight] cannot provide for or ensure the execution of measures regarding the modernization of existing AES units or put new power units into operation because--in accordance with the Government's decrees--it is a regulatory and oversight organ in the sphere of utilizing nuclear power. What we need is more detailed study and grounds for justifying the possibility of putting another power unit of the Chernobyl AES into operation in 1995. We must likewise take into account the fact that any decisions regarding the introduction of new power units at existing AES's and the organization of new enterprises for processing uranium can be adopted only after appropriate expert opinions have been rendered and reconciled with the regulatory and monitoring organs. There are several other observations to be made with regard to the above-mentioned Edict. Therefore, taking into consideration the factors cited by us here, we request that you rescind this Edict and send it back for further work and reconciliation by the departments concerned.
