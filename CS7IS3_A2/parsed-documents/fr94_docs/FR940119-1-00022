FR940119-1-00022 FR940119-1-00007 Paragraph (c) would require that range improvements constructed or implemented on National Forest System lands must be as unobtrusive as possible while still accomplishing the purposes for which the improvement was required. This could involve fences or water storage facilities being constructed in a visually inconspicuous fashion or the use of vegetative treatments in an environmentally sensitive manner. Paragraph (d) would require that in administering the domestic livestock grazing program, measures must be instituted to protect and conserve riparian areas. This could take the form of restrictions on place, time, or manner of livestock grazing and would be in furtherance of protecting and enhancing fish and wildlife habitat which is one of the management objectives of the HCNRA. Summary The proposed rule establishes standards for National Forest System lands within the HCNRA to ensure that the activities which occur on the National Forest System lands within the HCNRA are compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA was created. The proposed regulations have been carefully drafted to include only those management standards and guidelines which are nonduplicative. Except in those instances in which there would be a direct and irreconcilable conflict, this proposed rule would not supplant the Forest Service's existing regulatory authority related to National Forest System lands. This regulatory authority covers a panoply of subjects including, but not limited to, range management (36 CFR part 222), timber (36 CFR part 223), minerals (36 CFR part 228), off-road vehicle use (36 CFR part 295), archeological resources (36 CFR part 296), and historic and cultural properties (36 CFR part 800). Nor would this proposed rule simply restate the current regulatory authority of the Forest Service to administer the National Forest System lands. Instead, this proposed rule would augment existing regulatory authority to establish standards and guidelines that would address the subject matter areas identified in section 10 that were of particular concern to Congress when the HCNRA was established in 1975. Public comment is invited and will be considered in adoption of a final rule. In summary, these standards and guidelines will protect and preserve historic, archeologic, and paleontologic resources; provide for the use of motorized and mechanical equipment; provide for the use of motorized and nonmotorized rivercraft; and establish the permissible scope and extent of timber harvesting, mining, and grazing on National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. In so doing, the Forest Service will be able to ensure that the natural beauty, historical, and archeological values of the HCNRA are preserved for this and future generations, and that the recreational and ecological values and public enjoyment of the area are thereby enhanced. Regulatory Impact This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 on ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule also has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. , and it has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by that act. Environmental Impact This proposed rule is promulgated in accordance with section 10 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 460gg&hyph;7. The affected environment and consequences of implementing management alternatives for the HCNRA were analyzed and disclosed in the Environmental Impact Statement for the Comprehensive Management Plan that was implemented by the Chief of the Forest Service on May 23, 1981. The analysis completed for the Comprehensive Management Plan was revalidated in April 1990 with the signing of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Record of Decision (page 1). A review of this proposed rule indicates no potential for significant effect on the quality of the human environmental other than that previously disclosed in the Environmental Impact Statement. The environmental consequences of any future projects will be subject to site specific analysis pursuant to Forest Service National Environmental Policy Act procedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950, Forest Service Handbook 1909.15). Therefore, no additional environmental documentation is deemed needed on this rule. Information pertaining to the environmental analysis may be obtained by writing or calling the persons or offices listed under ADDRESSES and FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
