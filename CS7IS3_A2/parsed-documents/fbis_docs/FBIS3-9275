How much money do you specifically need, and how would you spend it? [Miller] You know, of course I need more of it than I have right now, but I am happy that, at least when it comes to some items, I have more money than I used to. For instance, when it comes to active forms of combating unemployment, my ministry has almost 6 trillions zlotys [Z] at its disposal right now, whereas we used to have just Z3.5 trillion. That is an increase of over 60 percent. So there are reasons for me to be happy with that. But, when it comes to social assistance, the situation is not as good there. The Z16 trillion that constitute the amount at the disposal of local governors will meet this year's needs at approximately the same level as last year. [passage omitted] [Reporter] There is ever more talk of unfulfilled election promises that were made by the now governing coalition, even though only six months have gone by. When asked whether he will sign the budget, President Walesa said that, if he does decide to sign it, it will be with the reservation that society was treated with disregard once again, in the sense that something was promised to society, and it is being given something completely different right now. Are you to blame for that? [Miller] Because you want to talk about election promises, let me remind you that there were all kinds of promises made then. For instance, our opponents from the election campaign used to say that, if the left wing wins, political isolation of Poland will follow. That did not happen. They also said there would be economic isolation, as well, that the West would turn its back on us. That did not happen, either. These opponents also said it is time to start buying vinegar in grocery stores--and, as far as I can recall, Mr. Borusewicz said he has already done that--because there will be nothing left in the stores. They also said one would have to introduce food-rationing coupons and so forth. So let us also confront these promises that were made back then. Of course, I am happy that these particular promises have nothing to do with the current reality. But what I would have to do is ask you [addressing the reporter] which specific promise you mean. If, for instance, you mean that we said that the level of the lowest retirement pensions and other kinds of pensions must be raised, the fact is that we did even more than what we promised because we said we would implement a 3-percentage-point raise effective 1 January, but, when it comes to retirement pensions, the actual raise is 4 percent. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I am not sure why, but there have been no questions so far on the strike situation. Do you plan on using force in the event of a general strike or if electricity is cut off from the building of the Council of Ministers' Office [URM]? There are such doubts in trade union circles. [Miller] I cannot assume that a situation could take place where the URM building should be deprived of electricity because there are other ways of supplying it there. [Reporter] But when it comes to a general strike? [Miller] Of course, a general strike is a big danger, and, because you mentioned it, the current conflict with Solidarity is taking place kind of on two levels: The first level is about real social problems. After all, no sane person could say that there are no families for whom life is extremely difficult; in fact, the situation of many Polish families is indeed tragic. But the other level of the dispute is about an argument concerning the ways and methods of solving the conflicts. We cannot treat Solidarity any differently from all of the other trade unions. The previous government treated Solidarity in a privileged way, and then it was brought down by that very Solidarity. We cannot make the same mistake. We will be trying to establish such areas of negotiation that are based on equal treatment of all trade union centers. So, if Solidarity wants to force the government to treat it differently, the government will be in a very difficult position. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Are you not afraid of other kinds of dangers? After all, we had a debate on the budget in the Sejm, but the president does not have to sign the budget, anyway. It may turn out that a completely new situation will emerge. What will the coalition and you do then? [Miller] Of course, Mr. President does not have to sign the budget, but the budget will be in force anyway because I am convinced that the Sejm would reject a presidential veto. That is because even those Sejm deputies who voted against the budget when it was being voted would vote against the president right now. Simply put, the Sejm will be aware of what it would mean. A nonrejection of a presidential veto would mean the Sejm's dissolution. I think that, if the president were to make such a move, the intention would be to have the Sejm dissolved. Well, the fact is that the Sejm will successfully defend itself against that. So I would simply urge Mr. President to just sign the budget. [passage omitted]
