Why? [Zinger] We approved a document in Cairo last Tuesday. It was close to an agreement. Now, we are trying to obtain the Palestinian and Israeli leaders' approval of that document. Despite certain statements, we have received signals that the Palestinian reply would not be "Yes" or "No," but "Yes, but." The Egyptian side is exerting great efforts with President Yasir 'Arafat. Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, his adviser Usamah al-Baz, and Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa told us in the presence of the Palestinian delegation that they would try to make the agreement possible. The main idea was that if 'Arafat's reservations on the document were rather positive, 'Amr Musa would visit Israel to try to persuade us to accept the Palestinians's reservations. We have presented our concept to the Palestinians in 108 pages under the headline: "The Israeli Proposal: Agreement on Gaza Strip and Jericho Area," dated 22 December 1993, and the Palestinians presented their concept in a similar file. We are now trying to come out with a unified, acceptable concept. [Al-Husari] When will the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement be signed? [Zinger] We are now discussing four subjects defined by Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat to be solved before other subjects. They are: 1. Foreign security along borders with Egypt and Jordan. 2. Crossing arrangements on border points. 3. The size of the Jericho area. 4. Other issues pertaining to the size of settlements in the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted] [Al-Husari] Yitzhaq Rabin said that he was not sure about Israeli withdrawal by 13 April. Is that surprising? [Zinger] He is right. The Declaration of Principles stipulates that the implementation will begin immediately after signing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and that we will still have four months to go, starting from the date of the signing in order to complete the withdrawal. If we do not end the negotiations within four months, the withdrawal will be postponed. If we do not sign, no withdrawal will take place. However, I believe we can reach an agreement and sign it by mid-April. [Al-Husari] It is clear to everybody that Yasir 'Arafat needs a quick agreement. Is Israel in a hurry too to reach such an agreement? [Zinger] I do not know if we are in a hurry. We have made commitments and we want to comply with them as soon as possible. We must expect a delay of a few weeks or months, but this situation must not drag out further since the agreement risks meeting the same fate as that of Camp David. We wanted to negotiate with the PLO because it was facing problems and was about to disappear. We realized that it was in nobody's interest for it to disappear and for Israel to remain alone facing several organizations, none of which is able to speak in the name of all the Palestinian people and to impose itself on them. Therefore, a further delay in implementation of the agreement could lead not only to the PLO's disappearance, but also to its collapse. This is in nobody's interest. [passage omitted] [Al-Husari] You were quoted as saying at the meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee that the military rule will remain the source of power in the self-rule areas. What does this mean? [Zinger] In the Declaration of Principles we agreed to dissolve the civil administration and end the military rule, but without dissolving it. The powers that will not be transferred to the Palestinians will remain in the hands of the military rule. The headquarters of the military rule will be located anywhere outside the self-rule area in Gaza. The work of the military rule will focus on the affairs of the settlements and the Israelis. [Al-Husari] Will the military rule continue to issue military orders as the case has been since 1967? [Zinger] I do not know. The military rule might issue orders related to settlements, such as preventing the Israelis from entering Gaza. And the only way to do this is through military rule. The military rule might also issue orders related to external security. The important thing is that, theoretically, we are not talking about independence. Therefore, we will not abolish the military rule and will not completely end Israeli control. [Al-Husari] Will you maintain military rule because you think there will be a need to return to the occupied territory one day? [Zinger] If I can read the Israeli Government's mind well, I think Israel does not want to return to Gaza at all. On the contrary, it might fear that one day this will be its only choice if the Palestinian police force fails to carry out its duties. We might be forced to do something we hate to do. We want to leave the Gaza Strip and never go back to it. Another situation might emerge if a large-scale war breaks out in the region. [Al-Husari] Does this apply to the West Bank? [Zinger] The situation in the West Bank is very complicated. For this reason, we are only talking about Gaza first. There are many differences between Gaza and the West Bank. In the West Bank, we are facing on the eastern front countries, who are still in a state of war with Israel. This situation does not exist in Gaza, because in Gaza there is only Egypt. In Gaza, there are 4,000 Israelis, while in the West Bank there are 100,000 Israelis. We find a solution to the four settlement areas by linking them through one road to Israel. Therefore, the Israelis will use four roads in Gaza only. This, however, will be impossible to apply in the West Bank. [Al-Husari] Will the final status of the West Bank be different from that of the Gaza Strip? [Zinger] The answer might be yes and no. In Gaza, there is no water problem, while in the West Bank there is only one water reserve. And in Gaza there are no holy places while in the West Bank there are many holy places some of which are common [to Muslims, Christians, and Jews]. The West Bank is different from Gaza in everything. Therefore, we decided to concentrate on Gaza now and not to think at all, in the current stage, of what is taking place in the West Bank. [Al-Husari] Have you noticed any difference in the talks with the Palestinians when the negotiators are changed, such as the absence or presence of Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]? [Zinger] I believe that the Declaration of Principles could not have been reached in Oslo without Abu-Mazin and Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray']. They were the catalysts within the PLO, and they are the ones who understand the spirit of the Declaration of Principles. When we began talks on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles, neither attended these talks and we found ourselves in front of new people. The problem here is that those new negotiators have to begin from square one and that they sometimes think they can use their skills to improve the Oslo accord. However, since they were not in the operation room when the accord was concluded they do not know its real components because it was ready before them.
