SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Following is a summary of the Application; the complete Application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant, a Maryland corporation, is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end diversified management investment company. 2. On June 6, 1968, Applicant filed a notification of registration under Section 8(a) of the 1940 Act and a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act registering $25 million of common stock, all of one class (File No. 2&hyph;29239). The registration statement became effective on April 22, 1969, the date the public offering commenced. 3. On November 5, 1992, the Applicant's Board of Directors unanimously approved an agreement and plan or reorganization (``Plan'') between Applicant and Northwestern Mutual Index 500 Stock Fund, Inc. (``Index Fund''), a registered, open-end management investment company. 1 The Plan was approved by the Trustees of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (``Northwestern Life''), Applicant's sole shareholder, on November 5, 1992. The Plan provides for Applicant to exchange all of its assets for shares of the Index Fund. Applicant states that the primary purpose of the Plan was to eliminate the inefficiency of operating two funds with identical investment objectives and policies. 1 By Order dated March 25, 1993, exemptive relief was granted by the Commission under Sections 6(c) and 17(b) from the provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, permitting Applicant to exchange its assets for shares of the Index Fund. (Rel. No. IC&hyph;19356) 4. At Applicant's shareholders meeting on April 28, 1993, Northwestern Life voted its shares of Applicant in accordance with the instructions it received from its variable annuity contract owners and payees, as required by the provisions of the contracts. Of the total 108,774,561.12 shares of stock, representing shares outstanding on the record date of January 29, 1993 entitled to vote, Northwestern Life voted 105,615,661.11 shares, or 97.1%, in favor of the Plan, and 1,647,162.77 shares, or 1.5%, against the Plan. Northwestern Life abstained from voting 1,511,737.24 shares, or 1.4%. 5. On April 30, 1993, Applicant transferred its assets, consisting of 108,968,687 shares of common stock, with a net asset value per share of $1.42, 2 for an aggregate value of $154,337,887, to the Fund. In exchange for its assets, Applicant received and distributed to its shareholder 114,296,045 shares of the Fund, with a total value of $154,337,887. The exchange resulted in the complete liquidation of Applicant. The value of Applicant's assets and the value of the assets and shares of the Fund were calculated as of the close of business on the New York Stock Exchange on April 30, 1993. 2 The difference between the total of 108,774,561.12 shares voted on April 28, 1993, and the 108,968,687 shares outstanding on April 30, 1993, the date immediately preceding the liquidation and merger of Applicant, is a result of intervening issuance and redemption of Applicant's shares. 6. Northwestern Life paid all expenses incurred in connection with the Plan. These expenses totaled approximately $148,327, and consisted primarily of printing and mailing costs and filing fees. No brokerage commissions were paid. 7. Applicant has retained no assets and has no security holders. Applicant does not have any debts or other liabilities which remain outstanding and is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. 8. Applicant has not, within the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of Applicant. 9. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. Applicant intends to file, after receipt of the relief requested, a certificate of dissolution or similar documents in accordance with state law. 10. Applicant states that it is current with all of its filings under the 1940 Act, including all Form N&hyph;SAR filings for each period for which such filing was or is required. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
