The Estonian delegation at present is headed by Defense Minister Juri Luik. Some sources say Luik is likely to be appointed the foreign minister in a series of changes in the government due before the Jan. 10 meeting of the parliament. The official status of the Estonian delegation rose first with Luik's appointment as defense minister. The Russian delegation is headed by Special Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin. "If we reach a breakthrough and an agreement on the main issues, including that of the troop withdrawal, and when only more prosaic and technical issues of detail remain on the agenda, we can easily replace the head of the delegation," Olljum said. He also said the Foreign Ministry already had a candidate for the new leader of the delegation, but added that he considered it premature to reveal the candidate's name.
