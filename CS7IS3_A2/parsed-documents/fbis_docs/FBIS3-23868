Yeltsin dissolved the deputy corps of Russia on 21 September, parliament's death-agony did not continue for very long--two weeks. At the same time, some of the deputies voluntarily gave up their deputy positions, while others are holding on to their badges to this day. As is the custom in our country, after any kind of turmoil there is a lengthy analysis of "who helped carry the wood" for the president, and who, for Khasbulatov. This time, thank God, it is not in order to execute by firing squad, but only simply to deny deputy privileges and social guarantees. Aleksey Surkov, an ex-deputy, was entrusted to head the commission established for this purpose under the president's administration. Edict No. 1435 of 23 September guaranteed all deputies a continuation of housing, job placement, an early pension, a large severance pay, and medical and health resort support. But part of the deputies ignored this edict, as well as Edict No. 1400, out of political considerations. Many from that irreconcilable opposition were the first to run to the cash department directly from the burning White House. This was N. Malkov, I. Muravyev, N. Ogorodnikov, T. Ponamareva, I. Rybkin, A. Sokolov, and others. It will be recalled--they received approximately 2 million rubles [R] each. Such hypocrisy on the part of people who incited a bloody tragedy, which almost became the starting point of a civil war, did not go unnoticed. By Edict No. 1590 of 6 October, social guarantees for the former people's deputies who remained in the White House to the end were canceled. Of course, we had to look into the rather delicate question. We are not the investigators, and we generally wanted to find out through questionnaires until what date a deputy was in the White House, whether he took part in mass disorders, and whether he instigated them. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Did the president make short work of political opponents through your commission? [Surkov] No, that is not the way people are dealt with. Today, many deputies are very surprised, seeing many "troublemakers" in "high" positions. According to Edict No. 1590, it was necessary to leave the White House before 3 October. But for several days before this, the very same people were approving decrees of congress right up to the execution of those who supported the president. We examined 530 personalities, carefully studied verbatim reports, and we also had a Ministry of Internal Affairs list of those who were led out of the White House on 4 October. As a result, 151 former people's deputies of the Russian Federation were identified to whom Edict No. 1435 does not apply. In accordance with complaints and statements, 13 former deputies on this list were authorized to receive severance pay. `BLACKLIST' V. Agafonov, A. Androv, Ye. Alayev, I. Anproyev, I. Andronov, A.

(The names of deputies who were newly elected to the State Duma and the Federation Council are published in boldface.) Thus, I think that everyone should know this list of antiheroes who, hiding behind walls, wanted to involve the whole population of the country in a bloody slaughter. I want to note that those who are on the list, but who have already received money, will be obliged to return it. This, in my opinion, is one of the reasons that many of them began to shout about reconciliation and general political amnesty. The trial of Khasbulatov and Rutskoy is disadvantageous to them. The chain will also stretch to the State Duma to those who urged the leaders on to a bloody confrontation. The very same method is being used to frustrate the criminal cases--through a deputy commission. FROM THE EDITORIAL STAFF. In publishing the "blacklist," we are refraining from making our own comments. Some will assess it as a political sentence for the extremists, and some will perceive them to be heroes. But everyone must make this choice for himself.
