In their talk the two will try to resolve the remaining disagreements. Minister Peres will also demand that 'Arafat supply information on the Israeli MIA's and captives. Our correspondent Dov Gilhar reports: [Begin recording] [Gilhar] Bucharest is becoming another stop of the peace train. Peres has left for an international economic conference in Romania, where he will meet with 'Arafat in an attempt to overcome the last obstacles in the Cairo talks. [Peres] Besides the MIA's issue, most of the talk will focus on how to bring about the conclusion of the negotiations from the viewpoint of issues, timetable, and arrangements. [Gilhar] In the wake of the report you heard from Major General Shahaq this morning, do you believe it will be possible to conclude the negotiations by next weekend? [Peres] I do not know if this will be the case indeed, but the impression is that we are at the final stage, and barring unexpected developments, we may be able to conclude the negotiations within two to three weeks. [Gilhar] In tonight's meeting Peres will also demand to receive information on the MIA's issue. Before his departure Peres heard a report on significant progress on civilian matters at the Cairo talks. The Israeli delegation leaders came from Cairo to Jerusalem this morning to brief the foreign minister and prime minister on the remaining disputes. Rabin heard from Maj. Gen. Shahaq that the talks are delayed over the PLO's demands that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] prisoners be released and that it exercise legal powers also regarding Israelis who move through the autonomy areas. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 20 April reports on the Cairo talks, adding that "several issues have remained unresolved in the deliberations of the Security Committee. The problem of the prisoners' release has not been solved yet, although an agreed timetable was already set for the release of 5,000 prisoners: 2,500 will be released upon the signing of the agreement, and the rest will be released three weeks after the signing. The Palestinians demand that a timetable be set for the release of another 3,500 prisoners approximately, including Hamas members, but Israel is opposed to this." On civilian matters, "three questions remain open, and they will be transferred to 'Arafat and Rabin for decision: the question of area code for Gaza and Jericho; the Palestinian stamp; and the passport."]
