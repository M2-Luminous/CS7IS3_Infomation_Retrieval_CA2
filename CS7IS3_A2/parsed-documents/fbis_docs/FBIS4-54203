An era of reconciliation and cooperation can begin only when North Korea embraces a policy of co-existence and cooperation, Han said in his keynote speech at the opening of an international seminar titled "Nuclear Policies in Northeast Asia." The seminar opened at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security (IFANS) under the joint sponsorship of the UN Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) in Seoul for a two-day run. Over 60 experts from home and abroad are participating in the seminar including UNIDIR director Sverre Lodgaard, German Ambassador at large Josef Holik, Tokyo University Professor Takashi Inoguchi and a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, Tan Han. South Korea fully supports extension of the NPT beyond its scheduled expiration in 1995 and also favors strengthening the nuclear safeguards measures of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Han told the seminar. The seminar is divided into four sections on the nuclear policies of Northeast Asia, the potential for nuclear proliferation, preventive action against such proliferation, and the nuclear policies of Russia, China, Japan, the United States and South and North Korea.
