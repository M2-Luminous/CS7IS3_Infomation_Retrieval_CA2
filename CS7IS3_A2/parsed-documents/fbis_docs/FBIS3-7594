(NTT). Hosokawa told the House of Representatives Budget Committee he never met the investment consultant who said he arranged the deal on behalf of Hosokawa. "I have never met (the consultant) nor sought his advice," Hosokawa said in response to a query by Taro Nakayama of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Japanese Communist Party lawmaker Zenmei Matsumoto. What the consultant says "is not a fact," he said. Hosokawa says the share transaction was conducted by his late father-in-law. It is not known whether the deal was legal. Earlier, Shuzo Fujiki, the consultant, said at an LDP-arranged press conference in the Diet building that the transaction was the prime minister's own. Fujiki said he arranged a 418 million yen loan for Hosokawa's former aide from a stock investment company to help finance the purchase of 300 NTT shares in 1986 just after NTT went public. Fujiki said the stock investment financing company agreed to allow Hosokawa to use the name of his father-in-law at the request of Hosokawa's financial secretary Masatoshi Miyama. When Fujiki visited the company in October 1986 with Miyama, the former Hosokawa aide asked a company official to permit the use of a name other than Hosokawa's for the account for the loan. Everything concerning the transaction was conducted "on the assumption that it was Mr. Hosokawa's own deal," Fujiki said. He said he is willing to testify before the Diet about his allegations. Over Miyama's involvement in the stock deal, Hosokawa said all he knows is that Miyama provided advice to his father-in-law from time to time, dismissing the call for Diet testimony on the matter by the former aide. Concerning a murky loan Hosokawa took from a scandal-tainted trucking firm, Sagawa Kyubin, which had paralyzed the Diet budget business for three weeks, the Communist Party's Matsumoto said there were some faults in the documents the prime minister submitted to the Diet. But Hosokawa only responded by saying, "They are all documents maintained by Sagawa Kyubin." "I borrowed 100 million yen from the company, and nothing more," he said.
