[Karadzic] Good evening. [Brkic] Could you summarize for the listeners of Belgrade Radio the events concerning peace negotiations on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and express your expectations for 1994. [Karadzic] First, I want to congratulate this official, international new year to all citizens of the Serbian lands, particularly the fighters on the defense lines of the Serbian lands, although I think that there will be opportunities to congratulate them on our own traditional Serbian Orthodox New Year. I want to congratulate them and thank them on behalf of all those whom they have saved and on behalf of the sacred and great aim that they are accomplishing by risking their youth and their lives. I also want other citizens to see the centuries-old aim of the Serbian people being realized next year, namely common life in a common state. 1993 has certainly been a year of great tests for the Serbs, because the world has found itself out of balance and to some extent off track, as all things in physics and nature fall off track when they are out of balance. The interests of major powers are simply congealed and, unfortunately, the Serbian people and their state have again found themselves on the path of big powers, above all on the path of German interests in Europe. This year was marked by the brutal and unscrupulous realization of the big powers' aims, the total lack of international law, the absence of any scruples, and great dangers for the Serbian people with unprecedented threats. I think that the past year was also a year for Russia's gradual recovery. This was also a year in which many Orthodox countries realized what was going on and extended either more or less support to the Serbian people and Serbia. Certain changes and improvements for our benefit also happened in Europe, because there are conflicting interests in Europe itself. The brutal policy of Germany has opened the eyes of, above all, the British, who have realized what is going on. Unfortunately, this policy has even more firmly tied the French to Germany. This was a year in which we withstood pressure exerted on us because of the Vance-Owen plan, which we rejected, a year in which President Clinton assumed his post, a year in which he had to bear the burden left behind by the previous administration, the burden of anti- Serbian views and attitudes. We also witnessed the United States slightly distancing itself from the crisis in Yugoslavia this year. In brief, this was a year that will be remembered by the Serbian people for unprecedented pressure, which they withstood, as well as unprecedented dignity and resistance of the Serbian people. Next year, we expect relations in the European Union and the world as a whole to further differentiate themselves. We expect uniformity to be restored to some extent. We expect the United States to concentrate on Asia and we expect many European countries, even some from the European Union, to try to oppose German domination. We expect Russia to become stronger and declare its interests in the Balkans, which also affects the Serbs, and we expect Greece to invest a great deal of effort in the first half of next year on settling the Yugoslav crisis -- particularly the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Brkic] Mr. President, at the end of our conversation, I would like to thank you on behalf of the First Program of Belgrade Radio on the exceptional cooperation during 1993, cooperation that enabled our listeners to always be timely informed on what was happening in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the international scene, and at the negotiations. You personally made a great contribution. Finally, we hope that peace will be established in this region and that you appear on our programs more as a poet than a politician, because, as Branko Miljkovic said, he who does not listen to a poem will have to listen to a storm. [Karadzic] Thank you very much. I must say that you deserve more thanks than we do. Radio and Television of Serbia and, thus, Belgrade and Novi Sad Radios have been closely following us and our struggle since 1990. They saw that this struggle was just and did not spare any efforts to help us. We are brothers and perhaps words of gratitude from each side are superfluous. I believe that this is what makes us a nation, one being. It is good that gratitude exists on both sides. [Brkic] Thank you and good luck.
