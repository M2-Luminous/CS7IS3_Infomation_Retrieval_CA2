Most people are stunned by the recent moves of some students and people from dissident groups and the working-class domain. They think that awareness of the current situation by some students and dissidents is quite different from that of the ordinary people. For example, at a time when the civil defense drill was being staged on 15 June, some college students staged a demonstration opposing the drill. Seeing this, the ordinary people silently asked them, "which nation are you the people of?" From this, we can note that there is no common factor whatsoever in the awareness of the situation between the ordinary people and some students and dissidents. The differences in the awareness of the situation are prompted by differences of opinion regarding how one should accept the situation taking place recently within and around us. There is a great possibility that acts carried out on the basis of such biased viewpoints may spoil the way along which the nation's destiny should advance, thus creating a serious problem. A democratic society is a many-sided society which is not absolutely dominated by one particular allegation or a certain sense of values. In a democratic society, various different allegations and different ways of thinking are respected by each other, and are coexisting. This being the case, many allegations and assertions are put forward over a certain issue and situation, and heated debates are to take place. This is precisely a characteristic and merit of a democratic society. In view of this, one should not merely totally blame the act of opposing sanctions against North Korea and calling for a solution to the problem through dialogue by so-called dissident groups; the act of some college students who staged demonstrations opposing the civil defense drill; and the act of voting to strike in an attempt to solve the worker-management problem by the National Alliance of Subway Workers Trade Union. However, the present situation is remarkably different from any other one. We would like to advise them to act by taking this fact into consideration. Today, in the face of a possibility of North Korea's nuclear armament, we are discussing whether we should leave this as it is or not. Whether North Korea comes to have nuclear arms or uses the nuclear issue merely as a diplomatic card, we will face the danger of war because of unexpected events that may break out in the course of pushing and pulling the nuclear problem. Therefore, we should refrain from acting to cause such a crisis. We have often witnessed from past history that optimism and an appeasement policy in time of a crisis rather deepened and expanded such a crisis. We should not forget that allegations and acts recently taking place within ourselves may cause and fan the misjudgment of the North Korean authorities, and even the issue of labor-management dispute, which is not directly related to the nuclear problem, cannot be the exception. At present we are discussing the nation's fate, and are facing a possibility of war, though it is not great. Concurrence in an awareness of the present situation is needed more urgently than ever before, and the sense of responsibility for the result of one's act and an awareness of the reality are required more keenly than ever before.
