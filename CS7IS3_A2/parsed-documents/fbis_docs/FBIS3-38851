French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur meanwhile told a cabinet meeting "he had personally asked for an ultimatum" to be given to the Serbs, government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said. Balladur said he was following the situation with "particular vigilance" and that a "turning-point" had been reached over Bosnia, Sarkozy added. "Everyone must understand that nothing will be easy", Balladur was quoted as saying. The French officials said the Franco-American proposal was that the Serbs withdraw or regroup their artillery, tanks and mortars outside a 20-kilometer (12 miles) radius of Sarajevo or face air strikes, the officials said. They said the French and the Americans agreed on a joint proposal Tuesday evening after intense consultations among the allies that followed Saturday's killing of 68 people by a mortar shell in Sarajevo. The French had proposed a 30 kilometer (18 miles) radius, but the two sides finally cut it to 20 kilometres, the officials said. However, an exception was made for a small area around Pale, seat of the Bosnian Serb parliament, on the heights above Sarajevo. The proposal made no mention of regrouping Bosnian Moslem heavy weapons. The officials said that after the 10-day deadline, all heavy weapons found in the exclusion area would be liable to destruction.
