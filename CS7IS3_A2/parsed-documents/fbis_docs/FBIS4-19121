Of the Netherlands voters, 29 percent would vote for Kok as prime minister, against 22.5 for D66 [Democrats 66] leader Hans Van Mierlo and 18.5 percent for CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] leader Elco Brinkman. This was revealed in a survey conducted by Interview Office on behalf of the ANP Press Agency and Nova, a TV current affairs program. Compared to four weeks ago, Kok took a remarkable step forward. At that time, 26.0 percent voted for Van Mierlo, 24.3 percent for Brinkman, and only 19.5 percent for Kok. Just like four weeks ago, VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] leader Bolkestein is lagging far behind the three others. He is now the most popular choice for prime minister for 11.4 percent of the voters, against 10.1 percent four weeks ago. Kok's progress is mainly due to an increasing popularity among voters from his own PvdA and from GroenLinks [Green Left]. Four weeks ago, hardly 70 percent of PvdA voters and only 20 percent of GroenLinks voters wanted Kok as prime minister. These percentages have now risen to 88 and 52 percent, respectively.
