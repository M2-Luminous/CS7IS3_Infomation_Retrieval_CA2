"Italy has taken part with great commitment in international actions, not only with the European diplomatic and political negotiations, with the Americans, Russians, and the sides in conflict, but also by putting its bases at the disposal of NATO for air action and with the naval patrols and the management of the embargo," he said in an official statement. "The truce at Sarajevo is certainly an important success for peace action, but it must not make us lose sight of the primary need to help the sides to find concrete and lasting solutions that respect the many human and political needs of populations that have suffered and which face a dim and uncertain future. "That is why the Italian reaction -- preliminary, since Yeltsin's ideas have still to be made known -- must be very reserved, if not actually negative: the formula proposed by Russia excludes Europe, just when the European Union peace plan has acquired -- again yesterday at the Bonn meeting with the Americans and Russians -- a truly central place in the common peace effort. "Even the United Nations, whose legitimacy in the conscience of the international community is a basis for the more peaceful post-Cold War world, would be excluded from the so-called 5-nation summit. "It certainly strikes us as negative that Italy was not cited as one of the participants, but we do not know if the summit will take place, given the aforementioned incongruities. Our role, and our action for a cause in which we believe, with the full support of Parliament and the country, would certainly not be diminished by it: but the effectiveness of international action would certainly be diminished by a prevalently inter-posed, misplaced and hurriedly prepared event, just when the hopes of tortured populations were beginning to find some concrete elements to express themselves."
