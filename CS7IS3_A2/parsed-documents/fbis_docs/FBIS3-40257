[Lorincz] I know the officers and generals of the Hungarian Army professionally, and not from a political viewpoint. Therefore, I can responsibly state that most of the Hungarian soldiers are worth appreciating for both their professional activity and moral stand. Obviously, we had dirty affairs that cast a shadow on this image, but I think one should not evaluate the entire army and its officers and generals on the basis of these affairs. Our soldiers are disciplined and are carrying out their tasks in accordance with their oath. I do not recall a single case of failing to carry out my orders, although similar cases often took place in our region. Our staff of officers are not mediocre and, despite their faults and problems, they are worth much more than society thinks. [passage omitted] [Fekete] Mr. Lorincz! How would you describe the army that you are going to hand over to your successor on 1 March? [Lorincz] The army has preserved its combat readiness even if it has become unhappy. The most important thing is that we succeeded in stabilizing it, because the army is a very sensitive organization that can only function under calm circumstances. If there is no stability and everything disintegrates simultaneously, unpredicted changes can emerge, and this leads to new tensions. I think we did not succeed in concluding anything, but we started something. From an offensive army belonging to the Warsaw Pact, we began building a national army capable of carrying out defense tasks. This is a very complex process that needs 10-15 years to complete. We had to carry out radical changes at a much faster pace than normal. In addition, we had to do all this in harmony with the social changes. We had to meet the challenges of the prevailing international situation, and I do not only mean here the war in Yugoslavia, but also the reevaluation and restructuring of our entire system of military contacts. I know that we received a lot of criticism for not having this process concluded to this very day. I think our economic conditions give a perfect answer to this: Our budget is constantly decreasing and we are constantly using up our reserves, while our military equipment has become obsolete and the living standard of our professional staff continues to deteriorate. [Fekete] What do you regard as the biggest shortcoming of your activity of more than four years? [Lorincz] I could not do enough for our professional staff, commensurate with what their activity, moral stand, and honesty deserve. I am leaving a dispirited army. Not because the army does not agree with the changes, but because it has less opportunity to creatively assist these changes. I am convinced that, now when we are laying the pillars of the post-1995 Hungarian Army, we should pay much more attention to the living problems of our professional staff. [Fekete] What are the pillars you are talking about? [Lorincz] We have already begun the process of developing the armed forces and creating the legal regulations of a new democratic army, because the Parliament adopted the security policy and defense principles, and a new defense bill has also been legislated. The bill on the soldiers' legal status is already on the government's table, a bill that, hopefully, would guarantee the long-term living conditions of our professional staff. We also started working out the personnel bases of the future army, including the new leadership and organizational principles. Last, but not least, an improvement in our military technology and weapons is currently under way. If I succeeded in contributing to all these processes, I can say that I am satisfied. [Fekete] What is your opinion about the chances of the Hungarian Army to integrate into NATO? What new burdens would this mean for Hungary and for the Hungarian Army? [Lorincz] The greatest advantage of the Partnership for Peace program is that it represents a realistic burden for the countries wishing to participate in it. We do not want to participate in a quantitative race; we would like to offer our quality to our partners. This could represent more both in time and funds than what we think today. [passage omitted]
