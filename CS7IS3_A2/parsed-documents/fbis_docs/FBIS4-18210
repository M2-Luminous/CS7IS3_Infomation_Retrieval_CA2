Forza Italia chief Silvio Berlusconi reiterated today that he feels he is the best person for the job, saying that the leader of the largest force in parliament should be given that privilege. The League, on the other hand, is throwing its weight behind its own Lower House whip Roberto Maroni. While Left Democrat Secretariat member Franco Bassanini repeated his party's line that TV and publishing tycoon Berlusconi would have too many conflicts of interest were he to enter government, the name of former President Francesco Cossiga as a possible premier refused to lie down. The controversial former head of state received a cold reception from League Senate whip Francesco Speroni who said "what an ugly name. Cossiga is really the oldest of the old," but in the neo-fascist National Alliance, the other major element of the Forza Italia-League right-wing Freedom Pole, the rejection was not quite so categorical. National Alliance chief Gianfranco Fini reminded journalists that Cossiga, a life senator, has decided to bow out of active politics, but "should he decide to return to the field, he could not, of course, play a minor role." From outside the political world came what seemed to be encouragement for Berlusconi, with Fiat Chairman Gianni Agnelli saying that in older democracies "it is always the leader of the party which took most seats who heads the government." Luigi Abete, head of the private employers' association CONFINDUSTRIA [General Confederation of Italian Industry], agreed: "These elections were one more step towards the modernisation of the country's political system, and the line-up which won on points has the right and duty to govern." Some confusion has arisen, however, over just which party did take most seats: though Forza Italia and its close minor allies the Christian Democrat Centre took a total of 186 seats in the two houses, to the League's 176, by subtracting Christian Democrat Centre votes, Forza Italia's share stands at 142. Whoever ends up governing, however, the unions today promised that they would not take a back seat. According to CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] assistant secretary general Guglielmo Epifani, "we want to get the power of trade union confederations back into the game," pushing such topics as employment, pensions and the welfare state to the fore of the government's agenda. While the right haggled to find a government programme and leader, the left tried to work out where the Progressive Alliance went wrong, and began looking to the future. Isolated voices, such as that of Socialist Party Senate whip Fabrizio Cichitto, calling for the resignation of Left Democrat Party chief Achille Occhetto were countered by Left Democrat spokesman Claudio Petruccioli who said that "the issue of Occhetto's resignation did not even arise" in a party secretariat meeting today. Occhetto's Left Democrats were by far the largest element in the Progressive alliance, which took 335 seats in the two houses. Constitutional expert Augusto Barbera of the Left Democrats suggested that Occhetto stay put until he had succeeded in forging a Progressive Party, taking on board all the centre-left forces which joined in the Progressive alliance in the March 27-28 vote, then step down to inject younger blood. For Fausto Bertinotti, chief of the Communist Refoundation Party, a Progressive Party would be going too far, but regular consultations between the alliance members to decide on strategy in parliament will be necessary. Bertinotti came down strongly against a suggestion that the Progressive allies form a single parliamentary group. From Sicily, Palermo's Mayor Leoluca Orlando of the anti-Mafia Network put the left's defeat down to a frantic but pointless search for unity on programmes: "The right certainly did not waste much time seeking unified proposals, and they took a larger percentage of votes in all kinds of social areas." Outside Italy, the elections prompted a furious reaction from one Socialist EuroMP who will be trying to have those Italian Socialists who went with Berlusconi's Forza Italia thrown out of Strasbourg's left caucus. A comment by Greece's minister for European Union affairs Theodhoros Pangalos, who talked in a TV interview of "Berlusconi's rabble" seizing power through "media magic," got diplomatic hackles up, and Italy's ambassador to Athens was dispatched by the Rome foreign ministry to tick Pangalos off. Having dealt all day with the thorny issue of who should become premier, Silvio Berlusconi found himself faced with another leadership problem this evening when he went to watch the AC Milan soccer team, which he owns, play Anderlecht in a European Cup bout in Milan. Should conflicts arise between his political role and that of chairman of Milan, Berlusconi is prepared to set aside his footballing hat, but in this case, finding an alternative will not be difficult: "Whatever happens," he told journalists, "I think I would hand the team over to someone from the family."
