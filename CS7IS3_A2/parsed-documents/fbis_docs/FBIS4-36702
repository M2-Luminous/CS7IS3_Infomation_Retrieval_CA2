[Sha'th] Without a doubt. President 'Arafat is returning to his homeland, in any case. But armed with support, he stands a better chance of doing something for his people and, at the same time, building the Palestinian authority. [Mu'addi] There are conflicting reports about the date for Mr. Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area. Do you know when he will arrive? [Sha'th] I am afraid I do not know for sure. President 'Arafat has his own schedule and plans. He is now preparing for the African summit in Tunis. He has to tie up some loose ends before he leaves Tunis. He cannot leave anyone behind without a plan of action. He cannot leave and close PLO offices in Tunis just like that. He does not want to leave the impression that he is letting anyone down. There are a few things that he must attend to before he moves out from Tunis. I was in touch with him yesterday, and today in the morning, and just a few minutes ago. I can tell you that he is coming before the end of the month, God willing. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, you have attended the recent conference of the donor nations in Paris, where a decision was made to extend at $42 million grant to the Palestinians. How will the money be spent? [Sha'th] This is part of the $77 million that represent the deficit in the current budget. The money will also cover vital projects to help those Palestinians who have been hurt the most. The money will not cover the long-term projects toward which the donor nations pledged $720 million for this year. Work on some of these projects is already in progress with the participation of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the Palestinian Housing Authority, and the UN Development Fund. These are separate projects. The Paris meeting considered only how to plug the deficit in the current expenses, in other words the finances required for running the Palestinian government and the upkeep of the Palestinian police force. The money will also go toward reducing unemployment in Gaza and rehabilitating freed detainees and the disabled and wounded and those who have suffered the most as a result of the protracted struggle. [Mu'addi] There have recently been some complications regarding the Palestinian detainees and collaborators. How did the agreement between Israel and the PLO address these two points? [Sha'th] As far as the detainees are concerned, the agreement is very clear. By the fifth week of the signing of the agreement, 5,000 detainees are supposed to have been freed. Israel is supposed to have freed 5,000 detainees as of today. Other than that to which the PLO committed itself, they will not be obligated to anything. In my opinion, this is a fair condition. The Palestinian government and opposition should not differ about the general conditions under which the detainees are released; namely a commitment to the peace process and the terms agreed upon between the PLO and Israel. Regarding the presence of these freed prisoners in Jericho or elsewhere, the agreement calls for those who were imprisoned for common rather than political crimes -- there are those who were guilty of theft, smuggling, and murder that have nothing to do with resistance and the struggle in which we were involved -- to be handed over to the Palestinian authority either to be incarcerated or put on parole. Since the Palestinian authority will be active only in Gaza and Jericho in the coming three months, these should remain in the self-rule area until the Palestinian authority extends to the entire West Bank. As for the political prisoners who were convicted on political counts and for their engagement in acts of resistance, they must be freed to return to their homes in Gaza, Jericho, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. These are the conditions laid out in the agreement which we have to implement, and we must see to it that these detainees lead free lives in their homes with their families so that the peace begins in earnest and so we may leave the past conflict behind us. With the release of the 5,000 detainees, negotiations should have begun without delay to draw up a timetable for freeing the rest of the detainees and prisoners along the same lines and principles which we agreed should govern the freeing of the first 5,000. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, when do you expect to arrive with your family in the self-rule area? [Sha'th] Tuesday, the day after tomorrow, God willing. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you so much. [Sha'th] Thank you.
