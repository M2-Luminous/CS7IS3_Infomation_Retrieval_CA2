He affirmed the official Lebanese stance that when Israel withdraws from the south, the Army will be ready to take on its security duties. We guarantee that there will not be any operations against Israel through the south. Minister Dallul today received doyen of Lebanese editors Milhim Karam, who interviewed him on current issues. [passage omitted] On the Army's preparedness to assume all security duties in the country, Minister Dallul said the Army has progressed a great deal, but we are preparing it to be able to restore security to the south when Israel withdraws. [passage omitted] Doyen Karam asked whether the Army was strong enough in the south, especially after some U.S. doubts about this were voiced by Ambassador Hambley. Dallul answered: If the United States or Ambassador Hambley are suggesting that the Army is not confronting the resistance, then this true, because the resistance is carrying out activities against the occupation. Does Washington want us to strike at the resistance in the interest of the occupation? The Army's deployment in the south is strong and extensive. When Israel withdraws, the United States will see that the guarantees we are talking about are serious. But for us to turn into a police force that protects the occupier is something we shall not do. It would be treason to our country. Minister Dallul denied that the Government has any information about Israeli pilot Ron Arad. When his plane was downed, there was no legitimate authority in Lebanon. We all know that, he said. He added that extensive investigations are taking place with regard to those who cooperated with Israel by allegedly leading the occupants of the two Israeli aircraft to al-Dirani's home to kidnap him. The defense minister refused to discuss judicial investigations regarding the assassination of [Dany] Sham'un and the church blast, because this is a judicial matter. With regard to holding Ja'ja' in the Defense Ministry, he said: As defense minister, I have to allocate one of the prisons belonging to the ministry in which to hold the prisoner. So I chose the Defense Ministry's building so that he can be properly interrogated, and for his own sake. As for the way he is being treated, it has become well-known: He asks for juice, toast, or yogurt, and gets whatever he wants. The orders for the food he wants are placed in the name of the officers guarding him rather than in his own name in order to protect him. I believe that his life is more secure inside the Defense Ministry prison than anywhere else. [passage omitted]
