Individuals wishing to attend the meeting, including individuals wishing to make presentations should contact Ms. Rebecca Hardy at 202&hyph;395&hyph;3501 prior to 3:30 p.m. on August 16, 1994, for clearance to the NEOB. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan E. Alesi, at 202&hyph;395&hyph;6803, Office of Federal Procurement Policy. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 7, 1993, the Vice President released the report of the NPR which required simplification of the procurement process by rewriting the FAR, shifting from rigid rules to guiding principles. According to the report, the FAR, which is the government's principal set of procurement regulations, is too process oriented, changes too often, minimizes discretion of procurement officials, and stifles innovation. The Board intends to develop a plan to rewrite the FAR to move from a system of rigid rules to guiding principles, promote decision making at the lowest possible level, eliminate unnecessary regulatory requirements, facilitate innovative contracting and develop a more effective process to listen to its customers. This project will be accomplished under the direction of the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy with the assistance of a Board of Directors comprised of senior-level officials from the Executive Branch. The Board has begun planning the FAR rewrite project by defining two approaches and by drafting a model FAR Part 9 that adheres, for the most part, to the drafting principles outlined in this announcement as the first approach. However, if the FAR is actually rewritten along the lines of the model, we expect that there would be additional material and more than one optional approach or illustration to be included in many parts of the nonregulation part of the model. The Board intends to recommend adoption of the NPR philosophy of giving greater flexibility in the formulation and administration of contracts. Questions for Commentors To assist the Board in its deliberations, it is requested that all interested parties review the proposed approaches, drafting principles, and illustration of the model rewrite of FAR Part 9. This notice solicits comments on the proposed approaches for the FAR rewrite and not on the content of the model rewrite of FAR Part 9. In preparing comments the Board requests that commentors consider the following questions with regard to each approach: 1. Does the proposed approach represent an improvement to the existing FAR system? If not, please suggest an alternative approach. 2. Does the proposed approach remove from the regulations system unnecessary, burdensome direction while still providing the procurement community with sufficient common policy and principles? If not, please suggest an alternative approach. 3. Does the proposed approach increase discretion and encourage innovation while still fostering good contracting practices? If not, please suggest an alternative approach. 4. Does the proposed approach simplify the procurement process? If not, please suggest an alternative approach. 5. Does the approach of publishing nonregulation information in an acquisition manual provide useful guidance for contracting officers in decision making, formulating process or practical solutions, identifying alternatives? If not, please suggest an alternative approach. 6. Does the proposed approach for the Code of Federal Regulations to contain only the regulation component of the model raise any concerns for you? If so, please suggest an alternative approach.
