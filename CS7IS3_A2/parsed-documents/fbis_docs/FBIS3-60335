"The GATT as it stands right now seems to have a trade-at-all- costs attitude," Greenpeace said while the WWF attacked the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) that will administer the GATT agreement. "The MTO will have the power to override national laws on environmental protection, health and safety," WWF director Gordon Shepherd said. "Uruguay Round drafts show that trade negotiators have failed even to establish a trade and environment committee within the proposed MTO," he said. Charles Arden-Clarke of Greenpeace said that by ignoring the environment the credibility of the MTO had been damaged before its inception "at a time when the environment and sustainable development are at the top of the international political agenda." Representatives from 115 nations are meeting here in an attempt to end the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
