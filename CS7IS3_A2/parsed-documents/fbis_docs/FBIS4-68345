Honor and Russia Barkashov-Style"] [Text] Aleksandr Barkashov too, it turns out, intends to put himself in the running in the presidential elections in 1996 and offer the people his model of society. Its essence is reflected in the "code of honor"--the party document of "Russian National Unity." Our correspondent Valeriy Batuyev met with Aleksandr Barkashov a couple of days ago. A couple of provisions of the code of honor: "The comrade-in-arms (party title.--ed.)...must restore justice to the Russian people with his power and his arms, without appealing to judicial or other authorities." "Any questions are decided by the comrade-in-arms, guided only by his national sense of justice in keeping with the authority granted to him by the Chief Comrade-in-Arms, and he obeys no other laws." "The comrade-in-arms must constantly recall that Russia has no friends. Anyone who forgets this becomes a traitor." "Persecution of foreign and domestic enemies of the Russian Nation, regardless of how far they might be outside Russia's borders, is a matter of honor for the comrade-in-arms." "The comrade-in-arms can cleanse himself of shame only with blood." "Betrayal is the most heinous crime for the comrade-in-arms and is punishable by the death sentence." [Batuyev] Aleksandr Petrovich, what do you mean by the word honor? [Barkashov] This is a person's internal condition (each person concretely!) as well as the general condition of people who are joined together by a national or civil principle. A person cannot allow others to spit in his face. Regardless of what kind of spit it is: social, political, ethnic...if small ethnic groups can join into communities to protect their political and ethnic interests, the Russian people have been deprived of this right. As soon as we join together to protect our national interests, people immediately begin to call us chauvinists and fascists. Is that not spit? [Batuyev] "Everything for the Nation. Nothing against the Nation. The Nation is above all." It is this "life principle" of the comrade-in-arms that gives many people justification for calling you Nazis or fascists. [Barkashov] Since they have no alternative to our ideology, they have no arguments with which to respond to us, they, like little children, descend to the level of name calling and pin labels on us. Yes, I am a Nazi. What is wrong with that? Nazi consists of two words--nationalism and socialism. The first is the elevation, the revival of our nation, and socialism is social justice, that is, I am in favor of what the communists and democrats are fighting against. [Batuyev] If you are really guided by the teachings of Jesus Christ with respect to the Russian people, certain points of the Code: "A comrade-in-arms can cleanse himself of shame only with blood," and "betrayal is punishable by the death sentence"--contradict the Christian "thou shalt not kill." [Barkashov] If the comrade-in-arms has violated his oath, the Code of Honor, he must take actions which can wash away this shame. He can go to a "hot spot" and defend the interests of the Russian people. There are also other alternatives. [Batuyev] You said that you are offering a new model of society. [Barkashov] The power will belong to the people and at the same time be authoritarian. [Batuyev] That is, according to the principle of your party: The Chief Comrade-in-Arms, the other comrades-in-arms, the associates, and the sympathizers? [Barkashov] Quite right. The hierarchical ladder is not frozen in place. The most worthy people, the nation's cream of the crop, will advance to the power structure. [Batuyev] And all "non-Russians," "non-sympathizers" with your movement will end up outside our state? [Barkashov] Why so? Any state has a Constitution which determines the activity of any citizen. If he is obedient and follows this law of the society and the state conscientiously fulfills its obligations, this person can live peacefully in our state, even if he does not share our views. But if he undermines the system of our values, fights against them, and thus undermines the unity of our nation, the state, naturally, will have no place for him. [Batuyev] I have heard that many comrades-in-arms viewed your flight as a violation of the Code of Honor and that the attempt on your life on 20 December 1993 was made by them as a kind of revenge. [Barkashov] There was no flight. We all left together when a decision was made to cease resistance. I wanted them to arrest me along with Achalov, but the officer from the Ministry of Security said that he had no order for my arrest and he would not act arbitrarily. I left with everyone else. [Batuyev] On 6 October you were 40 years old. Where did you celebrate your birthday? [Barkashov] At someone else's dacha. It was 20 kilometers from Moscow. [Batuyev] But your neo-Nazi friends in Germany were waiting for you at that time. [Barkashov] Indeed, a group of our comrades-in-arms had gone to Germany and met there with people who share our views...without contacting me, the boys accepted their invitation, but I had other plans. I was in Moscow the whole time. True, I went to Belarus for three days. [Batuyev] What authority do you delegate to your comrades-in-arms? Is it possible for them actually not to obey "any other laws" of the society? [Barkashov] Only a person who enters our organization can know what this authority is. In what case can we go against the law? If the Constitution is changed by the will of several people, as it was in September-October, and is violated unilaterally, the other side automatically receives this right.
