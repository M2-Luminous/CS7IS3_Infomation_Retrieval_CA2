Aranibar Quiroga today ends his three-day visit to the Belgian capital. Aranibar met with high-ranking European Commission [EC] officials and held bilateral talks with Belgian ministers and public and private sector representatives. Aranibar held a news conference. He said that during his meetings with EC Vice President Manuel Marin and Juan Prat, the North-South relations general director, they reviewed the three-year EU program with Bolivia. The program will be signed in May during Juan Prat's visit to La Paz. Aranibar said the program "represents an effort to achieve an encompassing vision" to "optimize our cooperation." The basic guidelines of future EC cooperation with Bolivia include the struggle against poverty, state modernization, environmental problems, sustainable development, and regional integration. The minister insisted on the importance of renewing and extending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) with the Andean Pact. "There is a commitment to extend and broaden it. That is a reason for our presence here," Aranibar said. The Bolivian minister said Bolivia has taken little advantage of the GSP. He said he wants "to make our agroindustrial trade to be more dynamic." During his meetings with Belgian authorities he talked about "our basic government plans to maintain democratic and economic stability" and "the search for economic growth with social democracy." "We want peaceful solutions for all Bolivian society's problems," said Aranibar after receiving Belgium's guarantee "to continue its cooperation effort, despite the economic difficulties facing European countries." Aranibar said that in the next few months a small evaluating team will travel to Bolivia to review the work of the Mixed Commission which controls cooperation. The minister said his meeting with his Belgian counterpart Willy Claes included "a very important exchange of information on our government's basic plans" and on the Bolivian offer to become "the point of contact and integration bridge with everyone in Latin America." Aranibar said: "We support American hemispheric integration" and NAFTA (signed between Mexico, the United States, and Canada). Aranibar travelled to Belgium with a small entrepreneurial mission. During meetings with Belgian entrepreneurs he insisted that the areas of oil, energy, telecommunications, airlines, and steel mills "offer opportunities to foreign investors. The idea has been received with a lot of interest here." "We seek trade more than cooperation," Aranibar said. The Bolivian minister handed Willy Claes an official invitation for Belgian King Albert II, asking him to visit Bolivia "whenever he deems it convenient." Aranibar Quiroga will travel to Sao Paulo on 21 April to participate in the Rio Group meeting with the European Unity (EU). He will then visit Germany and Spain.
