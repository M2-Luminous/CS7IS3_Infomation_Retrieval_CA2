In many situations changes in the value of h_n_[.sup]m[/] with irradiation can also be caused by the dependence of the h_n_[.sup]m[/] on the excitation intensity of the photoluminescence L, i.e. on the concentration of excess minority current carriers. The concentration is significantly reduced with increased irradiation dose �, resulting in a shift of the position of maximum luminescence h_n_[.sup]m[/] with irradiation, and appearance of a dose dependence h_n_[.sup]m[/](�), if h_n_[.sub]m[/]=�(L). Graphs were obtained of the maximum position of impurity radiation h_n_[.sup]m[/] as a function of the irradiation dose by fast neutrons �, measured in p-GaAs(Zn) for various excitation intensity L and concentrations of excess electrons �n. The graphs indicate that in the irradiated crystals, the luminescence maximum h_n_[.sup]m[/] is shifted into the low-energy region, if measurements are made at large L. However, the maximum does not change its position if the measurements are made either at small L, of under conditions �n=const. Figures 2, references 12: 7 Russian, 5 Western.
