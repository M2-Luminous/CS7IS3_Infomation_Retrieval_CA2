In a meeting with reporters in Vienna, David Kyd noted that since this plan clearly has a defensive nature, it will not represent a threat to anyone and that this plan is an issue between the United States and the ROK. Patriot missiles, which were developed and manufactured in the United States, were used during the Gulf war for the first time. These missiles successively destroyed Scud missiles fired by Iraq at Saudi Arabia and Israel. On 25 January, the U.S. Government said that the plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK was proposed by the commander of U.S. Forces in the ROK. This plan has not been approved by President Clinton nor has the date of deployment or the number of missiles been decided.
