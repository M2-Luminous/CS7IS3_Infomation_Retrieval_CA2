"Close air support has the full support of Mr. Stoltenberg and myself," Lord Owen told reporters after he and Stoltenberg, who have tried unsuccessfully to broker a peace agreement between Bosnia's warring factions, met here with Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu. He added however, "We would be much happier if we can achieve the UN mandate without that." Lord Owen, who represents the European Community, said: "What has been agreed by the UN Security Council is that there should be a close air support" and "that UN forces, when charged with a UN mandate, have the right to protection for themselves and for carrying out the mandate of the Security Council." He said: "These are air strikes that we'll take primarily in a defensive position." Stoltenberg, who represents the United Nations, arrived here with Lord Owen late Wednesday as part of a tour of several countries neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia.
