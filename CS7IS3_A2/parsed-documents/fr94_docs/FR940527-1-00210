However, we know of no definitive studies that establish an appropriate level or range for this factor. ProPAC's adjustment is for the cost-increasing effect of new technologies only, and this year assumes the estimated costs for these technologies at only 0.3 percent. We believe there may be several shortcomings with ProPAC's recommendations with regard to technology. First, the estimate does not account for offsetting changes in revenue due to changes in DRG assignment. Second, it is not clear that all of the new technologies listed in ProPAC's study significantly enhance health status. To the extent the new technologies are not quality enhancing, an adjustment is inappropriate. Finally, some of the technologies have considerable potential for cost savings relative to the technologies they are replacing. • Change in Case Mix: Our analysis takes into account projected changes in case-mix, adjusted for changes attributable to improved coding practices. For our FY 1995 update recommendation, we are projecting a 1.5 percent increase in the case-mix index. We define real case-mix change as actual changes in the mix (and resource requirements) of Medicare patients as opposed to changes in coding behavior that result in assignment of cases to higher-weighted DRGs but do not reflect greater resource requirements. We estimate that 1.0 to 1.4 percent of the projected case-mix increase of 1.5 percent will be real. This estimate is supported by past studies of case-mix change by RAND Corporation. The most recent study by the RAND Corporation, ``Has DRG Creep Crept Up? Decomposing the Case Mix Index Change Between 1987 and 1988'' by G.M. Carter, J.P. Newhouse and D.A. Relles, R&hyph;4098&hyph;HCFA/ProPAC (1991), uses medical records from subsequent Federal fiscal years using consistent standards to determine real case-mix change. The study specifically suggests that real case-mix change is not dependent on total change, but instead is a fairly steady 1.0 to 1.5 percent per year. We use 1.4 percent as the upper bound because the RAND study did not take into account that hospitals may have induced doctors to more completely document medical records so as to improve payment. The resulting adjustment to account for changes in case mix during FY 1993, the most recent year for which data are available, is ^0.1 to ^0.5 percent (subtracting the projected case-mix of 1.5 percent and adding real case mix change of 1.0 to 1.4 percent). The 0.9 percent figure used in the ProPAC framework represents ProPAC's projection for observed case-mix change, and its projection for real case-mix change, including within-DRG case complexity change, during FY 1994. Consistent with ProPAC's framework, we are using a projection for case-mix change in our recommendation. • Effect of FY 1993 Reclassification and Recalibration: We estimate that DRG reclassification and recalibration for FY 1993 resulted in a 0.1 percent decrease in the case-mix index when compared with the case-mix index that would have resulted if we had not made the reclassification and recalibration changes to the GROUPER. ProPAC does not make an adjustment for DRG reclassification and recalibration in its update recommendation (we note that Congress asks the Secretary for an estimate of these effects in our update recommendation). • Correction for Market Basket Forecast Error: The FY 1993 estimated market basket percentage increase used to update the payment rates was 4.1 percent. Our most recent data indicate the actual FY 1993 increase was 2.9 percent, reflecting that the actual increase in wages was lower than projected. The resulting forecast error in the projected FY 1993 market basket rate of increase forecast is 1.2 percentage points. Our policy has been to make a forecast error correction if our estimate is off by 0.25 percentage points or more. Therefore, we are recommending an adjustment of ^1.2 percentage points to reflect this overestimation of the FY 1993 market basket rate of increase. The following is a summary of the update ranges supported by our analyses compared to ProPAC's framework.
