Therefore, it was difficult to prevent the incident. However, more preventive measures are now required for important places, while cooperation is being undertaken with various countries in preventing serious incidents, and good relations are to be maintained with Middle East countries.

However, cooperation has been sought with other countries that are expected to have a criminal background on the group of terrorists so that further police action can be taken to arrest them.
