Take notice that on June 13, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard Illinois, 60148, filed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;745&hyph;001 an amendment to its application filed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;745&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, for authorization to increase Natural's maximum daily deliverability at three of Natural's storage fields, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Natural indicates that in its original application, it proposed to construct and operate 16 injection/withdrawal wells, and associated piping and meters. Natural further states that it proposed to replace one compressor and two segments of storage field lines, in its original application. Natural states that the proposed construction, operation and/or replacement of facilities at two of its storage fields in Iowa, and one of its storage fields in Texas was designed to increase the maximum daily deliverability from its storage operations by an additional 250 MMcf per day, at an estimated construction cost of $14,650,000 for the jurisdictional facilities and approximately $6,137,000 for the non-jurisdictional facilities. Natural is amending its application, by deleting its proposal to construct and operate all jurisdictional facilities proposed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;745&hyph;000. Natural further proposes to amend its original filing to this proceeding by increasing its maximum daily deliverability at three of Natural's existing storage fields by 175 MMcf per day original proposed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;745&hyph;000.
