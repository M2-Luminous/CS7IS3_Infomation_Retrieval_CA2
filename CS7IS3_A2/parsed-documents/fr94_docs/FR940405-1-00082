FR940405-1-00082 FR940405-1-00013 (a) Physiological Parameters. The physiological parameters include (1) the body weight and the weights of the individual organs or tissue groups, (2) the total blood flow and flows to each organ or tissue group, and (3) the alveolar ventilation rate. These quantities have been reasonably well established for the human [Exs. 4&hyph;155, 4&hyph;309] and the chief effort associated with pharmacokinetic model parameterization in the human is the determination of the necessary level of detail for the physiological description, grouping of the tissues not meriting a separate description into pharmacokinetically similar groups, and the association of the proper volume and flow data with the selected groupings. Existing models for nicotine and cotinine contain a fairly detailed physiological structure and differ only slightly in their assignment of tissues. The model of Plowchalk and deBethizy [Ex. 4&hyph;254] includes separate compartments for the brain, heart, and skin. The first two of these tissues are lumped into a ``vessel-rich'' tissue compartment in the model of Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;270], and the skin is lumped in with the muscle. Conversely, the gastrointestinal tract is given a separate compartment in the Robinson model but is lumped into a ``slowly perfused'' tissue compartment in the Plowchalk model. These differences mainly reflect the different interests of the modeling groups in terms of target organs and routes of exposure. The Robinson model contains a venous infusion compartment to accommodate the mixing time for arterial administration. The published Plowchalk model does not include this feature, but a forearm compartment has since been added to provide a similar function [Ex. 4&hyph;83]. Neither model appears to contain an explicit description of inhalation or oral exposure, but the necessary equations could easily be added to the existing physiological structures. A salivary fluid compartment could also be added to either model if desired. Experience with other chemicals has shown that uncertainty in the physiological parameters generally has much less impact on overall model uncertainty because they are known relatively well and are not as influential on model behavior as the distribution and kinetic parameters [Ex. 4&hyph;56]. (b) Distributional Parameters. In both of the published human models, the tissue partitioning was initially estimated on the basis of steady-state tissue/blood concentration ratios measured in animals. The partitioning parameters in the Robinson model were then iteratively adjusted to fit other timecourse data. The resulting partition coefficients in the two models differ by a factor from two to five in corresponding tissues. The partitioning data for cotinine, determined by Gabrelsson and Bondesson [Ex. 4&hyph;112], show a similar level of uncertainty; partitions for cotinine following infusion of nicotine were two- to five-fold higher than the same partitions following infusion of cotinine. The lack of reproducibility of these data represents a deficiency in the development of PBPK modeling for these chemicals. Fortunately, the partition coefficients tend to be less important than the kinetic parameters in terms of overall model performance. To a large extent, as long as the volume of distribution associated with the physiological structure and partition coefficients is in agreement with the apparent pharmacokinetic volume of distribution for each chemical, the model will perform adequately in terms of timecourses in blood and urine. This was evidenced by the ability of the Robinson model to reproduce published nicotine and cotinine pharmacokinetic data [Ex. 4&hyph;270]. A potentially more significant uncertainty associated with distribution is the possibility of pharmacokinetically significant tissue binding of nicotine. Satisfactory description of the timecourse of nicotine in the brain, lung, and heart of the rat required the inclusion of binding in these tissues [Ex. 4&hyph;255]. Clearly, the relatively low capacity, high affinity binding associated with nicotine is unlikely to effect total systemic clearance except at very low concentrations. However, the existence of nonlinear pharmacokinetics at low concentrations could lead to a miscalculation of exposure for the least exposed individuals. It has been suggested that there is a longer clearance half-life for nicotine, and therefore cotinine, associated with low circulating concentrations, and that this longer half-life is due to the slower release of nicotine bound to tissues [Exs. 4&hyph;28, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;167]. To date, no careful pharmacokinetic investigation of this possibility has been performed in the human model, and adequate nicotine-specific tissue binding information does not appear to have been collected except perhaps in the brain.
