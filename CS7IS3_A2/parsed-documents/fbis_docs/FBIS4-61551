Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, believes that Azerbaijan will also accede to the treaty soon. RIA reports him as saying this today at a Moscow news conference. Vladimir Shumeyko believes that the main obstacle preventing Azerbaijan from signing the Bishkek agreement is the problem of de facto recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent party to the conflict. The leader of the upper house of parliament considers that a cease-fire in the conflict zone will only be possible when Azerbaijan recognizes Nagorno-Karabakh's independence.
