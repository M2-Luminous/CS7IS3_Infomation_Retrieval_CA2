Obviously, this is not true, because in Hong Kong all kinds of capital is assigned to the real estate market, and capital from PRC-invested enterprises only accounts for a limited percentage of the Hong Kong real estate market as a whole. Quite a number of PRC-invested enterprises in Hong Kong have a real need for real estate, and only a small number of them are speculating. Over the last few years, PRC-invested enterprises in Hong Kong have been active in developing their business; they have a strong need for all types of buildings for use as offices and production sites. This situation is similar to that of other financial organizations. But PRC-invested enterprises' activities in the Hong Kong real estate market have aroused particular concern because of their sensitive background. Apart from this, their rapid development has also caused such concerns. According to recent statistics published by the Hong Kong Government, PRC-invested enterprises play quite an important role in Hong Kong's economy. Take banking as an example. There are 15 PRC-capitalized licensed banks in Hong Kong, including 13 licensed banks affiliated to the Bank of China Group, and Ka Wah Bank and Union Bank, which belong respectively to the China International Trust and Investment Corporation and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Limited. PRC-capitalized banks have actively developed their retail business and expanded their branches, hence the need to buy real estate. In manufacturing industry, industrial projects with mainland investments amounted to 39 at the end of 1992, and total investment stood at HK$4.133 billion [Hong Kong dollars] calculated by original cost, the third largest source of industrial investment after Japan and the United States. Calculated on the basis of original costs, the total value of their total fixed assets amounts to HK$2.9 billion. This, of course, includes the value of factory buildings. A survey by the Hong Kong Department of Industry in 1993 on regional representative offices set up in Hong Kong by foreign firms suggested that PRC-invested enterprises had established 67 regional headquarters in Hong Kong and were working hard to catch up with U.S., Japanese, and British financial groups. Thus, it can be seen that PRC-invested enterprises have a strong need to buy all types of buildings. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small number of PRC-invested enterprises speculate in Hong Kong's real estate market, but this problem is not serious and has received proper attention from the relevant Chinese department. Some comments in society have attributed the cause of real estate price hikes entirely to speculation, overlooking the basic factor of supply falling short of demand. These comments have even blamed PRC-invested enterprises for soaring real estate prices. Evidently, this is irrational and unfair, because other financial groups are also speculating in the real estate market. Real estate prices and rents have kept rising in recent years. Unquestionably, this has much to do with real estate speculation, but in a free market economy, all commodity prices are determined by the balance between supply and demand. The Hong Kong Government bears a major responsibility for the real estate price rises of recent years, because it does not have a strategy and the supply of land is imbalanced. It takes more than one cold day for a river to freeze three feet deep. In curbing real estate speculation, the Hong Kong Government should not just introduce several short-term measures, as these cannot resolve the problems. Overly rigorous short-term measures could lead the economy into a predicament.
