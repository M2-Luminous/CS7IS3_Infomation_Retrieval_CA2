The airline association president has said it will be business as usual while airlines wait to hear about the measure. Frantz Desvarieux explains that the suspension of commercial flights could have some serious consequences for the airlines. Desvarieux, who manages Haiti Trans-Air, in Port-au-Prince, said his company would be particularly crushed if air traffic were suspended. Correspondent Rothschild Francois reports: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Desvarieux] It is a problem for the airline companies. The route is economically important to those companies that use it. It is the only route that Haiti Trans-Air uses. We would have to close. It would be economically disastrous. About 200 more people would be added to the country's unemployment list. It will be very difficult for we are a small company. [Francois] Vacation time is a good time for the airlines... [Desvarieux, interrupting] Generally speaking, this is the season. Summer is economically the best season for us. The same thing happened with the guys exporting mangoes. This is the mango season. They lost it. This is a consequence of what is happening in the country. [Francois] Did you receive any notice from foreign companies telling you not to make reservations for July or September? [Desvarieux] No. The regulations office did not give us any notice. These stories are out of the question right now. [Francois] Asked about the restrictions Haitian passengers must face when traveling to the United States because of the embargo, Desvarieux said he recognized that the situation is getting difficult for the passengers who used to carry a certain amount of luggage, especially on their return to Haiti. [Desvarieux] The passenger traveling from Port-au-Prince to Miami is only allowed to bring personal belongings on board. No commercial items are allowed. It used to be that you could bring certain products -- such as rum -- worth up to $100 with you without paying taxes. This is no longer allowed. Passengers are allowed to bring food on the return flight from the United States. U.S. customs sometimes checks for commercial goods and then seizes them. We recommend that passengers carry personal belongings and whatever is allowed. Passengers should not bring large amounts of commercial-looking items. They will have difficulties. [end recording]
