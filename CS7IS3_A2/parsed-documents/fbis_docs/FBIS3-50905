These statements were made by a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation after Washington announced its decision to reduce its purchases from China in the specified area by 35 percent. This would include sweaters, clothing, cotton products, and elements used in the maintenance of machinery: a reduction that exceeds $1 billion, which is considered to be a severe blow to bilateral trade transactions in the textile sphere.
