The party formulated its position during another Political Bureau meeting today to examine developments in the Cyprus issue in light of the upcoming proximity talks.

He said: We refuse to cover up this situation. Khristofias mentioned that if Kliridhis made the decision to attend the proximity talks, he will have to figure out how to return to the substance of the Cyprus issue. Khristofias added that the party will not withdraw from the National Council. Within the framework of the dialogue with other parties that began at EDEK's [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] initiative, DISI [Democratic Rally] and socialist party EDEK delegations met today at the DISI offices to discuss the CBM's. DISI Chairman Ioannis Matsis and EDEK Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis headed the delegations. After the meeting, Matsis and Lissaridhis made statements. Matsis said that every party has its own position on the CBM's and considers its approach correct. He added, however, that they have a common goal: To break the deadlock and end the occupation. Lissaridhis reiterated that his party wants to disengage from the CBM's and turn toward the substance of the Cyprus issue.
