He stated: It is necessary to organize the broad masses of cadres, and especially leading cadres, to continually and profoundly study the 'Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three; the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the basic theory of the socialist market economy; and the relevant state principles, policies, laws, and decrees; as well as to firmly master the principal spirit of each and every major reform; unify ideology; work for, submit to, and serve the overall interests; strive to successfully push ahead with reforms; work out new reform measures; gradually resolve the province's in-depth contradictions; and deepen reforms. Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: With the central financial strength becoming stronger with each passing day, the state gradually will make more investment in and accelerate the economic exploitation of central and west China. Therefore, we should firmly grasp the current excellent opportunity to quicken the pace of resource exploitation and economic development; bring into full play Qinghai's superior resources; take full advantage of the fact that Qinghai has a relatively small population; make redoubled efforts to build each and every locally based small and medium-sized resource exploitation project; secure more state investment in the locally based large and medium-sized construction projects; and strive to accelerate resource exploitation by developing lateral economic associations with neighboring provinces and regions, inviting more foreign and domestic funds; and developing compensation trade. Governor Tian Chengping maintained: It is also necessary to energetically and simultaneously build both the spiritual and material civilizations; to vigorously strengthen and improve ideological and propaganda work; to rely on the broad masses of people; to enhance solidarity; to vigorously push ahead with all types of work; to implement to the letter each and every basic party and state principle, as well as the spirit of the current meeting; to unify ideology; to strengthen confidence; to make concerted efforts; and to make greater contributions to building a stronger and more prosperous Qinghai.
