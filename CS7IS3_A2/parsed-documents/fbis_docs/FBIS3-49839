The goal of the talks, to which the press did not have access, was to find consensus elements in the views of the opposition parties that are prepared to assume responsibility for leading the country out of its current situation. A statement released for the press after the conclusion of the talks says that in the opinion shared by the opposition parties, they are able to come up with concrete suggestions regarding both political and economic-social problems. Today's talks prove that the opposition parties have the necessary foresight, will, and competence to ensure the economic recovery, social peace, political stability, and international credibility of the country, the statement says. Assessing that the current deadlock is the consequence of a government based on political alliances that are harmful for the country, as they allow for the access to power of certain non-democratic, anti-reform, extremist, and xenophobic forces, the current parliamentary opposition declares that it is ready to assume the responsibility for ruling the country. To that purpose the parliamentary majority has to be restructured and therefore the opposition expresses its readiness to set up a coalition government with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania -- ruling party]. The responsibility now lies with those who hold the principal levers of the current political power. If the political proposal made by the opposition is ignored, the solution to this problem should be given by means of the direct vote of the nation [early elections], the statement concludes.
