As a result of the recession, lower wages, prices, and interest rates, 21 million German marks [DM] less will be available in 1995 than estimated as recently as in May last year. The government alone will receive DM9.9 billion less. This was announced by the tax assessment working group today after four days of consultations at the Finance Ministry. Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) stated that this shortfall in receipts can be absorbed in the 1995 budget. The projection of the global shortfall serves this goal. In addition, personnel reductions are planned, and privatization will also yield proceeds. Waigel called on the laender and communes to exercise strict discipline concerning expenditure to curb the overall new indebtedness. Waigel considers the shortfall that has been caused by the economic situation to be a consequence of last year's serious recession but also the result of the "agreeable moderate development of wages, prices, and interest rates." They will have a dampening effect on the increase in the nominal tax revenue in the coming years. Thus, the assessment also reflects the "success of our stability policy." In view of the economic development, DM2.7 billion more in tax revenues are expected to be earned as compared with the short-term assessment for 1994. A total of DM375.9 billion fall on the government, which results in an additional DM1.9 billion.
