Sichuan produces over 40 percent of all the natural gas produced in the country. The Sichuan Petroleum Administrative Bureau collected scarce funds to speed up the exploration of the Datianchi, Wubaiti, and other new gas fields of the Chuandong Drilling and Prospecting Corporation. Many natural gas reserves were found, and not only did last year's natural gas output at the Chuandong gas field reach 3.9 billion cubic meters, it made Sichuan the leading contributor to the nation's natural gas reserves.
