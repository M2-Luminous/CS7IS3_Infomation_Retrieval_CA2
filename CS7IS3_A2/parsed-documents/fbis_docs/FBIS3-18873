In the second part of his report, Kasoulidhis added, the secretary general proceeds with an analysis of the problems that have arisen and the key points of which should be agreed upon by both sides, as they constitute the substance of the current phase of the proximity talks on the confidence-building measures. The government spokesman said that the UN Secretariat's approach is evident on some issues. Our side, has outlined its views, he continued, and it reserves the right to agree or disagree at the negotiating table. Kasoulidhis said that in the third part of the report the UN secretary general presents some notes related with the way the proximity talks will proceed starting tomorrow, the logical timeframe for expanding the talks, and the importance he attaches to the prospect of concluding an agreement, or not. Asked to comment on an observation that the secretary general's report takes a clear stance on issues about which our side has expressed disagreement, especially on the issues of turning over sovereignty over Nicosia International Airport and free use of it by Turkish Cypriots with their own travel documents, the spokesman said that he can not comment on issues under discussion at the negotiating table. Kasoulidhis added that our side sees in the report some approaches by the secretary general that are closer to our side and others that differ from our side's positions. Replying to a question, the spokesman said setting the end of March as the timeframe is reasonable to reach agreements on the seven major issues.
