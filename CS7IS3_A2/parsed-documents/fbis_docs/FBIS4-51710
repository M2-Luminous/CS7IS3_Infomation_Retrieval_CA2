FBIS4-51710 "dreas085_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Thailand Officials Comment on Thai-U.S. Aviation Talks Officials Comment on Thai-U.S. Aviation Talks BK0205131094 Bangkok THAN SETTHAKIT in Thai 21-27 Apr 94 p 55 BK0205131094 Bangkok THAN SETTHAKIT Thai BFN [Text] Speaking to a THAN SETTHAKIT correspondent about the recent Thai-U.S. negotiations on an aviation agreement, Warawut Bunyatket, director of the International Affairs and the Aviation Industry Division of Thai Airways International [THAI], said that THAI, for the time being, is not interested in increasing the number of its regular flights or opening new flights to the United States because it is rather difficult to make any profit from flying to that country due to strong competition and price cutting campaigns among the U.S. airlines. It is unlikely that THAI will make any change in its operation even if the new agreement allows it to fly up to 38 flights per week to the United States. He said: "In any event, what we want is equality in carrying passengers from third countries. The Thai side proposed a limitation on the number of passengers from third countries for each flight at 45 percent. We do not know if the U.S. side will accept it or not." Worawut went on to say that THAI is now engaging in a "code sharing" [preceding two words in English] operation through aircraft and ticket sharing with United Airlines as a means of maintaining its market share in the region pending the conclusion of an agreement with the United States that will incorporate destinations in the United States to which THAI can fly. Meanwhile, Mahidon Chantharangsuk, permanent secretary of the Communications Ministry and head of the Thai delegation at the next round of the aviation talks with the United States to be held in Bangkok in June, said the negotiations will cover the details of issues concerned, especially the sharing percentage [as published], the flight numbers, and new destinations in the United States requested by THAI. During the first round of the negotiations, the Thai side made four major proposals. First, the U.S. airlines operate 38 flights per week to Thailand -- 31 for passengers and 7 for cargo. Presently, three U.S. airlines operate 28 flights per week to Thailand while Thai has only four flights per week to the United States. Second, the U.S. airlines are required to carry at least 55 percent passengers from Thailand on each flight before it is allowed to carry passengers from third countries. Third, the U.S. airlines are required to carry up to 70 percent tourists on each flight on which they intend to seek permission to fly to a new destination in Thailand. Fourth, the total number of flights between the two countries is equally divided for airlines of the two countries. On the other hand, the U.S. side made two proposals. First, the Thai side should stop freezing the number of seats of each U.S. flight at only 290. Second, the procedure for the collection of the value-added tax should be revised. The permanent secretary of the communications minister said that the conclusion of an aviation agreement will further expand the aviation services between the two countries. He will encourage THAI to increase its regular flights to the United States. THAI is capable of making up to 11 flights per week to the United States.
