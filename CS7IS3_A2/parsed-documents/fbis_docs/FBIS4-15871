Latest Revelations by Former General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik"] [Text] [Bartnikas] Did anyone put pressure on you during the discussion of the question of the general prosecutor in the Federation Council? [Kazannik] I think that everyone had already realized that it was impossible to put any pressure on me. To buy me off or offer me positions. But when I was general prosecutor, they did try. For instance, they said: So you have got yourself an apartment; why waste your time, let us furnish it for you for free. I refused. But in the present case no one pressurized me. On the other hand, I know that the president's administration worked at the highest level with many deputies and tried to persuade them to vote only for the dismissal of Kazannik. But I wish it to be noted that deputies are more law-abiding than the president and his team. And in the vote two motives prevailed -- the purely legal, and the moral. [Bartnikas] Yes, but after all, the question of the general prosecutor was by no means closed by your dismissal.... [Kazannik] Agreed, a far from straightforward situation will arise. The point is that there is no provision for an acting general prosecutor either in the Constitution or in the Law on the General Prosecutor. Only the general prosecutor's deputies can perform his duties in his absence, and only in accordance with the general prosecutor's own directives. An outsider simply cannot do this. But this is evidently no obstacle for the president, although difficult legal problems arise here. For instance, supposing it is necessary to extend a period of detention in custody to 18 months -- that is the exclusive prerogative of the general prosecutor. Suppose that Ilyushenko extends this term; then any lawyer will state that it is illegal. And the accused will be immediately released from the detention center. [Bartnikas] Do you think that the disputes over the general prosecutor are linked primarily with a desire on the part of the president's team to have a puppet Prosecutor's Office, or is it simply a matter of personal dislike? [Kazannik] I think that they have one wish -- to be able to telephone the Prosecutor's Office and say: Don't do this or that. And I am sure that, had Ilyushenko been general prosecutor during the amnesty period, he would have released no one. After all, he obeys not only Yeltsin's orders, but even Kozhakov's (chief of the Russian Federation president's security service -- editor's note). And after all, the president's entourage put very strong pressure on us. For example, immediately following the October events, the Prosecutor's Office received from the president's administration instructions on how the investigation should be conducted. These instructions ran more or less as follows. No political trials should be conducted. No investigation team should be set up, but rather just five or six investigators should be assigned. The October events should be investigated within three to four days, everyone should be charged under Articles 102 and 17 -- that is to say for complicity to murder -- and the cases should be handed over to the military collegium for criminal affairs. The trial should last two to three days, and everyone should be sentenced to the death penalty. These documents were unsigned. But imagine what another prosecutor would have done in my position who might have said: It must be done; how simple everything is. I did not allow this. [Bartnikas] Are you not sorry to leave your post? [Kazannik] Yes, I leave with regret. The post is not the point, nor are the privileges. I thought that I would be able to deal a serious blow to crime, including organized crime. But the latter cannot exist without corruption of the state apparatus. After all, how come that people in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] say: We know the location of around 15,000 bands, but we do not possess more detailed information. I am curious to know how it can be that people know the ringleaders by sight, they know their aliases and so forth, but they are still at large. And therefore I planned to check how the law on operational investigations activity is observed in all regions. I think that we would have determined why the MVD does not have the relevant information or does not want to have it. In addition, I wanted to reform the General Prosecutor's Office -- I wanted to reduce the central apparatus by one-half; after all, we have many departments where people are worn out through having nothing to do. However, I think that it would not have been possible to have remained an honest prosecutor. [Bartnikas] And one last question -- have you handed in your credentials? [Kazannik] Not yet. Incidentally, Acting General Prosecutor Ilyushenko fired me as long ago as 15 March -- either he has a poor grasp of legislation, or he was fulfilling an order from the Kremlin. In the near future I will take all my documents from the Prosecutor's Office, but I will be obliged to hand over the Russian general prosecutor's credentials.
