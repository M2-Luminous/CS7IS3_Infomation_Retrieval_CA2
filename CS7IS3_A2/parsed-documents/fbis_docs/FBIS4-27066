Provincial party Deputy Secretary and Governor Jia Zhijie presided over yesterday's meeting. Present at the meeting were provincial party Deputy Secretary Qian Yunlu and Ding Fengying, Li Daqiang, Deng Guozheng, and Huang Zhiyuan, Standing Committee members of the provincial party committee. In his speech, Guan Guangfu fully affirmed the gratifying achievements scored, over the last few years, by the leading bodies of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government in improving their style of thinking. [passage indistinct] [passage omitted] Some leading bodies and leading cadres have little interest in theoretical study. Some leading cadres' sense of purpose is getting blunted, and ideas such as money worshiping, hedonism, and out-and-out egoism are spreading among them. A small number of cadres are corrupt. Some leading bodies inadequately practice democratic centralism and are disunited and uncoordinated in action. Still other leading cadres have a superficial style of work, lax discipline, and are inefficient in work. We should attach great importance to these problems and take effective measures to solve them. [passage indistinct] [passage omitted] Guan Guangfu pointed out: In the new situation, in improving the style of thinking of the leading bodies of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide, we should comprehensively improve their quality and genuinely build them into strong and fighting collectives which are firm politically, bold in making reform and blazing new trails, united and coordinated in action, and are able to perform official duties diligently and honestly, maintain close ties with the masses of people, and comprehensively implement the party's basic line. Therefore, at present and for a certain period of time to come, in improving the style of thinking of the leading bodies of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government, we should pay particular attention to the following aspects of work: 1. We should thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, learn about socialist market economy, and strive to enhance our ability to solve practical problems by using theories as a weapon and to control the overall situation of market economy. [passage indistinct] For leading cadres to study theories, what counts is perseverance, willingness, and an effective guarantee in terms of systems. The core-group study system of the leading bodies of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government should be upheld. 2. We should practice democratic centralism, do an ever better job of maintaining unity among leading body members, foster an idea of keeping the overall situation in mind, enforce discipline, strive to achieve unity with the party Central Committee ideologically, politically, and in action, ensure that government decrees are implemented smoothly, and promote Hubei's reform, development, and stability. [passage omitted] 3. We should effectively improve party style and strengthen the building of clean government and strive to set a good example in performing official duties diligently and honestly. Persisting in opposing corruption and encouraging honesty, improving party style, and strengthening the building a clean government have always been the focus of the party building in the new period and especially improvement of the style of thinking of leading bodies. [passage omitted] 4. We should improve our leadership methods, change our work style, and improve our work efficiency. Leading bodies should start with overcoming formalism, enhance the sense of approaching things realistically and stressing practical results, and creatively do their work in light of the actual conditions of their subordinate departments. Leading bodies should energetically conduct investigation and study, adhere to the concept of from the masses and to the masses, go down to grass-roots units to extensively solicit the opinions and demands of the masses, find out the contradictions and problems existing in their practical work with comrades at the grass-roots units, study work, sum up the new experiences the masses have created in practice, offer specific guidance, and help them solve practical problems. [passage omitted] In conclusion, Guan Guangfu stressed: Secretaries of the working party groups (party committees) of various departments should effectively and personally take up the job of improving the style of thinking of leading bodies and play an exemplary role in this regard. [passage omitted] More than 1,000 persons including members of the working party groups (party committees) of the various departments, commissions, offices, and bureaus under the direct jurisdiction of the provincial government attended the meeting.
