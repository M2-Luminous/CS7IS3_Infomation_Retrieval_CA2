FR941020-0-00013 FR941020-0-00005 In addition, the Commission is making some non-substantive revisions. The definition of marketing in §161.2(c) has been revised, because the definition cross-referenced a section of the Commission's producer regulations that recently was removed by the Commission in an order that eliminated all of the producer regulations at Part 270. 5 The Commission is revising other regulations to clarify that they apply only to marketing affiliates and not other affiliates of pipelines. 5 Removal of Outdated Regulations Pertaining To The Sales of Natural Gas Production, 59 FR 40240 (Aug. 8, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶30,909 (July 28, 1994). II. Background and Summary of Order No. 566 The Commission, in Order No. 497, 6 issued a rule intended to prevent pipelines from providing preferential treatment to their marketing or brokering affiliates. The rule adopted Standards of Conduct (codified at Part 161 of the Commission's regulations) 7 and tariff and reporting requirements (codified in §250.16). 8 The Standards of Conduct established the principles applicable to relationships between pipelines and their affiliates. In general, the Standards sought to prevent pipelines from favoring affiliates with information or transportation discounts not available to non-affiliates. The tariff provisions required pipelines to include a variety of information in their tariffs, such as a list of operating personnel shared with affiliates, the information required in transportation service requests, and the procedures used for complaint resolution and for informing shippers about the availability and pricing of transportation services. The reporting requirements required pipelines to file information relating to transportation transactions with affiliates and to maintain the same information for non-affiliated shippers. 6 Inquiry Into Alleged Anticompetitive Practices Related to Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, Order No. 497, 53 FR 22139 (June 14, 1988), FERC Stats. & Regs.

In Order No. 636, the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers by requiring pipelines to unbundle their sale of gas from their transportation service and by implementing changes in the terms and conditions for providing transportation service. For example, the Commission required that pipelines establish EBBs to provide information about available firm and interruptible capacity on the pipeline, including the firm capacity available through the newly established capacity release mechanism. 9 9 Sections 284.8(b)(4); 284.9(b)(4). The Commission also has issued Order No. 563 promulgating standards governing the methods by which pipelines will provide information about available capacity through their EBBs.

In light of the changes effected by Order No. 636 and by the Commission's review of its existing Order No. 497 requirements, the Commission in Order No. 566 made significant changes in the Standards of Conduct and the tariff and reporting requirements. The Commission eliminated the Standard of Conduct dealing with gas subject to take-or-pay relief, because the Commission had established procedures in Order No. 636 for dealing with gas supply realignment costs. The Commission revised its Standard of Conduct H (prior Standard of Conduct I) to coordinate its posting requirements relating to affiliate discounts and thereby eliminate duplicative EBB postings. Former Standard I required pipelines offering discounts to affiliates to make comparable discounts contemporaneously available to similarly situated shippers. The Commission retained this requirement, but modified the regulation to codify its policy that pipelines use their EBBs to provide non-affiliates with the contemporaneous notice required by the Standard. This modification further enabled the Commission to eliminate a duplicative reporting requirement, in §250.16, under which pipelines had to post similar discount information on their EBBs. The Commission eliminated a number of the tariff requirements, retaining only the requirements that tariffs must include a list of operating personnel and facilities shared by the pipeline and its marketing affiliates and a provision establishing the procedures used to address complaints.
