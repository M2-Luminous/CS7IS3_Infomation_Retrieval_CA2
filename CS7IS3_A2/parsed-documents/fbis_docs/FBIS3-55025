In December, the parliament's rightist opposition demanded to take a vote of confidence in the minister for allowing to burn toxic fuel in boiler houses of several Lithuanian towns and regions. As a result, a number of people suffered from gas-poisoning, the opposition said. In a statement released Monday [3 January], Stasiukynas said state-run and commercial structures have the right to import and to sell oil and oil products in Lithuania in accordance with the Aug. 31, 1992 government resolution. The resolution allows all enterprises within the jurisdiction of the Energy Ministry to purchase oil products without any special permissions. Absorbent-1, a toxic fuel used in some areas, was purchased by the state-run Siluma (Heat) company from the joint Lithuania-USA company Lamaringas. According to the established order, oil products can be imported into Lithuania only if their import is officially permitted, or if a special permission is issued by the Environmental Protection Department. The minister said Lamaringas imported the toxic fuel unlawfully and is fully responsible for its realization in Lithuania. The minister said the case has been handed over to the prosecutor's office.
