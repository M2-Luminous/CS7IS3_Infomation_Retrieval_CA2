FR941221-0-00027 FR941221-0-00010 After carefully considering the comments of the Association for Union Democracy and Acuna, Casas and Araiza opposing the amendment and questioning the court's reasoning in Local 19, the Department has concluded that their arguments are not as persuasive as those of the court which clearly demonstrate through a thorough analysis of relevant legislative history, prior judicial decisions, and the language of the Act, that Congress did not intend section 401(h) to grant the Secretary the authority to file suit against a union for failure to follow its concededly adequate officer removal procedures. Furthermore, a union member is not without a legal remedy if his organization fails to follow its adequate removal procedure. Any union member, as referenced in the comments of the Laborers, may sue his or her labor organization for failure to comply with those provisions of its constitution and bylaws governing officer removal procedures. In response to Acuna, Casas and Araiza's argument that the amendment fails to state any steps the Secretary will take after a member has exhausted internal union procedures, we note that this matter is set forth in 29 CFR 417.17. In response to the United Food and Commercial Workers' suggestion of additional changes to the officer removal regulations, the Department has concluded the following: (1) The language of 29 CFR 417.16(a)(3) is not duplicative of subpart A because each provision addresses different aspects of the Department's officer removal regulatory process. Subpart A of 29 CFR part 417 prescribes rules for determining the adequacy of a union's constitution and bylaws for the removal of officers of a local labor organization. If the Department determines that a union's officer removal provision is inadequate, the union may resolve this matter by conducting a secret ballot vote by the members in good standing after notice and hearing, as prescribed by section 401(h) of the Act. 29 CFR 417.16(a)(3) provides that a member may file a complaint with the Department if the union's implementation of this subsequent remedial measure of notice, hearing, and secret ballot vote is not conducted in accordance with the principles governing adequate removal procedures as defined by ยง417.2(b). Hence, the language of 29 CFR 417.16(a)(3) does not duplicate that of subpart A. It references the adequacy of remedial action taken after a subpart A procedure. The Department, therefore, is not deleting any language of 29 CFR 417.16(3). However, in order to clarify that subpart B covers the failure of a union to act appropriately after a subpart A procedure the heading will be changed to read: Procedures Upon Failure of Union to Take Appropriate Remedial Action Following Subpart A Procedures. (2) The Department believes that the proposed language in ยง417.16(a) is clear and is consistent with the Local 19 decision. When a union has entered into a stipulation with the Director to comply with the provisions of section 401(h) and thereafter violates the procedures agreed to in that stipulation, subpart B action is appropriate. The proposed language in ยง417.16(a) addresses this situation and the Department does not believe that any amendment to the language is necessary or desirable. (3) The Department agrees that amending certain language in 29 CFR 417.17 would assist in defining the scope of the regulation. Therefore the Department will amend the language of ยง417.17 by replacing the words ``Title IV'' with ``section 401(h)''. Administrative Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 The Department of Labor has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 in that it will not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities, (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency, (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof, or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Agency Head has certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The rule will only apply to local labor organizations and would decrease the regulation of such labor organizations. However, the Department has determined that labor organizations regulated pursuant to the statutory authority granted under the LMRDA do not constitute small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.
