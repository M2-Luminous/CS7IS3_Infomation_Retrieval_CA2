Speaking at a meeting with party leaders on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, Rasmussen said if the United Nations wanted to change its plans for the Danish Leopard tanks the question would have to be referred back to parliament here. [passage omitted] Rasmussen said that in any event Sweden wanted the Danish troops in Tuzla so it could move some armoured troop carriers to Sarajevo. The Leopards will first head for Tomislavgrad in southwest Bosnia, which is under the control of Bosnian Croat militia. Rasmussen said he expected that the Croats would let the tanks through.
