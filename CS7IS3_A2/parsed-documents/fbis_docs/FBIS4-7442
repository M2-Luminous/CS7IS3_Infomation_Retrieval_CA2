You see, many problems have been solved. Two nations have agreed to go for the reconstruction of Bosnia as an integral state. I have not heard a single ugly word from any representative of the Croatian people or the Bosniak people about the Serbian people during our socializing here. Now when one thinks about it and takes into account that there are some 500,000 to 550,000 Serbs on the territory controlled by that army of Karadzic's, that there are some 200,000 Serbs who stayed with us to defend Bosnia, and that many have left, I would like to send them a message: They should integrate all their forces and we will make an effort to talk with all of them, both with those who have left Bosnia, and of course those who are with us -- we cooperated on a daily basis -- and with those who are armed and failed to show loyalty to the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This agreement, this agreement that has been reached, it is not to anyone's disadvantage. This is an agreement of equal opportunities and rights for the three nations, and all the other nations. I have said this before: One of the negotiators has said that the integral Bosnia will be saved when first two of the nations agree. However, I think there are more than two nations, that there are (forces) in the Serbian people, but they have to be integrated, they have to articulate their views [words indistinct] an integral Bosnia, since the (blood) of that nation has been spilt here, their historical monuments are here, their shrines -- just as the culture of the Bosniak people, their monuments and their shrines spread throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the Una River to the Drina River. We will try to conduct such a policy, to take advantage of the positive -- what to call it -- momentum, the positive momentum to continue the peace process with the aid of the international community. Of course, the war criminals will end up where they belong. I would like to tell them, that segment of the Serbian people who have been deceived, that they should remember Hitler's proverb: If the German nation does not follow my ideas, then it does not deserve to exist. Therefore, fascists have always had similar messages. I call on the entire Serbian nation to integrate and fight since the more you try to divide Bosnia the more it looks the same. I again stress that through my contacts here -- not speaking of [word indistinct] whom I meet frequently, but the deputies from the Una River to the Drina River -- noone said that this agreement was to the detriment of [words indistinct]. When one understands it, when one [words indistinct] [applause]. Therefore that is the message, and I think that we have now, with this act, thoroughly simplified the problem of the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis. Things have come around full circle and that is how the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina will finally end. The troops that crossed the Drina River must go back there or they will eventually be defeated. Still it would be good if the Serbian people were to integrate their forces, so that we can reach an agreement and unveil their flag here, too. I know, of course, that there are many Serbs who have fought for Bosnia and died for Bosnia, some of them are here with us. I repeat that this agreement has been reached by healthy forces from the ranks of the Croatian and the Bosniak people -- I always mention first the people to whom I do not belong out of some academic principles of my own. The Presidency and Federation bodies will continue to struggle for peace throughout the territory. We do not ask for anything except that every man have his house returned to him and that every man have his property returned to him, because pillage cannot be accepted at the beginning of the 21st century. I wish to salute you with these words, and I wish you continuing happy efforts. Thank you very much.
