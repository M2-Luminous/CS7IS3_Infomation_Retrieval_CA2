This is a strategic decision made by the Communist Party of China in order to establish a socialist market economy. However, how to implement the decision? This question has aroused attention from all circles. On 19 November this reporter interviewed Hu Ping, director of the Special Economic Zone Office of the State Council, who was presiding at the Fifth National WorK Conference on Economic Development Zones held in Tianjin. Hu Ping used over two hours to brief this reporter on 10 major trends in China's opening to the outside world in the 1990s. Major Trend One: Objective of Opening to Outside World Is Changing From External Orientation Based on Promoting Exports From Coastal Regions Into "Neutrality" Centered on Keeping Country's Imports, Exports in Equilibrium China's exports, Hu Ping said, should continue to be encouraged to compete on the world market and improve their own standing continually. But if China only strives to encourage exports, China will inevitably experience too many international economic frictions. At the same time China cannot particularly encourage imports. First, while there is demand, there is not that much foreign exchange. Second, that course of action will conflict with the overall goals of developing national industry, adjusting economic structure, and establishing an independent economic system. Therefore, with regard to the overall objective of opening to the outside world, it is advisable to formulate a "neutral" objective which neither particularly encourages exports nor particularly encourages imports, so as to make it possible both to maintain the market's attractiveness and to enhance international competitiveness. Major Trend Two: Opening to Outside World Is Changing From Moving in Forward Direction Into Moving in Both Directions During the 1990s, while promoting domestic economic development by making use of international economic forces, it is necessary to employ a two-direction strategy, so as to exploit the two markets, use the two kinds of resources, and learn the two sets of skills in a comprehensive manner. In addition to developing transnational business operations and carrying out international trade, it is necessary to encourage the carrying out of operations in Third World countries to develop resource products in short supply on the Chinese market. Such operations can simultaneously stimulate technology, equipment, and labor service exports and increase the availability of resources in short supply on China's domestic market, thereby achieving several things with one stroke. Comrade Xiaoping said that "it is necessary to adopt new ways to increase South-South cooperation." To that end, the government should provide support by adopting supporting policies on credit funds, insurance, taxation, and the sale of products in China. Major Trend Three: International Economic Cooperation Is Developing From Undiversified, Bilateral Level to a Higher, Diversified and Multilateral Level The development of the Tumen River proposed in recent years, Hu Ping said, involves six Northeast Asian countries, China, Russia, the DPRK, the ROK, Mongolia, and Japan, encompassing an area of 30,000 square km. This area enjoys both geographical and resource advantages, and, from a long-term perspective, has great potential for cooperative development. The joint development of the upper reaches of the Mekong River involves the four countries of China, Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos. Thailand is rather enthusiastic about it. Our Yunnan Province has taken initial steps to open transportation routes to Myanmar. This region is characterized by strong mutual complementarity in hydropower, tourism, agricultural, mineral, and other resources. Joint development, leading to the emergence of a "golden square" in Southeast Asia, constitutes a new situation in the opening to the outside world. With regard to the western borders, Korgas Pass has also proposed a new line of thought, calling for the establishment of a zone of border trade cooperation between Xinjiang and Kazakhstan so as to create channels of border trade between the two countries. Besides, the Suzhou industrial zone to be jointly developed by the government of Singapore and Jiangsu Province, a zone now in the planning stage, will cover 8 square km in its first phase. All those developments demand that we use political, economic, and diplomatic means in a comprehensive way in an effort to produce a new situation regarding the long-term effort to open up to the outside world, a situation which is beneficial to us on a long-term basis and based on international mutual complementarity. Major Trend Four: Situation of Opening to Outside World Is Turning From One Characterized by Development Centered on Coastal Regions Into One Characterized by Deeper, More Extensive Development Involving Border and River-Valley Regions In the 1990s the "coastal, border, and river-valley" strategy will be expanded in terms of extending the geographic scope and increasing the depth of development in the various industries. Currently, foreign enterprises are not only cooperating with state-owned enterprises, but have also created a new situation characterized by the forming of partnerships with township enterprises and private enterprises. The economic sector based on public ownership can consolidate its status as the main actor only through competition. Comrade Xiaoping said, "The further reform and opening up proceed, the greater the capacity to bear and withstand risks there will be." This argument is completely correct. Major Trend Five: Opening to Outside World Is Extending From Coastal, Border, and River-Valley Regions to Hinterland There now exists, he said, a view that it is necessary to be tilted in favor of some industries but no longer in favor of some regions. This view has some merit. The opening up process of the central and western regions should be appropriately accelerated. When conditions are ready, it is necessary to add some cities to the ranks of open cities. Investment policy should be based on integrating industrial policy and regional policy. With regard to guiding foreign investment, in addition to following the established policies concerning the coastal regions, it is also necessary to formulate some encouragement policies in view of the unique strengths of the Northwest and Southwest. For instance, it is necessary to study special policies with regard to such matters as comprehensive resource development, the development of the reservoirs area at the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, and the energy development in the Southwest. With regard to the issue of the coastal regions' helping the central and western regions in an effort to achieve common development, it is also necessary to use economic methods and adopt various forms such as partnership and cooperation in accordance with Comrade Xiaoping's instructions, and create a path in the 1990s. Major Trend Six: Construction of Development Zones Is Changing From Separate Construction Into Group Construction and Zones Are Turning From Being Unifunctional Into Being Multifunctional As director of the Special Economic Zone Office, Hu Ping has special feelings for the development zone, a product of the opening up to the outside world. After the cleaning up and cooling down, he said, the remaining development zones across the country which should get heated up will get heated up; that is, it is necessary to act in such a way as capabilities would allow, engaging actively in development while improving efficiency. Those zones can thus become the new growth segments of our country's productive forces and produce a new colony of industry. There is now a trend to form partnership relations among development zones which are forming partnerships and carrying out cooperation in the areas of information, planning, designing, business promotion, management, personnel training, etc. The development zones (including bonded zones) are exploring the use of international practices for the deepening of the development function so that they can develop in a multifunctional and all-dimensional direction. The development zones with the necessary conditions are exploring ways of developing operations in the central and western regions or even abroad. Many development zones have become windows of opening to the outside world as well as bases for efforts to adjust industrial structure, to promote the grafting of new contemporary technologies onto old enterprises, and to make the economy climb another step. As Comrade Xiaoping said, "The development zones have a great hope." Major Trend Seven: Foreign Investment Is Changing From Being Focused on Manufacturing of Exports Into Moving in Direction Emphasizing Industrial Operations and Diversified Operations, and Is Turning From Being an Investment Type Into Being an Investment-Finance Integration Type After 15 years of opening up to the outside world, foreign investment has now reached a certain scale. The target area of foreign investment has now extended to basic industries, basic sectors, and some tertiary industries, and the trend is good. Some large international corporations are making a strategic shift toward China. It should be particularly noted that not only is international capital inclined to invest in China, but that it is also forming joint ventures with influential enterprises in China on the basis of adopting the joint-stock system and then having the stocks sold on the markets of developed countries. The use of this practice indicates that our country's industrial capital is being transformed into financial capital and is moving from the domestic market to the international market. According to the international financial community, China, a "mountain-climbing tiger," will reach the summit, and it is hard to estimate its international impact. This development trend tells us that in using foreign investment, it is not only necessary to focus on introducing new technologies and developing new products, but also necessary to carry out in-depth, multiangular, and comprehensive analysis and formulate policies accordingly, so that the use of foreign investment may develop in a direction which is both appropriate to the new trends in international investment and more beneficial to China. Major Trend Eight: Relations With Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, Once Based on Trade Cooperation, Are Developing in Direction of Economic Integration The years 1997 and 1999 are coming soon. After the problems of resumption of sovereignty between the mainland on the one hand and Hong Kong and Macao on the other are resolved, the trend of economic integration encompassing the markets of Hong Kong, Macao, and the mainland will further grow under the general policy of "one country, two systems." Consequently, capital and technology from Hong Kong and Macao in large quantities will enter the hinterland market, and affect the manufacturing sector, infrastructure, basic industries, tertiary industries, and many other spheres on the mainland. The semiofficial Trade Development Office of Hong Kong made Europe and North America the focus of trade investment in the past, but has carried out deep-going advances into the hinterland in recent years by using the "uniform packaging" method. Recently people in Taiwan have proposed that special zones, facing the coastal regions of the mainland, be established in Taiwan. They have cried out in alarm: "As Hong Kong has adopted the uniform packaging method, what should Taiwan do?" Their idea of a "Chinese economic sphere" has some sound elements. We should provide adroit guidance in view of the circumstances, but should not ignore the idea. It can be expected that there will be a new trend in the economic and trade relations between the mainland and Taiwan in the 1990s. Major Trend Nine: Opening Up to Outside World Is Extending to Deeper Levels and Is Proceeding in a Comprehensive Manner The expansion of opening to the outside world requires the establishment of a set of new systems and mechanisms functioning at all levels. The more deep-level problems the opening to the outside world encounters, the more necessary it is to establish an effective system of macroeconomic regulation and control. In the future there will be fewer and fewer proposals to attract foreign capital through preferential policies. Instead, competition and service will constitute the key factor determining whether one succeeds or fails. Therefore, it is especially necessary to give emphasis to the construction of the investment environment, including the construction of both the hard environment and soft environment. The training of personnel needed for the opening to the outside world is the fundamental guarantee of the cause of opening to the outside world. Major Trend Ten: Opening to Outside World Is Changing From Being Just an Economic Matter Into Developing in Direction of Combining Economics and Culture According to him, the integration of economics and culture represents a worldwide trend at the present time, and cultural strength is part of comprehensive national capabilities. The integration of economics and culture is still in the phase of coming into being in China. Promoting the combining of economics and culture can give vitality, motive force, and attractiveness to the economy being opened up to the outside world, and can also provide a spiritual pillar and social constraining forces contributing to the prevention of corruption in society, while pushing China's fine traditional culture to a new high. Hu Ping used a vivid, figurative saying, "the sea of bitterness has bounds, but turning back will not lead one to the shore," to describe the general trend in China's opening to the outside world. The Chinese economy, he said, was on the verge of collapse 15 years ago. During the past 15 years, the reform and opening up have extricated China from the sea of bitterness. Facts have proven that only by advancing bravely in the process of reform and opening up will we be able to achieve the great goal set for us by Comrade Xiaoping.
