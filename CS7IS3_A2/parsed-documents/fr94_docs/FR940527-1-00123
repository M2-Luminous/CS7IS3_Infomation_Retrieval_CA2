FR940527-1-00123 FR940527-1-00014 III. Proposed Changes to Payment Rates for Inpatient Capital-Related Costs for FY 1995 The prospective payment system for hospital inpatient capital-related costs was implemented for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991. Effective with that cost reporting period and during a 10-year transition period extending through FY 2001, hospital inpatient capital-related costs are paid on the basis of an increasing proportion of the capital prospective payment system Federal rate and a decreasing proportion of the historical costs for capital. The basic methodology for determining Federal capital prospective rates is set forth at §§412.308 through 412.352 of the regulations. Below we discuss the factors that we propose to use to determine the Federal rate and the hospital-specific rate for FY 1995. The proposed rates would be effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. We computed the FY 1992 standard Federal payment rate for capital-related costs under the prospective payment system by updating the FY 1989 Medicare inpatient capital cost per case by an actuarial estimate of the increase in Medicare inpatient capital costs per case. Each year after FY 1992 we updated the standard Federal rate for increases in capital-related costs as provided in §412.308(c)(1). Also, §412.308(c)(2) provides that the Federal rate is adjusted annually by a factor equal to the estimated additional payments under the Federal rate for outlier cases, determined as a proportion of total capital payments under the Federal rate. For FY 1992 through FY 2001, §412.308(c)(3) requires that the Federal rate be reduced by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments made for exceptions under §412.348, and §412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the Federal rate be adjusted so that the estimated aggregate payments after any changes resulting from the annual DRG reclassification and the recalibration of DRG weights and changes in the geographic adjustment factor are budget neutral. For FY 1992 through FY 1995, §412.352 requires that the Federal rate also be adjusted by a budget neutrality factor, so that estimated aggregate payments for inpatient hospital capital costs will equal 90 percent of the estimated payments that would have been made for capital-related costs on a reasonable cost basis during the fiscal year. In addition, Public Law 103&hyph;66 required that, effective for discharges occurring after September 30, 1993, the unadjusted standard Federal rate be reduced by 7.4 percent.
