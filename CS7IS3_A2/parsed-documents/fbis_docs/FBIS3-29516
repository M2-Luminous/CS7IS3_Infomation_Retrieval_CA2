Seoul and Washington are looking into the military need for deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea but have made no decision, Han told reporters after a series of meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff and Assistant Secretary of State for Political Affairs Robert Gallucci. Han made a second stop in the U.S. capital on the last leg of a trip to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) member countries except Mexico to coordinate joint Seoul-Washington measures on the North Korean nuclear problem. His remark struck a different note from that of Defense Secretary William Perry, who said he accepted a request for the Patriot missiles by Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces in South Korea, and was currently discussing the timing and means of transport with the Seoul Government. The foreign minister said he expressed opposition to Washington's move to reauthorize the much-feared Super 301 trade legislation, which requires the USTR to identify and act against nations that erect barriers to U.S. goods and services, in retaliation for a broken trade agreement with Japan. Kantor said that no action has been taken, with a decision to be made after watching developments in the Washington-Tokyo trade framework negotiations, Han told reporters. Han said Korea would likely be excluded from the priority watch country list on intellectual property rights violations. He added that he might meet President Bill Clinton on Friday before boarding a flight to Seoul later in the day. Predicting resumption of inter-Korean dialogue in "the near future," Han reiterated that the third round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks would be possible only after full nuclear inspections and an exchange of envoys by the two Koreas. However, he added that under certain conditions, the date for the third round may be set and revealed earlier, hinting that Washington could announce the date in advance once International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin and inter-Korean contact resumes.
