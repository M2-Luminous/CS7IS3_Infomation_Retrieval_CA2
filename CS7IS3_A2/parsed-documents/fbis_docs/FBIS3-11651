He said that in the future Cuba will implement a diplomatic offensive policy because we are tired of being on the stand as a defendant. Robaina said that in Vietnam he is concluding what has been announced as a diplomatic offensive through several regions in the world with the purpose of explaining to several governments the truth about our country and studying our economic experiences. Our tours of the Caribbean, some Latin American nations, Africa, and now Asia, have conveyed to our interlocutors a broad vision of the process Cuba is experiencing, within a climate of respect and understanding, Robaina said. He added that in these contacts Cuba has found elbow room to personally explain the current Cuban situation and to say what the great news media fail to say. Our country is not the hell it is said to be nor the heaven we would like it to be, and for this reason it should not be on the stand as a defendant, Robaina said. From this moment on we are going to begin a diplomatic offensive in an effort to consolidate our legitimate aspirations and to expand our international relations. During a news conference held in Vietnam, Robaina said that we are a country open for dialogue, willing to negotiate everything, except our independence, sovereignty, and revolutionary achievements. The Cuban foreign minister said that 1994 will be a year of intensive work which includes a new tour of some Latin American nations in the beginning of April. On concluding his visit to Vietnam, Robaina added that his project includes a visit to the Middle East in the near future, but before that his country will host the conference between the nation and the emigre community, a meeting with the Cuban community abroad. Robaina said that the conference will be held in Havana between 22 and 24 April with the participation of Cuban citizen who reside in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the Caribbean, and other countries. Robaina went on to say that the objective of the meeting is to normalize ties between Cuba and its community abroad as all nations do. All Cubans of goodwill are invited to participate. Only the hysterical and agressive ones are not invited, he said. On analyzing his current tour of Asian countries, the Cuban foreign minister stressed the importance of exchanging ideas and analyzing economic experiences. He said that Vietnam was the most relevant point of his tour due to the traditional bilateral ties of friendship and cooperation, and he concluded by saying that he was surprised at the achievements of this Asian country.
