According to its plan, Shanghai will expand its monetary market (China's largest), securities market, foreign exchange market and insurance market, and open a gold market and a free on board (FOB) market. "To attain its strategic objective, Shanghai must further reform its economic system and open wider to the outside world while speeding up construction of its infrastructure facilities," Mao said. "Only by improving and fostering the market economy step by step, can the banking reform be deepened and a standardized international banking center be formed," he noted. In addition, according to Mao, the modern banking system needs to be coordinated with the modern enterprise system and banking laws brought into line with international conventions. At present, the Chinese Government is widely soliciting opinions in order to formulate a package of laws covering the operations of the central and commercial banks, securities and the banking market, which are expected to come into effect soon. Mao disclosed that, to develop the metropolis into an international financial center, Shanghai's banking organizations, under the leadership of the central bank, have decided to compete with overseas banking organizations. "Shanghai, China's largest economic center, is becoming the country's largest monetary, securities, foreign exchange and insurance market," the president said. He explained that the monetary market, in terms of inter-bank loans, will make maximum use of short-term floating loans between Shanghai and its nearby provinces. Mao urged the Shanghai Stock Exchange to further standardize and internationalize its operation so as to become a first-class securities collection and distribution center in the Asian and Pacific region. The China Foreign Exchange Center, located in Shanghai, is being encouraged to promote the stabilization of the renminbi exchange rate to allow free convertibility. Mao also called for the expansion of the insurance, gold and FOB markets -- which started later than other banking markets -- the golden card project and the city clearing and settlement system. According to Mao, the Shanghai International Financial Center is being developed in three stages; construction of the first stage will be completed in 1995, that of the second in 2000 and that of the third in 2010.
