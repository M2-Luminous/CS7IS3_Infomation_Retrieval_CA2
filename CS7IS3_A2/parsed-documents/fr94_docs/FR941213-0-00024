SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 21, 1994 in 59 FR 48410, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SBCAPCD's Rule 342, Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NO X ) from Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters. Rule 342 was adopted by SBCAPCD on March 10, 1992. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted this rule to EPA on June 19, 1992. Rule 342 was adopted as part of Santa Barbara County's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to Section 182(f) NO X RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA has evaluated Rule 342 for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluation has been provided in 59 FR 48410 and in the technical support document (TSD), dated May 1994 available at EPA's Region IX office. Response to Public Comments A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 48410. EPA received no comments.

The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate emissions of NO X in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
