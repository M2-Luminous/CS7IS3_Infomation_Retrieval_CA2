FBIS4-29715 "dreas119_q_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-119 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 AUSTRALASIA Fiji Opposition Considering Parliament Withdrawal Opposition Considering Parliament Withdrawal BK1706125794 Melbourne Radio Australia in English 0500 GMT 17 Jun 94 BK1706125794 Melbourne Radio Australia English BFN [Text] Fiji's opposition leader, Jai Ram Reddy of the National Federation Party [NFP], will consider whether to withdraw from parliament following Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka's warning that there could be another coup. The NFP and its ally, the Fiji Labor Party [FLP], are maintaining they boycotted parliament after walking out yesterday in protest at Mr. Rabuka's remarks during a law and order debate. Mr. Rabuka, who led the army overthrow of the Timoci Bavandra government in 1987, warned that there could be a third and possibly bloody coup if indigenous Fijians continue to feel disadvantaged. The NFP has accused the prime minister of trying to intimidate Fiji Indians, who comprise about 45 percent of the population, and they are denied equal political rights under the 1990 Constitution. Jai Ram Reddy, who head the NFP, was questioned whether Indian political parties have a role to play in parliament in view of the fact that they were barred from government and were criticized for performing as an opposition. Mr. Reddy said the NFP would consider during the weekend whether to continue in parliament and possibly have talks with the FLP. Meanwhile, Mr. Rabuka today sought to play down his remarks telling a half-empty parliament that he was not attacking any community in particular and that he was not saying he would stage another coup. However, he repeated that no one could guarantee what might happen in the future.
