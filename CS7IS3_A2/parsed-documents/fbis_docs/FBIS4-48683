"The MPR, he said, has nothing to do with the long delay in choosing a transitional prime minister and the opposition has itself to blame for not being able to control the ambitions of its members." The future prime minister of Zaire must be presented by the opposition which has not succeeded in agreeing on one candidate. Banza Mukalay was addressing in Lingala -- one of the national languages -- several thousand activists who gathered in Kinshasa on 22 May to mark the 27th anniversary of the foundation of the MPR . The radical opposition LE POTENTIEL newspaper, which reported this meeting in today's issue, estimated participants at 50,000 and said it was a "big resurrection of the MPR" which has not held any rally since 1991.
