Hizballah members have attacked and killed 10 of Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani's supporters. What has drawn attention is that the Hizballah attacks began after Mas'ud Barzani condemned the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK]. 2. The Hizballah movement in northern Iraq is still a weak organization, but it is gradually gaining strength. Ethem Barzani, who is a member of the Barzan tribe, is one of the important members of the Hizballah. 3. The socialist group headed by Rasul Mahmud is gradually becoming militant in nature. That group has been clashing with Mas'ud Barzani's men. 4. Mas'ud Barzani's relations with Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani have deteriorated. It is difficult to predict how effective the chairmanship council that Barzani and Talabani have established to prevent clashes between the two sides will be. The question at the present time is as follows: How will the maintenance or the withdrawal of the Hammer Force affect the present situation in northern Iraq? Siyamet Muzuri, one of the Hizballah leaders in northern Iraq, on 29 May told MILLIYET correspondent Namik Durukan the following: "The day when we shall take control of northern Iraq is very near. Our relations with the federal government are not favorable at the present time. That is because the government members prefer the secular system, as is the case in Turkey." Muzuri openly praised Iran and said that "Ayatollah Khomeyni taught us our objectives." The radical groups in northern Iraq are gradually becoming more and more aggressive. Furthermore, they seem to be inclined toward establishing a front against Mas'ud Barzani. That front will also include the PKK. Meanwhile, Talabani continues to be an unreliable leader. Obviously, the armed radical organizations will become more effective if instability worsens as a result of confusion or civil war in northern Iraq. Consequently, there will be a gradual increase in the forces interfering in the developments in that region. Obviously, the Hizballah groups and the PKK, by nature, are eager to have such a situation prevail in northern Iraq. It is a fact that the Hammer Force safeguards northern Iraq against Saddam Husayn's regime in Baghdad. However, that force also helps the "moderate" Barzani-Talabani administration maintain a relatively stable situation in that region. Naturally, as far as Turkey is concerned, Barzani is a more important leader. The reason why the PKK and the Hizballah groups in northern Iraq are opposed to the Hammer Force is as follows: They want instability to worsen and a wave of confusion or internal war to sweep through the region so they can become more effective. In fact, they may even cooperate with Saddam Husayn in order to achieve their objectives. The destabilization in northern Iraq may result in armed activities and create a new wave of refugees. That state of affairs would disturb Turkey. There is no evidence that the Hammer Force supports the PKK. It must be pointed out that Turkish officers fly in the Hammer Force aircraft that patrol the region. In fact, President Demirel has said that the Hammer Force has been helpful to Turkey by providing information for the operations the security forces carry out in the region. We wish that there was no justification for the presence of the Hammer Force in Turkey. However, high-ranking officials in Ankara regard that force as an essential factor because it is keeping the instability in northern Iraq from becoming worse. Furthermore, they believe that it is a "trump card" which Turkey can use.
