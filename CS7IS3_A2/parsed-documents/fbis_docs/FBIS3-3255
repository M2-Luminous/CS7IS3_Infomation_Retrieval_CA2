Today, this good life has become a reality in China. All year round, live fish and all kinds of prawns, shellfish, and aquatic plants are found everywhere in city and rural fairs and markets. A dozen years or so ago, however, aquatic products had to be rationed with food coupons. In the past 40 years or more since the founding of the PRC, China's aquatic products industry has developed roughly this way: The 1950's were a period of recovery and speedy development; the annual output of aquatic products rose at an annual rate of 21 percent, from 450,000 tonnes in 1949 to 3.09 million tonnes. In the 1960's, owing to the excessive extraction of aquatic products, their annual output did not increase, but decreased to 290,000 tonnes. The 1970's saw a slow annual average increase of 4 percent, with the annual output rising to 4.305 million tonnes. The 1980's were a "golden period" of brave reforms and speedy growth. By adopting a series of important reform measures, such as "paying simultaneous attention to the breeding, extraction, and processing of aquatic products, with the emphasis on breeding and allowing for the emphasis to shift in light of the situations of different localities," and removing all restrictions on the prices of aquatic products, we ushered in a new prospect of extraordinary development. In the past 15 years, the China's aquatic products output has seen a 2.8-fold increase, and total output for 1993 reached 17.86 million tonnes, representing an average annual increase of 9 percent. In the eight years since all price restrictions were removed, there has been an average annual increase of 1.35 million tonnes or more than 12 percent. In addition to the increase in total output, the structure of the aquatic products industry also has changed in a gratifying way. First, the output from sea fishery has decreased, while that from inland fishery has risen. The ratio between the former and the latter in 1979 was 74:26, but that in 1993 was 60:40. Second, the output from catching has decreased, while that from breeding has risen. The ratio has proceeded from 72:29 in 1979 to 52:48 at the present time. In the years since 1990, China has ranked first in the world in the output of aquatic products and China's proportion in the world's total aquatic products output has risen from 1/45 to approximately 1/6. Despite the fact China is a world leader in the output of aquatic products, the per-capita possession comes only to 14 kg, equivalent to only two-thirds of the world's average level. The many factors restricting the development of China's aquatic products industry remain, but as long as we make efforts and struggle unremittingly, China will be a leader, not only in total output of the aquatic products industry in the future, but also in the conservation and utilization of resources and in comprehensive social and economic efficiency.
