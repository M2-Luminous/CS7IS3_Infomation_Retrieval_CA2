FBIS3-15212 "drsov042cc_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-042 Document Type:Daily Report 3 March 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS Ukraine Approved as CIS Treaty Associate LD0103175194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1412 GMT 1 Mar 94 LD0103175194 Moscow INTERFAX Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Russia's Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin reported to INTERFAX that the session of CIS Coordinating Consultative Committee (CCC) underway on Tuesday in Moscow approved the draft agreement on Ukraine's joining the Treaty on Economic Union of CIS countries as an associate member. Shokhin, who chaired the session, said the problems related to Kiev's joining of the economic union are largely caused by the political situation in this republic, in particular, by the fact that a new parliament would apparently ratify a corresponding agreement. To this effect the minister reminded that based on CIS documents already ratified by Kiev, at the Commonwealth's forums, Ukraine enjoys the right of a decisive and in several cases of a consultative vote. As Shokhin asserted, Kiev "has no reserved special positions on articles of the treaty on economic union." "Ukraine's peculiar feature is that it is closer to plenipotentiary than to a classic associate membership in the economic union," stressed the minister. He added that the CCC had proposed a general variant of the draft agreement on associate membership with respect to Ukraine. Ivan Korotchenya, CIS executive secretary, made it clear during his conversation with our INTERFAX correspondent that a common principal accord was voiced on the issue of Ukraine's associate membership in the economic union at the CCC session. However, experts have been charged with also developing a text of an appropriate document. Korotchenya explained that due to the fact that Kiev had not signed the CIS Charter and the Treaty on Economic Union, because Ukraine had expressed its discontent with several of the Treaty's provisions, there appear certain difficulties and contradictions due to the preparation of an agreement on associate membership of this republic in the economic union. Korotchenya added that "there is not a single completely prepared document among those approved at the CCC session Tuesday, all of them are to be revised by experts." Korotchenya reported that majority of CCC members are in favor of a joint conference on March 31 in Moscow instead of two separate sessions, namely of the Council of heads of governments and Council of heads of states.
