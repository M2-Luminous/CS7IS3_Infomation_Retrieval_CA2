The decision on who will be our partner will be made by the voter, Vladimir Meciar, deputy to the National Council of the Slovak Republic and chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], said at yesterday's "13 Plus One" meeting organized by the editorial staff of SLOBODNY PIATOK. According to what he said, the question of holding elections has not been definitely settled because "in the course of the current meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, our deputies have been approached by two people--Deputy Gburova, with the proposal that the election date be postponed by two years, and Deputy Bajan, with the request for four more [HZDS] deputies so that they get the 90 votes [needed to pass constitutional laws]." Vladimir Meciar also contested reports about nocturnal meetings of his government to approve privatization projects: "After the passage of the vote of no-confidence in us, we had dinner and a friendly chat about what we would do the next day.... We were not approving any privatization projects; that had been done before, and even that concerned only four or five projects, I think, and I was not personally present." Meciar claimed that parliament is in a state of decay, which he supported by saying that, whenever there is a secret ballot in the National Council of the Slovak Republic, nine people vote along with the HZDS. Supposedly, these deputies only failed during the dismissal of the government, but they had already apologized to him and explained their reasons.
