However, according to official sources quoted today, Saturday, by the Madrid daily EL PAIS, there is no compromise in sight on institutional adaptations and changes in voting. Meanwhile, the Spanish Government has won the support of all the political parties, including those of the opposition, in the joint congress-senate commission of the Spanish Cortes [parliament] for the position being upheld in Brussels in the face of its Community partners. Today, the aforementioned Madrid newspaper carries an article by Vicente Albero, the Spanish minister of agriculture, fisheries and food, in which he reflects on the common fisheries policy and defends the Spanish position as regards its partners. Albero reiterates the point that on the subject of fisheries, Spain has a great interest in a country like Norway joining the European Union, but he stresses that this does not justify the abolition of the common wealth by pleading geographical exceptionality or greater efficiency of management of resources. In his article, the Spanish minister of agriculture and fisheries recalls that the Spanish fishing industry is the biggest and most complex of the whole of the European Union. He warns that Community enlargement must not and cannot represent a step backwards as regards what has hitherto been achieved.
