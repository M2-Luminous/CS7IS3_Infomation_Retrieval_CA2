With registered capital of $150 million, the Hainan-Aptronix Electronic Company was founded by US-based Aptronix Asia-Pacific Electronic Company, Hainan Seg International Trust and Investment Corporation, and Hainan-based Hua Xing International Leasing Company. The Sino-American venture will use the world's latest hi-tech advances -- the ``fuzzy control technology'' -- to help improve the automatic capacity of household electrical appliances, such as washing machines, air-conditioners and cameras. Yan Weiming, an official of the State Technology Supervision Administration, said a washing machine can cut power consumption by 2.6 per cent an hour with the fuzzy hi-tech. The venture has spent $6 million to introduce two product lines from the United States to manufacture the device, which is expected to make household appliance factories more competitive. It is the first factory to produce the fuzzy control device in China. The company is expected to start production at the end of this year, and has a designed annual capacity of 5 million fuzzy control devices in 1995 for the domestic markets.
