Hundreds of Palestinian faithful were victims of this massacre while praying at dawn on Friday last week during the month of Ramadan. This crime is a manifestation of the constant violations the Muslim Palestinian people are being subjected to. It also brings to mind the Dayr Yasin massacre and other methods of killing and oppressing Palestinians, which reveal Israel's true morality. This crime, which has shaken humanity's conscience, is a warning to the Palestinian people not to feel at ease with their enemies, not to give in to the imposed existing reality, and to continue their struggle until victory. This horrible crime exemplifies the inability of the Israeli enemy to stop the intifadah. It also shows that the Israeli enemy is upset about the heroism and steadfastness of the Palestinian people and the stone-throwing generation, and wants to take revenge for the Muslims' persistence in bearing sacrifices in order to maintain the state of jihad and reject capitulation as 'Arafat and his followers are doing. The Israeli entity is fully responsible for this crime. Those who protect this entity, including the forces of arrogance, are also jointly responsible because they continue to support this entity fully. The Muslim nations and peoples must shoulder their responsibilities toward what the Palestinians are being subjected to, such as humiliation and aggression, by putting pressure on those with decision-making influence, providing moral and material support for the Palestinian people's jihad, demanding protection for the Palestinian civilians through any means, and boosting morale in the Islamic world to continue Muslim resistance to the status quo policy which forces them to accept the legitimacy of the usurping entity in Palestine. The Iraqi people, who are also being subjected to the policy of extreme oppression by Saddam's murderous regime, share the sorrows of their brothers in Palestine over this tragedy. The belief in sacrifice is the correct course for regaining one's rights. The Iraqi people also believe that the foolishness of Saddam Husayn and his regime in Iraq are in part responsible for the current disintegration and weakness of the Islamic countries' stands and duties toward the holy cause in Palestine. We extend our condolences to all the aggrieved families and share the sorrows of the struggling Muslim Palestinian people. We believe that the souls of the innocent victims and the blood of the wounded in the sacred al-Ibrahimi Mosque will be the fuel that will feed the flames of the Palestinian intifadah and revolution and consume the Israeli designs. We call on God the Almighty to take the hand of the Muslims, lead them to their dignified status, and make them triumph over their enemies.
