If Turkish soldiers were sent to Bosnia the Serb political leadership would not be able to control the reaction of the Serb people, Plavsic said, and added that the Serbs in Bosnia were not defending just their own thing but also the Orthodox faith and Byzantine civilization. Evangelos Venizelos, representative of the Greek Government, reiterated the Greek Government's position that no Balkan country should be involved in the war in Bosnia, MPA says. The agency recalls a statement by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias that Greece would consider sending its own Blue Helmets to Bosnia if the UN secretary general accepted the participation of Turkish peacekeeping forces in the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
