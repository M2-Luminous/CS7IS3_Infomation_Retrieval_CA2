They discussed how desirable it was to sign a general agreement similar to the one signed on in Managua on 28 August 1992 between the Costa Rican Government and Public Security Ministry and the EPS. The new agreement will allow a more efficient coordination of all border issues to better fight smuggling, drug trafficking, cattle rustling, illegal alien smuggling, and gunrunning, as well as to coordinate maritime patrols. They also agreed to increase and standardize coordination mechanisms to reinforce the operations carried out by the civil defense of the two countries, especially mutual aid and communications during natural disasters and joint maneuvers to facilitate the protection of the environment. Relations of respect and understanding have existed between the two institutions for a long time and were made evident once more.
