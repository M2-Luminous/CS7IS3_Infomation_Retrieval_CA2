The synthetic SST gene was cloned into the pBR325 plasmid vector at the EcoRI and BamHI restrictase sites. As a result, expressing vector systems which ensure constitutive or induced synthesis of hybrid CAT-SST proteins at a 5-10% level of the total cell proteins in E. coli strains with an inhibited proteinase activity were created. The hybrid protein was segmented by cyanogen bromide, and SST was isolated by gel filtration and reverse phase chromatography. It is noted that the specific biological and immunological activity of purified and renatured SST matches that of natural SST. The bacterial SST-producing strains developed as a result of the effort and the methods of SST isolation from the bacterial mass make it possible to obtain 98% pure somatostatin with a yield of approximately 1 mg/l. The resulting recombinant SST is comparable to the commercial product synthesized by Serva. The authors are grateful to I.S. Komolov, A.A. Bulatov, and G.P. Yelizarova for biological activity studies and to M.L. Khodun for immunological testing. Figures 8; tables 1; references 24: 8 Russian, 16 Western.
