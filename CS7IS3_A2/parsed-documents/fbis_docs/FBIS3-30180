The former army general, who was sworn in earlier today for another five-year term as prime minister, has also said he would capitalize on his election victory by taking on a higher international profile. Mr. Rabuka told a news conference in Suva he believed the time had come for him to visit countries other than those in the Asia-Pacific region. Noting that Fiji's traditional authority, the Great Council of Chiefs, supported the island's re-entry into the Commonwealth, Mr. Rabuka said this was one issue he would look at in his portfolio as foreign minister. Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth lapsed in 1987 after the first of two military coups led by Mr Rabuka, which overthrew an Indian-dominated government. India is opposed to Fiji returning to the Commonwealth because of its racially-biased constitution which has ensured ethnic Indians are a minority in Parliament, but Mr Rabuka said he would like ethnic Indians to be included in a government within the next five years. At the same time he renewed his commitment to review Fiji's constitution by 1997.
