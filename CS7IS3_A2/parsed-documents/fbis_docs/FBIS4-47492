I. Omelayev, candidate of technical sciences, and Yu. V. Rukhlyadev, candidate of physical and mathematical sciences; UDC 621.384.326] [Abstract] A comparison revealed that of two portable optoelectronic instruments that with a scanner based on a 12-facet prism with differently tilted facets and matched optical channels has advantages with respect to angular resolution, image quality and nonparallelism of the axes over an instrument with a scanner based on five pairs of two-mirror rhombi with separate IR- and visible-wavelength channels. The two compared instruments are the OEP-1 and the OEP-2. A table gives their comparative technical specifications; a block diagram of the first identifies 12 components and a block diagram of the second identifies 14 components. These two annotated block diagrams are used in a detailed discussion of instrument structure and functioning. The comparison of the experimental and theoretical performance of the two types of systems revealed that in the OEP-1 its energy potential is not fully realized due to the great diameter of the entrance pupil of the optical unit and the lesser _D_T[.sub]equiv noise[/] level. Moreover, its angular resolution is poorer than for the OEP-2 both due to the lesser focal length (153 vs. 170 mm) and due to special features of the scanner and the presence of separate channels, resulting in the worsening of angular resolution. The angular resolution of the OEP-1 could be increased by increasing its focal length, but that would considerably increase its size and weight. The OEP-2 can ensure greater linear scanning fields than the OEP-1, which makes it possible to use photodetectors with a greater number of sensing elements. Figures 3; references: 3 Russian.
