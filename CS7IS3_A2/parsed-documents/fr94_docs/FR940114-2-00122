FR940114-2-00122 FR940114-2-00072 [Finance Docket No. 32441] Peter A. Gilbertson, Et al._Continuance in Control Exemption_Louisville & Indiana Railroad Co. Peter A. Gilbertson, H. Terry Hearst, Bruce A. Lieberman, R. Lawrence McCaffrey, Jr., and Harold F. Parmly, noncarrier individuals, have filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Louisville & Indiana Railroad Company (LIRC) when it becomes a carrier. LIRC concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Louisville & I. R. Co._Acq. and Oper. Exemp._Consolidated Rail Corp., Finance Docket No. 32440, to acquire and operate approximately 115 miles of rail line owned by Consolidated Rail Corporation in Indiana and Kentucky. LIRC expects to consummate the transaction on or about March 12, 1994. Four of the filing parties are officers or directors of the Chicago, SouthShore & South Bend Railroad (CSS), a class III rail carrier operating in Indiana and Illinois. All are minority shareholders in CSS's corporate general partner, SouthShore Corporation (a noncarrier), and three are officers and directors of that entity as well. The parties state that: (1) The railroads will not connect with each other or with any railroads in their corporate family; (2) the continuance in control is not part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction is therefore exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2).
