The leaflets contained threats against President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini [secretary of the National Alliance], Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left], and Bruno Trentin [general secretary of the CGIL confederated trades union]. According to police sources, the leaflets call for the resumption of the fight against capitalism and the traditional parties, and even against other extreme left-wing groups, which are defined as being "incapable of leading the class struggle." The investigators are examining the reliability of the leaflet and the group's symbol, which is unknown.
