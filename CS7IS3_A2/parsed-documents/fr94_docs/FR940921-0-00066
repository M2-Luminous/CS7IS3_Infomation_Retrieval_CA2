FR940921-0-00066 FR940921-0-00016 (C)( 1 ) An evaporative emissions deterioration factor shall be determined from the testing conducted as described in §86.090&hyph;21(b)(4)(i), for each evaporative emission family- evaporative emission control system combination to indicate the evaporative emission level at 50,000 miles relative to the evaporative emission level at 4,000 miles as follows: Factor = Evaporative emission level at 50,000 miles minus the evaporative emission level at 4,000 miles. ( 2 ) The factor in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C)( 1 ) of this section shall be established to a minimum of two places to the right of the decimal. (ii) *␣*␣*␣ (B) The official evaporative emission test results for each evaporative emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be adjusted by addition of the appropriate deterioration factor: Provided, that if a deterioration factor as computed in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of this section is less than zero, that deterioration factor shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph. * * * * * (7) *␣*␣*␣ (i) Separate deterioration factors shall be determined from the exhaust emission results of the durability-data vehicles for each engine family group. A separate factor as necessary to establish compliance with applicable emission standards shall be established for exhaust HC, exhaust OMHCE, exhaust NMHC, exhaust CO and exhaust NO X for each engine family group. The evaporative emission deterioration factor for each evaporative family will be determined and applied in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣*␣ (4) *␣*␣*␣ (ii) Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors, determined from tests of vehicles, engines, subsystems or components conducted by the manufacturer, shall be supplied for each engine-system combination. Separate factors shall be established as required for compliance with applicable emission standards for transient HC, OMHCE, NMHC, CO, and NO X , idle CO and exhaust particulate. (iii) For transient HC, OMHCE, NMHC and CO, and NO X , idle CO and/or exhaust particulate as appropriate, the official exhaust emission results for each emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of this paragraph. * * * * * (6) *␣*␣*␣ (i) Separate deterioration factors shall be determined from the exhaust emission results of the durability-data vehicles for each engine family group. A separate factor shall be established for exhaust HC, exhaust OMHCE or exhaust NMHC as appropriate, and exhaust CO and exhaust NO X for each engine family group. The evaporative emission deterioration factor for each evaporative family will be determined and applied in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) of this section. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣*␣ (4) *␣*␣*␣
