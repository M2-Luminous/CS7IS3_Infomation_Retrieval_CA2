FR940114-1-00005 FR940114-1-00002 One of the exceptions to FmHA's blanket lien requirement is that a lien will not be taken on chattel security when it will prevent the applicant from obtaining operating credit from other sources. This exception does not adequately correct the problems experienced with the lien on all assets rule. FmHA officials sometimes determine this exception is not necessary at the time the loan is made. However, taking a lien can later interfere with a borrower's ability to obtain credit from other sources, when borrowers have sufficient equity in assets to qualify for a non-FmHA loan to meet a portion of their credit needs. The Agency can subordinate or release liens on security property to facilitate credit from other lenders. However, these actions also impose a processing burden on borrowers and require staff time. Further, the Agency has found that some lenders shy away from providing credit to such borrowers due to the time and paperwork involved, even though the borrower otherwise meets the lender's loan criteria. The only recourse for the borrower to meet his or her credit needs is to request FmHA assistance. Thus, the lien on all assets requirement forces those borrowers who would otherwise not have a need for FmHA credit to consume resources which would be more appropriately directed toward borrowers in greater difficulty. Devoting more attention to those borrowers who desperately need intensive financial assistance and the time of FmHA staff should reduce the failure rate of these borrowers, thereby reducing program costs. The intent of this proposed rule is to make the loan security requirements less demanding while continuing to protect the Government's interest. The Agency will continue to make loans provided the value of the security available is at least equal to the amount of the loan. This is consistent with the authorizing statute and the Agency's mission of providing assistance to farmers with limited financial resources. However, rather than requiring a lien on all a borrower's additional assets, if any, when making a loan, FmHA generally will only require a lien on property only to the point that the value of the security is at least equal to 150 percent of the amount of the loan. The Agency has determined that security at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount will provide adequate assurance of repayment. Studies have indicated that loan liquidation costs are about 20 percent of the value of collateral. Additionally, the Agency has a funding cost as a result of monies borrowed from the Treasury in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, which continues until the loan is paid or written off. This cost is difficult to estimate because interest rates and liquidation periods vary widely. However, this cost should be no more than 30 percent of the loan amount on the average. Obtaining security at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount is a goal. Generally, the Agency will be unable to obtain security exactly meeting the 150 percent goal. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land, same type of livestock (dairy cows, brood sows), and when nonessential assets are taken as security for EM loans, as discussed below. The first security preference for operating type loans will be crops/chattels, and for real estate type loans the first priority will be real estate. Where there are several collateral possibilities for chattels (cattle, machinery) or real estate (different tracts of land), the FmHA loan approval official will select the most reasonable choice to reach the 150 percent collateral goal. If the applicant offers an acceptable alternative, the loan approval official will accept the applicant's choice. Because of this change, entity members no longer need to pledge their assets as collateral. Entity members still will be personally obligated on the loan note(s). The Agency proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1941, subpart A, §1941.19; part 1943, subpart A, §1943.19; part 1943, subpart B, §1943.69; and part 1945, subpart D, §1945.169 to incorporate these changes. All loan making regulations are being changed because most applicants affected by disasters apply for various types of farm loans and the changes are needed for administrative consistency. The Agency also proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, §1943.19 to state that chattel property will be taken as security for real estate loans only in certain situations. For the reasons discussed earlier with regard to burdensome chattel security servicing requirements and reduced availability of conventional credit, farm ownership (FO) loans will not be secured with chattels unless there is no other real estate available to provide security at least equal to the loan amount, or unless the chattels are real estate improvements (fixtures) made with FO funds. Generally, real estate values are more constant than chattel values and provide adequate loan security. Chattel security is not desirable on long term real estate loans due to servicing difficulties and rapid depreciation. Because of the limited circumstances in which certain chattel security will be taken on real estate loans, the exception for when title to a livestock or crop enterprise is held by a contractor or under a share lease agreement is no longer needed. The exception to taking a lien, therefore, is being removed from subparts A and B and part 1943. To clarify the existing policy and to assure that all possibilities are considered when the available loan security is not at least equal to the loan amount, 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, §1943.19, along with 7 CFR part 1941, subpart A, §1941.19; 7 CFR part 1943, subpart B, §1943.69; and 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, §1945.169, are revised to specifically state that in situations where the farmer does not or will not have adequate real estate or chattel property to secure the loan needed, other property, including real estate owned by a third party, can serve as security. A pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner. 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, §1943.19, 7 CFR part 1943, subpart B, §1943.69, and 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, §1945.169 will be revised accordingly. This policy already is stated in existing 7 CFR part 1941, subpart A, §1941.19.
