HACCP Round Table Purpose The purpose of the Round Table is to provide a forum for issues involved in the development and implementation of a mandatory HACCP program that will improve the safety of meat and poultry products. The goals of the Round Table are to: 1) identify issues of concern; 2) explore possible areas of agreement and disagreement; and 3) identify measures that will facilitate implementing a preventive system of control by providing input to FSIS prior to rulemaking. Furthermore, the Steering Committee identified six key issues for the Round Table: 1) HACCP Plan Approval; 2) Measures of Effectiveness; 3) Compliance/Enforcement; 4) Relationship and Effect of HACCP on Inspection Procedures; 5) HACCP Training; and 6) Phase-In of Mandatory HACCP. The Steering Committee participated in the drafting of issue papers for these six issues. The six issue papers will be available in advance of the meeting and can be obtained from Mr. Manis. The consideration of other issues either orally or in writing will be entertained at the Round Table. If written material is presented, then one copy must be furnished for the record. The Round Table will be open to the public, and a transcript will be prepared of the meeting. A final report, which will include any comments submitted at the Round Table, will be prepared and made available to the public. Done at Washington, DC, on: March 17, 1994.
