Maysam Abu-'Ali, a former resident of Hebron, said that he had been in the shrine at the time of the massacre and at the hebron Islamic hospital after the incident. He noted that at 05:15 am Friday Barukh Goldstein together with at least six other Zionists who were all in army uniforms attacked the mosque with tens of hand grenades and then sprayed the worshipers with bullets. About 53 worshipers were immediately martyred and 250 others severely wounded while seven others, trying to flee the mosque, were killed and 40 others injured by heavy fire of the Zionist soldiers outside the mosque, he added. He dismissed the Zionist regime's claims that Israeli forces had not cooperated with the attackers and said that the soldiers opened heavy fire in front of the Hebron Islamic hospital on Muslims who had rushed to the scene to donate blood to the wounded, killing three and wounded 30 others. On Palestinians reaction to the massacre, Abu-'Ali remarked that despite extenive presence of the heavily armed Zionist forces around al-Aqsa mosque, over 90,000 Palestiians turned out to hold the Friday prayers in the mosque. In a demonstration which followed the prayers, 17 Palestinian worshipers were martyred and tens of others were wounded, the doctor said. He continued that the Arabic translation of the message of the leader of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, on the Hebron catastrophe, which was soon distributed in all parts of the occupied territories, raised hope in the hearts of the oppressed Palestinians.
