On 4 April, the invading forces sent 400 troops and some tanks to rescue 600 of their colleagues trapped in the western part of Pailin. We attacked them continuously -- shooting, detonating mines, and lobbing hand grenades at them along the trails in the thick bamboo forests. We killed 36 of them, including a general commander, and wounded some others. We destroyed two trucks. The survivors who fled through the bamboo forests were bruised by the bamboo thorns; their faces and bodies were bruised and their clothes were torn. Some lost their way and are still fumbling their way out of the forests. Others were killed or wounded by stepping on land mines planted in the bamboo forests by the Vietnamese. 2. On 5 April, the invading forces mobilized troops to blaze a trail from Boeng Pra-lit to O Rum-el through the bamboo forests. We ambushed them there. We ambushed them 12 times along an 8 km stretch. We killed 19 of them, wounded some others, and destroyed two trucks. Some retreated along the trail and some fled in disarray into the bamboo forests. No one knows how many were killed or wounded or how many were bruised by the bamboo thorns. The fighting on 4 and 5 April took place mostly on small trails inside thick bamboo forests within the perimeter and in the western part of Pailin. 3. On 4 April, we completely swept the invading forces from Bos S'am, north of Pailin. We killed nine of them and wounded 16 others. The survivors fled in great panic into the forests. 4. On 4 and 5 April, we surrounded and attacked Sala Krau. The invading forces were in great panic. We killed 27 of them and wounded some others. The survivors fled in disarray into the forests. (Lay Veareak), commander of the 12th Division in charge of Sala Krau, whose field radio code name is Satan, fled north toward Kon Damrei along with 100 soldiers. He stripped off his uniform to hide his identity as a general. It is generally known that (Lay Veareak) has always been a bandit chieftain operating on the border in the Poipet-Sisophon zone. 5. Also on 4 April, we opened fire on a car -- a French Renault -- and set it ablaze near Boeng Pra-lit. 6. On the morning of 5 April, one of the invading forces' tanks ran over a land mine and broke down near Pang Roloem on Route 10.
