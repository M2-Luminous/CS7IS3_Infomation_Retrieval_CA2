Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, quoted U.S. Government officials as saying that there are strong demands in Congress and mass media for Japan to halt cash remittances. Yanai made the statement at the day's session of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. He represented Japan at weekend trilateral talks in Washington with Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, and Kim Sam-hoon, South Korean special envoy for the nuclear issue. The Cabinet Information Research Office reportedly estimated the aggregate annual amount of cash flow between Japan and North Korea, including two-way trade and investment, at 180 to 200 billion yen. Yanai also quoted Gallucci as saying the U.S. will urge China to stop exports of oil to North Korea, which reportedly depends on China for 60 percent of its oil imports and 75 percent of its food imports. Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry officials told a team of the no. 1 opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on Wednesday that Japan has expressed its willingness to comply with the U.S. call to stop cash remittances to North Korea, LDP officials said. Yanai and other diplomats told the team headed by LDP Policy Affairs Research Council Chairman Ryutaro Hashimoto that it is possible to regulate cash gifts to relatives from Korean residents of Japan traveling to North Korea by sea and air, the officials said. Japan need only take "legal measures" to put a ceiling on the sum of money Korean travelers are legally allowed to take out of Japan to North Korea, Yanai was quoted as saying. A ministry official said, "some rationale is needed to hold down the maximum sum of money a traveler would be allowed to take to a specific country." Ministry officials also said it is legally possible to ban the entry of North Korean diplomats to Japan as part of a package of sanctions. However, they said the maximum curb Japan could impose on limiting the travel and reentry of Korean residents of Japan between Japan and North Korea is a nonbinding "recommendation for them not to travel to North Korea." "It is impossible to ban the travel of ordinary citizens in view of international laws and the U.N. Convention on Human Rights," a ministry official was quoted as saying. The official also told the LDP team that he believes the U.S. would not be able to slap multilateral sanctions with Japan and South Korea "without awaiting the issuance of a UN Security Council resolution." In a related development, a government source expressed distrust in North Korea's handling of its people. "North Korea spends most of its national income on military expenditure," he said, and added that the country's common sense is beyond comprehension for Japanese people. "A dictatorship tends to create tension among foreign countries and tries to impose order domestically while keeping its people hungry," he said.
