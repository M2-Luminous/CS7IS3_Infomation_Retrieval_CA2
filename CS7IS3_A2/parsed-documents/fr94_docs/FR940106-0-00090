FR940106-0-00090 FR940106-0-00021 One commenter, an employer organization, suggested a new waiver provision. This commenter proposed that any facility which can demonstrate that it is unable to meet the requirements for nursing services under title XVIII or title XIX of the Social Security Act, or that can demonstrate that it fails to meet minimum federal or state statutory requirements for nursing staff, should be exempt from the fourth attestation element_timely and significant steps. The Department has concluded that it does not have the authority to promulgate such a waiver, since timely and significant steps are required by the statute. 5. Review of Attestations Accepted and Not Accepted for Filing The interim final rule's provision for administrative-judicial review of a determination by DOL whether or not to accept an attestation for filing has been clarified. Under ยง XXX .301(e), an appeal may be taken to the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals only on an ETA determination where ETA has performed a review function. The four instances in which ETA performs a review function involve determinations on the following issues only: (1) The facility attests to a ``non-standard'' indicator of substantial disruption (Element I); (2) the facility takes as one of its two steps a ``non-standard'' timely and significant step (Element IV); (3) the facility attests that taking a second timely and significant step under Element IV would not be reasonable; and (4) the facility is not an employer of H&hyph;1A nurses and is claiming a bona fide medical emergency as the basis for requesting a waiver of one or more of the attestation elements. 6. Technical Amendments to Enforcement Subpart Based on ESA's operational experience with the H&hyph;1A program, three technical changes have been made in subpart E on enforcement. First, to regularize the hearing process, while remaining consistent with Congressional intent regarding timely hearings for interested parties, the final rule specifies that, once the deadline for requesting a hearing has expired, an interested party may participate in an administrative law judge proceeding only with the approval of the judge. Further, to make the hearing and notification process more easily understood, the final rule has a separate section setting out the stages at which the enforcement determination becomes final agency action and notification (if any) is sent to ETA and INS. In the interim final rule, these provisions appeared in the same section with the provisions regarding the ESA determination notification, and this regulatory structure was somewhat confusing. In addition, the final rule contains an express statement of the opportunity to direct inquiries and requests for technical assistance to the Wage and Hour Division of ESA. The final rule also expressly authorizes the filing of hearing requests by facsimile transmission (FAX) and requires that the Solicitor of Labor will be appropriately served with hearing requests. Finally, the rule has been modified to make corrections regarding cross references and citations. II. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in the final rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and have been assigned OMB Control No. 1205&hyph;0305. Based on operating experience, technical changes were made to the Form ETA 9029 to clarify the attestation requirements and reduce the need for separate explanatory statements. The Department believes that the changes to the form will result in a decrease in the proportion of attestations returned to employers because they are unacceptable for filing. Included among the changes made to the form are the following: a. The phrase ``no explanatory statement required'' has been added as a parenthetical after the first two indicators of substantial disruption under item 8.a.(ii), to make it clear that explanatory statements are no longer required for these two attestation elements. b. The word ``past'' has been added before ``elimination/curtailment'' in the third indicator of substantial disruption under item 8.a.(ii), to make it clear that the elimination or curtailment must already have occurred. c. Language has been added under item 8.b. clarifying that in order to be in compliance with the no adverse effect wage requirement the facility must be paying each nurse it employs at least the prevailing wage as determined by the SESA unless wages for nurses at the facility are the result of a collective bargaining agreement. d. The words ``developed under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act'' have been added to item 8.d.(i) to clarify that the State plan has to be one developed pursuant to the requirements of the INA. e. The words ``steps of comparable timeliness and significance'' have been added to the sixth box under item 8.d.(ii) to clarify the ``other'' timely and significant step category.
