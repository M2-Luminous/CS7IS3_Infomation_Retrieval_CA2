FR940926-0-00010 FR940926-0-00004 The Commission received six letters commenting on the proposed rule. Copies of the letters are available for public inspection and copying for a fee at the Commission's Public Document Room, located at 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Five of the letters, two of which were from the same company, came from U.S. manufacturers that utilize sources containing the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides. These commenters strongly objected to the revocation of the general licenses for the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides, particularly californium-252 (Cf-252). The commenters indicated that the specific licensing requirements could result in serious economic disadvantage to their export business. It is their view that specific licenses would be disruptive to their businesses and cause them to lose potential business because of the higher expenses of license application fees, the additional paperwork burden, time delays, and uncertainties in delivery. One commenter believed the current general license regulations in Part 40 provided sufficient documentation to identify the supplier, quantity exported, and end user/end use. Several commenters argued that the revisions were unnecessary and were without any benefit to the stated objective of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. In view of these adverse comments, the NRC asked the companies to provide specific sales data on their exports to better understand the implications of the new regulation. After reviewing the responses, the NRC continues to believe that the economic impact on these companies is not significant because of the steps we have taken to address their concerns. First, the new general licenses permit the export of the specified alpha-emitters in quantities up to 100 millicuries to most countries, even when they are shipped separately from the equipment in which they are to be used. This understanding, in itself, reduced much of their concerns. The final rule was revised to clarify this point. Other new general licenses permit the export of unlimited quantities (except as limited by existing general licenses) of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides to NSG member countries. These new general licenses will allow the companies to export a significant quantity of their Cf-252 sources, including replenishment sources, without obtaining specific licenses. Also the companies are encouraged to apply for broad, long-term licenses to export their Cf-252 sources. These kinds of applications could include customers in a number of friendly, non-NSG countries and in sufficient quantities to cover replenishment sources for six years. Several commenters questioned whether a source containing less than 100 millicuries (186 micrograms) of Cf-252, if shipped separately from the device in which it is to be used, could be exported under the proposed new general license. One commenter noted that in the NRC materials licensing regulations, a ``source'' is not defined as a ``device''. As stated above, the NRC considers, for the purpose of part 110, that the export of a Cf-252 source for use in a specified device qualifies for this general license. The new general licenses are revised to clarify this point. One commenter requested that the effective date of the rule be delayed or that exports under contract be exempted by a ``grandfather'' clause to avoid possible forced defaults in currently existing contracts that are now subject to specific licensing controls. In response to this concern, the effective date of this rule is 45 days after publication. This should be sufficient time for exports that are ``in process'' to be accomplished without default. The NRC did not consider a ``grandfather'' clause in the rule to cover committed contracts. One commenter has committed contracts to deliver Cf-252 sources to the year 1997. The NRC believes these sources should not be excluded from the new regulation for more than another few weeks. The applicable export control guidelines were agreed to by the U.S. and other NSG member countries in 1992 and should be implemented by the NRC without an extended delay. A commenter representing a major U.S. vendor stated that the proposed restructuring of Appendix A and the new language still did not clearly delineate which minor reactor components required NRC licenses and which fall within the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce. The commenter believed that the proposed amendment could result in increased confusion for exporters. In view of this comment, the Commission defers consideration of the revision of Appendix A to a future rulemaking. The same commenter was concerned that service tooling contaminated with residual byproduct, source, or special nuclear material may be subject to specific licensing controls under the proposed rule. It is not the intent of the NRC to place new controls on these types of nuclear materials in this rulemaking. III. The Final Rule Under current NRC regulations, bulk tritium in quantities up to 100 curies, the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides in unlimited quantities, and transuranic isotopes americium-242m, californium-249, californium-251, and curium-245 in unlimited quantities can be exported to most countries under general licenses. The final rule amends the general license provisions in §§110.21&hyph;110.23 for the export of special nuclear, source, and byproduct material to revoke the general licenses for these materials. Specific licensing controls are established on the above materials. Although some of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides inadvertently were not specifically identified in the proposed rule, they are included in the general license revocation implemented by this rule. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile are removed from the list of restricted destinations in §110.29. Since publication of the proposed rule, Argentina and Brazil have ratified and begun implementation of the Argentina/Brazil/IAEA full-scope safeguards agreement and Chile has waived into force the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Section 110.30 is a list of the other member countries of the NSG. Exports of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides in unlimited quantities (except as limited by the existing general licenses) and dispersed tritium in quantities up to 40 curies per device are permitted to NSG member countries under the new general licenses established for them. Subsequent to the publication of the proposed rule, Argentina has become a member of the NSG and is included in the list. Three items covered in this final rule were not specifically identified in the proposed rule: (1) The general licenses in §110.23 for einsteinium-252 -253 -254 -255, fermium-257, gadolinium-148, and mendelevium-258 are revoked; (2) Argentina, Brazil, and Chile are removed from the restricted destination list in §110.29; and (3) Argentina is added to the NSG member list in §110.30. Although the NRC did not publish these changes for comment in the proposed rule, the NRC is merely codifying international obligations of the United States. The NRC is proceeding to final rule because these changes involve a foreign affairs function of the United States. Therefore, solicitation of public comment is not required under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)) and 10 CFR 110.132(e) and 110.134. Here solicitation of public comments would delay U.S. conformance with its international obligations and therefore would not be in the public interest. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described as a categorical exclusion under 10 CFR 51.22 (c)(1) and (c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150&hyph;0036 and 3150&hyph;0027. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average less than 3 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;10202, (3150&hyph;0036, 3150&hyph;0027), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.
