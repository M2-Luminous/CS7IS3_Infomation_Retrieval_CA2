Areas inhabited by minority nationalities must make use of the favorable opportunity resulting from industrial transference from more advanced areas of the country to take the initiative to readjust their industrial setups in light of their own local conditions. This is of great significance to speeding up their economic development. From 21 to 26 April, Li Tieying went deep into enterprises in Beihai, Nanning, Liuzhou, and Guilin to carry out on-the-spot inspections, and held discussions with responsible persons of relevant local units and entrepreneurs. Since last year, cadres and masses of various nationalities in Guangxi have implemented the spirit of the remarks of Comrade Deng Xiaoping made during his southern tour and of the 14th CPC National Congress to further emancipate their minds and speed up the pace of reform and opening up. Guangxi has entered a period of rapid development. Last year the region's GNP was 19.6 percent higher than in 1992. This was the best year in its history. Total incomes of township and town enterprises increased by 140 percent, and the margin of increase had ranked first in the whole country for three years running. The amount of foreign capital actually used increased by 300 percent, and the margin of increase also led in the coastal areas. People's livelihood had been markedly improved, and per capita income of residents in cities and towns grew by 38.5 percent. Per capita net income of peasants rose by 20.9 percent. Li Tieying held: As long as we promote reform through expanding opening up, promote opening up through deepening reform, seize on the fine opportunity of industrial transference, and exploit Guangxi's regional strong points, we can follow a suitable path for our efforts to speed up economic development. He pointed out: When economic development is speeded up, industrial transference can definitely be quickened. At present, more advanced areas are speeding up their industrial transference to less advanced areas. For the latter, this is their fine opportunity. The fact that sugar production is being shifted from the east to the west is a good example. Guangdong was a big sugar-producing province. In recent years, it is making efforts to develop other undertakings with higher additional value. Guangxi is now making great efforts to vigorously develop its sugarcane planting undertaking, and cane sugar processing industry as well. Its sugar production output now rank first in the whole country. Taking the initiative to seize the fine opportunity of the more advanced areas' industrial transference is a good idea for promoting economic development. Promoting industrial transference in a region itself is also a good idea. Readjusting product mix in accordance with international market demand aimed at increasing its market share is a good idea too. For instance, Guangxi produces more than 800 kinds of tropical fruit. The fruit-processing industry can be spread from key cities like Nanning and others to other prefectures, counties and cities. Guilin's watermelon frost [a kind of Chinese medicine] is warmly welcomed by consumers. If a city noted for tourism can develop its main production of souvenirs to meet the demand of both Chinese and foreign tourists, it can have more opportunities to occupy the market. Organization and development work in a planned way can form unique industrial strong points of areas inhabited by minority nationalities. Li Tieying said: It is necessary to carry out various kinds of reforms on an experimental basis in a number of selected enterprises in townships and cities, do a solid job, and score achievements. He added: Under the new situation of reform, cadres must participate in transformation and carry out profound investigations and studies. It is unnecessary for them to devise a certain kind of pattern. They must conscientiously sum up experiences. Factory directors and managers must study hot and difficult points in reform, and become all-round entrepreneurs noted for their effective operations. Areas inhabited by minority nationalities must proceed from reality to actively and steadily carry out reform in systems regarding enterprises' property rights and the establishment of modern enterprises. Li Tieying stressed: Guangdong has fully exploited its strong points of being adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, adjoining international markets, and having quick access to information to promote its economic development. Guangxi also has the strong point of adjoining the Southeast Asian market. It must grasp well infrastructure projects to fully make use of its strong point as a sea passageway of the vast southwestern region to invigorate its economy and cause it to serve the vast southwestern region. It must firmly seize the fine opportunity of the flow of commerce, commodities, qualified personnel, and information brought about by its position as a sea passageway to make itself prosperous and flourishing through reform and opening up. When Comrade Li Tieying was carrying out his inspection in Guangxi, regional CPC Secretary Zhao Fuli, who was conducting investigations and studies in prefectures and counties, reported to and briefed him on our region's reform and opening up, and economic development in recent years. Liu Mingzu, regional party deputy secretary and chairman of the regional people's congress standing committee, accompanied Comrade Li Tieying during the entire inspection tour.
