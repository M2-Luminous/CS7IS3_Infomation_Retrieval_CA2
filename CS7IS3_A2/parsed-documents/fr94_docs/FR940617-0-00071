FR940617-0-00071 FR940617-0-00016 Section-by-Section Comments on 36 CFR Part 290 Section 290.1␣Purpose and Scope In considering the general comments on the scope and detail of the regulations addressed in the preceding section of this preamble, the Department concludes that the proposed rule was confusing in specifying that the initial determination of significant caves would be made by a special process and that subsequent significant cave determinations would be made through the forest plan amendment or revision process. The final rule clarifies this concern by: (1) stating that significant cave resources will be managed pursuant to direction contained in individual forest plans and in accordance with the policies contained in the Forest Service Directive System and (2) by eliminating any reference to forest planning in the initial and subsequent listings. This change acknowledges that forest plans provide direction to manage significant caves but do not contain a list of these caves. Section 290.2␣Definitions Authorized Officer Several respondents expressed concern over the range of potentially designated authorized officers listed in the proposed rule. One respondent felt that the authorizing officer should be the Regional Forester while another felt this authority should not be delegated below the Forest Supervisor level. Another felt the final decision for determining significant caves should be at a senior management level. Further, some respondents indicated that the authorized officer should have qualifications and duties related to caves and/or cave resources. The comments received on this definition reflect a lack of understanding of how authority is delegated through the Forest Service. Authority flows from the Chief through Regional Foresters to Forest Supervisors and District Rangers. These line officers have responsibility for managing all resources, including caves, and will be legally responsible for complying with this rule and the Act. The agency will delegate that responsibility through the issuance of internal agency directives and the delegation of authority will vary depending on the significance of the action being assigned. In general, the authorized officer will refer to the Forest Supervisor who must carry out the evaluations and documentations required by the rule in the context of forest planning. To avoid confusion, the definition in the final rule does not include the list of all potential authorized officers. Cave The agency received a range of opinions on this definition. Some respondents felt the definition was too narrow; others believed it was too broad. Some respondents, stating that a vug is one resource the Act is intended to protect, were concerned with the exclusion of vugs from the definition. Individual respondents suggested modifying the definition to include qualifiers such as: a dark zone; a minimum horizontal or vertical length; absence or presence of an entrance at any specific time period, and a naturally formed subterranean open area. A couple of respondents were concerned about the requirement that an individual be able to enter. One felt this precluded passages accessible for small cave biota. Another felt this requirement may allow for enlarging small openings to make them accessible as caves. One respondent was concerned that the definition would not protect the ``unnatural'' portion of caves from destruction or restrict the location of such from the general public. The Department has concluded that the definition in the proposed rule was confusing because it described both the components of a cave and the features that do not comprise a cave. Accordingly, in the final rule, this definition has been revised to focus on what a cave is, rather than what it is not. ``Feature'' was replaced with ``opening'' since it was felt the intent is to include small air passages that extend from the cave itself and that are integral parts of the cave. This definition encompasses any entranceways, including excavated passage; therefore, the location and passage associated with the excavated portion is considered under purposes of this Act. While the suggested qualifiers further define features associated with caves, they were not added because they extend beyond the scope of the cave definition listed in the Act. Cave Resources Some respondents suggested that historical resources be separated from the rest of the resources listed as naturally occurring. A few respondents noted that speleogens and speleothems should be defined since these terms are not commonly found in dictionaries. The term ``naturally'' was removed as suggested since cultural materials do not occur naturally in caves. Speleogens and speleothems are not included in the definition in the final rule since they are but a couple of the features that comprise geologic and mineralogic materials or substances. National Forest System Lands Several respondents were confused over which lands the Act applied to: non-federal lands on which the agency has planned projects, private lands with caves affected by agency projects on Federal lands, lands owned in fee title, and/or National Forest System lands. A definition for ``National Forest System lands'' has been added. This rule applies only to lands managed by and under the legal jurisdiction of the Forest Service. The Act contains no language extending agency authority to private property. Significant Cave Several respondents noted that this definition should correspond to the criteria listed in proposed section 290.3(b). This definition was revised to include the criteria now in §290.3 (c) and (d). Vug Respondents overlapped their comments on ``vug'' with the ``cave'' definition. A couple of respondents suggested clarifications to the definition including: Add a size definition other than ``small'' and make clear that a vug is only a stand-alone cavity presumable intersected by a man-made passage. Since the only reference to a vug was in the definition of a cave and this reference has now been removed, the separate definition of a vug is no longer necessary. Section 290.3␣Determining Significant Caves Comments are presented by major paragraph of this section of the proposed rule.
