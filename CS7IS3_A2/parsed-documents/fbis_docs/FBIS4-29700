"The NDF delegation and the (government) panel agreed to hold the next round of talks in the Benelux within the third quarter of this year," Howard Dee, chief government negotiator, said in a statement. He did not say where in the three Benelux territories -- Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg -- the meeting will take place. Neither did Dee say why Vietnam was dropped as venue but said the panels thanked Hanoi for earlier agreeing to host the talks. Vietnam had earlier declined a request by the NDF to act as third-party mediator in the peace talks. The government and the NDF simultaneously released to media yesterday the 10 point agreement they signed during the 10 to 14 June meeting in Breukelen, near Amsterdam. The document showed that while the issues were discussed, they were not resolved. The first seven points are NDF's requests and objections which the rebels said are "goodwill measures" to be voluntarily undertaken and are not to be taken as preconditions to the talks. The joint statement signed for government by Dee and for the NDF by Vice Chair Luis Jalandoni said: -- The NDF pressed the government to "stop its policy" of treating and prosecuting political offenders as common criminals. But the government insisted there are no political prisoners. -- The Dee panel will convey to the president the NDF's request for the immediate release of political prisoners. The NDF will provide a list but stressed it does not mean they are members of the movement. -- The NDF endorsed claims for indemnification of victims of human rights violations during the Marcos regime for at least 30 percent of the money to be recovered from the Swiss bank deposits of the late strongman. -- The NDF warned the government against violating the joint declaration signed in The Hague during exploratory talks in September 1992, if it will enter into peace talks with communist breakaway factions. The government panel said it is its own prerogative and does not consider it a violation at all. -- The NDF vigorously objected to the two amnesty proclamations of Mr. Ramos, saying it "impinges upon the organizational integrity" of the NDF. The government said another amnesty proclamation can be issued after the peace talks. Proclamations 347 and 348 were for those who have already surfaced, it said. -- The NDF also objected to Executive Order 125 as an imposition on the rebels of the Constitution. The government refuted this, saying the order merely provides adherence to constitutional processes. The only two points of agreement were the holding of the next round and the issuance of safety and immunity guarantees for negotiators, staffers, consultants and security detail during the talks. The panels set an eight-point agenda for the next meeting, including the review of confidence-building measures, the date-and venue of the formal talks, and sequencing of the formal agenda to be tackled prior to the talks by reciprocal committees.
