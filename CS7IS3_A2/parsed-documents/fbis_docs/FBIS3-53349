He said in a news conference this evening that Egypt and France are willing to promote their relations, especially in the fields of investment, culture, and encouragement of Francophonism in Egypt. On the Middle East peace process, Juppe said France has supported this process since the Oslo declaration, and is eager for its timetable to be implemented so that it will not be obstructed. He emphasized the importance France attaches to Lebanon's fate in the comprehensive regional settlement. Lebanon's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity must be preserved, and the settlement must not be achieved at Lebanon's expense, he said. Juppe said that in his talks in Egypt, cooperation in the Mediterranean region was discussed. Egypt and France represent a Mediterranean power, and we are determined to intensify our dialogue in the economic and security spheres, he said. He said Egypt was the first to call for a Mediterranean forum, and added: We have contributed to this idea since November, and 'Amr Musa and I decided this morning to prepare for a semi-official meeting next summer "in the same way unofficial European meetings are held." On the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the NATO meetings, Juppe said his country accepts any criticism except that of being careless. He said France made the biggest efforts to stop the tragedy and sent 6,000 soldiers to that region. He noted that those soldiers are subject to many risks, and that there have been many victims. The French minister said his country has also sent humanitarian relief and transferred hundreds of millions of ECUs for relief operations, which is a tremendous European and French effort. Juppe said that in the recent NATO meeting, France demanded that the question of Bosnia-Herzegovina be listed on the agenda although everybody else asked that the issue not be discussed. He explained that the 16 NATO members supported the European political plan, which says that each community must have enough land to survive and have its own outlet as a basis for a peaceful settlement. If this plan is signed, he said, those countries will be ready to send some 50,000 soldiers to the field. He added: The United States has expressed readiness to contribute half this force, and we are ready to help the United Nations implement its resolutions by sending planes today if we are asked. However, no one asked us to attack Serbian positions. Juppe said there are issues related to two security regions. The first is Srebrenica, around which the Serbs are tightening the noose and where France expressed readiness to replace the Canadian forces, which are willing to withdraw. The second is Tuzla airport, which is under shelling by Serbia. Juppe said France demanded that Tuzla airport be reopened, and French planes will land there to deliver humanitarian aid. If we are attacked, we will retaliate, he said. He stressed that the peaceful solution is the actual solution, and for it to happen, the formation of a court to punish those who violate human rights and perpetrate crimes against their peoples must be considered. The French foreign minister pointed out that his country made great financial efforts concerning the Bosnian problems, spending 500 million ECU. It has also made several initiatives over the past nine months, but all these efforts failed, and that is why we were active in the NATO meeting a few days ago, he said. Juppe noted the possibility of misunderstanding the international and European positions toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially by the Islamic world. He said Egypt is affected by this misunderstanding, where Europe is accused of abandoning Bosnia and allowing human rights violations there to go unpunished. He said: But today is not September 1991; it is January 1994. Things have changed, and Europe is now right in drafting the only peace plan proposed. The French foreign minister pointed out that the operations concerning Srebrenica and Tuzla are useful for humanitarian purposes, but will not solve the basic problem. He stressed the need to work out a peaceful plan to stop the bloodshed and reinforce the airlift to Sarajevo. He said: We warned the Serbs that we would attack them from the air if they fail to comply with these resolutions. If the NATO resolutions are not implemented, he said, the alliance's prestige will be put to the test. Asked about the restoration of relations between the Vatican and Israel, Juppe expressed the belief that this is natural, positive and it helps advance the peace process. "If the PLO has recognized Israel, I wonder why the Vatican should not," he said. He said the Oslo accord will not solve the problem of Jerusalem, which will be solved later. Asked about France's position toward Libya and Iraq, Juppe said: Concerning Libya, we demand that the UN resolutions and international law be implemented. We also demand that Iraq implement the UN resolutions. He noted that Iraq had implemented some resolutions, but said that all resolutions must be implemented. Juppe called for destroying all mass-destruction weapon networks in Iraq; ensuring the safety of Kuwaiti territory; Iraq's recognizing the borders and refraining from changing them; and Iraq's refraining from practicing violence against population centers. The French foreign minister said: I would like to point to some progress concerning Libya. I have heard information on this topic and have read how far things have gone concerning some proposals, but no progress has been made in this field. On French-Iranian relations, Juppe said that his country shared the European view which stresses the need for a critical dialogue with Iran. He said the policy of isolation toward that country is futile. We will ask for official guarantees that Iran will abandon terrorism and respect international laws, he said.
