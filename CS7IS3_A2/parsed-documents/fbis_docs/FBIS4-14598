The negotiations, which centered around security in Hebron, ended with the decision to send international observers to this city. "Russia as a co-sponsor of the peace process is firmly convinced that these accords must be followed by new steps, and first of all by the signing of an agreement on Gaza and Jericho and its implementation in accordance with the schedule indicated in the declaration of principles. This would enable not only an easing of tension on occupied territories but also open up a path towards the advancement of the entire negotiating process aimed at establishing a fair and durable peace in the Middle East," the Russian Foreign Ministry said. The Russian ministry expressed the hope that the accords reached in the course of the negotiations would be fulfilled to provide reliable protection to the Palestinian population and normalise the situation on the occupied territories.
