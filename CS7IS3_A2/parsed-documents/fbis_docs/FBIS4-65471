Will the union be less cohesive? [Brundtland] I do not think so. That is because at its meeting in Lisbon, the EU Council decided that the expansion should proceed on the basis of the existing balance. However, there will, of course, be new discussions once a country is admitted. We will enter such discussion without any preconceptions. [Ruehl] But does this expansion toward the north and northeast not mean that there will be a geopolitical change, especially for Russia? [Brundtland] Yes, because if one views such a move from a historical angle, against the background of the Cold War, then northern Europe was geographically and militarily close to the focal point of East-West confrontation, if only because of Russia's access to the Atlantic and the USSR's strategic complex, the North Sea Fleet, and the submarines that could launch missiles based at Kola. The "northern balance" in the Cold War became apparent after Norway and Denmark joined NATO in 1949, while Sweden and Finland remained neutral. That was how everything was settled. With the collapse of the Soviet empire, this eastern barrier disappeared and the road to the West was opened up. All of northern Europe now has the possibility of embarking on the EU path, so that it can then have a common border with Russia, one that will include Norway's border with Russia in the north and the entire Russo-Finnish border. This is now part of the European reality. However, if one looks back to the time when the Soviet Union still existed, then one also realizes that all the countries here in the north had good relations with Soviet Russia; trade, cross-border traffic, and relations in general were good. That will also make future European policy vis-a-vis Russia simpler. The three northern European countries will make a significant contribution in this respect. [Ruehl] So, you share a view that is widespread in Moscow, namely, that an expansion of the EU could be a way of pressuring Russia? Some would see it as an advance staged by the Western bloc of states or, in any event, by a strong military grouping. For example, the head of the Russian intelligence service, Primakov, spoke of the dangers of the West's offensive military capacity in connection with NATO. [Brundtland] I do not think that such views reflect current Russian thinking about West Europe. The Russians have the experience of cooperating with Norway, Finland, and Sweden. This has enabled them to develop confidence in the northern European countries, in the fact that those countries desire to live in peace in the region along with Russia, without confrontation and to the exclusion of no one. With the "Barents initiative," Norway made a proposal for the further development of regional cooperation that was taken up by Russia. The proposal envisages cooperation in the fields of business, ecology, technology, and culture -- cooperation extending beyond borders and involving the northern European countries, Russia, the United States, and the EU. Russia understands a positive initiative of this kind. Foreign Minister Kozyrev has said that it would be advantageous from the Russian viewpoint for Norway to be a member of the EU. Some people were surprised by that, but I was not. [Ruehl] Would that also apply to an expansion of the EU in the north and in the Baltic region? [Brundtland] As a NATO member, Norway is an associate member of the Western European Union [WEU]. We also want to become full members of the WEU as soon as we have joined the EU. That also depends, of course, on how the Norwegian people vote on the admission treaty. We want to be able to function fully in both organizations, because we cannot be only members of the EU or alternatively, only members of the WEU. Norway will then be an active partner in the common foreign and security policies envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty and contribute to their development. That is our goal. [Ruehl] Does this mean that Norway will also advocate enhancing the status of the WEU as a "European pillar" within NATO? Should one try, in the course of expanding the EU, to make more of the WEU than has been the case so far? The WEU has in fact already assumed the tasks of the alliance's European group of partners and has established direct relations with NATO in Brussels. [Brundtland] I am not sure about that question until we are in the EU. At this point, I cannot judge how different roles should best be assigned to the EU and WEU in the future. I want to see how things function within the EU. One must also consider the fact that the European partners in the EU cooperate much more closely within the EU than within the WEU or NATO. The EU foreign ministers meet each other more often, more than once a month, which means that political consultations at the governmental level are the most frequent within the EU. These meetings mean that there is an ongoing dialogue and a process of reaching agreement. There is no doubt that this central relationship within the EU will be the basis of common policy and will have a vital function in determining European security interests and security policy tasks. At the head of government and foreign minister level, the European governments formulate common NATO policy and represent the decisions made by their countries with NATO in the same way as they do within the EU in the case of European affairs. This is the background against which one must consider what is left for the WEU as a "European pillar." Countries and their governments are always the key elements. [Ruehl] To ensure its security, Norway has in the past primarily relied on the United States and Great Britain to protect NATO's northern flank and has insisted on an adequate U.S. presence on the northern flank with the provision of reinforcements from the United States and the U.S. Atlantic fleet for crises deployment in the Norwegian Sea. Has something changed for Norway in this respect following the end of the Soviet Union or does Oslo still always look across the Atlantic to the distant west and count on a strategic umbrella and a military commitment on the part of the United States? [Brundtland] We are still of the opinion that the transatlantic bond should not be weakened. In Europe, one would no longer have security or would not have security at the same level if this bond were weakened. One can say that as a Norwegian, but also as a German, a Briton, and even as a Frenchman, which is something that the French have incidentally recognized in the meantime. The Norwegian Government has constantly lobbied the U.S. Administration and the Congress in Washington to maintain, not reduce the U.S. military presence on Norway's coastline and northern flank. In view of reductions in the military budget, particularly the U.S. one, and the restructuring of the U.S. Armed Forces, we have been emphasizing the fact that the transatlantic link and U.S. military forces are still needed. The alliance's strength and Europe's security is based on the sum total of European and North American defense efforts. [Ruehl] Should this support be extended to the Baltic and eastern Central Europe by expanding NATO eastward? [Brundtland] I think that we should leave things in the form that was decided on at the NATO Council meeting in January. The offer of Partnership for Peace [PFP] to all European countries that do not belong to NATO, which also means all the countries to the east of the alliance, makes it possible to hold discussions with everyone about their specific circumstances, and on the basis of the actual situation of each country, look at a given country's security needs, at what obligations it can assume, and what contributions it can make. In any event, there will be a bilateral relationship between a given country and NATO and not simply a security guarantee issued by NATO. NATO made that a precondition for these new partnerships before the offer was made in Brussels. It is a good solution. [Ruehl] Do you consider the PFP to be an experiment or a fixed program, a model enabling NATO to organize European security beyond alliance territory? [Brundtland] I view it as a flexible process that will allow experience to be acquired. Now that some countries have accepted the offer, a certain dynamic can be set in motion that will parallel the expansion of the EU. The process will take several years and create a network of bilateral ties between NATO and other states. [Ruehl] This leads one back to the question of a special security partnership between NATO and Russia. President Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Kozyrev have expressed concern that a new form of confrontation might not necessarily come into being, but that a new dividing line might appear in Europe, one created by the West. Kozyrev even warned France against reviving the 1920's policy of a "cordon sanitaire to isolate Russia." [Brundtland] Well, that is one aspect of an analysis of the situation in Europe. NATO started a discussion about these issues, about the relationship to Russia, and the result was the January council resolution with an offer that also applies to Russia so as to prevent the appearance of a new dividing line between Europe and Russia. Earlier Russian statements conveyed concern and expressed warnings about pursuing a policy that would exclude Russia. Nothing of that sort occurred in Brussels in January. That is why the PFP has also been offered to Russia. No new barriers should be erected. [Ruehl] With regard to security, President Yeltsin always returns to the same point: Russian participation in a special relationship with NATO and, incidentally, a bilateral relationship with the United States, one between two nuclear superpowers with a great military potential. Evidently, he wants more than the partnership offer, something very special, something appropriate to Russia's significance and not the expansion of NATO to cover the territory of the former Warsaw Pact. He has been talking about the "geopolitical balance" in 1990, which should not be changed in a way that would be to Russia's disadvantage. He has also proposed a "joint security guarantee" given to other states by both NATO and Russia instead of admission to NATO, and he has taken up what Clinton said about a "strategic partnership with Russia." [Brundtland] In its declaration, the NATO Council avoided potentially negative aspects in that sense. This period of history is not one in which one could have a division of power in Europe, a "condominium" between two superpowers, or the creation of "strategic spheres of interest." The days of empire and hegemony are over, as Yeltsin himself said. However, the rejection of such ideas does not mean that one should fail to take account of Russia's history and interests. Indeed, it means that one must take account of Russia's interests with respect to economic development, to participate in European institutions and international agreements such as the GATT customs and trade treaty, and to have an input into the kind of "mixed economy" that we have in the West. That is because none of us lives in a "capitalist society." In our free market economies, we have a public sector alongside a private sector. The East European countries, including Russia, could develop in line with this model of a "mixed economy." [Ruehl] Let's stay with this model. As part of the EU, what could northern Europe do in the Baltic region? [Brundtland] Our goal is to develop and consolidate democracy. That applies to all the East European countries, but, of course, also to Russia, with which we live in the same part of Europe. Our own security needs dictate that we support the development of democracy and a cooperative attitude on the part of Russia toward its neighbors, beginning with the Baltic states, whose development we are also assisting and that also look toward northern Europe. The northern European countries have a democratic tradition, one composed of a social democracy along with a "mixed economy," in which the state is also active. This could provide a model for the East European countries. Europe must view the opening up of the East as a historic challenge. The EU now has the possibility of acquiring a truly pan-European significance -- to go beyond a single market and political union -- and to become more than just a customs and monetary union for an economic region, although that in itself is already of great significance. That is of even greater benefit to the countries of East Europe, because only cooperation can settle problems with Russia pertaining to the present situation and history and thus create a community of neighbors between whom, just as in West Europe, there can be no confrontation. Of course, it is not easy to balance interests, but we can conclude compromises. We will make an effort to achieve that. [Ruehl] Thus, should Russia become a G-7 partner? [Brundtland] That is difficult to say today, especially if one is not a member oneself. In a certain sense perhaps; it depends on the arrangements that are made. In any event, Russia is a great nation that must be taken seriously and must participate in discussions about the future of the world economy. That is in our common interest, because we are all involved in developing a democratic society. We are already cooperating with Russia in the north and in the Baltic region, and Germany and Poland are also involved in that cooperation. [Ruehl] Irrespective of that, what is your opinion of a "strategic partnership with Russia," which has also been offered by NATO General Secretary Manfred Woerner? [Brundtland] We all have an interest in a good relationship between the United States and Russia, which also involves bilateral relations between the two superpowers and especially cooperation with Russia participation on the UN Security Council. This should also be given a multilateral institutional configuration, covering Russian relations with the EU and NATO as well as Russia's position within the CSCE. [Ruehl] We would like to turn to the subject of Bosnia now. What conclusions are to be drawn from Western policy on the collapse of the Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflict there and from what NATO has done? [Brundtland] The main problem in the EU as well as in NATO was that the most important partners did not agree on a common analysis of the causes of the conflict, criteria for action, and common interests in good time. That also had an impact on the Security Council. [Ruehl] If one views all these things together: What are the implications for European security and the role of various organizations, for example, the CSCE, or the WEU and NATO? [Brundtland] As far as the application of CSCE rules and principles and the oversight of situations and developments are concerned, the CSCE has a positive role. However, in the case of preserving or establishing peace, authority lies with the UN Security Council, which is alone in having the authority to decide on the use of force and sanctions and to issue a mandate for specific political or military operations. The United Nations is the only organization that has a mandate from all nations to act in the name of international security. Outside the bounds of collective security, NATO can only act with a UN mandate, that is, in the service of NATO. [Ruehl] Through its actions, has the West not played into the hands of the parties to the conflict? [Brundtland] The problem is that when this tragedy began, the United States and the most influential nations in Europe were unable to agree on a common assessment of what was at stake. Differing views were expressed for too long a time, and the parties to the conflict played these differences off against each other, going along with one European opinion on one occasion, then switching to another European view or that of the United States in order to gain advantages. I hope it has now been realized that it is necessary to adopt a common stance based on a joint assessment of the situation and a joint concept for a policy. The alliance summit resulted in the unanimous adoption of basic principles on Bosnia. The difficulties involved in reaching agreement and deciding on joint action did indeed -- to answer your question -- play into the hands of the various parties to the conflict. They used that opportunity in dealings with the EU and UN Security Council. We have been taught a lesson, a very bitter one, I believe.
