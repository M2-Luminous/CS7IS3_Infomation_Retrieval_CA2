Did you discuss with Andreas Khol, the EDU secretary general, the petition for a referendum [initiated by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia], which he had called undemocratic a few days earlier? [Carnogursky] I discussed this issue with Andreas Khol at the margin of the meeting. He confirmed his position that the EDU and the Council of Europe would consider the exclusion of elected deputies from parliament undemocratic. The issue of the observation of democratic rules in Slovakia would be raised in the Council of Europe in that case. As a matter of fact, this problem is known also from Albania, where a group of deputies broke away from the Democratic Party. This party, too, wanted to deal with this problem like Vladimir Meciar, but it finally abandoned its intention on the basis of warnings from international organizations. These deputies now represent an independent club of deputies in the Albanian parliament. [Toth] You have spent approximately one week in the West. What is the view there of Slovakia, which is experiencing a crisis? [Carnogursky] Slovakia is slowly but surely becoming the pariah of Europe. Compared with all other countries of the continent, it is declining. [Toth] The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] used to have a relatively good position in the EDU, particularly from the viewpoint of lobbying. Do you think that your credibility, or the effectiveness of KDH lobbying, might suffer, in view of the political and economic crisis in Slovakia? [Carnogursky] The KDH's credibility will not suffer, but the effectiveness of lobbying will because it can only be done to a certain degree. Simply, when Slovakia gets itself into too many "troubles," these cannot be mitigated by lobbying. [Toth] What does this mean for us, and what should be changed for Slovak diplomacy to gain scope for lobbying? [Carnogursky] A wide range of steps is involved, which I am unable to enumerate at present. But rendering impossible a legislative amendment that would allow the exclusion from parliament of deputies [who have left the party, on the ticket of which they had been elected] would definitely be one of these steps. In economic policy, the generation of a budget deficit and the borrowing of money from abroad that is not reasonably covered must not continue. And a foreign policy must not continue, about which it is not clear where it is heading.
