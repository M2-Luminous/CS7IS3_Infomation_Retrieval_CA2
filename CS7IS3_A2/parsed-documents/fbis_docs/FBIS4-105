Reports from the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola Military Command in Cuango area yesterday said the involvement of mercenaries in the MPLA-PT air force was confirmed in the last bombings. Our source said the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] will not take responsibility for what will happen to those mercenaries and others on the battle fronts. Recently the head of the South African Army said mercenaries operating in Angola did not do so with the government's consent. However, when UNITA killed 12 South African nationals, including a colonel, on 22 March during clashes, Pretoria became agitated.
