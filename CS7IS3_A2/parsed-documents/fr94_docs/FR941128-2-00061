FR941128-2-00061 FR941128-2-00044 Electronic Connections The Federal Reserve charges fees for electronic connections to depository institutions for accessing priced services. The costs and revenues associated with electronic access are allocated to the various priced services based on the relative number of endpoints that access each service. Electronic connection fees have not increased since 1989, with the exception of the 1991 $100 increase in the monthly dedicated leased-line fee. In light of the increasing costs due to the implementation of Fednet# , the Board has approved increased fees for three types of electronic connections in 1995. The fees for four other types of connections would remain unchanged. Specifically, the Board raised the following fees: 1) receive and send dial connections from $65 to $75; 2) multi-drop leased-line connections from $300 to $450; and 3) dedicated leased-line connections from $700 to $750. Monthly electronic connection fees for receive-only dial, high-speed dial, high-speed 19.2 kbps leased-line, and high-speed 56 kbps leased-line will remain at $30, $350, $850, and $1,000, respectively. In 1994, the Federal Reserve Board established standard fees for dedicated high-speed 56 kbps and 19.2 kbps connections and high-speed dial 56 kbps connections. In response to requests from several depository institutions that Reserve Banks support connections at speeds higher than 56 kbps for transmission of large data files, the Board has approved standard connection fees for two new categories of high-speed connections: $1,800 and $2,000 per month for high-speed leased connections of 128 kbps and 256 kbps, respectively. These new high-speed connection categories require more expensive signalling, encryption, and circuit components than the 56 kbps and 19.2 kbps connections. Finally, the Board has approved two new standard connection options to support contingency testing by depository institutions that use dedicated leased-line connections for their production traffic. A dedicated dial test connection will provide additional dial connection equipment to address the needs of those institutions that conduct their contingency testing simultaneously with their production work. A shared dial test connection will address the needs of institutions that test only during off-hours and will provide a necessary subset of dial connection components. These new contingency connection options will be lower cost alternatives to depository institutions than a second dedicated leased-line connection. For these test options, a usage guideline of 120 hours per year will be established. Institutions that exceed this guideline will be asked to establish a dedicated leased-line connection for testing purposes and pay the standard connection fee. The monthly fees for the dedicated and shared contingency testing options are $250 and $150, respectively.
