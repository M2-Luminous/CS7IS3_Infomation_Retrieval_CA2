The newspaper adds: This is not the first time Syria is subjected to pressures. Before the peace process, the pressure campaigns had been at their peak to draw Syria into something it did not want and did not approve regarding Arab land and rights. During the peace talks, pressures increased and took various forms, such as accusations, lies, and warnings all aimed at undermining Syria's decision which is primarily based on not relinquishing the national and pan-Arab rights. AL-BA'TH says Syria has overcome these pressures and has not yielded to intimidations and maneuvers. It has been proven that peace for Syria is a strategic option, not a negotiations game or casual position for the sake of diplomatic gains. Peace is a principle that was presented by Syria when President Hafiz al-Asad called for full withdrawal in return for full peace. The newspaper emphasizes: We in Syria have always been with the peace process. We have cooperated, and are ready to cooperate to render it successful, but we do not accept anything less than the principles set for this process. Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria is experienced in resisting and confronting pressures, and no one can force it to change its firm positions that represent the national and pan-Arab interests of its people and Arab nation. Syria acts in harmony with its principles and those of the international legitimacy in the efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive solution that secures the restoration of rights to their owners, and realizes solid peace, security, and stability for all parties in the region.
