The United Nations is counting on the effective reopening of Tuzla Airport, on 7 March for example. NATO may be called upon for close air support. For Alain Juppe, another ultimatum is not at all necessary in order to undertake this operation: [Begin Juppe recording] Ultimatums are fine, but they should not be set every day, because they are then difficult to enforce. I neither confirm nor deny that date [7 March], because it falls within UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] remit. I think the United Nations instigated it; the question should be put to them. As for Tuzla, we have legal grounds should we want to intervene, and I would like to remind you that we have legal grounds should we want to resort to force. We do not need any other decision. What is it all about? You know very well: We are in a town that is in the Muslim zone and under Serb guns. We say: We need a new airport so planes carrying out a humanitarian airlift can land in this region, which is in a very difficult position. For this to happen, it is necessary for the Serbs not to threaten shelling. What we want to do is to set up a ground control system that will enable planes to land. We say quite clearly: Should Serb batteries hinder this, they will be destroyed. This is why there is no need for an ultimatum, because it is all there, in the documents. [end recording]
