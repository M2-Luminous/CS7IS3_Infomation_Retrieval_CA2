Aznar, who met in the French capital with Gaullist Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, avoided centering his remarks on specific individuals, but pointed to Felipe Gonzalez in saying that the bounds have also been breached in "the evasion of responsibilities by those people who hold the greatest responsibility." As he said later, the People's Party leader forecast to Balladur an imminent political change in Spain: "As is natural, I conveyed my impressions and thoughts," he said at the end of the 20-minute meeting, because "we are approaching a stage when one political period will end and a new one will begin." Own Initiative That interpretation of the Spanish situation, he said, "was not requested of me by Prime Minister Balladur; I gave it to him on my own initiative." In addition to the Spanish political situation, the exchange of views with the French prime minister "was lively and interesting," according to Aznar, who was accompanied by Abel Matutes, the People's Party list leader for the European elections and commissioner for transport and energy in Brussels. "The European Union, the current political and economic state of Europe, the Maghreb, and bilateral relations between our two countries," with particular reference to cooperation in the antiterrorist struggle, were discussed during the conversation. Aznar described the situation in this respect as "good right now," but said that it is desirable "to deepen it in order to make it increasingly effective." For Balladur, the meeting with Aznar had a less ceremonial and more practical aspect, embodied in the presence of European Commissioner Matutes, who, it is hoped, will intervene in favor of the Air France restructuring and recapitalization plan. Proof of the French Government's interest in exchanging views with Matutes is the fact that, early in the afternoon, the Spanish representative in Brussels met again with Balladur, with the latter now accompanied by Transport Minister Bernard Bosson. For his part, Jose Maria Aznar announced that he intended to meet again with the French prime minister in the evening, in the course of a "private wdding reception."
