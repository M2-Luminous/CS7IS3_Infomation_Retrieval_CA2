During this morning's meeting with Senate President Oliviu Gherman the guest withdrew for a few minutes for a telephone conversation, trying to reach UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to discuss the serious worsening of the situation in Rwanda. Ten Belgian UN troops were killed in the Kigali incidents. Also at the meeting with the president of the Senate, which was devoted to discussions about the political and economic situation in our country, prospects for the Partnership for Peace, and relations with the European Union, Claes announced that he will cut his visit short to participate, together with his colleagues, in a government meeting in Brussels that will examine the situation in Rwanda. Our correspondent also informed us that in a second round of official talks this morning between Claes and Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, the sides examined international issues, particularly the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Melescanu briefed his counterpart on his contacts in Athens and the visits to Bucharest of Presidents Slobodan Milosevic and Suleyman Demirel; he also discussed the Romanian position regarding the need to involve Bosnian Serbs in the peace process. The sides also examined developments in the former Soviet Union, especially in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The Romanian side also informed the guest about aspects of our relations with neighboring countries: Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Republic of Moldova. Willy Claes noted that one of the major elements in addressing developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the UN sanctions policy. The Belgian guest expressed the view that it was imperative to reach an accord on the three approaches to this issue: the American, the Russian, and the European Community's. The two foreign ministers also examined aspects of the Partnership for Peace and the Balladur Pact. Belgium believes that an enlarged Europe is also a stable Europe. After the talks, the two foreign ministers signed the joint political declaration between Romania and the Kingdom of Belgium. Mr. Melescanu was invited to pay a visit to Belgium.
