By 1700, 58 percent of Kazakhstan residents had turned out at election precincts. And the CEC could now be firmly confident that the republic population would not boycott such an important political campaign as elections to the Supreme Council and to maslikhats. Subsequent statistics confirmed this optimistic prognosis: By not yet final data, 73.84 percent of the Kazakhstan residents took part in the elections; in the capital, this figure stood at 62.59 percent. Nature attempted to make its negative adjustments to the course of elections: In the north, it was unseasonably bitter cold; the south and west were hit by snowstorms. Activists from district and precinct commissions, assured the CEC chief, countered the weather with a high degree of organization, aided by modern communications. For instance, it was decided to transmit the preliminary results of voting at the remote animal husbandry pastures by radio telephone. A high degree of organization in the course of election campaign was noted, according to the CEC chairman, by numerous foreign observers as well. Of course, the question arose regarding violations recorded in the course of both election campaign and the elections. "I do not see grounds for great concern," said Karatay Turysov, in this connection. "Shortcomings and snags always happen in such a major undertaking. There have been no major incidents in the republic." As to "minor incidents," the head of the chief electoral body sees the cause as being that both the candidates and some district commissions did not comply with the provisions of the Electoral Code. As is known, the Supreme Council brought different level administrations into organizing the elections. And in this, even the watchful CEC had trouble distinguishing where the local administrations' direct duties ended and direct abuse began. Where the violations were obvious, electoral bodies' sanctions followed: warning, withdrawal of registration. Or, vice versa, actions to protect contenders for deputy mandates. Six candidates have been restored in their rights by a direct CEC decision. Some "eliminated" candidates for deputies have not succeeded in going all the distance in their appeals: Election day found some in the corridors of the Supreme Court, and some, of the Constitutional Court. The Karaganda procurator decided to invalidate election results in those districts where the code had been violated in the process of candidate nomination. "As a CEC chairman, I am satisfied with the election campaign," said Karatay Turysov in conclusion. "I believe that under any circumstances we will have a highly professional parliament!" The CEC promises to make public the final results of the vote and the names of deputies in our new parliament on 14 March.
