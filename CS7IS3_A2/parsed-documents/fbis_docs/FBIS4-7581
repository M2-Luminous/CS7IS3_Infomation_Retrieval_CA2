This was declared by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at a news conference held in Budapest a few hours after Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky handed over Hungary's application for EU membership in Athens on Friday [1 April]. [Begin Chernomyrdin recording, in Russian fading into Hungarian translation] We support Hungary's submission today of its application to join the EU. Russia is also preparing to do this. We hope a decision on this will be made this year, first on the political level and then in the economy as well. Of course, this will take a considerable period of time. We do not have illusions because we assess the situation realistically. We expect that when Hungary is a member of the EU, it will support Russia's membership application. [end recording] At the news conference, which followed two days of negotiations in Budapest between the Hungarian and Russian prime ministers, other issues of integration and security policy were also discussed. A British journalist asked about Hungary's intention to join NATO. [Begin Chernomyrdin recording, in Russian fading into Hungarian translation] It is a matter for Hungary, the Hungarian Government, and the Hungarian people to decide whether or not to join NATO. We may express our view on it, we may offer philosophical theories about it, but it is still a matter for the Hungarian people. [end recording] It was also said at the news conference that Russia could pay back some of its debts to Hungary through arms deliveries. Chernomyrdin did not rule this out. Even more, he offered joint arms production, the possibility for Hungarian firms and entrepreneurs to participate in the privatization of Russian weapon manufacturing plants and to acquire share ownership in these plants as a form of [Russian] debt repayment. [passage omitted] The main focus of the prime ministerial negotiations was the economy. Russia will repay its debt, which amounts to about $800 million, within three years through deliveries, services, and handing over Russian assets into the ownership of Hungarian entrepreneurs. Meanwhile Russia will pay interest on the existing debt. [passage omitted]
