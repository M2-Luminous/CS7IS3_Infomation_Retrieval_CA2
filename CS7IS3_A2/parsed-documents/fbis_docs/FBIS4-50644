Mr. Yu said that it was very necessary for the Preliminary Committee [as received] for the Preparatory Committee of the SAR as well as its security affairs group to discuss at present the preparatory work on the issuance of the SAR passports, since there were only more than three years to come from now on to the hand-over of sovereignty right of Hong Kong in 1997. In this period, the preliminary work on this matter should be carried out. In addition, such passports should be publicized and popularized overseas in order to make them acceptable in more countries and passports issued by foreign countries would be, in return, recognized in Hong Kong. Mr. Yu pointed out that the issuance in advance of SAR's passports to those China's citizens who were holding permanent residential identity cards certainly required the British Hong Kong Government to provide related materials of passport applicants, the issuance of this kind of passports must be responsible both for Hong Kong people and those countries by which these passports were accepted therefore they could not be issued in an irresponsible way. The adviser held that should the work of the passport issuance be done after 1997, the two kinds of passports would not dovetail, creating inconveniences for Hong Kong residents in their travels and businesses overseas as well as unfavorable influence to the territory.
