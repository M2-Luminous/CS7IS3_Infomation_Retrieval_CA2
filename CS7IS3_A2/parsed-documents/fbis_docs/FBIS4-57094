Neighborhood assemblies in the different voting precincts are analyzing the main problems affecting their communities as well as the efforts of the delegates who represent them at different government levels to solve the problems. These plenary sessions have the power, according to the organization and make-up of the people's government and the existing laws, to dismiss delegates who, in the people's opinion, have not fulfilled their obligations. On this occasion, the assemblies are also debating different aspects of the application of the economic measures adopted by the parliament in an effort to improve the country's internal finances. Regarding the process of rendering accounts, Jaime Crombet, vice president of the National Assembly of the People's Government, said it is being carried out at a very opportune moment to wage a political battle, under extremely difficult economic conditions, and to advance solutions for local problems more effectively.
