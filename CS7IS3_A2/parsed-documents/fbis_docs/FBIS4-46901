Do you believe that Tatarstan's Cabinet of Ministers is capable of functioning effectively in its current composition? Yes30 percent No45 percent No opinion25 percent 2. What is your assessment of the economic situation in Tatarstan? Situation stable3.5 percent Situation critical2.3 percent Pre-crisis situation54.0 percent Crisis situation40.0 percent 3. Does Tatarstan's parliamentary system need to be reformed? Yes76.5 percent No19.0 percent No opinion4.7 percent Among parliament members who are directly involved in decisionmaking as part of the executive authority (heads of local administration, enterprise directors) and who hold about one-third of the seats in the parliament, the mood is even more radical than in the deputy corps as a whole. In this group, 36 percent are convinced that changes in the government are necessary. They also look more critically at the current economic situation in Tatarstan. As to deputy groups and factions, the following picture emerges. Representatives of the Party of Unity and Progress believe that the priority task for the parliament is to change the tax system and intend to state their position at the session. The Equality and Legality bloc believes that the issue of cabinet membership per se is not important--the system of administration as a whole needs to be changed. The group Tatarstan expresses the opinion that the government has not kept the promise it had given to the parliament, and instead of an anticrisis program has submitted another declarative document on a number of priority measures. The bloc's representatives intend to voice their complaints on this subject in the parliament. In the course of the survey, 85 deputies were polled--35 percent of the deputy corps. The survey was done on the telephone by random selection. The results are representative.
