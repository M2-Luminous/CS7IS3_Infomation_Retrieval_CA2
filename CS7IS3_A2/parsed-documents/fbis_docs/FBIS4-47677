Mr Buthelezi travelled through rural areas of Zululand on Friday in cold weather which probably led to his poor health at the weekend, Mr Memela said. He said it was difficult to predict whether the IFP leader would be at work on Monday, but he would probably have time to rest because of the delayed election results from KwaZulu/Natal.
