Foreign pressures on the domestic economic system, the problems and difficulties created by American-led world imperialism, which sometimes became severe, the effects of the worldwide economic recession, especially in the economies of Europe and Japan and changes in the international markets, placed problems in the path of the nation's rapid economic development, but with the help of God and through the comprehensive and coordinated efforts of those working in the Islamic Republic's divine government, few bad effects were imposed on the nation's economy. Of course, the effects from the reform of policies and programs on the nation's economy must not be overlooked, for these existed along with the problems beyond the nation's borders. Yet striking successes were achieved in the growth of the agricultural and industrial products, despite the fact that the relative stagnation of economic activities, the lack of clarity in the evaluation of investments in the nation's new economic conditions, and the lack of clarity of some laws having to do with investment, especially in the industrial free trade zones, cast a shadow over Iran's economic situation. Last year the Islamic Republic of Iran was not spared the pressures of propaganda and baseless accusations from world imperialism, and in some cases, fighting tooth and nail against evil American-led imperialist propaganda required unceasing effort. America's constant activity aimed at isolating the Islamic Republic of Iran and placing it in difficulties did not stop even for a moment. At the meetings of the leaders of the seven industrial nations in Geneva on 93 Tir 1372 [as published, 22 June-22 July 1993], America once again asked the other nations present at the meeting, including Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada, and England to reduce their economic ties to Iran as much as possible and it accused Iran of supporting international terrorism. These baseless accusations received a positive answer only through the extensive political efforts of those working in the government to retain the independent positions of the Islamic Republic of Iran's foreign policy. In reality, America was not able to achieve its goals, chief of which was to put Iran under economic pressure in order to dilute the principled and righteous positions of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran towards international issues. The Islamic Republic of Iran is still considered the greatest power in the Persian Gulf area. It is a wealthy and independent nation in political activity in the strategic region of the Middle East, and the outlook for its reasonable economic growth and development is still hopeful. Iran's economy during the last year can be studied from various perspectives. Gross Domestic Product According to the preliminary estimates of the Plan and Budget Organization, the value of Iran's gross domestic product in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] at fixed prices based in the year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] was 12,483 billion rials [R], which compared to the R11,715 billion fixed figure for the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] shows an increase of 6.5 percent. The growth in Iran's gross domestic product was 3 percent in the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], 12.1 percent in the year 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], 9.9 percent in the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] and 6.2 percent in the year 1371. Iran's average economic growth in the years 1368-1372 implementing the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan reached 7.5 percent per year, which is close to the 8.1-percent figure set in the plan. Although at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan's implementation most Western experts said that the economic growth set in this plan would be impossible to achieve and that the goals were opportunistic, today the achievement of this growth is recognized by international experts as an undeniable success for the Islamic Republic of Iran. The small difference between the nation's real economic growth and the goal set in the plan is due to the failure to achieve growth in the oil, industry and construction sectors, especially in the years 1371 and 1368, even though the growth in the water, electrical power, gas and transportation sectors was faster than expected under the plan. Added Value of Economic Sectors In view of the new conditions for continuation of the policy of economic adjustment, in the year 1372 the unification of the foreign exchange rate and the application of the floating foreign exchange rate system, in view of the amount of currency in circulation, and the insufficient activity in the banking system in providing the needed means for the nation's economic units, especially in the first half of the year 1372, were among the factors in the slower growth of economic sectors. According to statistics published by government sources, the growth in added value in the agricultural sector in the year 1372 was 6.5 percent, it was 10.1 percent in the oil sector, 8.5 percent in industry and mines, 17.8 percent in water, electrical power and natural gas, 4.8 percent in construction, 1.3 percent in transportation and shipping, and 15.5 percent in communications. The average growth in these sectors in the First Five-Year Plan was 6.1, 9.5, 15, 9.1, 14.5, and 5 percent, respectively. Growth in the communications sector under the plan was not announced. The experience of the First Five-Year Plan has caused economic planners to pay more attention in writing the Second Five-Year Plan to capital resources in the nation's economy, international conditions, the oil market situation and unpredictable changes, and they have set a more reasonable economic growth target of 5.8 percent per year. Most of the world's independent economic experts consider Iran's economic success in recent years, despite increasing foreign pressures on the country, to be a great success for Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government. Of course, it is necessary to pay appropriate attention to the reasons for the failure to achieve all the goals. Most of those reasons originate abroad, and some of them are the result of domestic economic policy and behavior. Government's Role in General Budget Despite the fact that in the 1372 budget the expected and approved deficit figure was zero, according to the latest estimates from the Plan and Budget Organization the general budget deficit in the year 1372 was R2,139 billion, an increase compared to the 1371 budget deficit of R1,077 billion. The government's total expenses in the year 1372 were estimated at R21,823 billion, compared to revenues of R19,684 billion. To a great extent the general budget deficit in the year 1372 was due to the failure to achieve oil revenues, because the tax revenues were greater than expected in all the years of the First Five-Year Plan. Even in the year 1371 the government's tax revenues were 45.4 percent greater than the figure projected in the Five-Year Plan. Despite the economizing done by the government organizations, especially this year, and despite the economical payments and allocations done by the Plan and Budget Organization, general expenses increased. Some of this was due to changes in the foreign exchange rate and heavier expenses that the floating foreign exchange rate imposed on government applicants for foreign exchange. The failure to achieve projected oil revenues in the First Five-Year Plan, mostly due to foreign factors and inappropriate behavior by international agents in this industry, caused the nation's economic officials and planners to act with greater caution and to set next year's oil revenues at above $10 billion in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, to reduce the negative effects of economic changes in the world's energy markets on the national economy, and this is considered one of the positive points in the planning of the nation's economy. Imports and Exports The rapid growth in trade in the first years of Iran's First Five-Year Economic Development Plan led to the nation making foreign exchange commitments. Thus, since the beginning of the year 1372 [21 March 1993] the officials of the nation's economic system took a more conservative position on imports to reduce the trade imbalance and to be able to reduce the burden of foreign exchange commitments. Iran's imports in the year 1372 decreased sharply from the year 1371, and according to estimates from unofficial sources it reached $13 billion. The Plan and Budget Organization estimated this figure at $16 billion. In view of estimates from this organization that the value of oil exports in the year 1372 was $14.9 billion and that nonoil exports were valued at $3.26 billion, in the year 1372 there should be a trade surplus of about $2.16 billion for the year 1372. However, unofficial sources, who have estimated Iran's nonoil exports at about $3.5 to $4 billion and sometimes more, say that Iran should have a trade surplus of about $3.5 billion in the year 1372. In view of the fact that Iran had a trade deficit of more than $5 billion in the year 1371, this is considered a great success for Iran. Although the trade surplus was due to the increase in nonoil exports and restrictions on imports, it was necessary to apply the floating foreign exchange rate, which is to some extent responsible for imports costing more and making exports more profitable, and on the other hand reducing imports has suspended or slowed implementation of some economic projects, and this has made it difficult to make full use of economic capacities due to the shortage of monetary resources to obtain the needed raw materials in time. It is clear, however, that economizing on imports, in view of the nation's limited foreign exchange resources, was a positive and necessary step in the view of most economic experts. Iran's foreign exchange commitments against usance purchases have increased in recent years, and repayments on these commitments have been deferred to the last year of the First Five-Year Plan and the years of the Second Five-Year Plan. This has made it necessary to economize on foreign exchange expenditures. Among Iran's other economic successes in the view of the experts are the infrastructure and essential investments that have been made in the First Five-Year Plan, which have created conditions allowing for growth in domestic production and reduced demand for imports to achieve society's essential needs. For example, in recent years Iran was a major importer of steel, cement and wheat. In the year 1372, not only did steel and cement imports stop, but Iran began exporting steel to the world's markets with rapid growth. Demand for wheat imports also decreased significantly this year, and this was due to increased domestic production. On the other hand, preparations for increased nonoil exports were made under the First Five-Year Plan. The value of Iran's nonoil exports this year is more than $3 billion. The estimate by the Plan and Budget Organization shows a figure close to $3.2 billion, but insiders in trade affairs believe that including the smuggling of goods outside the country and in view of the continued low customs rates for export goods, the value of Iran's nonoil exports this year is even greater than $4 billion. This group believes that with the growth in the quality and quantity of the nation's production, the development of industrial exports, Iran's active involvements in marketing, international expositions and markets, and better packaging, it will be easy to more than double Iran's nonoil exports during five years to $10 billion and to increase the role of nonoil exports in meeting expenses to more than 50 percent. In the year 1372 this figure was about 25 percent, yet before implementation of the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan that figure was less than 10 percent. Foreign Exchange Market Fluctuations Despite the implementation of the floating foreign exchange rate system and the sale of dollars by the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the banking system, since late in the month of Farvardin 1372 [21 March-20 April 1993], there were two successive periods of severe fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, which ultimately led to the dollar increasing in value against the rial. From Farvardin 1372 until prior to the announcement of the sale of travel and commercial foreign exchange at the floating rate by the banking system, the value of the dollar increased to R1,850, yet at the same time the floating foreign exchange rate was less than R1,500. In the first phase the Central Bank raised the value of the dollar against the rial to about R1,750. In the first fluctuation of the foreign exchange market the value of the dollar increased again against the rial, and on the free market the price of a dollar reached R2,800 under the pressure of the demand for and short supply of foreign exchange. Among the main reasons for that were the activities of foreign exchange speculators in fanning the flames of market change. Foreign Exchange Commitments Iran's major problem in the year 1372 was the suspension of the country's foreign exchange commitments. According to reports from official sources, by the end of this year the nation's total of unpaid foreign exchange commitments reached $12 billion. Under the effects of this problem, it was difficult for Iran to open credit documents in the foreign banking system and most of Iran's transactions were done in cash drafts, which proceeded slowly. The banking system's low sales of foreign exchange also caused many who were seeking foreign exchange to turn to the free market, and increased demand on this market. In view of the short supply of dollars and the speculative activities of brokers, this caused the rial to weaken against the dollar. Iran's efforts to renegotiate the timetables for its foreign exchange commitments late in the year 1372 bore fruit, and this was considered one of the great successes of Iran's economic policymakers. Successes were achieved with German creditors in rescheduling 4.5 billion marks of Iran's foreign exchange commitments, and with Japanese creditors in rescheduling about $800 billion in suspended commitments to Japanese companies. These successes paved the way for Iran to open credit documents and to procure the foreign exchange needed normally through the banking system. It is expected that in the near future this process will proceed with sufficient smoothness and will show a positive effect on the free foreign exchange market. For the first time in recent years the Central Bank did not seek to strengthen the value of the dollar and during the foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the first part of the month of Esfand this year [20 February-19 March] it did not lower the value of the rial. Volume of Currency in Circulation In view of this, the government's budget deficit helped with the growth in currency in circulation in the country. The First Five-Year Plan, which had the goal of achieving economic balance by controlling the growth of currency in circulation by reducing the government's budget deficit to zero, was in practice faced with increased demand for cash. The volume of currency in circulation in the year 1370 reached R28,628 billion, based on the estimate from the Plan and Budget Organization. In the year 1371 this figure reached R35,799 billion. It is likely that in the year 1372 this figure will reach more than R40,000 billion or a maximum of R47,691.5 billion, an increase of 33.2 percent compared to the year 1371. Rate of Inflation Growth This rapid growth has intensified inflationary pressures. The indicator of prices for consumer goods and services with a base year of 1361 as 100, reached R421.9 in the year 1370 and in the year 1371 it reached R513.2. In the year 1372 this figure is expected to reach R667.3. Thus inflation in the year 1372 is estimated at 30 percent, which is more than the 21.6 percent registered for the year 1371. Although the government is trying to guide currency in circulation into productive channels and positive economic activities by selling the shares of the producing units under its control on the Tehran stock market or through auctions and negotiations, providing various services with new tariffs, increasing tax rates, especially in the customs sector, changing the consumption model, encouraging investment in the producing sectors and other things, there is still a hot market for speculation in gold, foreign exchange and other profitable materials in the trade and services sector and it is attracting some of the currency in circulation. By increasing the profit rates it pays on deposits, especially fixed-term deposits and providing various financial services, Iran's banking system is trying to guide the currency in circulation in the private sector into the banking system. However, the difference between the profit rate for bank deposits and the enormous profits for speculative transactions has kept this goal from being completely achieved. Despite this, existing statistics testify to the increased volume of bank deposits. In the first half of the year 1372 the government took steps through the banking system to control the flow of currency in circulation. Although the implementation of the floating foreign exchange rate system and increasing the foreign exchange rate for that group of producing units that had used preferred government and competitive foreign exchange rates before the year 1371 increased the demand for currency in circulation to procure the foreign exchange needed, in the first half of the year the banking system adopted a more restricted policy for granting credits, which serves to control the growth in the government's currency in circulation. However, at the insistence of economic agents, who were making less use of production capacity because of the shortage of currency in circulation to procure raw materials, the banking system changed this course, and in the second half of the year 1372 more credits were granted. This was followed by growth in currency in circulation, and the inflationary pressures were pronounced. Thus Iran's economy, through great effort, forbearance and solving problems, during the year 1372 continued moving towards a market and pricing system and the government made greater efforts to expand private sector activities and to transfer to the private sector some executive and practical responsibilities, especially in the production sectors. Oil Market More than 80 percent of Iran's foreign exchange revenues come from the export of oil, and the nation's economy is sensitive to world oil market conditions. Last year the situation in the oil market was the worst it has been in five years. The price of oil decreased more than 25 percent and, like it or not, it affected Iran's economy. Although the nation's economy was not able to obtain the projected revenues of $16.8 billion from oil sales in 1372 and the weakness of the market caused oil revenues to drop below $14 billion, various factors influenced this situation, and despite Iran's efforts in OPEC to overcome the malfunctioning situation in the oil market, they made the market situation worse day after day. The rapid increase in the production of oil in the non-OPEC nations, especially Norway and England in the North Sea; the growth in oil sales by Russia to Western markets to obtain more reliable foreign exchange revenues; the growth in oil production in other non-OPEC nations; the continued economic stagnation in Western Europe and Japan, which led to reduced demand for oil; efforts and collusion by the big oil producers to keep oil prices down on the world market, and other things all affected the world oil market situation in the year 1372. Despite this, Iran's efforts at the September 1993 OPEC meeting of oil ministers in Geneva were especially important, because if these efforts had not borne fruit and if the OPEC members had not tried to control the marketing of oil, even greater decreases in oil prices would have been inevitable. The oil market, which was severely weakened and in disarray after the summer of 1372, was offering more than 1 million barrels a day [BPD] because of reduced demand and excess marketing, mostly by the independent producers. The efforts of the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran to contact Fahd, the king of Saudi Arabia, to put the oil market in order, was among the effective steps bringing OPEC members to an agreement to keep production down to 24.58 million BPD in the first half of the year 1993 and the first three months of the year 1994, and it prevented a further drop in oil prices, although the non-OPEC producers responded irresponsibly. Despite this, OPEC continues to work to gain the support of non-OPEC producers through reduced production, although some independent producers insist on continuing to produce at high levels, and in reality the have created a disappointing outlook for the oil market by working with the world's other dominant powers. Consequently, this undesirable situation has caused most OPEC members, including Iran, to review their economic development programs and the implementation of their national projects and expenditures to keep this process from having undesirable effects on their economies to the extent possible. Although Iran's oil production capacity reached more than 4 million barrels in the year 1372, its true production level was kept at 3.8 million BPD, and the Islamic Republic of Iran has kept its commitment to OPEC decisions on oil production quotas. Despite more limited revenues from oil sales than those projected for the year 1372, oil and gas projects still have priority and are being pursued. Many projects in the oil and gas sectors were completed. Production capacity increased and more wells were drilled in the Persian Gulf and in the Caspian Sea. The capacity of the oil refineries increased with the reconstruction of the Abadan refinery and the establishment of the Arak refinery. Natural gas delivery projects to 150 of the nation's cities continued, and the Esfahan motor oil project, the Arak petrochemical project, and others went into operation. The year 1372 was the final year of implementation of the Islamic Republic of Iran's First Five-Year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan. Despite the effective and comprehensive advances in the oil industry, which were made through extensive investment and persistent effort by those working in this industry, the revenues projected in the Five-Year Plan were not achieved. In the year 1372 Iran's revenues from oil sales were to have reached $16.8 billion, yet according to the latest estimate by the Plan and Budget Organization these revenues were $14.9 billion, based on daily exports of 2.545 million barrels of oil at an average price of $14 per barrel. Independent economic experts put Iran's revenues from the sale of oil at about $13 billion.
