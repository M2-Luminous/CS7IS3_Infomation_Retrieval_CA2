[passage omitted] Bernard Kouchner is in Kigali. That is where Christophe Boisbouvier contacted him: [Begin recording] [Kouchner] There are refugees everywhere: Some are hidden, some are out in the open, and they are in a very difficult and dangerous position. There are 2 million refugees in the country, between 1 and 2 million, and there are some who are in particular danger in Kigali. Do I have any hope? If I didn't have any hope I wouldn't be going on, but nothing has yet been achieved. Let me remind you that, in cooperation with the United Nations, with the UN forces led by General Dallaire, we want to open the humanitarian corridors that they themselves tried to open long ago, and to protect those in danger, especially inside the town. [Boisbouvier] Do you hope to be able to get the refugees out of the town to the airport, in particular the ones in the Hotel des Mille Collines, the Amahoro stadium, and the church of the Holy Family? [Kouchner] We hope to start a symbolic evacuation that will make it possible to open up these corridors and to continue their protectection by the UN forces. [end recording]
