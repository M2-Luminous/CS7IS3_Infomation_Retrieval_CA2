Things are moving slowly and the delegations to the peace talks continue to examine the document presented by the mediators and observers on the conclusion of the electoral process. UN Alioune Blondin Beye met with negotiating teams from the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] before leaving for Geneva for a meeting on Angola with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel reports: [Manuel] Alioune Blondin Beye has not yet left Lusaka for Geneva. He is still expected to do so this evening. During the day Alioune Blondin Beye held some working meetings with the heads of negotiating teams from the government and UNITA. The parties are presently debating the document presented by the mediators and observers on the conclusion of the electoral process -- that is, general and specific principles. The negotiators are also discussing, although not in depth, issues connected with local and legislative elections. The fundamental issue, however, is the holding of the second round of presidential elections. The date of these elections will only be announced after the creation of what a source described as material and psychological conditions -- that is, the establishment of complete peace. It will be the United Nations to announce the existence the preconditions for a second round of presidential elections. According to one source, the UNITA team proposes changes in some aspects of the electoral law. UNITA says the voting bulletins must be more informative and more acceptable. It also proposes changes in the organization and operation of the National Electoral Council [CNE] and calls for an active UN participation in the conclusion of the electoral process. The following question remains, however: Who is going to hold the second round of presidential elections? Will it be the CNE or the United Nations? The reply will be obtained after the conclusion of debates on the issue. All the same it seems as if the discussions on the conclusion of the electoral process are on the right track. There are few differences. According to our source, after a possible cease-fire a lot of time may be needed to hold the second round of presidential elections [words indistinct] government organs must operate normally, with the inclusion of some UNITA elements. On the country's administration, despite all the secrecy, it is being said that it is no longer a very difficult issue. According to a negotiator, every effort is being made to ensure that the peace talks conclude in April. It is true, however, that differences still remain.
