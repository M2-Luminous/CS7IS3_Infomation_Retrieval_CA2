Addressing the Army Commanders Conference in New Delhi today, Mr. Narasimha Rao said India is in favor of a time-bound universal and nondiscriminatory nuclear disarmament. He said New Delhi has always advocated peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Referring to the allegations of human rights violations, he said that anti-India forces are using these for political exploitation. Mr. Rao called upon such forces to stop maligning India on this score as New Delhi's concern for human rights is second to none. The prime minister said that the low intensity conflict sponsored by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir is a major challenge. Islamabad is sending terrorists, including foreign mercenaries, to the state, he added.
