The ministry said in a report that the nation's exports in April totaled 7,692 million U.S. dollars, a 14-percent increase over the same period last year, while imports reached 8,071 million dollars, up 17.8 percent compared with April 1993. The deficit represents an increase of 277 million dollars over the same month of 1993. Accordingly, trade in the first four months ran a deficit of 3,010 million U.S. dollars on a customs clearance basis with 27,597 million dollars in exports and 30,606 million dollars in imports. The trade deficit during the first four months is 1,122 million dollars higher than in 1993. April's sharp increase in imports resulted from growing demand for imports amid business recovery and from more raw materials being shipped in. In particular, imports of crude oil and oil-related products, which had witnessed declining demand, are on the rise while such capital goods as machinery, chemicals and textiles are showing an increase of around 20 percent. Meanwhile, exports showed a sound recovery with a double-digit increase in products from the heavy-chemical and primary industries together with an 8.7-percent rise in light-industry goods. The strong Japanese yen prompted Korea's export to increase in electronics and electrical goods (21.2 percent) and chemical products and precision machines (12 to 13 percent). Korean exports to developing countries surged 17 percent compared with 11.2 percent to advanced countries. In contrast, exports to China decreased 2.3 percent due to a decline in Chinese demand for Korean automobiles.
