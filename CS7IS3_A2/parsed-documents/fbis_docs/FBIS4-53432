They forces have collected 6,180 billion dong as fines and back taxes and have confiscated over 1,279,000 packs of foreign-brand cigarettes. In An Giang alone, over one million packs of cigarettes have been imported illegally. Lately, because of our regular control over various ground routes, smugglers have shifted to shipping their goods along riverways. They have rented boats for transportation and have hidden their contraband cigarettes under layers of farm products. Other kinds of contraband originate mostly from China and are smuggled through the northern border and from Thailand through the southwestern border into the western region. Smuggling has also increased sharply in Binh Dinh in the first four months of 1994, compared to the same period in 1993. The volume of contraband has been increasing rapidly as long-range commercial ships are plying the Binh Dinh sea area with each bringing in between 2,000-3,500 sets of television or video recorders; and cigarettes, and beers of all brands. So far, the province market control committee has collected 502 million dong as fines or back taxes for the budget. The value of contraband in retention now and in which action has yet to be taken is estimated to be worth 1.4 billion dong.
