After the audience, the two leaders said they held talks with the head of state on the appointment of a new prime minister. The two political leaders will be meeting tomorrow with the head of state at the latter's residence to continue the discussions. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] The president has just received you and Edem Kodjo. What was the purpose of your discussions? [Agboyibor] During the last discussion we had with the head of state, we expressed the desire to be received together with UTD. The opportunity was offered us and we have continued our reflections on the choice of a prime minister. The meeting lasted for some time, and we decided to meet tomorrow at 1100 to discuss the same issue. [Correspondent] Does that mean that you have not yet agreed on the choice of a prime minister? [Agboyibor] It simply means that the consultations continue. [Correspondent] Your Excellency, I put the same question to you. [Kodjo] As my colleague has rightly pointed out, the discussions continue. They have been very interesting, and we will resume the talks tomorrow at 1100. [Correspondent] The people are waiting. They hope to obtain a reply at all costs. Are you ready to make concrete proposals to put an end to this wait? [Kodjo] That is precisely the purpose of these consultations. [end recording]
