So, having eyed the tired, ordinary faces opposite me, I raised my gaze to an advertisement inviting us to be tested in the AIDS diagnosis office of the Institute imeni Sklifosovskiy. I liked the invitation. Not in the sense that I had any apprehensions about myself but because the entire procedure cost three ice creams--150 rubles. We don't see huge columns of tragic numbers at the Sklifosovskiy Institute's laboratory of clinical immunology and AIDS diagnosis yet, thank God. This year only six persons were registered with a positive HIV test, two of them being foreigners. (Let's compare with previous years: eight persons in 1991, five of whom were foreign students, and 13 in 1992, to include 10 of our fellow countrymen). Approximately 85 percent of all tests represent those carried out officially and mandatorily prior to surgical operations, or those necessary for travel abroad. The rest are anonymous, from 60 to 100 persons a day. Sergey Kudryashov, a doctor and a lab technician, can't say yet that AIDS has reached epidemic proportions. But there are of course no grounds for reassurance. If the figures of this laboratory may be considered to be not entirely indicative, here are data from the Russian AIDS Control Center: 650 Russian citizens infected with immunodeficiency virus have been registered, and 81 persons have already died as of the beginning of this year. Foreigners make up an extremely substantial number--421 (since 1987). In this case 82 infected former Soviet citizens were registered in 1991, 85 were registered in 1992, and this year just 38 have been registered as yet. There were 13 foreigners in 1991, 26 in 1992 and three in 1993. As you can see, while the number of infected persons is steadily rising, an abrupt increase has not yet occurred. Vadim Pokrovskiy, the director of the Russian AIDS Control Center, feels that this is associated with the effectiveness of certain measures, as a result of which the natural transmission pathway has now been practically closed off. Thus, since 1987 not a single case of infection with the virus during blood transfusion has occurred. Infections arising as a result of the use of dirty syringes have not occurred since 1990. However, sexual transmission of the infection is gaining momentum. Of the total number of adults possessing the immunodeficiency virus 30 percent are women. Homosexuals are not far behind. Their share is 30-40 percent. What is surprising is that not a single case of infection associated with drug use has yet been registered. ``What we need first of all is effective prevention--training and education,'' said Vadim Pokrovskiy. It wouldn't be bad for the government and the Supreme Soviet to remember this. After all, a state AIDS control program still hasn't been adopted.
