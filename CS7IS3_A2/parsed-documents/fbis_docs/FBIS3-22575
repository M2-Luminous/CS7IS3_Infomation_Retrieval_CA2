The health services have also treated 80 healthy carriers (infected, but not seriously enough to develop the malady). Patients are being hospitalized in the 30-bed "infectious disease" ward. And to accommodate new cases, an additional 30 beds may be shifted from the "psychiatric" ward of the Tizi Ouzou CHU [university hospital center]. Also, it was decided to open isolation wards at Azazga, Draa El Mizan, Tigzirt, Ain El Hammam, and Larbaa Nath Irathen. Healthy carriers are examined and treated with antibiotics in their homes, thanks to mobile disease prevention squads responsible for checking other members of households where the disease has struck. The purpose of these activities, according to Dr. Bourbia, director of pedagogical and medical services at the Tizi Ouzou CHU, is to "diminish or arrest transmission of the germ, which is directly communicated -- this can't be repeated too often -- from person to person (interhuman transmission)." It should be noted that cases have been reported thus far in Beni Douala, Ain El Hammam, Ouacif, Azeffoun, Ath Zmenzer, Boghni, Draa ben Khedda, and in the chief town of the wilaya. It has also been learned that the director of preventive services has hurriedly dispatched a delegation from the Health Ministry to Tizi Ouzou to confer with the antidiphtheria committee recently formed in that town's CHU. Besides participating in a day-long diphtheria public awareness program to be held on 20 January at the paramedic school, the team from the ministry "has given us assurances concerning regular provisions of vaccines and serums," Dr. Bourbia said. For example, a shipment of 5,000 doses of vaccine and antidiphtheria serum has been delivered. It was also recommended that diphtheria patients be referred to El-Kettar hospital, which specializes in treatment of infectious diseases. We note last that health personnel, patient associations, and the press have all been urged to work for the success of the public awareness program this Thursday. Meanwhile, the dread disease is gaining ground.
