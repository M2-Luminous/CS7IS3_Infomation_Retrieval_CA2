This was the first time that they took part in a meeting of heads of state and government, and it was only natural that they should elicit a certain amount of curiosity. Given that this was a European summit, observers -- and no doubt the main players themselves -- paid special attention to the statements and, even more so, the behavior of the representatives of the new government in Rome. It was important to know whether their entry on the European scene on a particularly significant occasion would change the balance of forces between free-traders and unionists -- in short, whether Italy was going to persevere in its Europeanist position or, on the contrary, align itself with the Euro-skeptics, as indeed certain clues suggested might happen. Over [European Commission President] Delors' successor, would Rome take sides with the Bonn-Paris axis or, alternatively, with London? Right from the first day, on Friday 24 June, as the summit began, it became apparent that Rome was gravitating toward London. Observers -- whether British, French, or German -- noted this tendency without however expressing any surprise, since it confirmed the forecasts that had been made for some time. However, in the evening of that same day, Italy shifted its position by performing a magnificent pirouette. The prime minister could not resist the [German] chancellor's beckoning and, relinquishing his free-tradist position, came down with his vote on the unionists' side. How can he be blamed for that sudden change, considering that in the second -- and final -- round, Belgium's Dehaene, whose candidacy was supported by Paris and Bonn, won 11 votes out of 12, and was only flunked because of [British Prime Minister] John Major's veto? The prime minister's common sense probably prevailed over the foreign minister's line. Forced to repress his Thatcherite feelings, Antonio Martino hastened to assuage the irritation understandably felt by the Britons, who had once again relied on Italy's support only to be let down as usual. (The turnabout must have reminded Foreign Office officials of many episodes at the time of De Michelis, Antonio Martino's predecessor under Craxi). However, the Corfu summit has failed to clarify Italy's position in the European field. It is too early. At present, priorities lie elsewhere. Above all, the government in Rome now wants to be accepted by the international political community, particularly by the European one. After being treated rudely on so many occasions, Silvio Berlusconi finds comfort in smiles and handshakes. They are ointments on his open wounds. The German chancellor's cordiality (and perhaps the prospect of enabling Forza Italia's European deputies to join the Christian Democratic parliamentary group in Brussels, from which they have so far been excluded) weigh more than Foreign Minister Antonio Martino's Thatcherite leanings. Smiles also carried much weight in Rome, at the time of Clinton's visit. The American President flatly turned down Italy's demand to become a permanent member of the Security Council, as well as the more legitimate demand to take part in the "contact group" for Bosnia -- more legitimate in that Italy is providing bases for the aircraft operating over former Yugoslavia, and should at least be among the countries involved in the various political initiatives. On that occasion, too, smiles counted more than facts. But we have not yet moved beyond smiles.
