Would you please comment on this visit? [Al-Hasan] I want to reiterate the deep and distinguished Jordanian-Omani relations that have been reinforced by His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id. As you know, these relations are becoming stronger with time. These relations, which are fraternal in terms of dealing and frank in terms of coordination and consultation, have become an example for other countries. King Husayn's visit to his brother Sultan Qabus falls within this framework. These relations are based on the existing fraternal relations between the two leaders and two people. I can say these relations are strong, firm, and continuous. The two countries are determined to strengthen these relations on all levels. I can also say that the high level of consultation and coordination will include many bilateral issues and many Arab, regional, and international issues. King Husayn's visit represents a qualitative move that will strength Jordanian-Omani relations. [Correspondent] Your Excellency: Today, you met with the Omani minister of state for foreign affairs. What took place during the meeting? [Al-Hasan] I held a fraternal meeting with my brother His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi, the Omani minister of state for foreign affairs. We reviewed our good and distinguished bilateral relations on the political, economic, and cultural levels. We discussed a number of measures to provide momentum to these relations, to develop them, and to activate our bilateral agreements. I also discussed with the minister a number of Arab, regional, and international issues of mutual interest. Thank you. [Correspondent] Thank you, sir.
