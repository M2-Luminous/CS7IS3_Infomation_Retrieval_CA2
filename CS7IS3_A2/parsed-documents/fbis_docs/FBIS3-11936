[Gaviria] Many things have happened throughout these years. All I can say is that I truly did not prepare myself to be a diplomat nor am I an expert in that area. I believe that what has happened recently is that the world's agenda has changed significantly. As a result, people like me, who are interested in economic matters, have begun to stand out in the current world. [Reporter] You are leaving the Narino Palace to assume the position of OAS secretary general in Washington. Is it possible that you will be coming back from the OAS to the Colombian Presidency? [Gaviria] [laughs] I am not thinking of that now. It is very difficult to think about my life five years from now. In any event, I am not thinking of my political future in Colombia or anything similar. [Reporter] Do you know that yesterday, when people were leaving the OAS headquarters, many Colombians who were carrying the flag and singing the national anthem asked Noemi or rather called on Noemi Sanin to be a presidential candidate? [Gaviria] The truth is that yesterday's victory is basically a victory for Noemi and the Colombian Foreign Ministry. There is no doubt about that. This is why I am somewhat bothered by references to pressure from other countries and the United States. Yesterday's victory was a victory earned by Noemi and the Colombian Foreign Ministry, as well as a victory earned through her hard work and the way in which she toured this continent so many times, making telephone calls, working, calling, explaining our positions. [Reporter] Do you see her as a person with the ability to be a presidential candidate? [Gaviria] She has the ability to become anything she wants. If this hemisphere can recognize her ability and her great victory, it is obvious that Noemi has the ability to be president and many other things. [Reporter] The United States invaded Grenada and nothing happened. It invaded Panama and nothing happened. You will have reached the OAS secretary general's office with the basic support of the United States. Will you be able to stand up to the United States the day the United States again attempts something like this? [Gaviria] These things happened because of actions -- actions that the Latin Americans have rejected and do not agree with, such as the actions you have mentioned -- but they also occurred because of our lack of action. Both sides are to blame. We have overlooked some of the problems that have occurred on this continent. We left them alone, as if they were the United States' problems, and we ended up with the worst possible solutions. Yes, these things happened, but the Latin American countries are also to blame, because we viewed these problems with a degree of indifference. Today, on this continent, the defense of democracy is everyone's responsibility. We all have to work to defend democracy on this continent. [Reporter] Does this mean we will no longer see U.S. unilateral shows of strength? [Gaviria] I think unilateral actions are totally undesirable, and I believe that in today's post-Cold War period, no one is thinking about unilateral actions. The actions of the United Nations itself are the best demonstration that everyone is thinking about multilateral actions, but, in order to take multilateral actions, all of the countries involved must have a willingness to act. In Latin America, we must build on this will. [Reporter] Let us return to personal questions. Do you imagine groups of people from Pereira will now be going to Washington? [Gaviria, laughing] I do not think so. I think they must be happy as many other people in Colombia are, but I do not think they are going... [Reporter, interrupts] The editorial in Pereira's LA TARDE newspaper reads: Pereira, we are going [words indistinct]. [Gaviria, laughing] They are probably happier in my hometown. [Reporter] The people here in Colombia felt your victory was Colombia's victory. Do you realize that? They did not feel it was a victory for Gaviria but a victory for the country. [Gaviria] That is right, and, in a number of ways, I believe it should be viewed this way. Because we experienced the problems of violence, guerrillas, and drug trafficking in recent years, we began to feel uneasy. Within this same period of time, however, we made progress in our international policy, particularly in our effort to sell Colombia as a country that is modernizing, that is changing, that is promoting political and economic change. There is a general recognition of this attitude and a recognition of Colombia's independent thinking on a number international issues. [Reporter] Are you not going to miss the people, the country, and the food? [Gaviria] I will miss them. Of course, I do not think I will miss the problems of the presidency. [laughs] I hope no one will escape, and I hope the lights will not go out on me. [sentence as heard]
