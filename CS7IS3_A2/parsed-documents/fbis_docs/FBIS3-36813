This was said in the statement by the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction (leader Yavlinskiy) in the State Duma published on Wednesday. The statement points out that "involvement of the NATO military-political bloc into an armed conflict beyond NATO's sphere may break the military-political balance in Europe and contradicts Russia's national interests." According to the faction's deputies, the lifting of the embargo on military deliveries to Bosnia and Herzegovina would inevitably make non-European forces (Muslim states) get involved into the conflict. The statement underlined that such actions could cause a serious domestic problem within the Russian Federation - a split between Christian and Moslem peoples. The faction's statement emphasized that it was "non-productive" to continue implementation of the economic sanctions against the new Yugoslavia since Yugoslavian civilians and the economy of the neighboring states were the first victims of these sanctions. In connection with this, the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction insists on the lifting or "gradual softening" of the sanctions against Yugoslavia (which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro-IF note), which does not directly participate in the war.
