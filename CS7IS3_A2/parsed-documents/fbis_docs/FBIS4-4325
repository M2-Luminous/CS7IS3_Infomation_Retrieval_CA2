FBIS4-4325 "dreas062_j_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 31 Jan 1994 Indonesia * More Credit Opportunities for Small Businesses * More Credit Opportunities for Small Businesses 94SE0077A Jakarta SUARA KARYA in Indonesian 31 Jan 94 p 4 94SE0077A Jakarta SUARA KARYA Indonesian CSO [Text] Jakarta, 31 Jan--The government needs to reactivate the Small Investment Credit Program (KIK) and the Permanent Working Capital Credit Program (KMKP) to help small and medium sized business firms to grow. Based on the experience of a few years ago, it was proved that the KIK and KMKP programs were able to help business firms become strong. This was stated by Sukamdani Sahid Gitosardjono, president of the Sahid Group of companies, at a seminar on "Indonesian Economic and Financial Prospects During 1994," held by HIPMI Jaya [Indonesian Young Businessmen's Association of Greater Jakarta] in Jakarta on 29 January. According to Sukamdani, one cause of success in extending KIK and KMKP loans to help small and medium size businesses in Indonesia was that the criteria and the objectives were clear. These loans were really extended to those who needed them. This situation differs greatly from loans extended under the present, Small Business Loans Program (KUK), although both programs have been aimed at small and medium size businesses. Sukamdani said that the criteria used under the KUK program, which replaced the KIK and KMKP programs, were unclear and confused. He said: "Loans provided to small businesses under the KUK program have an upper limit of 200 million rupiahs. Small businesses do not need so much money. In the past a KIK loan for one million rupiahs was unusual." He said that previously the government, through the KIK and KMKP programs, successfully strengthened small and medium size businesses. He asked why these programs were not continued. Regarding the statement of the minister of finance that loans will be extended to small and medium size businesses through government owned banks, Sukamdani expressed the hope that before this statement becomes a government regulation a dialogue needs to be held. This is because in a dialogue views closer to the real situation can be obtained. He said: "The government is `committed' to this program. We must 373 provide our inputs through a dialogue. This can also be done through the mass media." Later on he said that converting small- and medium-sized businesses into large companies is presently difficult because there are structural and sectoral obstacles in the way. In structural terms the development of small and medium size businesses requires the "political will" of the government on a continuing basis. In fact the government often follows a "mixed strategy." On the one hand the government develops "capital intensive" industries, particularly downstream industry. However, at the same time small- and medium-sized industries are also encouraged to grow. In sectoral terms agricultural products produced on the farm and mineral products do not have substantial added value and competitive strength in the market. There are still many agricultural products which are marketed in raw form. In this connection there is no other solution than establishing industries based on technological innovation. This needs to be done by a working team provided with appropriate guidance, consisting of experts and persons with practical experience who have different but mutually related skills. Meanwhile, Dr Djisman Simandjuntak, director of the Prasetya Mulya Executive Higher Management School, said that, in fact, the difficulties facing small and medium size companies in developing their businesses have been created by the government itself. The government is unfair in providing incentives to businessmen. Often already large companies obtain protection and incentives more extensive than those extended to small businesses. Furthermore, there are many business practices which are still common, such as the formation of cartels which only benefit big businesses. As a result, the question is not how to encourage economic growth of about six percent, rather, it is how to stimulate a higher rate of economic growth and, at the same time, achieve a balance in all business sectors.
