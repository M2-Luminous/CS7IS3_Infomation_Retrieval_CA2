[Meciar] We will address the basics. The basis of the problem is the fact that the parliament chairman was stripped of his rights in an unconstitutional way [deputies voted that the deputy chairman should chair the session today]. The essence of the problem lies in the fact that this parliament has been deliberately led into crisis for a long time now. They try to change election results so that the structure of parliament changes. That is immoral and politically wrong. There cannot be two moral codes in parliament. One has to dig even deeper into the efficiency of this political system that has emerged in parliament. For example, when voting, let us say in the cross-party standing committee, everyone stands for one political entity. Thus, the antigovernment coalition has the majority. In reality, though, with the number of votes, it represents a minority. They [the antigovernment coalition] cannot assume a majority stance on some issues. We have to make it clear what the position of Ludovit Cernak, the National Council's [parliament] deputy chairman is. He became deputy chairman on the basis of the coalition agreement, which he later trampled on. Does he have any moral or political right to be a deputy chairman of the National Council? This question has to be resolved as well. It is not our intention to create a crisis at any cost in the way the opposition is trying to do. The whole opposition is trying to do so, including Peter Weiss [chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left]. Our aim is to find a model for cooperation. We will either cooperate or let us confess to citizens that we are not able to do so. Let them then choose from among us with whom they want to cooperate. This situation has been coming to a head for a long time now, several months now. I still do not consider this to be a critical moment. I consider it to be an element of the first conflict, which will still be resolved. However, if essential, deeper, systemic changes are not adopted, there is a danger that the crisis will recur. It might change into a permanent parliamentary crisis. That, already, is a very serious matter. [Unidentified correspondent] At the moment, there is in fact a stalemate in parliament--75 for and 75 against. Do you think the National Council will be able to continue discussing the government bill [on large-scale privatization] tomorrow? [Meciar] It is not appropriate that I should take a stance on parliamentary matters from my position as a Cabinet member. I would rather speak on behalf of the HZDS movement. There is no stalemate [in parliament]; the balance is still in our [government coalition's] favor. We do not do this out of fear. We have the majority in parliament, even the majority needed to adopt necessary laws, as the law on large-scale privatization is. [Unidentified correspondent] One lady deputy allegedly left the HZDS yesterday? [Meciar] I do not know anything about that. [Unidentified correspondent] Did you change your opinion on early elections after what happened today? [Meciar] My opinion remains the same. First, those who left their [deputies'] clubs--namely, nine deputies from the HZDS, several SNS deputies who left for the so-called national democratic [club]--should leave their seats in parliament. The citizens voted for particular parties. The election system is based on parties. Therefore, it will be one of our duties to initiate a change, both through a bill on internal affairs and by asking the citizens to petition and support the referendum, which would decide on this matter. If the referendum fails, the next option for a solution, in my opinion, would be early parliamentary elections. However, I still prefer other options--i.e., I prefer tackling the internal situations in deputies' clubs in harmony with the election law and not in the spirit of two moral codes, two sets of rules, two approaches regardless of the law. That would be dishonest. [end recording]
