The two ministries will also exchange information on issues such as the production of pesticides and chemical fertilizer, the acreage of crops and forecasts for plant diseases and insect pests, the agreement states. They will probe new ways and means to scientifically apply fertilizer and pesticides so as to raise their utilization rate and reduce production costs. According to the agreement, they will link the chemical fertilizer plants and the agricultural sector more closely as producer and consumer, by facilitating the circulation of chemical fertilizer and pesticides. Meanwhile, the two ministries, in co-operation with other departments, promised to bolster market supervision and management, and halt the manufacturing and circulation of fake and low-quality products. Also stated in the agreement is that the two ministries will help develop rural and township chemical plants, especially those in central and western China, and encourage them to conduct technical exchanges and co-operation with their state-owned counterparts. Signed by Liu Jiang and Gu Xiulian, the respective ministers, the agreement is sponsored by the State Council, which says it is conducive to the progress of agriculture and the agro-chemical industry. Official statistics show that the use of pesticides has enabled China to make 30 billion yuan (about 3.4 billion U.S. dollars) in direct economic benefits every year. The damage caused by plant diseases and insect pests are inclined to be heavy this year, and some 210,000 tons of pesticides are needed nationwide, according to official forecasts. An official at the Ministry of Chemical Industry said that the ministry is now making every possible effort to guarantee the supply of all sorts of pesticides.
