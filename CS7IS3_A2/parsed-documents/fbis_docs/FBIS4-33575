Eduardo Linares, deputy minister of planning and economic policy, has reported that international financial institutes (IFI's) could "withhold approximately $300 million in credits if the government fails to comply with various stringent conditions imposed by these organizations." He added, "There would be a $1.9 million deficit in 1994 budget if this money is withheld." The government is expected to make several modifications to the national budget to prevent the IFI's decision from negatively affecting the budget. Planning Minister Delia Cardenas, Finance Minister Victor Juliao, and Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria are scheduled to meet on 6 June to discuss the issue.
