During his interview with IRNA's correspondent in Moscow, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha elaborated: We don't even have the slightest difference with the Islamic Republic of Iran hampering mutual cooperation. Asked about the Russian Government's view of foreign policy, he said: In view of its geographic position in Europe and Asia, Russia should have equal political and economic relations with all countries based on reciprocal interests. Zaveryukha stressed that unilateral tendencies usually have dangerous and negative consequences for countries such as Russia, so there must be multilateral cooperation with countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. He added: The "insane ramblings" of individuals such as Zhirinovskiy regarding neighboring countries are not at all representative of the opinions or will of the Russian Administration or people. On the prospects for cooperation between Iran and Russia and the cordial relations between Iran and the former Soviet Union, the Russian deputy prime minister added: In the Persian Gulf region, Iran is bestowed with all kinds of capabilities, so we should establish extensive cooperation in the cultural and economic fields. On the upcoming conference of the Caspian Sea littoral countries, he stated: Iran's participation in this conference along with the CIS member countries is necessary and imperative.
