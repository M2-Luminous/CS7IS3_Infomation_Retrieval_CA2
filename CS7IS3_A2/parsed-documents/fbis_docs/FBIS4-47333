Karasev, Scientific Research Institute of Engines] [Abstract] This paper examines the use of electroerosion machining (electic discharge machining, EDM) on current-carrying materials (copying and piercing operations). Conclusions reached from experience using EDM are expressed. Methods of improving EDM equipment are outlined, and include: increasing the range of pulse characteistics, better monitoring of the machining process, more flexible control, specialized machinery, new materials, special liquids for the machining process, and expert systems to design procedures. Flexible modules for piercing operations are described in detail. Current equipment achieves an accuracy of 0.01 mm. A number of machines in the SEP series have been developed for EDM. In one pass the machines can make up to 15,000 perforations; depending on the number and diameter of the holes this can take 30-70 minutes. The SEL-1 is a specialized machine tool with a semi-automatic mode, and it is described. It has two independent heads and machines the channels between the blade of monorotors. The accuracy achieved in 0.05 mm; the roughness ratio is 2.5. References 3 (Western).
