"In adjusting tariff rates on agricultural imports, we'll not only consider GATT requirements but also refer to the rates of GATT members whose economic levels are similar to ours, such as Japan and South Korea," the official explained. South Korea's average tariff rate on agricultural products stood at 19.6 percent in 1993, slightly higher than Japan's 18 percent but lower than Taiwan's 21.63 percent. After the GATT Uruguay Round accords take effect later this year, the official said, the two countries must further lower their tariff rates by 24 to 36 percent. The official said Taiwan will be forced to open its agricultural market after it is admitted to the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body which advocates free and fair trade. "With its limited production, Taiwan's agricultural industry cannot compete in international markets," the official noted. "And without tariff and non-tariff protection, the products will not even be able to compete on the domestic market." Among others, growers of sugar, peanuts, red beans, garlic, mushrooms and potatoes will be hardest hit if the government removes subsidies and cuts tariffs in accordance with GATT regulations, the official said. Current local prices for those products are two to four times those quoted on international markets. Peanuts, red beans and garlic are major crops for farmers in southern Taiwan. "The social and political costs for allowing importation of these products will be very high," the official warned. Many locally produced fruits, including pears, peaches, plums, apples, grapefruit, bananas, mangoes and guava, may also be squeezed out of the market after current import restrictions are eased, the official said. To help local farmers overcome difficulties that are expected to arise after Taiwan's GATT entry, the official said, the agricultural council will adopt several strategies to cope with tariff problems. First of all, the official said, the government will ask GATT to allow Taiwan to import only limited quantities of rice for the first 10 years of membership. "The import quota will be set at 1 to 4 percent of Taiwan's total annual rice consumption," the official said. "If this goal can be realized, the impact on our rice farmers will be limited," he noted. Meanwhile, the official said, Taiwan will liberalize importation of other farm products under a tariff system. "After we join GATT, we'll use different tariff strategies toward different farm products," he explained. For example, the government may lower tariff rates on some farm products during the off-season. The government may also adopt a two-tier tariff system for some items under which imports within quotas will be subject to lower tariff rates and higher rates will be imposed on those exceeding the quotas.
