FR940328-1-00016 FR940328-1-00007 Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC21 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered Status for the Plant Puccinellia Parishii (Parish's Alkali Grass) AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the plant Puccinellia parishii (Parish's alkali grass) as an endangered species under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This ephemeral annual grass occurs in small, widely disjunct populations in California, Arizona, and New Mexico occupying desert springs or seeps. Parish's alkali grass is threatened by alteration of hydrologic flows due to spring or seep development, water diversion or impoundment, and groundwater pumping; loss of habitat from farming, grazing, and residential construction activities; limited distribution; and low population numbers. This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal protection provided by the Act for Parish's alkali grass. Critical habitat is not being proposed. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by May 27, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by May 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, New Mexico Ecological Services Field Office, 3530 Pan American Highway, NE, suite D, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87107. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne Cully, at the above address (505/883&hyph;7877). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Parish's alkali grass was first collected by Samuel Bonsal Parish at Rabbit Springs in the Mojave Desert of California in 1915. It was described by A.S. Hitchcock in 1928. Parish's alkali grass has also been collected in Arizona and New Mexico. Parish's alkali grass is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is a dwarf, ephemeral, winter-to-spring, tufted annual that flowers from April to May. The leaves are 1&hyph;3 centimeters (cm) (0.4&hyph;1.2 inches (in)) long, firm, upright, and very narrow. Flowering stems are 2&hyph;20 cm (0.8&hyph;8 in) long and number 1&hyph;25 per plant. The inflorescence is 1&hyph;10 cm (0.4&hyph;4 in) long, narrow, and few-flowered. Each division has 2&hyph;6 perfect flowers, 3&hyph;5 millimeters (mm) (0.1&hyph;0.2 in) long, that separate at maturity. Parish's alkali grass is known from widely disjunct localities in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Its small populations occupy a very specific desert habitat of alkaline springs and seeps at elevations of 700&hyph;1,800 meters (m) (2,300&hyph;6,000 feet (ft)). This species is dependent upon continuous spring or seep flows. Population size fluctuates widely in response to climatic conditions and precipitation. In Arizona, Parish's alkali grass is documented from several historic locations on the Navajo and Hopi Indian reservations. These include a marsh near Tuba City in Coconino County (Phillips and Phillips 1991) and near Shato (Shonto), Navajo County. There are seven currently known sites in Arizona, all from the vicinity of Tuba City. It is unknown whether the historic and currently known locations near Tuba City are precisely the same. The 7 known populations total approximately 400 plants and occupy about 0.1 hectare (ha) (0.2 acre (ac)) of mesic canyon bottom seeps and natural springs. Associated riparian species include Triglochin spp. (arrowgrass), Distichlis stricta (saltgrass), and Juncus spp. (rush). The Shato population has not been relocated; wetland sites may have disappeared in response to severe overgrazing (B. Hevron, Navajo Natural Heritage Program, pers. comm., 1993). Parish's alkali grass presently occurs at two sites in the California Mojave Desert. The first site is located on a privately owned multiple spring complex in San Bernardino County. First collected at these springs in 1915 and later in 1950 (Phillips and Phillips 1991), the species was rediscovered at the spring complex in 1992 (T. Thomas and C. Rutherford, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). An estimated 100&hyph;200 plants occupy a 50 square (sq) m (500 sq ft) area, 5&hyph;8 m (16&hyph;26 ft) downslope from a leaking earthen impoundment. Associated species include Anemopsis californica (yerba mansa), Carex spp. (sedge), saltgrass, Hesperochiron pumilus, and Mimulus guttatus (monkey flower). It is uncertain whether Parish's alkali grass disappeared at this location or was merely overlooked; botanists had searched for it repeatedly (Rutherford, pers. comm., 1993). Alteration of hydrology and loss of habitat could explain why this species remained undetected for 42 years (Phillips and Phillips 1991). There is little historic information on the land use or hydrology of this spring complex from which to evaluate the present condition of the Parish's alkali grass population. However, it is evident that the spring complex was altered at some point to create several ponds for livestock use (Thomas, pers. comm., 1993). Development around this site may have contributed to lowering the water table to the point that the spring stopped or rarely flowed (Phillips and Phillips 1991). Jerrold Davis, of the Bailey Herbarium at Cornell University, noted that the spring itself did not appear to have flowed for a long time (A. Phillips, Museum of Northern Arizona, pers. comm., 1991).
