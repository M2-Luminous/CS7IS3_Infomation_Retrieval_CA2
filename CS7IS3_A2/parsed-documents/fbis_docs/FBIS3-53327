Preservation of the freshness and fervor of the presence of society in political affairs cannot be done by force. Neither can government directives be instrumental in politicizing a society, nor can one force the people to participate in political affairs at a particular juncture or for the sake of the personal inclinations of an individual. That society has a constant presence on the political scene which is endowed with political acumen and this cannot be achieved without the spontaneous fervor of the people for such a presence and is only possible when the society feels such a need. The great leader of the revolution constantly stresses the people's regular presence on the political scene and recently too he exhorted the students to cultivate political understanding and insight -- it is a source of amazement that the students cannot participate in the most essential gathering and march against the United States on the day that has been declared a national day of combating the powers of world arrogance. Interior Minister Besharati's response to a question by the Rasht deputy gives the impression that the commemoration of this day and the marches by students on 4 November [anniversary of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy by Iranian students] can only be done through government channels. If the students of this country, who are part of an enlightened, dynamic, and aware society, have to surmount a barricade called a government directive to express their hatred and to condemn the United States, how can they be expected to have a constant presence on the country's political scene? In answer to the question by the Rasht deputy, the interior minister stated: "Our criterion for granting permission to stage marches on 4 November is the directive which is a legal document, and we can grant permission to only one organization and that is the Islamic Propagation Coordination Council." Minister, Sir! Please note that on the day that it becomes necessary for students to be present on the political scene to condemn the powers of world arrogance, it will not be possible to drag them to that scene with a directive. Yes. The law is to be respected and its implementation is necessary and it is binding on all. However, it is not possible to groom a society to be a spontaneous political one endowed with a high level of awareness and acumen merely by means of government circulars.
