Erik Zuleta, general secretary of the Lara Automotive Union, reported that at the meeting held by the Bloc of Transportation Unions of the Central and Central-Eastern States, it was agreed to initiate the strike as of Tuesday. This move will leave the following states without public transportation along city and inter-city routes: Tachira, Merida, Trujillo, Falcon, Zulia, Barinas, Portuguesa, Yaracuy, Apure, Cojedes, and Lara, as well as part of Carabobo. Zuleta said the transportation strike will hit the nation's central area, the central-western region, the Andes, and the western flatlands. The strike will be staged indefinitely until the Transportation and Communications Ministry responds to a document turned over by Fedetransporte [expansion unknown] in October in which the problems of more than 80,000 transportation sector workers are spelled out. The demands include an increase in the minimum wage, the elimination of the VAT [value-added tax], and that the state absorb the cost of the student tariff. Zuleta indicated that the transportation workers are not willing to continue subsidizing this service that should be assumed by the government. In addition, the secretary general of the Lara Automotive Union said that one of the main points for resolving the tariff problem is the need for the government to establish official tariffs for urban, suburban, metropolitan, and countryside transportation. The decision made by the Bloc of Transportation Unions has already been made. The strike will be initiated on Tuesday for an indefinite period until the bloc receives a satisfactory reply from the government. The workers have been waiting for this reply for three months.
