The decision ratifies commitments made by Brazilian diplomats and confirms that the national nuclear program--recognized as a leading sector in the progress of Brazilian industrial technology--is following rigorous parameters in complying with international safety standards. Besides the Senate decision, a new level in relations between Brazil and Argentina has been reached thanks to establishment of the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC). The result is that Brazilian diplomats now possess important trump cards for reversing Brazil's image as an unreliable country as far as transferring sensitive technology is concerned. The subject of nuclear safeguards is complex and requires exhaustive international negotiations by Brazilian diplomats. Brazil has not signed and does not intend to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it considers discriminatory and unfair. It is, however, one of the few countries in the world whose Constitution includes a provision banning the manufacture of atomic bombs. Perhaps that constitutional provision is not regarded as a guarantee, but it shows our country's intention to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. According to the text approved by the Senate, the enrichment of uranium will be inspected not from the standpoint of the way it is accomplished but in terms of the quantity produced. The Navy is thus honoring its pledge to keep uranium production at enrichment levels not exceeding 20 percent. Brazil is therefore providing the international community with a guarantee that its production of nuclear power is not aimed at the manufacture of an atomic bomb, which would require uranium enriched to much higher levels. And at the same time, the country is protecting the secrecy of the military program for building a nuclear-powered submarine, a program that is being carried out in an extremely efficient manner by the Navy at the Aramar Experimental Center in Ipero, Sao Paulo. It should not be forgotten that nuclear power is currently a highly competitive international market. Indiscriminately divulging the stage reached in certain research could hinder the transfer of technology and the achievement of Brazilian production levels capable of threatening internationally established monopolies.
