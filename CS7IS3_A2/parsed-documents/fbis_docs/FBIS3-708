The transitional government was officially seated on Monday [7 March], but the inauguration of cabinet ministers was delayed. The deployment of the African peacekeeping forces to disarm the fighting factions has also run into difficulties. A major split in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] is causing serious headaches, so is renewed fighting in Rivercess regions, south of Buchanan, between the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] and Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces. From Monrovia, (Niaty Allison) telexed this report: ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is still being prevented from entering ULIMO and NPFL territory, five days after the seating of the transitional government. The chief of staff of the African force, General Femi Williams, said our deployment there will depend on how soon the problem in ULIMO is resolved and the buffer zones are vacated. ULIMO fighters, loyal to renegade General Roosevelt Johnson, are said to have cordoned off the Bong Mine region and are in combat readiness against ULIMO leader Alhaji Koromah's supporters, who are occupying areas west of the (Simpe) River. However, in the Todee area, about 35 miles northwest of the capital, Monrovia, the peacekeeping force has deployed and is being given cooperation even though actual disarmament has not begun. The African peacekeeping force and UN officials have been carrying out shuttle diplomacy aimed at bringing the two opposing sides in ULIMO together. The disarming of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia, [AFL], continues today, with 300 soldiers handing in their guns. On the political front, the Transitional Council announced today that they would install cabinet ministers on Monday, 14 March. The list of appointees has not been released, and according to an official at State House, the list is being held up so as not to cause further confusion. Meanwhile, thousands of people continue to stream into the port city of Buchanan, fleeing the war between Charles Taylor's NPFL and the George Bolley's Liberia Peace Council. LPC leader George Bolley, a former minister in the government of Samuel Doe, had, up until today, been the shadowy hand behind the LPC. Now he has come out in public. He claimed that the LPC firmly controls six counties, including Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, Rivercess, Grand Kru, Maryland, and he said, nearly all of Grand Bassa County, except Buchanan, which is controlled by the African peacekeeping forces. Fleeing women, children, and the elderly, yesterday told stories of mass looting of warehouses by forces of the Liberia Peace Council.
