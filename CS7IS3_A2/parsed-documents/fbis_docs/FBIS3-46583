Kajima Chairman Rokuro Ishikawa, 68, Vice Chairman Shoichi Kajima, 63, and President Akira Miyazaki, 70, approved the plan to provide the unreported "donations," the sources said. At the time, Kajima was president and Miyazaki a vice president. Twice annually -- during the summer and year-end gift-giving seasons -- 5 million yen was "donated" to Watanabe through the Liberal Democratic Party's fund-raising body, Kokumin Seiji Kyokai. Altogether, Watanabe received 40 million yen from August 1988 through December 1991 in this manner, the sources said. The Tokyo district public prosecutors office is probing into the matter, sources close to the investigation said. Nippon Television City Corp., a company that owns and leases Tokyo Tower's communications facilities to various television and radio stations, planned in 1987 to build a high-rise hotel project on land lying within Tokyo's Shiba Park. It awarded the contract to build the computerized "intelligent building" to Kajima. The project was initially regarded as difficult because the land lay within the park, where commercial construction is severely restricted by the Tokyo metropolitan government to protect and preserve urban greenery. However, the Tokyo government issued permission in October 1988, a few months after the summer of that year when Watanabe asked metropolitan authorities to grant a waiver exempting the project from the building restrictions. Just prior to that, Watanabe, now 59, had held the post of deputy chief cabinet secretary to the Cabinet of then Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone from July 1986 to November 1987. Watanabe assumed the post of "advisor" to Nippon Television City Corp. in May, 1988, five months before the Tokyo government approved the Shiba Park high-rise development. Afterwards Watanabe held the position of posts and telecommunications minister from November 1991 to December 1992 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Watanabe, a six-term member of the Diet's House of Representatives, lost his seat in last July's general election. Payment of the unreported "donations" were suspended when the project was aborted following the breakdown of contract talks between Nippon Television City and a foreign hotel operator that had planned to use the building as its Tokyo branch, the sources added. Former Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama and other top Kajima executives were arrested last year over the giving of bribes to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii and Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi. Ishikawa headed the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry from December 1987 until his resignation last August. Kajima Corp., one of Japan's three largest general contractors, was also implicated in a bid-rigging scandal involving public projects in Saitama Prefecture. In May 1992, the Fair Trade Commission ordered the company to stop its alleged unfair business practices.
