The Russian Federation Procurator General's office has announced that on 11 March, acting Procurator General Ilyushenko dropped the criminal case against the chemist Vil Mirzoyanov, who was accused of divulging information that constituted a state secret, owing to the absence of any corpus delicti in his actions. [Moscow INTERFAX in English at 2048 GMT on 10 March, in an earlier report, adds: "Russian scientist Vil Mirzayanov, charged with betraying a national secret, told Interfax on Thursday that he would continue his efforts to end the development of new chemical weapons in Russia." "Mirzayanov said Russia and other nations continued devising new toxic substances, for that did not contradict any international agreements. Thus, the Paris Convention on the destruction of chemical weapons does not mention new types of chemical arms, including binary weapons. `As long as work goes on on new kinds of toxic substances I will continue fighting whether I am arrested again or not," the scientist said.'"]
