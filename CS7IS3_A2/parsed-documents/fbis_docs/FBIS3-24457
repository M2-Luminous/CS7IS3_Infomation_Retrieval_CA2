Therefore, all the more unexpected is the call for an all-Russian strike by RTPTs [not further identified] workers. A correspondent of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA contacted by telephone Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Communication Workers. [Nazeykin] After the February events, when communication workers banged, as they say, their fists on the table, we managed to handle only last year's debts. Communication workers have already received about 30 billion. The government promised to cover the remaining 35.9 billion in the very near future. Up to now it is unclear what will be this year. Contracts with many television and radio companies have not been concluded and there is no financing. It is not even clear how many state television programs and what their broadcasting volumes will be. [Akkuratov] Could a meeting with the prime minister solve the problems? [Nazeykin] We have not yet seen Chernomyrdin. Proposals for the government draft decree on television and radio broadcasting had to be prepared first. The document must determine how it will develop and who will manage it. The draft (it already exists!) discusses the establishment of the Teleradioinform Company under the Ministry of Communications. In the future television and radio companies will have to conclude contracts for technical servicing with it. Taking into consideration the big delays in the payment for our services, we proposed that a point on prepayment be introduced into the decree. [Akkuratov] However, the February action, seemingly, has brought results. Why are passions inflamed again? [Nazeykin] Because in a number of regions--Kirov, Kemerovo, Tula, and Voronezh--they began to set procuracies against communication workers. Although in February a strike was not even discussed--a reduction in broadcasting volumes, yes. Incidentally, in oblasts, where heads of administrations allocated money from their budget, broadcasting was not reduced. Now RTPTs labor collectives demand that the prosecution of their leaders be stopped, but their opinion is ignored. Dissatisfaction is growing and people are declaring their intention to use extreme measures. [Akkuratov] Political demands, as in February, are not put forward? [Nazeykin] When in March people receive wages for November and December--is this policy or not? The state has four television channels, let it pay for them. If it is unable to do so, let it give them to commercial structures. Communication workers are dissatisfied with the fact that television and radio companies do not settle their accounts with them for advertising, which takes more and more time on the air. [Akkuratov] Are you not disturbed by the fact that, by "punishing" the state, you infringe primarily upon television viewers' rights? [Nazeykin] What is left? During the entire year of 1993 we talked about our unfortunate situation. No reaction. Then we decided to resort to a reduction in broadcasting. At first we scheduled this for 1 July and then we postponed this to 12 August. To 1 October. And, again, nothing but promises. The broadcasting center in Kamchatka was idle for an entire month. Power engineering workers shut it off owing to our debts. Most technical centers have been operating to the point of wear for a long time. Basic equipment has become disabled. There are no funds to buy new equipment. What is there to wait for? [Akkuratov] Nevertheless, how realistic is an all-Russian strike by communication workers? [Nazeykin] If the attempts to prosecute the organizers of the February action do not stop, it will be difficult to guarantee anything. Labor collectives can no longer be held back by promises to analyze the situation. If RTPTs leaders are not protected, the process will become uncontrollable. And then the consequences are unpredictable.
