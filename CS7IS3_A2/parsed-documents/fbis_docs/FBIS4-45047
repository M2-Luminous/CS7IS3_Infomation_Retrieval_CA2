Palestinians took over administration of their own affairs for the first time. How is the Palestinian police planning best to perform its missions? How will it deal with citizens and with settlers at the same time? Colonel Hajj Isma'il, chief of the Palestinian police forces, throws light on the future duties of the Palestinian police in the following telephone interview with our AL-SHARQ bureau in Cairo. [Husayn] What missions have been assigned to the Palestinian police? How do you feel now that the Feast of Sacrifice has arrived with the police forces among their own people in Gaza and Jericho for the first time? [Isma'il] First I send my greetings to all people in the Arab homeland on the occasion of the Blessed Feast of Sacrifice. I send these greetings from the liberated land of Palestine and the brave city of Jericho. We send expressions of love and esteem to all who contributed and helped the Palestinian people return to their land and home. Greetings to the whole Arab nation from the Atlantic to the Gulf! As for the duties of the police, since their arrival, the civilian police forces have assumed normal duties as usual in the territory, especially in the Jericho area. The forces have begun to execute all their duties to provide security and safety and maintain order. Affairs here in Jericho are proceeding normally and as usual. The Palestinian police are running affairs in accordance with the operational program they have. [Husayn] What is the situation of the settlers in the Gaza and Jericho area? Do you expect disturbances to be fomented during the operation of the Palestinian police forces? [Isma'il] We have worked hard from the beginning to avoid getting into problems with the settlers, particularly the religious ones. The Jews have a small synagogue in the Jericho area. One of the agreements was that the religious should be allowed to frequent this synagogue once a week or at any time they wish, but on condition that they not be armed. The religious are insisting on entering the synagogue with their weapons and are refusing to be bound by the agreement. They are giving us trouble and problems. They also are going through the city. We are trying hard in liaison with the Israeli side to overcome the problems. We are still suffering from this problem. The religious settlers are still behaving provocatively. [Husayn] What about the return of refugee Jericho residents to their lands from Jordan? [Isma'il] There are large numbers of Palestinians living completely on Jordanian soil and receiving much attention in Jordan. They are now waiting for arrangements to be made to implement the agreement on a return of the refugees. They will have priority in returning to their country. Special committees will begin in this context to discuss the return of the refugees--joint Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian committees and joint Israeli-Palestinian-Egyptian committees. [Husayn] What about Palestinians visiting Jerusalem, given the ban that Israel is imposing? [Isma'il] The Israeli position remains the same regarding visits to Jerusalem by residents of the Jericho area. We are suffering from this difficulty. We discussed the subject last Wednesday with the Israeli side. The Israeli position still has not changed on this subject. They insist that anyone who wants to visit Jerusalem must obtain a permit. We have informed them that Jerusalem is part of Palestinian territory. We shall soon visit Jerusalem. We are working to break the blockade and lift the measures that the Israeli side has imposed on Jerusalem. [Husayn] What preparations are being made to receive Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in the Jericho area? [Isma'il] We in the West Bank and Gaza are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Chairman Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and earnestly preparing to receive him. The timing of the arrival has been left up to the chairman. He will be among his people and friends. We welcome him warmly among the people of his homeland. [Husayn] What about supervision of the King Husayn Bridge entering and leaving Jericho, as well as the passage linking Jericho and the Gaza Strip? What is the situation of the police forces regarding these two crossings? [Isma'il] There are agreements on the subject. The Israeli side is building the installations necessary for traffic on the three crossings. The Israeli side will soon finish setting up the designated stations, and we shall then begin to implement all measures concerned with the process of entering and leaving the corridors in accordance with the provisions of the agreement on the subject. [Husayn] Would you tell us something about the deployment of the Palestinian police forces and the duties assigned to them? [Isma'il] As soon as our forces reached the Jericho area, they moved to secure and safeguard public installations. We are working hard to assure public order and provide protection to citizens. When we arrived, we began to provide protection to all institutions, so that they can operate normally. Tourism as usual has returned to Jericho. All civil institutions are working regularly. We also took swift steps to restore control of traffic in the city and of public utilities in cooperation with people here. We are witnessing great joy among our people who lived under the occupation and those who have returned from the diaspora. The whole country is filled with joy. Jericho will be a step toward the return of all our lands--until the flag of freedom shall fly over them. We are working hard to make Jericho a brick in the edifice of our independent Palestinian national state. We ask the Arab states to support the Palestinian people, so that we can restore the infrastructure that we received in ruinous condition from the Israeli army of occupation. We are working to build a modern state. This requires support from the Arab and Islamic nation. [Husayn] What measures are the Palestinian police forces taking with regard to the issue of arms proliferating in the hands of civilian citizens in Jericho? [Isma'il] We for our part will take measures to guarantee and control the weapons phenomenon in a way that protects the dignity of citizens and the dignity of the homeland. We expect close cooperation from citizens with the police. We have no troubles on this subject in Jericho, since everyone favors stopping the circulation of any illegitimate and illegal weapons.
