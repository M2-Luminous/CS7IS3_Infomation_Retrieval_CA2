Zherzdev, Moscow; UDC 629.7.023.22] [Abstract] This paper examines the creation of condensed heat-resistant coatings for cooled working blades of the gas turbines of aviation engines and energy plants. The evaporation of ZnO[.sub]2[/]-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics are studied and a coating with a columnar structure is formed. The basic thermophysical properties of ceramic coatings are studied. Ceramic condensed coatings are highly resistant to thermal loads and were not damaged during prolonged tests on aviation engines. The coatings protect blade surfaces from high-temperature corrosion and the blade material from weakening due to high temperatures. The characteristics of ceramic coatings in general are listed. Two ceramics were tested, KDP-1 and KDP-4. The conductivity of KDP-1 was close to that of a ZrO[.sub]2[/] single crystal. The main cause of coating failure is oxidation of the ceramic-metal interface; other causes are listed. The oxidation causes a continuous reduction in the adhesion of the ceramic coating. This may be reduced by alloying and reducing the diffusive mobilty of oxygen. At temperatures below 1100ï¿½ the coatings may last 10,000-15,000 hours.
