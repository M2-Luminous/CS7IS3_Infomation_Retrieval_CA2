The principal reason of the censure motion, the document emphasizes, is based on the current negative state of our economic and social life, with grave consequences upon the level of the standard of living. The motion also mentions the lack of certain concrete government programs and the critical condition of Romanian agriculture, which proves the inability of the government to solve the economic problems and promote its own program. Commenting on the text of the censure motion, the PDAR chairman stressed that it represents a gesture to protest against poverty and incertitude and to condemn incompetence and inefficiency. Answering journalists' questions, Surdu expressed the hope that the censure motion will be seconded by parties with more weight in parliament, and added that the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party] has already expressed its readiness to do so. In that context, Surdu said that if other parties also want to initiate censure motions, the PDAR leadership will examine such initiatives, and if they also include the claims of the PDAR, it cannot be excluded that the party will support such motions. Considering that the current structure of parliament does not offer any answers to the question toward what kind of society we are heading, Surdu also said, a reevaluation of the Romanian political spectrum would be necessary through the organization of early elections.
