According to statistics from the local government, the province harvested 1.2 billion kg of grain and 150 million kg of oil-bearing crops in 1993, both record high. Despite a rare storm at the beginning of last year, the province's stock breeding industry achieved good total in major livestock. The output of the province's rural and township firms registered a 30 percent growth over 1992 to exceed one billion yuan (110 million U.S. dollars). Qinghai's industry has picked up momentum, due to more technical input and reforms of companies' management systems. Many crisis-ridden trades, such as machinery and woollen industry, have stepped out of the doldrums. More and more state-owned businesses have meshed with the demand of the market and produced a number of high-quality products, which are welcomed by consumers both in and out of the province. Last year, Qinghai's total industry output amounted to eight billion dollars (990 million U.S. dollars). In addition, local government further boosted individual and private enterprises. About 120 new trading markets have been put up, contributing to a four billion retail transaction last year. In 1993, the province took great strides in foreign trade, with a total import and export volume of 100 million yuan (11 million U.S. dollars). Another 49 foreign-funded firms were built up, bringing in 45 million U.S. dollars in investment. In addition, the province held a large-scale commercial fair in Hong Kong, striking 20 million U.S. dollars worth of deals and concluding 40 cooperative contracts with foreign companies, which will bring in another 300 million U.S. dollars. Last year, the local government slashed a number of money-consuming construction projects to ensure energy and material supplies for key national projects. By the end of last year, several key projects had been put into operation, such as a one-million-ton refinery in Golmud, the expansion of Qinghai Aluminium Plant and first-stage renovation work on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.
