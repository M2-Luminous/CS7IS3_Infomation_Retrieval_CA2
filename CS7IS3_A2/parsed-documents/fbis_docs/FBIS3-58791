His suggestion received support from ex-New Democracy minister Alexandros Papadhogonas but was dismissed by the government spokesman. Pandelis Oikonomou, a member of the PASOK Central Committee, has been known to take up unpopular policy options which the party leadership sometimes later embrace, as in the case of his preelection stand in favor of taxing "repos." But his "Slavomacedonia" suggestion comes at a time when Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is eager to show his government is united on the issue, especially after recent divergent opinions from European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, echoing the Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, insisted Mr. Oikonomou was only expressing "his personal views which have nothing to do with government policy."
