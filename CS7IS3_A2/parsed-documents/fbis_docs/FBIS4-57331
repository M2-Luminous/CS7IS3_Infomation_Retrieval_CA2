We hope that in the spirit of cooperation we may do whatever is feasible and possible to see that the transition is carried out in the least disruptive way possible, with the utmost respect for all the people of the Endara administration and all public officials involved in this transition, who I am sure understand that their jobs are not at stake.

We will gladly oblige.
