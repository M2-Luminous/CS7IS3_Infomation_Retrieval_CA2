More than 100 armed Abkhazians entered the village of Ganmukhuri which is situated on the other [west] side of the Inguri river. In this connection, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia left for Zugdidi. Our correspondent today got in touch with Givi Lominadze, chairman of the interim committee for emergency situations in west Georgia, and asked him to give us more detailed information about the incident. Unfortunately, after the fall of Sukhumi, the villages of the Zugdidi and Tsalenjikha areas -- Ganmukhuri, Taya, Pakhulani, Muzhava, and others -- fell into the hands of the Abkhaz side. After the republic's government troops entered Zugdidi, Vakhtang Kobalia's letter asking Ardzinba to keep his promise not to enter these villages was found in the desk of one of the officials. As it emerged, the first copy of this letter was sent to Ardzinba. We do not know how seriously Ardzinba took Kobalia's request, but the fact remains that, as we have told you above, on 30 December at noon about 100 Abkhazians entered the village of Ganmukhuri. According to the local population, they behaved correctly. The Abkhazians said that their move was prompted by a report alleging that the Georgian side planned to attack on 1 January. It must also be said that some Georgian army formations whose job it was to guard these villages did not carry out the duties delegated to them. As a result of negotiations, the Abkhaz side left the village. As I have told you, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia left for Zugdidi, where he held a meeting and demanded that certain army formations and their leaders treat their duty with greater responsibility and guard villages to prevent such instances in the future. Batoni [honorific title] Givi Lominadze noted at the end of the conversation that every measure is being taken to retain peace and stability in the region.
