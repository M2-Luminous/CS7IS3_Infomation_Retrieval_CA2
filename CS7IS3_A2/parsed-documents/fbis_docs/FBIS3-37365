"This decision is a result of much thinking and three notes on resignation which I have presented to the Cabinet's leadership since this January," Pamfilova said in her exclusive interview with our news agency. "I do not want to be a screen nor to reassure in vain people who need social support and security. I cannot do anything in the government with such a composition. At the same time I do not want this government to fall because real chaos could come out of the ruin," said Pamfilova. At the same time, she admits that an opportunity for the present Cabinet could be lost in the near "two-three months." I would not like to be among the people who are willy-nilly building the road to Zhrinovskiy's power," declared Pamfilova. In her words, the government would become viable if Yegor Gaydar returns to it as the first prime minister and Boris Fedorov -- as leader of the economic sphere. "I hope I shall have an opportunity to explain my decision and my position to President Yeltsin in detail," said Pamfilova. On Wednesday she conducted a conference with her department's staff and explained the motives for her resignation.
