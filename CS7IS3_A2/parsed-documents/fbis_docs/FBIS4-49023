The letter says that in accordance with the law, relevant departments on the China mainland protect the lives and property of Taiwan compatriots touring, visiting relatives, doing business, and making investment on the mainland. Regarding cases of the lives and property of Taiwan compatriots being infringed upon, the mainland authorities will investigate and deal with them should they take place, and handle them according to the law. The "Qiandao Lake" case has served as an example. In principle, ARATS agrees to exchange views with Taiwan's SEF on incidents jeopardizing the lives and property of mainland and Taiwan compatriots that have occurred now and then in cross-strait exchanges and contacts in recent years. In the wake of the "Qiandao Lake" incident, compatriots in Taiwan as well as on the China mainland have pinned greater hopes on ARATS and SEF pushing forward cross-strait relations. We should work hard to promote the aforesaid discussion's bearing fruit. For this purpose, ARATS has already enthusiastically made suggestions on the agenda and contents in exchanging views. The letter says that ARATS has already continuously provided SEF with facts regarding the crimes of the culprits and the situation at the scene. Regarding the autopsy reports, verbal briefings will be given when SEF experts arrive in Hangzhou.
