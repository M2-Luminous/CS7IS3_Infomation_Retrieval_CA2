Establishes New Intellectual Mitsubishi Materials Corp. Establishes New Intellectual Property Service Company 94FE0393B Tokyo NIKKEI SANGY0 SHIMBUN in Japanese 8 Feb 94 p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0393B Tokyo NIKKEI SANGY0 SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] On February 1, 1994, Mitsubishi Materials made an announcement of its newly-founded, wholly-owned "intellectual property service" company. The new company will be engaged mainly in collection and analysis of patent and technical information concerning manufacturing, mining, and information industries. Effective February 1, together with the intellectual property division, previously designated as the patent division, the company will expand the scope of its activity, strengthening survey functions and going after orders from external sources, in addition to the management of various types of ownership. A target set for the first year is an annual turnover of ¥200 million. The amount of capital invested in the new company is ¥10 million. Mr. Giichi Yamaguchi, the former patent division chief, has assumed the position of president. The staff consists of 13 members, most of whom have been transferred from either the former patent division or the research institute. The new intellectual property division is staffed by approximately 20 employees. In the past, it was the patent division which primarily had handled the management of manufacturing and mining proprietary rights at Mitsubishi Materials Corp. However, as workloads in the area of information gathering and analysis had increased and, moreover, as the company had realized that technologies which it had accumulated in the broad business areas of metallic and non-metallic materials, machine tools, and cement would be marketable, the company decided to establish a new firm with an eye on consulting business as a part of the new venture. In the beginning, the new company will provide service only to the head office's intellectual property division and the various firms belonging to the Mitsubishi group. In the future, however, the company will go after business from outside firms by offering consulting, technical training, and engineering development services in industrial proprietary rights, such as patents, utility models, and new designs.
