He urged people to take a serious view of the situation. He said: The Helsinki Accords established the inviolability of borders fixed after World War II. There is an agreement between Russia and Ukraine reaffirming the inviolability of the two countries' borders. Finally, a trilateral agreement on nuclear arms elimination containing the same stipulations was signed in Moscow between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. Ukraine received guarantees not only from the United States, but also from European states, the Crimean parliament speaker stressed. Only a naive person can think that Russia will risk violating these agreements, Mykola Bahrov said.
