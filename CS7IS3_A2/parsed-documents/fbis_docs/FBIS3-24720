Nelson Mandela talks about the obstacles that the new South African democracy encounters in its path: the white extremists and the black ones. He promises to practice an "open-door policy" toward the international community, without "tyrannizing" investors. Pre-election opinion polls give the ANC 60 percent of the votes. [Emiliani] Mr. Chairman, apartheid in South Africa is officially dead. The blacks have finally gained admission to the transitional government whose task is to organize the first free general election, to be held on 27 April. And yet the enemies of peace and democracy in the country seem to be multiplying. Who are the die-hards? [Mandela] The toughest opposition to the transitional government currently comes from Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party and some of its fellow members of the Freedom Alliance. They sit at the negotiating table with us and do nothing but pursue an "all or nothing" tactic. Inkatha above all does not favor mediation, whereas the ANC -- the African National Congress -- has made mediation the rule so that as many sides as possible may be involved in the negotiations and the greatest number of political demands can be taken into account. Believe me, we are doing all we can to stop Inkatha and the other parties in the Freedom Alliance from walking out of the negotiations, now and again going far beyond the limits that we had set, just to keep the negotiations open. [Emiliani] But the opposition in South Africa is now an armed opposition, and violence is spreading throughout the country. Which do you consider the more dangerous: the extremism of the whites, the hard-liners who want a return to apartheid, or that of the more radical black groups? [Mandela] The African National Congress has never refused to talk to the right-wing groups, Inkatha and the Afrikaner People's Front included. As far as we have been able to establish, some of the leaders of the Afrikaner People's Front are inclined to be reasonable and are perfectly aware how dangerous it is to threaten civil war at the drop of a hat. Our discussions with them have been fruitful, and we are understanding one another better. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same of our talks with Inkatha. At times we come out of the negotiations with Buthelezi's party with the distinct feeling that we have made not the slightest step forward in mutual understanding. Nevertheless, we shall continue talking with Inkatha in the hope of persuading them to take part in the negotiating process again, and above all in the election on 27 April. [Emiliani] So what point have the transitional government's negotiations with the parties forming the Freedom Alliance reached? [Mandela] As such, the transitional government, or rather the transitional executive council, is not negotiating with the Freedom Alliance. It is a structure conceived under the interim constitution to organize and monitor the election, an election that must be free and fair. The negotiations involve all the parties and organizations forming the transitional executive council, which have made some, albeit still inadequate, progress in the course of the negotiations. We are doing our best to speed things up, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go, issues on which we cannot compromise, such as the date of the election itself, which is set for 27 April. [Emiliani] What is the ANC in particular doing in this connection? [Mandela] The ANC's role in the negotiations is absolutely central. We are the guardians of the mediation process, and we are conducting it in the most all-inclusive manner, placing the interests of South Africa above any party interest. [Emiliani] The more radical black groups, too, are raising difficulties and rejecting the negotiations. How are relations between the ANC and the Pan-African Congress at the moment? [Mandela] We are both liberation movements. There are obviously differences between us, but we are working together as partners in the mediation process. We are pleased that the Pan-African Congress has decided to take part in the 27 April election. [Emiliani] And what about relations between the ANC and AZAPO, the Azanian People's Organization? [Mandela] Our relations with AZAPO, too, take account of the fact that we are both organizations working for the liberation of the oppressed black people of South Africa. However, we are different organizations, and the ANC is exterting strong pressure on AZAPO to fight the election. However, the fact that it has decided to boycott it does not detract from its being an organization working for liberation. [Emiliani] According to the latest opinion polls, the ANC could win over 60 percent of the votes on 27 April. What is your economic program, what are your priorities once you are in government? [Mandela] The opinion polls and the meetings that we are holding all over South Africa so that people can inform the ANC of their needs all point to the most sensitive issues being unemployment, the housing shortage, lack of education, and inadequate healthcare provision. As a people's liberation movement, in other words a movement that sets out to meet the people's needs, these are also the ANC's priorities. [Emiliani] How have the business world and the international economic community, reacted to the transitional government? Are they showing confidence in South Africa? [Mandela] I hope with all my heart that they start to believe in South Africa again. Since the ANC's appeal to the United Nations to repeal sanctions, the response has been favorable, and the Johannesburg stock exchange has recently shown a considerable increase in the volume of trade. Some major international companies are still put off by the spread of violence, but I am confident that as soon as we manage to create a true democracy and take measures capable of putting an end to the violence, we shall be able to create the conditions required to attract further investment. [Emiliani] What sort of policy does the ANC intend to pursue toward foreign companies? [Mandela] An open-door policy that avoids "tyrannizing" investors. What I mean is that we believe foreign investments must not be penalized by over-restrictive currency regulations and that the best way to attract them to South Africa is to give companies a wider range of investment opportunities. We should also like to see investment directed increasingly toward our country's emerging black business class, which apartheid has kept on the sidelines for a long time. [Emiliani] One last question, Mr. Chairman. In your heart of hearts, to whom have you dedicated your Nobel peace prize, apart from the South African people? [Mandela] You are right in saying that the courageous, long- suffering South African people, deserves the Nobel peace prize. Apart from South Africa, I believe that the president of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, deserve it for the effort that they are making to bring peace to the Middle East.
