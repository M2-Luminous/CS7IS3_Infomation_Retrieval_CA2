FR941207-1-00006 FR941207-1-00002 (2) For airplanes that have accumulated 50,000 or more total flight cycles, but fewer than 60,000 total flight cycles, as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to the accumulation of 2,500 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD. (3) For airplanes that have accumulated 60,000 or more total flight cycles, but fewer than 70,000 total flight cycles as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to the accumulation of 1,500 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD. (4) For airplanes that have accumulated 70,000 or more total flight cycles as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to the accumulation of 500 flight cycles or within 90 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. (d) Repeat the inspections required by paragraph (c) of this AD as follows, until the optional terminating action described in paragraph (g) of this AD is accomplished: (1) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (c) or (d) of this AD, the airplane has accumulated 27,000 or more total flight cycles, but fewer than 50,000 total flight cycles: Perform the next inspection within 15,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 15,000 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 50,000 or more total flight cycles; then perform the inspections required by paragraph (d)(2) of this AD. (2) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (c) or (d) of this AD, the airplane had accumulated 50,000 or more total flight cycles, but fewer than 60,000 total flight cycles: Perform the next inspection within 7,500 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 7,500 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 60,000 or more total flight cycles; then perform the inspections required by paragraph (d)(3) of this AD. (3) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (c) or (d) of this AD, the airplane had accumulated 60,000 or more total flight cycles, but fewer than 70,000 total flight cycles: Perform the next inspection within 5,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 5,000 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 70,000 or more total flight cycles; then perform the inspections required by paragraph (b)(4) of this AD. (4) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (c) or (d) of this AD, the airplane had accumulated 70,000 or more total flight cycles: Perform the next inspection within 3,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles. (e) If any crack is found in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A during any inspection required by this AD, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. (f) If any crack is found in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727 during any inspection required by this AD, accomplish paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this AD, as applicable, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737&hyph;53A1166, dated June 30, 1994. (1) For any crack that extends from the forward edge of the chord or from the forward fastener hole, but that does not extend past the second fastener hole, accomplish either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(ii) of this AD. Thereafter, perform initial and repetitive inspections in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD. (i) Prior to further flight, install the time limited repair. Prior to the accumulation of 4,500 flight cycles or within 18 months, after accomplishing the time-limited repair, whichever occurs first, replace the outboard chord. Or (ii) Prior to further flight, replace the outboard chord. Note 4: Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737&hyph;53A1166 references Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;53&hyph;1088 as an additional source of service information for procedures to replace the chord. (2) For any crack that extends from the forward edge of the chord, or from the forward fastener hole, and that extends past the second fastener hole, prior to further flight, replace the outboard chord in accordance with the alert service bulletin. Thereafter, perform initial and repetitive inspections in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD. (g) Accomplishment of the following actions in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737&hyph;53A1166, dated June 30, 1994, constitutes terminating actions for the requirements of this AD: (1) For airplanes on which no crack is found: Install the preventative modification in accordance with the alert service bulletin. (2) For airplanes on which any crack is found: Prior to further flight, replace the outboard chords and install the preventative modification in accordance with the alert service bulletin. (h) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note 5: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (i) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on December 1, 1994. James V. Devany, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
