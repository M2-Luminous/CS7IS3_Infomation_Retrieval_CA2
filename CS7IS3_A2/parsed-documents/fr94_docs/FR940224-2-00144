FR940224-2-00144 FR940224-2-00092 Survey of Selected Foreign Financial Assets as of March 31, 1994 AGENCY: Departmental Offices, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Notice of reporting requirements and availability of survey forms and instructions. SUMMARY: By this Notice the Department of the Treasury is informing the public that it is conducting a mandatory survey of United States residents' ownership and/or custody of selected financial claims on foreigners other than long-term debt or equity securities. The purpose of this survey is to reassess the value of various classes of portfolio capital positions on foreigners as currently reported by United States persons under the Treasury International Capitol reporting system. The data will be used to ensure the quality and completeness of international financial statistics which are vital components used in determining the international investment position and in compiling the official balance of payments accounts of the United States. These data are also important in the formulation of the U.S. Government's international financial and monetary policies. The survey has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act under OMB Control No. 1505&hyph;0150. This survey has been designed to collect systematic and consistent information on selected classes of financial claims on foreigners owned by U.S. persons as of March 31, 1994, while holding the reporting requirements to a minimum. The survey's approach is to collect data from global custodians located in the United States to the extent possible. Data are requested only by type of instrument. Data are not required on individual claims and financial instruments, nor on the geographical distribution of such assets. The survey collects data on certain types of claims on foreigners owned by U.S. persons that represent portfolio investment. Reportable claims include deposits with foreign institutions, financial instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, and loans to foreigners. Excluded are direct investments, equity holdings, debt securities with an original maturity of more than one year, contingent claims, and off-balance sheet contracts, including unsettled spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, options, and warrants. More detailed information on the categories of claims and financial instruments to report is provided in the survey form and instructions. This Notice constitutes legal notification to all United States persons that they must respond to, and comply with, this survey if they are subject to the reporting requirements set forth below in Who Must Report. United States persons who are required to report but who do not receive a set of the ``Survey of Selected Foreign Financial Assets ``forms and instructions, should obtain copies by contacting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at (212) 720&hyph;8238, or the Department of the Treasury at (202) 622&hyph;2250. DATES: All United States persons who receive a set of survey forms and instructions or who are required to report as set forth in this Notice must submit reports, including those which indicate that the United States person is exempt from reporting requirements, by June 30, 1994.
