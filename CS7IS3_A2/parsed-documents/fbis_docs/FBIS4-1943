FBIS4-1943 "drchi065_s_94010" FBIS-CHI-94-065 Daily Report 15 Mar 1994 Northeast Region High-Tech Zone To Increase Agriculture in Jilin High-Tech Zone To Increase Agriculture in Jilin OW1503082394 Beijing XINHUA in English 0746 GMT 15 Mar 94 OW1503082394 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Changchun, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's Jilin Province, one of the country's major commodity grain producers, has built an agricultural high-tech development zone in a bid to boost its farm production. The newly-built zone, located southeast of the provincial capital city of Changchun, is an extension of the city's new and high-tech industry development zone, covering an area of 1,200 hectares. The province plans to turn the zone into an integrated center with agricultural high-tech development, experimentation, production, processing and marketing. According to a Changchun-based Agricultural University professor, the zone will enjoy all the relevant preferential policies formulated for the city's development zones and university-run enterprises. Future research and development of the new zone will focus on products including health food, fertilizers and veterinary medicines, additives, chemicals for controlling plant growth, and special foods. Also included are breeding of high-quality strains of vegetables, animals, flowers and trees, and planting of high-yield crops. A high-tech industry official said that the project has already attracted many investors from Japan, the Republic of Korea, Canada and the United States. So far, the zone has set up a ginseng company funded jointly by China and Canada, one biological product company financed by a Hong Kong firm and one Sino-American pets company, which are expected to go into operation soon. Jilin, rich in agricultural resources, is one of the biggest corn and ginseng producers in China, but the agricultural economic returns used to be small because of a disproportionate emphasis on grain output. To drive the development of fine-hybrid and high-yielding grain production, the province has established dozens of experimental farm zones over the past few years. It has also made great efforts to bring the role of its institutions of higher learning into full play. Located in the new zone, the Jilin Agricultural University has 72 teaching and research sections, about one hundred laboratories and six institutes specializing in modern farm technology. Other institutions involved in the drive are the Jilin Forestry Institute, Jilin Vegetable Research Institute and the Jilin Aquatic Products Research Institute.
