Alexander Downer, formerly shadow treasurer under the leadership of John Hewson, on Monday defeated his boss by a vote of 43 to 36 to become the new leader of the liberals. At a press conference in Canberra today, the 42-year-old Downer pledged a fresh start for the oppostion. "I pledge myself to do everything I can to restore hope and a bright future to Australia," he said. Downer's father was a minister under the late prime minister Richard Menzies. TECO Representative Francias Li said both Hewson and Downer are friendly to the ROC. They both visited Taiwan in March 1991 and were impressed by the progress they saw there, he said. Li said many of Downer's supporters either have visited Taiwan or are members of the Australia-Taiwan parliamentary group in Canberra. The group now has 86 members, next only to the Australia-U.S. parliamentary group in terms of participation. Li said the election of Downer to head the Liberal Party was a positive occurrence for the ROC. "I believe our relations with the opposition will further improve," he said.
