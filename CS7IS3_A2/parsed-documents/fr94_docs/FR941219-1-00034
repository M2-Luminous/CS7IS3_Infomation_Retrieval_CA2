FR941219-1-00034 FR941219-1-00015 Under today's proposal, the phrase ``shall not .␣.␣. permanently change in external configuration or dimensions'' throughout the test is intended to serve the same purpose as the NGV2 ``no distortion'' criterion. Thus, if there were a slight bulge in one location or if there were a change in the container's volume by even one tenth of one percent, the container would be considered to be distorted. A pass/fail gauge could be adjusted to fit the container before the test, and then used again after the test to verify that a container's dimensions had not changed. NHTSA requests comments about this ``zero distortion'' requirement, and whether some amount of distortion should be allowed. If so, how should the permissible amount of distortion be quantified and measured? The agency also invites comments on how the no distortion criterion might otherwise be objectively expressed. In addition, the agency requests comments on whether there are other terms, such as fiber delamination, which should be incorporated and how they could be objectively defined. As an alternative, NHTSA is considering a no leakage criterion as the sole pass/failure performance requirement. However, under this alternative, the agency would increase the two sets of 5,000 cycles to 9,000 cycles each. Thus, the standard would specify a total of 18,000 cycles instead of the 10,000 cycles currently specified in NGV2. The agency tentatively concludes that the additional cycles would be necessary since this alternative proposal would otherwise be less stringent than NGV2 which contains additional criteria to disqualify substandard containers, i.e., distortion, deterioration, and failure. The agency further notes that 18,000 cycles is consistent with the ambient pressure cycling in NGV2 and in FMVSS No. 304. That cycling represents severe service, i.e., four refuelings per day, 300 days per year for 15 years. The agency requests comments on this alternative, and on other approaches that might be more appropriate. In addition, the agency requests that commenters suggesting other approaches include measurable pass/fail performance criteria and a proposed test procedure. Section S8.5 sets forth the procedures and conditions for the environmental cycling test. As with the proposed performance requirements, these provisions are modeled after NGV2. The agency has tentatively adopted modified versions of certain provisions in order to be consistent with the criteria that are within the agency's authority. NGV2 further specifies that during the environmental cycling test the container is pressurized ``using natural gas or methane.'' This is part of the test's preconditioning phase in which a corrosive material is introduced inside the container to determine its corrosion resistance. The agency is proposing that only automotive grade natural gas be used in the environmental cycling test. The agency believes that specifying only one test gas would make the test more repeatable for enforcement purposes. Further, although the major constituent of natural gas is methane, natural gas does contain other minor constituents which could make the test performed with natural gas more severe than if only pure methane were used. Therefore, the use of natural gas would represent a more severe scenario that is closer to real world use. NHTSA requests comment on the appropriateness of using only natural gas in the environmental cycling test, rather than specifying both fuels. NHTSA has decided to propose language addressing the use of protective coatings that it believes is consistent with NGV2. Specifically, S8.5.2 states that ``A CNG fuel container free of any protective coating '' is cycle tested in a specified manner. The agency believes that the phrase ``free of any protective coating'' refers to temporary coatings such as oil and grease, so as not to inhibit action from the corrosive materials during subsequent testing. The agency further believes that it would be inappropriate for the agency to preclude permanent coatings such as paint or other materials, since this would discourage manufacturers from applying permanent coatings that increase corrosion resistance. The agency requests comments on how best to describe this concept. An alternative to the proposal to specify ``free of any protective coating,'' would be to specify ``The container shall be in the as manufactured condition.''
