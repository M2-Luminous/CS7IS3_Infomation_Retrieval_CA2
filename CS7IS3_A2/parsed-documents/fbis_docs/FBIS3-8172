Asked about the Serbian mass media threats to arrest him, Rugova answered: I carry out my job and I am here. For more details, let us follow reporter Sherif Konjufca: [Konjufca] The raids and arrests of Albanian citizens by the Serbian police are being accompanied with the brutal demolition of houses and the destruction of their properties. Mr. Rugova said that, during last week, Selman Daci was killed at the Hani i Elezit border point for no reason. The trumped-up trials against Albanians continued in Peje and other cities in Kosova. On the other hand, movements of the Serbian Army have been observed in many areas in Kosova, particularly at the border area with Albania. Police formations are continuing to be stationed in many areas, such as in the factory of [word indistinct] near Kacanik, the Prishtina-Podujeve road, Komoran, and other localities. After the closure of the academy, the Serbian authorities have decided to close the Albanological Institute, which is an institution that bears a symbol of the national identity of Albanians. Unlike the first closure of the institute in 1957, this time the institute will continue its work just like the other scientific, cultural, and state institutions in Kosova, despite whatever will happen with its building. Mr. Rugova said that we, once again, warn the Serbian regime and its exponents installed in Kosova of the consequences of all these provocations against the Albanian population in Kosova. On this occasion, Mr. Rugova greeted NATO's intervention in the Bosnian sky, the Bosnian-Croat agreement, and the statement by U.S. Secretary of State Christopher that all the problems in the former Yugoslavia will be resolved by the United States and Europe without bloodshed. This gives us hope that the problem of Kosova, too, will be solved by placing its territory under UN protection. Answering a question about the possibility of intervention by an external factor, particularly Albania, in the case of war or a Serbian massacre in Kosova, President Rugova answered: We have worked to avoid conflict in Kosova. However, Albania, which is concerned about the fate of its fellow nationals in Kosova, is also not interested in a conflict. Today, the whole world knows the catastrophic consequences that such a conflict may bring to the whole region. Regarding a journalist's appeal to comment on the threats of the press and several Serbian party leaders to havre him arrested, Mr. Rugova answered briefly: We are all threatened, but I carry out my job and I am here. Meanwhile, responding to the possibility of Albanian-Serbian dialogue, Mr. Rugova said: We have said that we favor dialogue, but the Serbian side does not give such signs. First, repression should be stopped and an appropriate atmosphere for talks be created. The talks should be held in the presence of an international mediator. For the moment, the Serbian regime has erected a mental blockade and cannot find courage to do that, Mr. Rugova said at the end of his meeting with reporters.
