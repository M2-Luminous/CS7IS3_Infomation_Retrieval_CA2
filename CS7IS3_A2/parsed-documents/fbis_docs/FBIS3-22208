Comparative Analysis of the Ecology Sections of Party and Block Electoral Platforms''] [Text] It often happened before that deputies elected to the agencies of state power on the basis of ecological slogans soon forgot about them. Today the situation must change, since now the responsibility for fulfilling such promises is borne by a specific political party or association, which in the not too distant future will once again have to turn to the voters for support in the next elections. Our task is not to allow the politicians to forget their ecological promises. Therefore, it is rather important specifically now to recall and analyze the ecology sections of the pre-election platforms. In the programs of the ``Future of Russia--New Names'' block, the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and the Communist Party of Russia, sections on ecological policy or program proposals on the resolution of ecological problems have been absent altogether. The programs of the ``Women of Russia'' movement and the ``Dignity and Charity'' block contained only a few fragmentary statements of the most general nature. The most complete representation of Russia's ecological problems appears in the programs of the constructive-ecological movement ``Kedr,'' ``Choice of Russia'' and the ``Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin'' block (``Yabloko''). By its broadness of scope in encompassing political problems in the sphere of ecology, ``Kedr,'' is, of course, in first place. Second is ``Choice of Russia,'' third--the ``Party for Russian Unity and Accord'' (PRES), and fourth--``Yabloko.'' In terms of the depth of economic development of ecological problems, the priority undoubtedly goes to PRES, while the other three places are shared by ``Choice of Russia,'' ``Yabloko'' and ``Kedr.'' In terms of the detailed nature of development of specific problems presented in the pre-election platforms, the leaders are ``Choice of Russia,'' ``Kedr'' and the Agrarian Party of Russia. We must say that the problem of the economic mechanism of regulating the activity of ecologically hazardous industries and natural resource utilization has gained greatest recognition among this group of political parties and movements. Five parties and movements have included some kind of declaration to this effect in their platforms. Four parties and movements have included demands on compensation of ecological loss and rational utilization of nonrenewable natural resources in their platforms. Three parties have declared the need for tightening procedures for ecological expert analysis of all projects, programs and decisions by agencies of state power and administration, and three parties have a program of first priority measures in the field of ecology. On the whole, however, analysis shows that none of those who aspire to the State Duma of Russia from the all-federal electoral district have presented a sufficiently comprehensive program for the ecological revitalization of Russia. Even if we put together all the announced positions, all the questions of ecology raised in all the pre-election platforms, they would still not reflect in full measure the ecological problems facing Russia. We get the impression that the ecological sections of all the parties and movements were hastily written and weakly developed. I must conclude with disappointment that the deputies who have gained membership in the State Duma according to the party lists will not be able to provide objective and in-depth solutions to the ecological problems facing the country. We may only hope that the deputies coming to the State Duma from regions for which the state of the environment is not a purely theoretical question, but a most vital one, will be able to correct the legislative activity of the parliament in the sphere of ecology. An analysis of the presence of ecologists among the candidates for deputy in the State Duma presented by party lists also allows us to make certain curious observations. We will note that under such an analysis, ecologists were considered to be not only those candidates who actually called themselves ecologists, but also biologists, glaciologists, and specialists having a higher education in the field of natural sciences. With such a broad approach, it turned out that, within the voting list of ``Kedr,'' 45 percent of the candidates for deputy could be called ecologists. However, unfortunately this movement found itself outside the bounds of the State Duma. Second in the number of ecologists was the ``Dignity and Charity'' movement, with almost 14 percent. But, alas, it too was unable to bring its representatives to parliament. In third place was ``Yabloko,'' with almost 6 percent of the candidates for deputy who could be called ecologists. In the ``Women of Russia'' movement, 5 percent of the candidates for deputy could be called ecologists, in ``Choice of Russia''--4 percent, in the RDDR [Russian Movement for Democratic Reform]--3 percent, in the PRES--2 percent, in the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]--1 percent, and among the agrarians and the LDPR--less than one percent. In last place were the communists, whose electoral list did not contain a single person who could be called an ecologist. A comparison of these data with the analysis of the pre-election platforms of the parties and movements allows us to draw certain conclusions. As we have already stated, ``Kedr,'' ``Choice of Russia,'' and PRES had more or less well-developed ecological programs. However, by the number of ecologists presented in the electoral lists, PRES is only in eighth place, while ``Choice of Russia'' is in fifth place. Thus, despite the notable presence of ecologists in the other electoral blocks, this did not sufficiently influence the development of ecological problems in the pre-election programs of the blocks. This may indicate either a random selection of candidates for deputy, or an insufficient participation of these candidates for deputy in the preparation of the pre-election platforms of their parties and movements.
