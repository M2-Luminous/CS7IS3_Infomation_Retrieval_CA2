This laser diode and detector, which can be provided with multimode and single-mode fiber optic connector modules having international-standard interfaces, are ideal for long-wavelength fiber optic trunk lines, LANs, fiber optic microwave subcarrier-wave (SCM), fiber optic cable TV, convergent-control radar signal fiber optic distributors, and many other applications. For interested manufacturers, investment costs to build a production line with an annual output of 100,000 laser diodes and detectors is about 30 million yuan, and annual output value is about 100 million yuan.
