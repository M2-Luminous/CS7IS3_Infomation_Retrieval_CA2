And now this process has reached summit level. Kazakhstan Republic President Nursultan Nazarbayev has arrived in Moscow on an official visit. What can we expect from his meeting with the Russian president? What interstate agreements do we hope will be signed? One of the main points of the talks is linked with the fate of the Baykonur space center, which has very recently become a bone of contention between Russia and Kazakhstan. As is known, the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry attempted to "close" the matter through talks at their level. And a great deal was done during the preparatory period. But a definitive solution to the question was only found when the presidents met. Why? It has turned out that recently relations between the two republics have not been developing in the best of ways. Or rather, not in the way people would like. Let us recall the differences of view over a unified ruble zone; the future operation of the Russian missile early warning station at Balkhash; Baykonur, which we have already mentioned.... On the one hand these contradictions are explicable. Kazakhstan is seeking to play a role in the world arena which is more autonomous and independent of Russia. And it has declared everything located on its territory to be its own property. But in terms of the Baykonur space center, let us recall that its status was defined by an intergovernmental agreement of 2 October 1992. At that time Russia, in the shape of the Defense Ministry and the Russian Space Agency, committed itself to provide 94 percent of the funding of Baykonur and Leninsk. In 1993 the Russian Federation spent 47 billion rubles on keeping these two facilities going. At a time when the Kazakhstan side was unable to ensure full and prompt payment of the other 6 percent. Today it is thanks to the Russian Military-Space Forces that the social sphere operates and spacecraft are launched. The world famous space facility is financially maintained by Russia. But do you want to know something interesting? While Russia was maintaining Baykonur, Kazakhstan was holding talks on how either the United States or Ukraine might be enticed to lease it. It was no coincidence that Alma-Ata [Almaty] started by saying that the 1992 agreement did not match Kazakhstan's interests. And then came the idea of creating a Baykonur-based international consortium in which no provision was made for advantages for Russia not only vis-a-vis the former republics of the USSR but even in terms of other space powers headed by the United States. Furthermore, according to an ITAR-TASS report, some kind of agreement on the joint use of Baykonur was signed during Nazarbayev's visit to the United States. Although the details are not being made public, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's recent visit to Alma-Ata and Baykonur indirectly confirmed the two sides' definite joint interest. As for Russia, it -- and others -- was eventually offered a lease on the space center, but on what were in fact unacceptable terms. In terms of both cost -- billions of dollars -- and the length of the lease. And although the positions of the sides changed several times in the course of the preliminary talks, a compromise on the main issue was not found until the last moment. Nevertheless Russia, as we were told at the press center of the Russian Federation Military-Space Forces, whose representatives have participated in the talks process at various times, is still ready to lease the Baykonur space center. But not on just any terms. It is no surprise that as a result of the uncertainty which has been generated this unique ground complex with a developed infrastructure has found itself without an owner and is now in a sorry state. Some of the launch equipment is unusable, some things have simply been stolen. Lower-story apartment windows gape blindly.... Nevertheless there has recently been perceptible movement in the Russian and Kazakhstani positions, facilitated by an active process of negotiation -- visits by a Russian Federation delegation to Kazakhstan and by a Kazakhstan delegation to Moscow. Nor is it possible to disregard the fact that the Baykonur problem comes into the context of the military-political and military cooperation treaty between Russia and Kazakhstan which is being prepared for signing. In the course of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Kazakhstan mutual understanding was reached on Russia's utilization of some Baykonur facilities to implement defense-space programs taking account of Kazakhstan's interests. Including long-term programs, some of which are tied in to Russian accords with foreign countries and are geared to the utilization of precisely Baykonur. The mid-march return visit to Moscow by a Kazakhstan state delegation headed by Premier Sergey Tereshchenko was also devoted to seeking compromise. On this occasion talks were held with members of Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet. The discussions covered military and military-technical cooperation. the utilization of the Baykonur space center, the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, and the deepening of relations in the field of the economy, science, culture, and law. That is, the precise questions which are scheduled for signing [as published] by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev and which figure on the agenda for the planned meeting. As for nuclear energy problems, the technological situation at the Mangistauskiy power plant in Kazakhstan is now extremely unfavorable: Nuclear scientists consider that keeping the BN-350 reactor at a safe level is problematical. Repair work and preventive maintenance have been cut back at this, Kazakhstan's only nuclear power station. And the republic cannot manage without Russia's help here, or in the future operation of Baykonur, or in the building of a Kazakhstan petroleum pipeline to the port of Novorossiysk, or on the implementation of many other projects. So Kazakhstan and Russia have a mutual interest in considered and mutually advantageous solutions in these areas. And likewise, incidentally, in the matter of creating a unified customs area, a free trade zone, an interstate bank.... And ultimately, maybe, in creating an economic union. As this edition of the newspaper was being signed to press the final results of the meeting between the Russian and Kazakhstani presidents were still not known. It will take time to study and analyze the documents that have been signed.
