The two reached the accord at a dinner party hosted by Mondale and his wife, Joan, at the U.S. envoy's official residence in central Tokyo, Hosokawa told reporters. Hosokawa's wife, Kayoko, also attended. Mondale reportedly voiced regret over Hosokawa's decision to resign due to the Diet paralysis on the fiscal 1994 budget, which was spawned by allegations of his financial improprieties. Mondale also called on Hosokawa to continue working with him after his resignation to further promote bilateral relations, the premier said. Hosokawa, 56, who suddenly offered to step down last week, will remain on board until his successor is chosen. Friday night's dinner party followed an earlier invitation from Hosokawa asking the Mondales to his official residence.
