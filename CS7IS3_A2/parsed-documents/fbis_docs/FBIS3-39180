Haavisto described the EU's position as a disappointment and regretted the fact that the EU negotiators do not have greater knowledge of Finland's circumstances. "We are disappointed with the way in which the EU is negotiating. There is no united and effective leadership in the negotiations. Too many different EU bodies are involved, and the Greek presidency is colored by the fact that Greece only took over the position at the beginning of the year," Heikki Haavisto said in an interview with FINSKA NOTISBYRAN's correspondent in Copenhagen. According to Haavisto, the EU negotiators do not know enough about conditions in Finland. It is difficult therefore to convince them that Finland needs special agricultural and regional support. He regretted the tough line that the EU countries adopted on Tuesday [8 February] on agricultural and regional policy. According to Haavisto, Finland cannot accept the EU's no to special and permanent support for Finnish agriculture. However, Haavisto pointed out that the negotiations are still being conducted chiefly at civil servant level, and that the 12 EU countries' leaders, who are expected to involve themselves in the final phase of negotiations, have all expressed great interest that the EU should admit the other current applicant nations as members. Yesterday Haavisto was on a one-day visit to Copenhagen to discuss the Finnish position in the EU negotiations with Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen and Danish Agriculture Minister Bjorn Westh. Haavisto described the meetings as "extremely positive." The two foreign ministers also discussed relations with Russia, the Baltic region, and NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace. According to Haavisto, Finland and Denmark have largely concordant views on these questions. Yesterday, Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen was much more restrained in his comments on the situation in the EU negotiations than was Foreign Minister Haavisto. Salolainen stressed that the real negotiations are only just beginning -- so far it has chiefly been a case of an exchange of positions. Decisions will not be arrived at before the decisive political negotiations at the end of this month. The negotiations will be conducted at ministerial level on 21-22 February and again on 25-28 February. On 25 February the Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish prime ministers will meet in Helsinki to ponder the situation prior to the decisive bout of arm wrestling. However, Salolainen also regretted the fact that the political goodwill that the Finnish side has been able to note in recent high-level political contacts has still failed to find an expression in the positions the EU has adopted in the negotiations proper. He expects that both sides will be forced to display "wise flexibility" in the decisive phase of the negotiations. It will be impossible to have the Finnish demands accepted 100 percent, but there have to be better offers from the EU if there is to be an acceptable result from the negotiations.
