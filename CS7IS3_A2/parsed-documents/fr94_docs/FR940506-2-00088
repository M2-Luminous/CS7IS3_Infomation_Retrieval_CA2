FR940506-2-00088 FR940506-2-00054 [Docket No. 94M&hyph;0129] Pace Medical, Inc.; Premarket Approval of the Model 4553 MICRO&hyph;PACE TM Dual-Chamber, DDD, Temporary Cardiac Pacemaker AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by Pace Medical, Inc., Waltham, MA, for premarket approval, under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), of the Model 4553 MICRO&hyph;PACE TM Dual-Chamber, DDD, Temporary Cardiac Pacemaker (Model 4553 MICRO&hyph;PACE TM ). FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant, by letter of March 10, 1994, of the approval of the application. DATES: Petitions for administrative review by June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written requests for copies of the summary of safety and effectiveness data and petitions for administrative review to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Cheng, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;450), Food and Drug Administration, 1390 Piccard Dr., Rockville, MD 20850, 301&hyph;594&hyph;2720. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 30, 1992, Pace Medical, Inc., Waltham, MA 02154, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket approval of the Model 4553 MICRO&hyph;PACE TM . The device is a temporary external pulse generator and is indicated for use in any clinical situation in which the use of a temporary pacemaker on a patient provides therapeutic or diagnostic value or serves a prophylactic purpose. Indications for the use of temporary cardiac pacemakers include, but are not limited to, the following: Intermittent or complete heart block associated with asystole or bradycardia, symptomatic sinus bradycardia, surgically induced heart block, and heart block accompanying an acute myocardial infarction. Additionally, temporary cardiac pacing has been used to overdrive, and thereby terminate, atrial arrhythmias, including atrial flutter. It has been used in preparation for permanent pacemaker implantation to ascertain the thresholds for sensing and pacing on the acute lead system. Although the intended uses of the Model 4553 MICRO&hyph;PACE TM are primarily therapeutic and prophylactic, the ability to extensively program both the amplitude of the constant voltage output and the pulse width in the Model 4553 MICRO&hyph;PACE TM does make it, when necessary, a satisfactory alternative to a properly functioning pacing system analyzer for the thresholds for sensing and stimulation. In accordance with the provisions of section 515(f)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(f)(2)) as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629), this premarket approval application (PMA) was not referred to the Circulatory System Devices Panel, an FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On March 10, 1994, CDRH approved the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH. A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Opportunity for Administrative Review Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section 515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)), for administrative review of CDRH's decision to approve this application. A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts. A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under ยง10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the Federal Register . If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details. Petitioners may, at any time on or before June 6, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) two copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h))) and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 5.53). Dated: April 20, 1994. Joseph A. Levitt, Deputy Director for Regulations Policy, Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
