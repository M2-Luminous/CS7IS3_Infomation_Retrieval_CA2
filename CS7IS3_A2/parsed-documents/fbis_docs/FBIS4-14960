The AES' significance in the republic's life is so great that the agreement has both political and even psychological and moral repercussions. It will be a while -- at least a year -- before the power station comes on stream, but this represents both a real deadline and a real hope, which will make it possible to withstand yet another dark and cold blockade winter. [passage omitted] A visiting session of the republic government was held at the Armenian AES recently. Opening it, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan spoke highly of the agreement signed by the Russian Federation Government. The political and technical problems have been solved, he said. Work is now underway on settling the financial problems. After demothballing, the power station will be producing 400 megawatts of electricity, which will make it possible to meet the republic's minimum requirements and escape the damage caused by the blockade. The Sevan River, whose water resources are currently being overexploited, will be saved from silting up. As for the power station's safety, this is one of the main points of the Russian-Armenian agreement. Furthermore, for months now a group of experts representing various countries and international organizations has been studying the situation at the AES. They also think that the station can be commissioned if a number of measures are taken. The president described the opening of the station as a priority task, and the decisions which have been adopted show that these are not just words -- the government is serious about this. In order to insure an inflow of skilled personnel, wages 20 times above the minimum wage in the republic are being set for the power station's workers. This is much more than the highest-ranking state officials get. Provision has been made for large sums to provide free food for the workers. Repairs to the AES' rest home will be completed this year. So the first steps have been taken. Yet reactions to the demothballing of the AES have been far from unequivocal. The United States makes no secret of its negative attitude, and Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Georgia are sharply opposed to the nuclear power station resuming operation. But for all this Turkey and Azerbaijan are not prepared to lift the blockade, and Georgia is still incapable of ensuring the protection of the gas pipeline and the railroad. Admittedly the United States has allocated in the form of aid a large consignment of kerosene, which is being distributed among the socially vulnerable strata of the population. But this humane act cannot influence the situation in the economy. Neighbors' views have to be taken into account as far as possible, of course. But this desire must be mutual. Moreover, some countries' attitude betrays not so much ecological worries as concern of a strictly political nature. The Armenian and Russian sides spent a long time working on the draft and, one assumes, also gave careful consideration to the possible international reaction to the opening of the AES. And there is one other curious detail. Commenting on the agreement, observers -- manifestly without collusion -- have concluded that Russia is coming back. This sounds somewhat strange, particularly in Armenia, which Russia has never seriously left. Its troops are stationed here and its border guards protect the border. Not so long ago a document was signed under which there will be twice-yearly drafts in Armenia of young people for service in the Russian Border Troops. The whole point, probably, is that the troops can be moved in or out in a short space of time. But the demothballing and joint operation of the AES is a matter calculated for decades ahead, and the agreement once again confirms the seriousness of Russia's intentions. At the time, the closure of the AES coincided with the start of destructive processes in the economy. Might its demothballing mark the beginning of the restoration of destroyed ties, of a destroyed economy? It would be nice to believe so.
