FR940505-0-00083 FR940505-0-00024 It has been determined that this rule is not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. This action allows the AA to establish a registration program as authorized by the final rule (57 FR 57348, December 4, 1992), codified at 50 CFR 227.72(e)(6)(iv). Such a program contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), namely, registration by vessels fishing in the leatherback conservation zone from Cape Canaveral, FL, to the Virginia-North Carolina border. This collection has been approved by OMB under control number 0648&hyph;0267. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 7 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, should be sent to NMFS and OMB (see ADDRESSES ). Pursuant to section 553(b)(B) of the APA, the AA finds that there is good cause to take this action without notice and opportunity for comment. It is impracticable and contrary to the public interest because relatively high levels of leatherback turtle abundance have been reported recently in Florida, and closures and/or restrictions may need to be imposed quickly. The action announced by this notice is needed at this time so that shrimp trawlers will monitor NOAA weather radio and prepare for closures and/or restrictions in specific areas where relatively high leatherback sea turtle concentrations are identified. Furthermore, comments were solicited on the temporary rule establishing a leatherback conservation zone last year (58 FR 28790, May 17, 1993). In addition, comments were solicited on potential leatherback conservation measures (57 FR 57348, December 4, 1992), and a summary of the comments received and a response was published (57 FR 40859, September 8, 1992). NMFS also solicited comments in meetings with fishing groups and state officials concerning this problem. Pursuant to section 553(d) of the APA, the AA finds there is good cause to waive the required 30-day delay in effective date for this action. Advance preparation is not necessary to monitor the NOAA weather radio. While time may be needed to procure a Taylor TED or make the appropriate modifications to the Morrison TED, restricted areas will be relatively small in size and shrimp trawlers should be able to operate in other areas with existing gear. The AA prepared an EA for the final rule (57 FR 57348, December 4, 1992). A supplemental EA prepared specifically for this action concludes that, with specified mitigation measures, this action will have no significant impact on the human environment.
