Lambeck report: "A German Is To Administer Mostar"] [Text] Bonn -- After a solid peace agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the FRG Government is planning to help rebuild and administer the city of Mostar. Bonn government circles confirmed such intentions to DIE WELT. Hans Koschnick, former Bremen mayor and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] politician, is to manage the reconstruction of Mostar on behalf of the European Union [EU]. He is to take over the office of administrator for the capital of Herzegovina. The FRG Government proposed this to the EU partners, the Foreign Ministry reported yesterday. The 12 have not yet made a decision. SPD foreign policy expert Karsten Voigt stated that Koschnick has already agreed to the proposal. In the Chancellor's Office it was stated that Koschnick is "an experienced politician," but a "personnel decision" has not yet been made in connection with the first plans for the Bosnian city. Moreover, it was learned from the Chancellor's Office that the whole Mostar project is "by no means settled yet." One is "in the first stages of planning." Nevertheless, it is regarded as certain that FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) wants an active German contribution to the reconstruction in Bosnia. It can only take place within the European framework and in close cooperation with the EU partners. No military mission whatsoever is envisaged. Only civilian help after the signing of a peace agreement is under consideration. In the planning phase, which is still going on, it is also discussed to send perhaps about 300 officers of the Federal Border Police as policemen to Mostar. However, there is still a controversy over this proposal. In government circles, one talks of "considerable objections." The fear of attacks by Serbian units is behind it. Moreover, the policemen would have to act as a force to maintain public order. This is problematic. However, the development work of German administrative experts who are to support the German administrator for Mostar -- who is to be appointed -- is regarded as unproblematic. The employment of the Technical Assistance Office in the reconstruction of the city is also possible. Moreover, the Federal Government wants to repair a hospital in Mostar with civilian personnel.
