One of the leaders, 'Adil 'Awad Siyam, was killed and his brother-in-law, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim Khalifah, was arrested. During an international press conference today, al-Alfi disclosed the schemes of that organization, which sought to terrorize the safe citizens and destabilize the country with the ultimate goal of striking at economic development in Egypt. The minister said that the security agencies seized an enormous amount of explosives, weapons, and ammunition in the hideout of these terrorists. Al-Alfi noted that nine hideouts of the terrorist group, which represents the military wing of the al-Jihad Organization, were stormed in several governorates at the same time and a large quantity of weapons and explosives were found. The operations were carried out in the presence of representatives from the Higher State Security Prosecution Office, experts from the criminal laboratory, and explosive experts. The three defendants, whose hiding places were stormed, were found in possession of 17,000 dollars, 3,000 pounds sterling, and 9,000 Egyptian pounds, he added. A number of firearms were also seized, including two automatic rifles, an Israeli-made Uzi submachine gun, six pistols, 17 magazines of automatic weapons, various types of pistols, 582 nine-mm bullets, three RPG projectiles, three silencers, and a large quantity of firing pins, he added. The interior minister added that searches conducted in the nine dens led to the seizure of 335 bombs of various types, explosives, quantities off sulphuric and nitric acids, ammonium nitrate, mercury, chlorine, and ammonium chloride. Approximately 150 kg of gelignite powder and another 150 kg of (?nitrate) powder, a highly explosive material, also were found in the terrorists' hideouts, in addition to a tricycle used as a trap, three wireless devices, a cordless telephone, and magnets used to attach explosives under vehicles. The interior minister said that the security services seized organizational papers and documents containing information about the security of the installations and people and the method of producing explosives and preparing deceptive traps. The security services also seized a list of names of targeted figures, various organizational plans, the code used by the organization, and receipts for the transfer of foreign currency from abroad. The interior minister explained that the security forces discovered in the possession of the captured terrorists a quantity of forged official papers, including military conscription cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates, passports, and identity cards as well as a large quantity of police and military uniforms and officers' ranks. The interior minister noted that the security services also seized various types of vehicles belonging to the organization, including vehicles used in operations that members of the organization have admitted they carried out. The interior minister said that the security services found a Yemeni passport belonging to the first accused, 'Adil 'Awad Siyam, commander of the organization's military wing, who was killed in the al-Munib area in al-Jizah in the past few days. During the international news conference, which was attended by more than 100 correspondents from Egyptian and Arab newspapers and Arab and foreign news agencies, the interior minister noted that because of the detective work carried out by various security services following the assassination of Sayyid Ahmad Abu-Yahya, the first witness in the case of Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, and the wounding of his friends who were with him during the attack, the State Security Investigations Department was able to uncover an extremely dangerous terrorist group commanded by 'Adil 'Awad Ahmad Mahmud Siyam, commander of the military wing of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt, who is considered one of the most dangerous terrorists to be found in recent years. The interior minister said that members of the State Security Investigations Department also monitored the movements of the second terrorist commander, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim Muhammad Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil. The interior minister added that the organization was made up of a large number of terrorists who were given sophisticated training, with the knowledge of the two mentioned commanders, in the arts of combat, marksmanship, and the manufacture of various types of explosives. He noted that the investigation confirmed that terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam assumed responsibility for this terrorist organization after his return to the country at the instructions of the central command of the terrorist al-Jihad organization abroad and after receiving advanced military training on the use of all types of weapons and the preparation, manufacture, and use of bombs and explosives. The interior minister added: In light of the investigations made by the State Security Investigations Department and after taking all legal measures, the movements of the organization were monitored on tape and by sound and accurate observations were intensified until the aforementioned terrorist was confirmed to be the link between the terrorist organization's elements in the country and its leaders abroad. He added that the investigations also confirmed that terrorist leader 'Adil 'Awad Siyam was in control and had such great influence on his group that he was convinced of the need to commit suicide when arrested to maintain the secrecy of the organization and its membership. He said that the investigations confirmed that this organization's members were experienced in criminal acts, high-risk operations, and vehicle theft and were using aliases and a secret code in their contacts and movements. He added that these terrorists used the slums and remote areas as centers for their activities, depots for their weapons and ammunitions, and lairs for hiding. Investigations also showed that the organization included a large number of cadres that were well prepared and that 30 of these terrorist organization's cadres were monitored. The interior minister then said: After asking for permission from the Higher State Prosecution Office and taking the necessary legal measures, antiterrorist units that are highly trained to combat terrorism and to undertake this type of confrontation were prepared and sent on time to arrest the organization's members and raid its lairs, which had been accurately monitored beforehand. He added that security action resulted in the death of the dangerous terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam immediately after he opened fire on the forces that chased him. He was in a Fiat 128 car with false license plates. The security forces opened fire and killed him. Another leading terrorist who was with him, Muhammad 'Abd-al- 'Alim Khalifah, was arrested. A quantity of uniforms similar to those used by the Armed Forces and the police were found in the car together with a pair of field glasses, a forged identity card, and 4,260 pounds. The interior minister said that the State Security Investigations Department arrested 30 members of the terrorist organization. He added that their names have not been made public because the investigation and their confessions indicate that other members are being chased and arrested. He said that the names of the other members of the terrorist organization will be announced in a detailed statement that the ministry will issue after the operations are completed. He added that the defendants gave detailed confessions on the terrorist operations they had carried out in the past, the most important of which was the assassination of citizen Ahmad Abu-Yahya on 4 February 1994, who was the primary witness in the failed attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. He said that the weapons used in that incident have been seized and noted that the results of the criminal laboratory's examinations confirmed the defendants' confessions. The vehicles used in that incident also were seized. He said that this organization also carried out the attempt to assassinate Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on 18 August 1993, which resulted in the death of terrorists Nazih Nushi Rashid and Diya'-al-Din Dawud. The defendants also confessed that they detonated the explosive device in the Shabab al-Jazirah Club on 13 July 1993, which targeted some of the state security officers who were at the club for physical training. Minister Musa noted that the defendants made detailed confessions on the assassination of 'Adil Anwar al-Sayyid, a dissident organization member, in front of his home in the Saray al-Qubbah area in Cairo on 3 July last year. In their confessions, the defendants stated that they had monitored and reconnoitered a number of public, political, executive, media, judicial, and military figures intending to assassinate them and thus create a media uproar meant to tarnish Egypt's reputation in the foreign media and shake the people's sense of security and stability. The interior minister added that for that purpose the organization members took all the necessary steps to blow up booby-trapped cars by remote control to cause the maximum degree of demolition during the execution of these operations. All defendants have been referred to the Higher State Security Prosecutor's Office to proceed with the investigations, he added. The minister described the uncovering of this major terrorist organization as one of the most successful security operations conducted by security men in their confrontation with the cowardly acts of terrorism carried out by a band of hired hands who seek to disrupt security and stability; harm innocent people such as the elderly, women, and children; and undermine the successful economic reforms. The interior minister stressed that the security men have the initiative in their confrontation with the forces of evil and darkness. He added that these forces have deviated from their religion and have pursued ways offensive to the noble Islamic religion either to gain false leadership or to earn a few dollars by the implementation of a tightly planned scheme that primarily seeks to harm Islam and the Muslims. He noted that the security agencies bear the brunt of confronting this malicious campaign launched by the modern day khawarij [members of a dissident Islamic sect that appeared in the 7th century]. He noted that the security strategy depends on broadening the circle of confrontation with all terrorist elements to frustrate their schemes, uproot them, and eliminate all the forces that stand behind them. Reviewing the recent security measures, the interior minister noted that since the beginning of the year 20 major terrorist operations have been aborted. These operations include a series of planned explosions and assassinations of public figures that would have harmed innocent people, he added. During the same period, he added, 43 terrorists were arrested and a number of others were killed during exchanges of fire with security men; this was out of a total number of 52 terrorists wanted in connection with these cases. He emphasized that the security agencies are capable of achieving the security and stability we all wish for, adding that the security forces are the shield of the people that safeguards the country with courage and boldness. He praised the close cooperation among the security agencies, the media, and the honest and courageous citizens who have supplied the security agencies with information out of their sense of loyalty. Thanks to this information, he added, this deviant band and their hideouts have been attacked. Responding to a question on whether the security services have obtained new information on the assassination of Major General Ra'uf Khayrat last Saturday night and whether those services have been penetrated, the interior minister said that the incident is still under investigation and action is being taken to identify the culprits. He stressed that when an incident takes places it does not mean that the security services have been penetrated but, on the contrary, it is the security services that have penetrated these fugitive terrorist groups and this has helped abort dozens of attempts. Replying to another question about the campaign and whether there is coordination between all the services in confronting terrorism, Hasan al-Alfi stressed that there is full coordination between all the services, especially between the security services and the media. Regarding the sources of these weapons and how the terrorists are getting them, the interior minister said that many of these weapons are surplus from former wars and others are being brought in across the borders. He stressed that there are strict measures to control the borders. In reply to a question on the success achieved by the state's security services and whether a period of calm is expected, the interior minister said that all things are possible. He noted that the confrontation of every terrorist group with this ferocity and vast financial resources and the security forces' vigilance and readiness to make sacrifices for the sake of Egypt's security and stability are bound to achieve positive results. On whether there is a link between the terrorist al-Jihad organization and the terrorist Vanguards of Conquest organization or whether the al-Jihad has more than one group, the interior minister stressed that the Vanguards of Conquest is one of al-Jihad's military groups. He noted that the Vanguards of Conquest is a branch of the terrorist al-Jihad organization. Regarding the leaders who have fled abroad, the interior minister stressed that there are intensive efforts and constant contacts at all levels to apprehend these leaders. But he refused to divulge the names of these countries or persons because progress has been made in this matter. He said: It is in the public interest not to mention any details about them until the time is right. In reply to the correspondents' questions, he explained that the terrorists began as a small group and then split into other groups. He noted that they have a single objective and took Islam as a cover, but that they are not Muslims. Responding to a question on whether there is a link between the Muslim Brotherhood and these extremist terrorist groups, the interior minister stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood is a propagator of religion only but that the terrorist groups are advocates of violence and assassinations. In response to a question on the possibility of a dialogue with these terrorist groups, the interior minister categorically denied that there is [words indistinct] and stressed that there is no dialogue with these terrorist groups. He asked: Dialogue with whom? A dialogue with killers and butchers? Does a state conduct a dialogue with killers and criminals? There is not a single country in the world that conducts a dialogue with killers and criminals who order the killing of innocent people with firearms and explosives. On another question about reports that the extremist groups are digging a tunnel under Salim Salih Street to be used for explosives to ambush and assassinate important figures, the interior minister said these reports are "irresponsible." He said that the Public Prosecution Office is investigating these reports and that everything will be announced when the investigation is completed. On the security services' success in eliminating 82 percent of the terrorists and whether the rest have a major role in terrorist operations, Minister al-Alfi stressed that the remaining minority is behind these terrorist actions and the sabotage.
