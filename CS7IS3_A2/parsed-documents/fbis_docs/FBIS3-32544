Corabastos (expansion unknown; involves supplies) reports that in January the price of 30 basic staples increased by between 0.5 and 204 percent. On 1 February, the DANE (National Administrative Department of Statistics) released a report on the cost of living for January showing a considerable increase in food prices, which could raise the cost of living index by as much as 3.5 percent. Meanwhile, Cesar de Hart Vengoechea, president of the Association of Colombian Farmers, said the consumer index was low because of the sacrifices of the farming sector and low profits. He said the opposite would be true with increased prices and farmers would be able to make a little profit. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 1 Feb 94 p 2B) During January, food and transportation prices increased the most and the consumer index increased 3.15 percent. This increase was .09 percent lower than the same period in 1993 when a 3.24 increase was recorded, which raises the government's hopes of meeting its goal of 19 percent inflation in 1994. DANE Director Rodolfo Uribe says the index was affected primarily because the price of vehicles, gasoline, parking lots fees, tires, etc. increased 9.23 percent. Prices in the health sector increased the most in areas like consultation, hospitalization, lab tests, and dental services. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 2 Feb 94 p 1, 1B)
