This was stated today at a news conference by the heads of the government's Economic Reform Center. According to them, inflation over the last couple of months has remained at a low level -- 8 percent. However, there are certain trends toward it increasing. The ruble has been losing its value at a slower rate than prices have been rising, and the average wage has moved closer -- calculated in foreign currency -- to $100. Meanwhile, according to the Economic Reform Center, there remains a considerable fall in output in the machine-building and fuel and power complex. The failure of enterprises to make payments are not too good, either. Their debts on wages remain high. However, according to Richard Yard, an economist from Britain, this type of nonpayment was reduced by 4 percent compared with April. Moreover, according to Yard, the overdue debts of enterprises are lower than the European average. The London economist noted that in the sphere of employment among the Russian population, as nowhere else in the world, the redistribution of the working people in production outstrips open unemployment. And the latter in our country increased by only 1 percent during the past 18 months. The most comforting news was given by Sergey Pavlenko, a spokesman for the Economic Reform Center. Among the population, faith in financial institutions has increased. The citizens' savings are growing not in hard currency, but in rubles.
