Japan is at a loss as to what is the effective way to deal with this new development. It is now important to face the situation calmly, and try to look for even one or two concrete, viable ways to straighten out Japan-U.S. economic relations before the meeting of leaders of the advanced nations (Naples Summit) in July. There are two aspects to U.S. President Bill Clinton's evaluation of the recent summit talks. First, he is disappointed that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was not able to override the bureaucrats. On the other hand, he also pins his hopes on further serious efforts by both leaders to deal with the problem. However, such hopes are not necessarily shared by officials who work closely with the President. People around him, including Congress, still work at cross purposes. Regarding the appreciation of the yen, while the President did talk about the "foreign exchange rate factor" at a news conference, there is no conclusive evidence that the Clinton administration is manipulating the exchange rate. It remains to be seen whether the U.S. Government will now engage in vigorous Japan bashing. We would like to make three suggestions to Prime Minister Hosokawa. It was right to say "no" to the U.S. demand for numerical targets. All U.S. scholars who have received the Nobel Prize for economics oppose numerical targets. However, we need alternative proposals on what to do with the huge trade surplus against the United States. In this regard, Japanese and U.S. negotiators were stuck on the issue of numerical targets at the framework talks. We need to come up with a comprehensive plan, and present this to the United States. Second, something should be done to normalize relations between the automobile industries in both countries. Fortunately, Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation, has been designated the next chairman of Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations]. The prime minister should support a private sector-led solution to restore the balance between the Japanese and U.S. automobile industries. This will probably take the form of mutual market participation through horizontal division of labor. There should be an unbiased way for both parties to make use of each other's marketing networks. Reaching a compromise on automobiles will enhance the sense of equality between Japan and the United States, and contribute to the solution of a considerable part of the trade imbalance issue. Third, in the multimedia sector, where the United States enjoys a significant edge, Japan should accept U.S. leadership. It will be much cheaper for Japan to just adopt U.S. technology. Then, Japan can devote time to improve on such technology to develop original technology for Asia. The point is, to work on the key issues of Japan-U.S. friction from a broad perspective. If we merely come up with trivial piecemeal measures, it will only serve to aggravate the distrust between Japan and the United States. The prime minister seems unable to attract talented advisers. Therefore, even if he is successful at coordination, there can be no new creative ideas. He should look for people who can come up with real ideas, and listen to their suggestions. While the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is good at discussing specific issues, recently, its ideas lack coherence. In the financial sector, Japan should also establish principles as soon as possible that will guarantee no discrimination in investments in Japan. In the insurance sector negotiations, the United States was distrustful of the Japanese negotiators. Japan is partly to blame for this. It is easy to criticize the United States; some say it acts like a spoiled brat. However, this will only put Japan in a difficult position. Even regarding the issue of the exchange rate, the dollar is strong against the European currencies. Japanese companies cannot afford to raise the price of their products even with the appreciation of the yen. Therefore, for the time being, a strong yen will not affect prices in the United States. The United States is taking advantage of Japan's weak point. However, there is no need to worry too much about the strong yen. The fact that there has been a reversal in the balance of power between Japan and the United States means the exchange rate will recover to a realistic level in due course.
