This was revealed by a poll Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] conducted on 22 April. It seems businessmen hold severe views about politicians. The poll was conducted from approximately 1,500 executives and managers from firms belonging to Keidanren; 37.2 percent of them responded. When asked "if bureaucrats will have more chances to display their abilities" because of the collapse of the long-lasting Liberal Democratic Party administration and other factors, 55.4 percent of the respondents answered "yes." As a reason for answering "yes," a managing director of a major supermarket said: "There are not many lawmakers who can claim the title of good politician; bureaucrats are more competent than politicians." A department chief of an information industry said: "It is easy for bureaucrats to take the leadership when there is confusion in political circles." This view was shared by many respondents. A question was asked "if politics should be given an advantage over bureaucratic organizations in personnel matters" to prevent bureaucrats from having their own way. Only 27.2 percent of the respondents agreed. According to an executive of a medical company, as a reason for opposing political intervention in the personnel affairs of bureaucratic organizations, some of the respondents said "it is a problem because ministers are replaced every several months, and it is questionable if politicians have adequate knowledge of or study enough about what they are required to know." Moreover, as areas where they expect the bureaucrats to fulfill their roles in the future, many of the respondents enumerated such areas as disaster prevention, protection of the global environment, and national security. Areas such as overall agricultural policy, monetary exchange control, and promotion of regional economic buildup were mentioned by only a few respondents.
