Office: Public and Indian Housing. Description of the Need for the Information and its Proposed Use: The purpose of this information collection is to have projects administered under the public housing, Indian housing, and Section 8 Certificate, Rental Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs submit certain data electronically to HUD in a HUD prescribed format. For housing agencies (HAs) that are not already automated or who determine that automation is not cost-effective, transmission of the data through the use of a service bureau is permitted.
