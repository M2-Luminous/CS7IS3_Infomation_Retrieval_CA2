The time of "dancing with the wolf" is no longer far away. If so, what impact will "the resumption of GATT membership" have on Shanghai's industries which account for 60 percent of Shanghai's GNP? The result of an authoritative study, conducted in Shanghai, of "the resumption of GATT membership" shows: that "the resumption of GATT membership" will have a strong impact on Shanghai's industries. The Group Studying the Impact of "the Resumption of GATT Membership" on Shanghai's "Industries and the Policy on Dealing With the Impact," composed of experts from the city's economic commission, foreign trade and economic relations commission, and customs administration and 12 industrial bureaus as well as other institutions, believes: From a long-term perspective, "the resumption of GATT membership" is beneficial to Shanghai's industries. However, its impact and disruptive effects will be very strong, and the intensity involved should arouse great attention from all sectors. According to an analysis of 286 major products produced by the 12 industrial bureaus, because of the effects of tariff reductions and the abolishing of import licenses, there will be disruptive effects and impacts on 72 percent of those products. The most severe disruptive effects will be on such products as the Sontana passenger car and computers and their peripheral equipments. There will be beneficial effects on the development of 80 products, mainly giving them price advantages. Also, according to an analysis of 1,074 state-owned enterprises which are supervised by the 12 industrial bureaus (corporations) and covered by the local budget, there will basically be no impact on 46.83 percent of the enterprises, and there will be impacts of different intensity on 29.42 percent of the enterprises; there will be very severe impacts on 9.86 percent of the enterprises, some of which will even close down as a result. Those enterprises are mainly concentrated in such industrial bureaus as the Light Industry, Textile, Medical Supply, No 2 Light Industry, and Instrument Bureaus. According to an investigation of 48 industries, "the resumption of GATT membership" will have beneficial effects on 23 percent of the industries including the diesel engine, light-industry machinery, metal-cutting machine tool, threaded steel, refractory materials, electric lighting equipment, small household electric appliance, and household hardware industries. There will be large adverse impacts on such industries as the automobile, radio and television, communication equipment, engineering machinery, bearing, stainless steel, refrigerating and air-conditioning equipment, wire, chemical fertilizer, electronic parts, automation instrument, clock and watch, household chemicals, paper-making, refrigerator, copper product, and aluminum product industries. Based on comprehensive and in-depth investigations, the authoritative study group reached its conclusion on the overall impact of "the resumption of GATT membership" on the industries: From an overall perspective, "the resumption of GATT membership" will be beneficial to Shanghai's industries. This mainly refers to the prospects that after "the resumption of GATT membership" a number of Shanghai's industries which are competitive can increase their exports; that there can also emerge a more extensive resource-allocation environment with regard to the provision of energy and raw materials which have all along been in short supply; and that it will also be possible to make stepped-up efforts to develop high- and new-technology and high value-added industries in the next few years by exploiting the provisions for protecting infant industries and the most-favored-nation treatment. Even more important, "the resumption of GATT membership" will stimulate Shanghai's industries to accelerate their becoming capable of meeting international standards with regard to product prices, operating mechanisms, technological standards, and industrial structure, thereby speeding up the movement of Shanghai's industries toward modernization. It is unavoidable that the high- and new-technology industries and priority-development industries will encounter severe challenges. Shanghai's high- and new-technology industries and priority-development industries started late, and are not yet in a situation characterized by economies of scale; some of them may die young. That long-range impacts and disruptive effects are more severe than near-term ones will become a fact. In the near term, Shanghai's labor-intensive products will retain some competitive advantages on the domestic and external markets; the patents on most imitation-based goods have already expired, and therefore such goods can continue to be produced; some high- and new-technology products will receive protection for a time, but once time is up there will be growing disruptive effects on those industries and their products. There will be a double disruptive impact on the basic parts, accessary, and raw materials industries. This is, on the one hand, because of the disruptive effects on them produced by the impact of "the resumption of GATT membership" on the main parts industries, and, on the other hand, because of the disruptive effects on them produced by the importation of parts, accessaries, and raw materials after "the resumption of GATT membership." Nevertheless, the intensity of the disruptive effects produced by "the resumption of GATT membership" will in the end change with the development of the market economy. This is the final conclusion presented by the report on that authoritative study, carried out in Shanghai, of "the resumption of GATT membership."
