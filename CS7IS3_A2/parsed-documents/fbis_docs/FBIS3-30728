He said that the Serbian side had a legitimate right to defend itself by all means. If we are attacked from the air, we would not suffer the strikes with our arms crossed, said Radovan Karadzic, who demanded a thorough investigation of the Sarajevo tragedy: [Begin Karadzic recording] The reaction of the [UN] secretary general and the entire international community to the tragic massacre in the Sarajevo market is precisely the way the Muslims expected it to be. Such a reaction particularly encourages the Muslims to repeat this massacre, which is not the first in a series of massacres that have occurred with the aim of compromising the Serbs. We fully understand the emotional side of all this. We are disgusted by this crime and condemn it most adamantly, calling resolutely for an international commission consisting of the experts from countries that are in no way interested in the outcome of the entire crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, the Russians, the Japanese, the Indians, and the Chinese, with one Muslim and one Serbian representative. We not only demand a ballistic analysis, we also demand a forensic analysis, that is to say, that an international and objective commission of forensic experts determines the reasons and the time of death of all these victims. Namely, we have had some indications that all in all this has been staged to disrupt the international community. Not merely this incident, but any further incidents must, in our opinion, be investigated thoroughly by an objective commission, which will naturally also comprise one Serb and one Muslim. Only in such a way will the international community not stumble in the dark in search of the culprit. Regarding the attack, even if the Muslim side is responsible for it, that is, if the UN firmly establishes that the Muslim side is responsible, it is perfectly clear to us that the Muslim side has done it, I do not know what good air strikes would do. I think that it is much better to have a commission and international pressure exerted on those who avoid a political solution and, on the eve of each conference, commit great crimes in order to sabotage the peace conference. We shall not make the political negotiations more difficult in any way. We are interested in accomplishing peace as soon as possible. We have had some indications so far that a bomb could have been thrown from a nearby building, that this bomb alone was not of 120-mm caliber, but was wrapped in a great quantity of plastic explosive and, as such, thrown from the 21 Decembar building nearby. Naturally, we must work further on the proof, and it would be the best if the expert group consisting of ballistics and forensic experts concentrates on an examination of the reasons and circumstances of this massacre, which we highly praise, be correctly informed. [sentence as heard] We shall do our best to inform them correctly of everything that is happening. The Serbian side has a legitimate right to defend itself by all means. If we are attacked from the air, we will defend ourselves by all means and would not tolerate strikes without defense. [end recording]
