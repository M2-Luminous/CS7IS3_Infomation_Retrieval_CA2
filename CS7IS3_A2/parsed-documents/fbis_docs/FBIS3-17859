He was born and brought up in Tbilisi. He graduated from the philosophy faculty of Tbilisi State University. He continued his studies as a postgraduate. He is a candidate of philosophical sciences. He has worked as a teacher in higher educational establishments in Tbilisi. At the request of our readers, as we promised, we propose to you an interview with this person. We leave you to supply any commentary. [Pitskhelauri]Your, as they say, alliance with Zhirinovskiy [leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR]) has alarmed the Georgian public. What we mean are the letters you sent to him. [Gagnidze] I did indeed send these letters to Zhirinovskiy. We stated that our party is the true opposition in Georgia today (as opposed to those "pseudo-oppositionists" who are motivated by personal interests and ambitions) and I addressed the LDPR leader as one opposition [leader] to another. Moreover, the welfare of Georgia and Russia forms the basis for all this. [Pitskhelauri]Until now, you have been known by a large part of society as an active comrade-in-arms of Zviad Gamsakhurdia.... [Gagnidze] I got involved in the national movement in 1989-90. I became an ally of Zviad Gamsakhurdia. At that time, I was getting my own articles published. Zviad told me in public: "You know how to write and you should use this to serve the national movement." The first articles that I had published were on political science; they concerned national will and national freedom. Later on, there was disagreement between myself and the president about cadres selection. The National Ideology Association was formed on 12 September 1991 and was transformed into a party exactly one year later. We are struggling for the restoration of national ideology. Our variant of state organization is national self-administration. This is quite separate from a presidential or parliamentary form of government and constitutional monarchy. National ideology is the only path toward the salvation of Georgia, and not only Georgia. After all, the idea of humanity forms the basis of our ideology. Following the overthrow of Zviad's government, national ideas were being cursed along with the president, which was a moral blow for us. I said then, and repeat now, that the government should have been replaced without recourse to bloodshed and barbaric methods. Second, we are, philosophically speaking, idealists. We have also developed the question of a national religion. Religion should express the natural qualities and potentialities of each nation and its soul. It will get rid of confrontation and unite all Georgians. [Pitskhelauri]If it is not a secret, what were your letters to Zhirinovskiy about? [Gagnidze] The first one expressed our attitude to the elections. We believe that Zhirinovskiy expressed the will of the Russian people and hence was victorious. Therefore, we decided to welcome this fact. I sent the first letter to Volf dze [son of Volf -- Zhirinovskiy] on 12 December. It turned out that, after the Russian elections, opposition parties in Georgia condemned the results. Some were forgetting that Zhirinovskiy had been elected by his own people and that we have no right to interfere in their choice. This led to my sending a personal letter of congratulations. The reason for the second letter concerned Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Our party believed that the ex-president could, under no circumstances, be buried in Groznyy. We decided to appeal to Zhirinovskiy, Butrus-Ghali, and Ilia II [Georgian patriarch], to intervene in some way, in accordance with the principles underlying the protection of human rights, so that the president could be buried in Mtatsminda [burial place in Tbilisi for eminent Georgians] or in the courtyard of the Kolkhuri tower. The next letter concerned the treaty signed between Georgia and Russia. The Russian Duma refused to ratify it. We appealed to Russia's national forces not to oppose the signing of this treaty. I don't know who should take the credit for this but this process was stopped. Another point of contact with Zhirinovskiy was the political amnesty. We welcomed the fact that the political prisoners Khasbulatov and Rutskoy had been released from Lefortovo prison. That was all. So, there is nothing to fear and condemn regarding what we did. [passage omitted] [Pitskhelauri]Zbigniew Brzezhinski also pointed out that chauvinism could grow into fascism and this was easier to envisage following Zhirinovskiy's appearance on the political arena. [Gagnidze] I believe that it is only Zhirinovskiy who expresses the will of the Russian nation today. He is a fairly complex phenomenon. It has become a common event to curse and hurl all kinds of slander at a new leader as soon as he appears on the political scene. We also have experienced such facts. Zhirinovskiy stated in his first speech during the election campaign that, if he alone was criticizing the current authorities, it was because they were interfering in the administration of other republics, specifically Georgia. Well, isn't Yeltsin aiming to create a powerful state? Like Volf dze and unlike Yeltsin, we also support democracy that is not limited, but on a large scale and believe that Yeltsin's heyday is over and Zhirinovskiy's is imminent. I forgot to mention that we stated in the concluding part of the letter to Zhirinovskiy: "Your victory in the elections will have a beneficial influence on strengthening Georgia's national independence and protecting its territorial integrity." We should make use of this person. [Pitskhelauri] You were recently christened on television as the Georgian Zhirinovskiy. [Gagnidze] That's right. If I'm not mistaken, it was on "Ibervizia" that I was called the Georgian Zhirinovskiy. They probably saw that the similarity between us lay in what he wants for Russia and what I want for Georgia, that is to say, territorial integrity. The difference between us lies in the fact that Zhirinovskiy is a Jew by nationality whereas "there is not a drop of my blood that is not Georgian." I would also like to point out that we Georgians have the habit of comparing anyone dynamic who appears on the scene with foreigners. It would be my wish not to be known as the Georgian Zhirinovskiy, but for Zhirinovskiy to be called the Georgian [as published] Gagnidze. [passage omitted] [Pitskhelauri] In conclusion, let us turn to the current problems facing Georgia. How do you assess parliament's ratification of the document on Georgia joining the CIS? [Gagnidze] Frankly speaking, I have a strong antipathy toward the Georgian parliament. There is no doubt that it has to be dissolved. During one year, this parliament has not been able to issue a single law. To put it crudely, it reminds me of a cow that is well looked after, but cannot produce any milk. It is no better than the former parliament; if anything, it is worse. I agree with Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Giorgi Shevardnadze when he said that there should first be order not among the people but in parliament. As regards the CIS, this is an ephemeral association that contains aspects of security. I believe that the association should be based on free will. The question of ratification should be put to a referendum and the Georgian people should decide whether Georgia joins the CIS or not; it should not be decided by parliament, which does not have the moral right or the power to decide the country's fate. The question of dissolving parliament and holding new elections in which we would like to take part should be put on the agenda in the near future. [Pitskhelauri]What would be the most desirable outcome of the elections for you? [Gagnidze] I have already told you -- national self-administration.
