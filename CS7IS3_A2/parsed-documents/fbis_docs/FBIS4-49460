In his speech, Li Fangren expounded in detail on the objective and significance of the province's work to help the poor and carry out development, approaching the subject through many methods and angles. He set clear and definite demands, remarking: Marked results have been achieved in our province's work to help the poor and carry out development, but compared with other parts of the country, our task remains a very arduous one of steadily solving the problem of sufficient food and clothing and of achieving a well-to- do standard of living. In terms of the overall situation, the country's rural economy at present has developed to the stage of moving from having sufficient food and clothing to striving for a well-to-do standard of living. Many areas in our province are still very poor, so the task of helping the poor remains very arduous. Therefore we must make great efforts to carry out our duties so as to enable all members of society to do a good job in work to help the poor. In accordance with the requirements of the state's program to help the poor, which requires that the problem of sufficient food and clothing for 80 million people be solved within seven years, and in light of the realities in our province, the overall goal of the work to help the poor, beginning in 1994 and continuing to the year 2000, is to help 10 million people basically shake off absolute poverty. Focusing on this goal, the basic line of thinking in the work to help the poor and carry out development, both at present and for a continuing period of time, is to uphold as the guide Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, to emancipate our minds, to seek truth from facts, to deepen reform, to explore new paths in the work to help the poor and carry out development, to develop the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, to adhere to the development-oriented principle guiding work to help the poor, and to accelerate the pace of economic development and the construction of infrastructures. We should strive to improve the efficiency of the work to help the poor and carry out development by orienting our efforts toward market needs, exploiting natural resources, and relying on scientific and technological advances. Energetically developing the productive forces, continuously increasing poor peasants' household incomes, steadily solving the problem of sufficient food and clothing, and eliminating absolute poverty should be taken as the basic starting points and goals of the work to help the poor. Liu Fangren said: By carrying out the development-oriented work to help the poor, we mean encouraging the broad masses of cadres and people in poverty-stricken areas to maintain the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, exploit and utilize local natural resources, and develop the production of commodities with state support and by gearing themselves to market needs and relying on scientific and technological advances. [passage omitted] Liu Fangren stated: To do a good job in the work to help the poor, we should foster the ideas of the market economy, development-oriented work to help the poor, comprehensive development, and efficiency. [passage omitted] All units and departments, as well as trades and professions, must work out their own plans for work to help the poor and carry out development, based on the Help-the-Poor Program. [passage omitted] Liu Fangren urged: Party committees and governments at all levels should genuinely put the work to help the poor and carry out development in a position of importance and place this work at the top of their agendas. All poverty-stricken counties should regard it as a central task to help the poor through development and solve the problem of sufficient food and clothing for the masses of people. Principal leaders of party committees and governments at all levels must take up the work personally, and must pursue not only a system under which the governor or magistrates of poverty-stricken counties is or are responsible for the work, but also a system under which party committee secretaries are responsible for the job. [passage omitted] The meeting was presided over by Wang Siqi, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. Vice Governor Yuan Ronggui, member of the provincial party committee's standing committee, conveyed the spirit of the national conference on work to help the poor and carry out development. The other party, government, and Army leaders attending the meeting were Long Zhiyi, Liang Mingde, (Wang Guangxun), Li Wanlu, Wang Shouting, Xia Guohua, (Huang Yao), (Hu Jiansheng), (Wang Anze), (Zhang Weiqing), (Meng Shusheng), and Deng Guoyong.
