According to the same sources, there have be no reports about whether the aircraft undertook combat action in the area of the two towns which are close to the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. U.S. NATO aircraft on Sunday and Monday raided Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" which should have been demilitarized last spring. Not only that Gorazde has not been demilitarized, but it was used to mass over 10,000 Muslim troops and launch a strong offensive on Bosnian Serb territory in late March. [passage omitted]
