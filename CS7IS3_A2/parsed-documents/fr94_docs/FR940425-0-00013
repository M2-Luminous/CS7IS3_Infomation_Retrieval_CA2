FR940425-0-00013 FR940425-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 522 Implantation or Injectable Dosage Form New Animal Drugs; Zeranol AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Pitman-Moore, Inc. The supplemental NADA provides for deletion of the caution statement in the labeling against the use of a zeranol implant in heifer (suckling beef) calves intended for reproduction. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jack Caldwell, Center For Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;126), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1638. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pitman-Moore, Inc., 421 East Hawley St., Mundelein, IL 60060, filed a supplemental NADA 038&hyph;233 which provides for deletion of the caution statement in the labeling against the use of a zeranol implant in heifer (suckling beef) calves intended for reproduction, and to approve its use with stated limitations. The supplemental NADA is approved as of March 30, 1994, and the regulations are amended by revising §522.2680 (21 CFR 522.2680) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this approval for use in food-producing animals qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning March 30, 1994, because the supplemental NADA contains a report of a new clinical investigation (other than a bioequivalence or residue study) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The 3 years of marketing exclusivity applies only to the change in the labeling for which the supplemental NADA was approved (deletion of the caution statement in the labeling against the use of zeranol in heifer (suckling beef) calves intended for reproduction). The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
