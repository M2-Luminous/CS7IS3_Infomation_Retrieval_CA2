It is the Islamic Front, and its leader is Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz. Our colleague Kursat Akyol met Shaykh 'Uthman in Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq. [Begin recording] [First off-screen reporter] The Islamic Front made itself known for the first time last month. Following a 10-day-long bloody battle with Talabani's peshmergas, the organization withdrew and its leader Shaykh 'Uthman fell prisoner. One immediately notices the extraordinary security measures at the entrance of the house where he lives under the custody of the Kurdish leader Barzani. During the meeting with the shaykh, prominent members of his party were also present. What was the aim of this radical Islamic group that was born so quietly? [Second off-screen reporter, translating the statement of Shaykh 'Uthman, who is on screen but unheard] Our aim is to establish an Islamic state in northern Iraq similar to the one in Iran; an independent Kurdish state governed in accordance with the shari'ah, and then to expand this state toward the north, that is, toward Turkey. Once we take the Kurds in Turkey into an independent Kurdistan we will establish a great Islamic state. [First off-screen reporter] With what force does Shaykh 'Uthman intend to accomplish this? Where is his military power? [Second off-screen reporter, translating 'Uthman] I cannot reply to this question, as it is a military secret. We have peshmergas in every corner of Kurdistan. We have 12,000 peshmergas only in the mountains. [First off-screen reporter] Shaykh 'Uthman has interesting links in Turkey. He told us that he visited Turkey 10 months ago, and held quite beneficial talks during this second visit. [Second off-screen reporter, translating 'Uthman] We met with the leading officials of the Welfare Party, with Necmettin Erbakan and Sevket Kazan. We also held beneficial and fraternal talks with the leaders of Nur Society. [video shows guards in front of a house, Shaykh 'Uthman, others sitting on a couch in a room, being interviewed]
