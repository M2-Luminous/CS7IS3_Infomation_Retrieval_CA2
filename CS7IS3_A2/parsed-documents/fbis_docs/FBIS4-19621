He said the United States and Europe were at one over the way forward, and it was necessary to co-ordinate the military effort on the ground and in the air. Washington wants to widen the threat of air strikes to protect other United Nations safe havens and impose stiffer sanctions on Serbia, which backs the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Hurd said: "I believe that the United States and the European allies are now at one on the main points. Yes we need to use air power, not because it is magic, not because it will itself bring peace, but because it can be useful in protecting the safe areas. Yes we need to keep sanctions strong and indeed strengthen them where we can, where there are loopholes. Yes we need UN troops on the ground, more troops. I hope the President will be able to say America is no longer having to block the financing of other people's troops, UN troops, on the ground in Bosnia. I hope other countries will now come forward with troops." But, on Channel 4 News, he stressed the only way the war would end was through a negotiated settlement. And Mr Hurd said he could imagine a situation when the UN had to withdraw from the war zone and leave the fighting factions to battle it out. "I can imagine a situation in which the UN and the international effort had collapsed and there was no grounds therefore for preventing the sides from fighting it out. I think its very dangerous, tragic and might lead to a spread of the war," he said.
