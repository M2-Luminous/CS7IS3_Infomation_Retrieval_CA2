Instead, government officials repeat their promises and sometimes pledge new ones. In his latest speech, the Algerian prime minister promised to hold parliamentary elections soon, but said this depends on the outcome of talks among the country's political forces. Sifi also emphasized that all factions respecting the Constitution and the law can participate in the talks. But it seems that such statements are somewhat in contradiction to government practices, and that the new Algerian Government insists on repeating the mistakes of its predecessors. What could be the meaning of talks and a pretense of reconciliation whene leaders of the most important political organization are in prison, and while the government does not even recognized them? In the opinion of most political observers, the current Algerian statesmen are trying to play for time because they realize that they can not have the upper hand in any dialogue, and to achieve supremacy it is necessary to guarantee the support of other parties other than the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. In other words, a coalition should be formed against the Front, and public opinion should become skeptical of the nature, operation and aims of the Front in order to reduce its popular support. Political experts thus see yesterday's demonstrations in Algeria within this context. Thousands of people participated in a peaceful march and called for an end to violence and the continuation of talks. According to news agency reports, parties close to the government had organized the demonstrations, with the support of the police. Political experts say that the move was designed to agitate public opinion against FIS and to measure popular tendencies, but it was cooly received and was countereffective. Meanwhile, it was announced in Algeria that two French citizens were killed after being targeted by armed men. France is the main foreign supporter of Algeria's military government, and last year, Islamic combatants warned that -- in order to end western governments' support -- western citizens would be targeted and that they they must leave Algeria before the end of the year. But attacks against foreigners came to an end following promises of talks with Islamists. It now seems, however, that FIS leaders prefer not to put hope in the empty official promises, which only gives more time to the ruling military to uproot Muslim combatants and destroy their organization, and thus attain obtain its own interests in the political arena.
