While the government considers that the time is not right to discuss forming a commission called the "Truth Commission" or "Commission of the Past" with its immediate international verification, the Army flatly rejected "any possibility" of doing so. The "Truth Commission" and the participation of international agents are things the URNG guerrillas have demanded as part of the peace discussion with the various governments over the past decade. Copaz [Peace Commission], a government sponsored organization, President Hector Rosada, admitted today in a meeting with foreign journalists that "there are military sectors who are unhappy" about reaching an agreement on human rights and the creation of the Truth Commission. Deputy Defense Minister General Julio Fidencio Otzoy told ACAN-EFE today, during a visit to El Salvador, that "we do not accept the so-called Truth Commission or Commission of the Past, under any circumstance. The commission is definitely bad because we are searching for peace and reconciliation, but the commission seeks to reopen wounds; it brings out the bad side of people, bad blood, which in turn causes violence and instability," stressed Otzoy. The military leader, nevertheless, considered positive the fact that the government and the guerrillas reached a framework for agreement in January for the resumption of peace talks, possibly next month. "Our position is to immediately seek peace, but unfortunately the URNG is not interested in peace; what they are interested in is a political aspect," stated Otzoy. According to the military leader, the URNG "has already militarily lost the war" and is now fighting "tooth and nail" to ensure political recognition so that "their effort is not described as useless and so the situation does not turn against them." Copaz President Hector Rosada said the government "is not refusing" to discuss the creation of the commission at another time in the peace process, but stressed that the Army believes this affair "seeks to weaken or blame the Armed Forces." The government representative denied that an Armed Forces purge or reduction will be discussed in the negotiations with the URNG "because these are military affairs; civilians have no business discussing them. These are matters that depend on geopolitical reasons." Hector Rosada, an expert sociologist in military topics, stressed that "by dividing the Army all that will be gained is a coup d'etat," therefore, he warned that the government is not in "position to unnecessarily relinquish political opportunities" to the guerrillas. "The Truth Commission," he added, "is a verification mechanism not a human right commission, therefore we will discuss it when the time comes." Rosada insisted that the government "is not refusing" to discuss this affair. Rosada maintains that the United Nations cannot adapt the mechanisms used in El Salvador to Guatemala because it is not the proper procedure and in addition, he stressed, "I have my reservations" about the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal). To his way of thinking, the Truth Commission should be an educational and political instrument so the population can learn that "the politics of animals were used throughout 20 years" and so sectors learn not to hide in impunity. Rosada believes this commission should take the most representative cases of genocide, kidnappings, and murders to demonstrate that "what happened when the country was a mess." Copaz has requested President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and Defense Minister Gen. Mario Enriquez not to change any of the three high-ranking officers who comprise it, given negotiations with the guerrilla are due to begin in the next few weeks with UN mediation.
