It is a nightmare for the Serbs who have bound up their destiny with it, a "lost land" for those who are packing up, an excellent field to start up yet another socioeconomic game of chance and to score a few political points for those who have already ensconced themselves in central Serbia. The same picture as six or seven years ago emerged the other day. In the village Milosevo, at the 10th kilometer of the Pristina-Kosovska Mitrovica highway, some 20 signs offer some 20 houses for sale. "I am selling my house because of the slowness of the state in solving the Kosovo problem," says the sign in front of Vukasin Dutina's house. What it says is that he is "completely fed up." After "everything else" came land consolidation. Land was taken away from Dutina and his neighbors 30 years ago. Following the socialist collectivist transformations, frequent sale or letting someone else cultivate the land, people lose track of the parcels. The parcel "returned" to Nikola Grbic is listed under two different names by its number in the land records and its number in the opstina archives. He knows that Ismailj Jakupi is now cultivating the field beside the house which 30 years ago the state turned over to the agroindustrial combine Kosovo-Eksport. Jakupi has said that he will give up the land to him, but only when the state returns land to him, which, it seems, is fine with Grbic. He is waiting for the state to do its job, but he "really" is going to go. "Land taken away has frequently been turned over to Albanians," says Milan Hrkalovic. He took possession of the parcel returned by force. Dutina is unable to make a deal with his Albanian neighbor, who has plowed over the path and the boundaries. He is waiting for the intervention of the law-governed state, which is slow. And along with everything else, the inevitable story about land consolidation is being repeated with talk about inappropriate replacement of the quality of the land, if one is to believe Hrkalovic, in which the best pieces of land somehow always go to people who have some position or hold some office. When Albanians are involved in the episodes, the whole story inevitably takes on the Kosovo ethnic mutation, to such an extent that an ordinary man concludes that "this is intolerable." Serbian Walls The land consolidation, say the inhabitants of a village with 250 houses, 90 of them Serbian and 160 Albanian, has been satisfactory to only two people. They received parcels alongside the mosque, so that they will be able to get big money from the Albanians. Grbic says that the price of land is dropping dramatically and that five years ago he was getting money which he will never be able to get again. Quite often the signs which say that a house is for sale protrude over the high walls that surround them. Until recently, the walls were the way to recognize only Albanian houses. Hrkalovic's house is one that is surrounded by one. "It sells better. The Albanian is not interested in water, nor a parquet floor, nor the house being wired for electricity. All he is interested in is that it have a wall around it," explains Milan Hrkalovic. It seems the exodus is inevitable. Aside from the problems with land consolidation, Hrkalovic has four daughters, all unemployed. "They are all saying they are so sorry I do not have a son, and then they would hire him. If I had a son, I would employ him myself on the land," says the head of the house. He is employed at Kosovosped, but on mandatory leave. He tells how he went with a group of colleagues to the Serbian Assembly to complain of monkey business in his firm. Bata Zivojinovic, who headed the opstina Committee for Petitions and Grievances at that time, told them jokes to entertain them and dispel their concern. Zivorad Igic, deputy from Kosovo, directed them to the Assembly restaurant, where the food is good and cheap. The hungry people were taken in, they went to the restaurant, and there they encountered the Assembly security. "They came after us, and we were glad when we found the door," Hrkalovic relates. That was his first experience with the state. Milan Hrkalovic has no intention of complaining again. Nikola Grbic, however, thinks of writing to Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, whose picture hangs above him in the living room as he tells his sad tale. He was thinking, he said, of giving a house lot to his sister, who returned to Kosovo from Krusevac, but now he does not have it to give. "Unless Sloba helps out, I do not know who will." "Unless Sloba helps out," the Grbices will soon come to the end of their own personal Kosovo cycle. They came to the village which bears the name of the Serbian hero in 1922 from Lika. Vukasin Dutina is "80-percent" decided to leave. He says that he does not believe that he has a future here and that "things are not being worked out the way they should." His younger son got a job only at the age of 29. The elder, Slobodan, is working as an auto mechanic at the Obilic Coal Mine for miserable pay which does not give him the courage to establish a family. Many have already left, and he does not know how why he is staying. Those who have left have told me that they would return if the situation were "the way it should be." But it is not. Vukasin explains that he has been unable to build a new house by his own honest labor, while others have been getting a new apartment even when they were too lazy to paint the old one. He says that he "had hopes," that is why he stayed even in 1981, when the exodus was largest, he stayed all these years, but it seems that he will have to leave in '94. He has no more hope. The state has made promises so that fulfillment of people's hopes is bound up with it. Hoping that the state will not betray that trust, Vukasin Dutina's younger son waited until age 29 for his first job, while during that period Albanians were going to the West, opening private stores and trade establishments. Now the Serbs from Milosevo are complaining about the venal Kosovo (Serbian) bureaucracy. A myth which is threatening the myth of the battle of Kosovo is being created on the theme of corruption, venality, and crime. Just as in a myth, there is much that cannot be checked out, the facts are mysterious, assessments of the role of the heroes vary from case to case. Getting Around the Prohibitions "The Albanians, which have exceptional economic power, buy strategic goods and sell them not only in Kosmet, but also to the Macedonians and Croats, with the help of irresponsible and venal representatives of the authorities all over Serbia," Zejnel Zejneli, POLITIKA journalist and federal deputy from Pristina, wrote in that newspaper. No names are given even in his article. Zejneli says that in the end he is only a journalist, not a judge, so he does not publish the names. This deputy on the slate of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] gives among examples of machination the case of Kosmet tours, 49 percent of whose shares were sold below the price of one of the 10 buses the firm possesses. In the trade in real estate, which is prohibited in Kosovo, Serbs and Albanians have found a way of getting around the law. One of the ways is a fictitious marriage between a Serb and an Albanian woman, so that later, after the divorce, the Serb leaves, say, the apartment to his "fictitious wife," and he gets money in return. Mortgage loans are another way, and there are also less complicated ways reported by the farmers in Milosevo: "You grease the right palms, and there are no problems." Zejneli also calls upon his obviously extensive documentation to tell how in Prizren, during the greatest shortages, milk was sold from a truck with Belgrade license plates and how the people in Subotica were forced to buy corn in Kosovo, after previously having sold it there.... Albanian capital is conquering Kosovo. To take an obvious example, this is how it looks: On a building bearing the name of the publishing house RILINDJE in capital letters in the Albanian language, following the transformation and the prohibition of the Albanian newspaper, the stylized letters read Gracanica, so that Gracanica is leased, and the lessee is an Albanian, and a big sign reading "Greguri" is displayed in the window of his shop. Thus, Albanian capital and Serbian spiritual history come together. Albanian demographic growth and the growth of capital are having a depressive effect on the Serbs. The machinations of their fellow countrymen are also discouraging. Milos Djordjevic, chairman of the Pristina Committee of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), also complains of the very low intellectual potential of Kosovo Serbs. "What do we amount to here when not a single one of our people means anything in culture or science or art? They only count for something in the government, and then at the local level," says Djordjevic. The chairman of the Pristina DSS suggested to a journalist of our newspaper "a worthwhile informant." Then that "informant" declined. He had received a worthwhile job in a Kosovo institution. When someone with university education gives up his right to free speech "on behalf of the state," then it is quite understandable that he is turning over the question of his survival, in Kosovo, for example, to the state. The state is not making itself heard. The president's half-sentence that "there are no problems" of granting broad autonomy to Albanians has remained; now people are wondering whether that unfinished sentence was ever uttered or not. What is changing in Kosovo is the slow awakening of the economy. The state appointed Vekoslav Sosevic, officially a minister without portfolio, to be "minister for Kosovo." Sosevic, they say in Kosovo, proved his exceptional managerial abilities in the rebirth of the factory Balkan in Suva Reka. The Grand Hotel in Pristina is moving faster and faster to restore its old gleam in order to receive the numerous economic, financial, and business experts, and Sosevic, judging from this, is becoming the Kosovo manager. But the problem of Kosovo, which the "minister for Kosovo," of course, knows as well, is not a managerial problem.
