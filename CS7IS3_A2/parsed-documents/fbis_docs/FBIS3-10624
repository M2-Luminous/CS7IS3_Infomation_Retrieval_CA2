The proposal is being negotiated by rapporteur Nelson Jobim, PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] lawmaker for Rio Grande do Sul, who opted for a more flexible system, to be adopted by the next president of the Republic. The decision to make more flexible the state presence in the economy is a majority trend within the Constituent Congress, which will be voting within a couple of weeks on the most controversial part of the reform. According to the rapporteur's report, which was released to a limited number of lawmakers, the concept of national capital enterprise and the restrictions on foreign capital will both disappear. Most of the activities that are currently being undertaken by monopolies, or that are being protected by market restrictions, will be exploited "directly by the Union, or through concession or authorization." Jobim believes that his proposal could be good either for a president with a liberal program of government, or for a president whose program of government advocates strong participation by the state. The idea is not to produced a "fixed" economic model, because after the reform any change will require the support of three fifths of the congressmen. Despite the fact that it preserves the Union's power to control strategic sectors, the proposal does not prevent the participation of private enterprises in providing telephone and data-transmission services, for example. Article 177 of the Constitution, which defines state monopolies, will undergo a deep change in the rapporteur's proposal. Not even the prospecting for, production, and enrichment of nuclear minerals will remain under a monopoly. Exploitation will be done directly by the Union or by authorized enterprises. The Union will also control the prospecting for and exploitation of petroleum, but will not participate in the refining, importation, exportation, and maritime transportation of petroleum, which are considered the most profitable fields. This is the most controversial point of the proposal: exploitation of these areas will be free, and the only constitutional requirement will be to observe technical refining regulations and customs policies in the case of exportation and importation of oil and oil byproducts. The proposal by the rapporteur puts an end to the provision, included in the 1988 Constitution, which makes a difference between Brazilian enterprises and national capital enterprises. Such enterprises will, however, enjoy preferential treatment: in addition to general benefits in the economy, they will have exclusive rights to produce minerals, and will enjoy preference for the purchase of goods and services by the state. Jobim's proposal ends the privileges and the restrictions affecting foreign capital in financial and health care institutions. The proposal maintains a preferential treatment for small-sized Brazilian enterprises. In addition to ending the market reserve for enterprises like the Postal and Telegraph Company (ECT) for mail services, and Embratel [Brazilian Telecommunications Company] in the area of telecommunications, the modifications of the Economic Order will also affect other sectors. Among these are the exclusive market for Brazilian ship owners, commanders, and crew members for long-range navigation, and for navigation along the coast and along local routes, plus the restrictions on ships built outside Brazil. The Proposal The following are the changes proposed by rapporteur Nelson Jobim for the Economic Order: -- The prospecting for and production of petroleum, natural gas, and other fluid hydrocarbons will no longer be a monopoly, and will be directly exploited by the Union or by private enterprises through concessions granted in bidding. -- The refining of Brazilian or foreign petroleum, the importation or exportation of byproducts, and the maritime transportation of petroleum in bulk will be open to exploitation. -- The transportation of gas or petroleum through pipes can be directly exploited by the Union or through concession. The same conditions will apply to the prospecting for, production of, and enrichment of nuclear minerals. -- The postal service and public telecommunications services can be exploited by the private sector with authorization or concession from the Union, which will lose control over the National Air Mail Service. -- The Union will no longer directly exploit the infrastructure of airports, or the highway, railway, and river transportation infrastructure for transportation between national ports and within the national territory. Private enterprises will need authorization to operate in these fields. -- The concept of national capital enterprise, and its benefits, will be terminated. Restrictions on foreign capital in the financial and health assistance fields will be terminated.
