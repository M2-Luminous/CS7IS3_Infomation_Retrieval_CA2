The Ranks of its Opponents Changing Formation"] [Text] The Duma committee for CIS affairs and relations with compatriots held closed-door hearings yesterday on questions of Russia-Georgia relations in connection with the treaty of friendship, good-neighborliness, and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia signed by Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze on 3 February. The pivotal topics of the hearings were points 3 and 4 of the treaty "on aid in the creation of armed forces of the Republic of Georgia, equipping them, and the acquisition of armaments, military hardware and technology," and on border troops of Russia and Georgia, as well as a point on the recognition of the republic's territorial integrity -- that is to say, questions which in sum could lead to an exacerbation of the situation in the region. Aired at the hearings were messages from many Caucasus regions whose authorities doubt that the Georgian side could guarantee that arms provided by Russia will not end up in the hands of criminal elements, while Mr. Zatulin, chairman of the committee for CIS affairs, voiced bewilderment in connection with the appearance in the text of the treaty of the names of concrete military bases and of their "branches" on the territory of Georgia. Present at the hearings were deputations of the Foreign Ministry; the Defense Ministry; the State Committee on Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery from Natural Disasters; the Ministry for CIS Affairs; the Finance Ministry, and of the other executive branch agencies privy to the elaboration of the treaty and the concomitant agreements, and in addition to them, separately, representatives of the contracting parties of Georgia and Abkhazia. The arguments in favor of signing the treaty presented by Mr. Pastukhov, deputy foreign minister; by Colonel General Galkin, Defense Ministry representative; and by Mr. Smirnov of the Ministry for CIS Affairs, were sufficiently well considered, according to parliamentary analysts, and raised no special objections from deputies and experts. The main opponent of the arguments was a representative of Abkhazia, Mr. Dzhevgeniya, who put the main stress on the unsettled status of relations between Sukhumi and Tbilisi. At the close of the session, journalists were admitted to the room to hear commentaries from participants in the hearings. Konstantin Zatulin promised a corresponding statement from his committee, but not before Monday. On the whole, the deputies' dissatisfactions with the agreement boiled down to two: first, the text of the documents; second, the signing procedure. The latter dissatisfaction seems to have especially hurt the committee on CIS affairs and its chairman personally: The documents had been prepared without their knowledge, the appeal by all Duma factions to the president not to sign the treaty for the time being had been ignored, and Boris Yeltsin's word that he was not going to submit the document for ratification before Georgian-Abkhaz and Georgian-Ossetian relations have been normalized, placed the authors of the above appeal in an idiotic situation. Mr. Zatulin tried to get out of it by pointing out, on one hand, the fruitful contacts with the executive branch at the time of organizing the hearings; and on the other, by supposing that it was the appeal of the Duma factions that made the president wait a little for the ratification of the treaty. A plausible version, but too elaborate. Most likely, the main objective of those who arranged the hearings was to demonstrate their ability to organize calm multilateral negotiations and discussions, while their motive was the fact that Mr. Zatulin apparently did not wish to be branded for causing yet another standoff between the two power branches.
