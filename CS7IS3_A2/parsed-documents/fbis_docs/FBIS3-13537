The newspaper says in its editorial today that the Iranian statement, while worthy of welcome for indicating a positive change in that country's attitude toward Middle East peace, remains surprising and raises a question as to why Iran is using a double standard in its attitude toward Egypt and Syria. AL-AHRAM recalls Egypt's attempt, soon after President Mubarak took power in 1981, to open a new chapter in relations with Iran to promote inter-Islamic cooperation and regional stability and security. It adds that the end of the Iraq-Iran war was a strong reason for removing the tension between Egypt and Iran and refers to a recent statement by President Mubarak that an agreement to restore bilateral ties may have been possible at one time but the Iranian leaders were divided among themselves over whether to have it. The paper notes that the reason given by the Iranian hardliners for not restoring ties with Egypt was their opposition to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and says that these hardliners began encouraging deviant terrorists to undermine stability inside Egypt and strongly opposed any Egyptian role in the Gulf. AL-AHRAM concludes its comment by expressing the hope that the difference between Iran's attitude to Egypt and Syria will not signify that it is using a double standard. It further hopes that Velayati's recent remarks will spell a new development in Iranian policy that will promote greater understanding with the Arab countries, notably Egypt, for the general Muslim good. The paper cites the example illustrated by the unique understanding marking the Cairo-Damascus relationship.
