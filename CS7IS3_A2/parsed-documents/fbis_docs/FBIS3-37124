There is no alternative to relations with Russia and this refers to all spheres: social, cultural, economic, military and others, he said. The parliament session discussed measures to stabilize the coupon (monetary unit) of the Georgian National Bank and the situation in the Ghali Region of Abkhazia. Commenting on the signing of the Russian-Georgian agreements during the recent visit to Tbilisi by Russian President Yeltsin, Shevardnadze said that this had created the legal basis for equal relations between the two countries. Of special importance for Georgia, he said, is the package of economic agreements. Shevardnadze has said that it is necessary now to do everything so that the two countries' parliaments to ratify the signed agreements. Speaking about the situation in the Ghali Region of Abkhazia, the Georgian leader described the actions by the Abkhazian armed units as another fascist sortie. There is only one way out, he said. It is to settle the conflict politically. This could be achieved, he said, if UN peacekeeping forces or Russian troops are deployed in the zone of conflict.
