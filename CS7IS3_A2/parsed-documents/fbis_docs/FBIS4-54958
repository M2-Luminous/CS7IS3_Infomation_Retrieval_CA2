According to them, work in the commission cannot be a substitute for bilateral talks with the government. After the lignite miners suspended their strike, the protest of "S" lost its impetus; however, Marian Krzaklewski has announced tbe escalation of strikes for today. Anthracite mines are still on strike; the protest has been joined by the railroad workers, even though the General Directorate of the Polish State Railroads [PKP] claims that only 14 employees went on strike -- in Tarnowskie Gory. Apart from this, in line with the data of "S," 20 enterprises all over Poland are taking part in a continuous strike. The unionists are hoping that the deadlock may be broken if the protest is joined by more railroad workers and if the lignite miners resume their strike. Presidium Against the Commission "Most of the members of the Presidium of the National Committee believe that the union should no longer participate in the Trilateral Commission because it does not fulfill the functions for which it has been set up," "S" spokesman Piotr Zak told RZECZPOSPOLITA. Minister Miller is trying to make people believe that the Trilateral Commission is a wonderful remedy for all conflicts and that it is the committee that should handle the union's demands. He forgets, however, that "S" is the only union that signed an agreement with the government (on 29 May 1992), whereby it may begin collective bargaining with the government, and resolution of the strike is possible through negotiations between the union and the government. Therefore, the Presidium believes that the work of the Trilateral Commission cannot substitute for bilateral negotiations. According to the "S" spokesman, the present commission, "without a legal foundation and in view of the fact that the issue of the representativeness of the unions has not been settled," is a fictitious body. Krzaklewski: Culmination Today "S" National Commission Chairman Marian Krzaklewski said that the government's statement that popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] will have been rescinded by the end of the year is contrary to the agreement signed with lignite miners (following which they suspended their strike). "In such a situation the union is preparing a strike action in the power industry; on Friday the Strike Committee in the Belchatow mine will decide whether or not to resume the strike in this enterprise," he said. He added that the "S" Protest Action Headquarters will agree that the mine renew its strike. "On Friday there will be a culmination of our three-day strike. A few hundred enterprises will stop work, among others, the historical Gdansk Shipyard," announced the "S" leader. It is worth recalling that the "S" Strike Headquarters first announced a nationwide continuous strike action and then declared that it would be intensified on 4, 5, 6, and 7 May; all the branches of the union were supposed to take part in an active strike. According to Krzaklewski, through the present strikes the union has achieved its strategic goals; now there must be "collective pressure, so that the demands are reinforced." Asked about the scale of the strike, he stated that this was just the scale that he had expected and that there were no surprises: "I knew how many enterprises would stop work." Also the union's spokesman positively evaluated the course of the strike; he added, however, that he was not familiar with the data that PKP had at its disposal. Miners go or not go on strike. Today a demonstration by the defense industry unionists is to be held in Warsaw, as well as a "S" demonstration in Biala Podlaska. An eight-hour strike will be staged in the enterprises of the Gdansk region, including the shipyards and ports of Gdansk and Gdynia. The fuel base in the northern port will be cut off, which will make the reloading and reception of oil impossible. Yesterday the strike by anthracite miners was joined by two mines: "Zabrze-Bielszowice" and "Nowy Wirek." "S" claims that 23 coal mines and three zinc and lead mines are out on strike. The State Anthracite Agency maintains that 20 anthracite mines are out on strike. "S" did not manage to organize a strike in the Gliwice Coal Partnership yesterday. If the "S" plant committees of the mines that are associated with it do not join the strike, the "S" Inter-Mine Coordination Commission in the Gliwice partnership threatened to request the region's leadership to suspend the present authorities of the union in the individual mines. The Union Is Not the Army Off the record, the unionists concede that the strike was not as successful as was expected -- even though Marian Krzaklewski holds a different opinion. They point out that the protest lost momentum when the lignite mines suspended their strike. Some criticize the behavior of Strike Headquarters, whose decision concerning the intensification of the strikes was so sudden that there was not enough time to inform the Plant Committees about it and to persuade them to strike. "There is discipline in the union; however, it is not a military-like discipline," we were told by a high-ranking "S" activist. Quite common is the opinion that "S" strikes are better organized by the various branches, which can add their own demands and thus encourage employees to go on strike. The unionists are now hoping that the protest will be joined by the railroad workers and that the employees of the power industry will resume their strike, which might result in extending the strike action.
