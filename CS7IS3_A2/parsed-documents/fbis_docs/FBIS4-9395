Moslem secessionist forces led by Fikret Abdic, controlling the north of the pocket, freed 280 prisoners, and troops loyal to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in the south freed 76, the ICRC said. The exchanges followed the signing of an agreement between the two sides April 23. ICRC representatives held discussions with each prisoner to make sure they were happy crossing the front line to rejoin their own side. The forces have clashed intermittently since Abdic declared autonomy late last year for Bihac.
