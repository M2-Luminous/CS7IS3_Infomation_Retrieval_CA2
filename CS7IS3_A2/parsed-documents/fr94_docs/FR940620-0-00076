FR940620-0-00076 FR940620-0-00026 18. All initial construction permits for LPTV stations will continue to be issued with a five-character alpha-numeric call sign. However, we will permit any LPTV station that so chooses to request a four-letter call sign, without threshold operating requirements, after receiving its construction permit. 10 We stated our belief in the Notice that only licensed LPTV stations should be able to apply for four-letter call signs because many LPTV construction permits never become operational. We recognize commenters' concerns, however, that LPTV operators need to have four-letter call signs as early as possible to effectively market their stations to the public. One commenter suggests that an LPTV station be permitted to apply for a four-letter call sign at any time after issuance of the initial construction permit if the request is accompanied by a certification that a firm equipment order has been placed or that physical construction is underway at the transmitter site. We believe that this limited restriction is not unreasonable in that it will not unduly burden LPTV permittees and will promote efficient use of Commission resources. Accordingly, a permittee requesting a four-letter call sign must include with that request a certification that it has placed a firm equipment order, which includes a down payment for such major components as a transmitter or a transmitting antenna, that physical construction is underway at the transmitter site or that the station has been constructed. In addition, permittees, as well as LPTV licensees requesting a four-letter call sign, must also submit the drug certification statement required by Section 1.2002 of the Commission's Rules. By a later public notice, a schedule will be established by which licensees and permittees will be able to apply for four-letter call signs. Those stations in operation for the longest period of time will have the opportunity to apply first. 11 10 All initial LPTV construction permits will be issued with a five-character LPTV call sign. TV translator stations appear to have no need for four-letter call signs and therefore will not be eligible to request them. 11 There are now 1,400 licensed LPTV stations and an additional 1,300 outstanding LPTV construction permits, which represent a potentially large number of requests for modified call signs. Accordingly, we believe that a phased implementation of the new LPTV call sign policy is necessary to ensure expeditious handling of call sign requests and the avoidance of delays. A fair and flexible means of accomplishing this is first to accept requests from operators of licensed stations on the basis of years of operation. Once all station licensees have been afforded an opportunity to request a four-letter call sign, the opportunity will be extended to LPTV permittees. The certification requirement will effectively enable the Commission to award four-letter call signs to those permittees most likely to construct and operate their stations. 19. All LPTV four-letter call signs will include a suffix of ``&hyph;LP,'' ( e.g. , ``WXYZ&hyph;LP''). We do not agree that the suffix will unduly prejudice LPTV stations, and we believe that such a suffix is necessary to distinguish LPTV stations from full-power television stations so as to guard against public confusion. The commenters' comparison of the relationship between LPTV and full-power stations to that of different types of stations in other broadcast services is inapposite. Different classes of FM stations are all regulated as part of the FM service, and different classes of AM stations are all regulated under the AM service. LPTV stations, however, are regulated as a distinct broadcast service from full-power television stations. As such, they are not constrained to follow rules applicable to full-power stations such as multiple ownership restrictions, children's programming rules, the prime time access rule, local public file requirements and main studio requirements. Moreover, they operate on a secondary, non-interference basis. We believe that the distinctive suffix ``&hyph;LP'' is more appropriate than ``TV,'' ``CT'' or other suggestions because it best reflects the longstanding denomination of the service and would not introduce new and possibly confusing terminology. 20. As we proposed in the Notice , requests for four-letter call signs will be handled under the practices detailed in ยง73.3550 of the Commission's Rules. 12 An LPTV operator may not request a call sign used by another broadcast station unless the stations are commonly owned, or unless the LPTV operator has the other station's written consent. Also in keeping with the Notice , where a call sign is requested by more than one party, the first operator to file its request with the Commission will prevail. In the case of identical requests filed on the same day, the call letters will be assigned to the station with the longest continuous record of broadcasting operation under substantially unchanged ownership and control. We also adopt the proposal from commenters that a full-power television station will prevail in the situation where a full-power station and an LPTV station apply for the same call sign on the same day. Similarly, an AM or FM radio stations will prevail over an LPTV station applying for the same call sign on the same day. 12 Requests for modified call sign assignments can be made by letter to the Commission in accord with ยง73.3550.
