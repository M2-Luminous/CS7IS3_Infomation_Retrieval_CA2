ACTION: Interim final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is changing the regulations governing the U.S. 70 Bridge across Gallants Channel, mile 0.1, in Beaufort, North Carolina, by extending the hours of restricted openings from the current 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. timeframe to the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. This rule also further limits the number of openings required during the hours of restrictions.
