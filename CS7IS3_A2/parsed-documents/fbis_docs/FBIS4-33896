Maintaining a cease-fire that is recognized by the Zapatist National Liberation Army and the prevalence of a political solution are elements that characterize the correct position assumed by the government toward the conflict, the president added. During a news conference that he offered after talks with Cuban President Fidel Castro, Salinas de Gortari said his government will try to consolidate peace in and guarantee national sovereignty over that territory. He will also reinforce social programs already under way in that zone, especially those relating to health and supplies implemented as part of the official policy, about which the Mexican Government will offer more details later. Salinas de Gortari added that besides those measures, the political parties and society are participating in the debate and efforts to achieve a consensus in the "country's political and democratic progress." "We have already achieved a national consensus in favor of peace," with regard to the situation in the extreme southeastern area of Mexico, the president added. Salinas de Gortari said he discussed with Castro the situation in Chiapas, where an armed group occupied several towns on the first day of this year, followed by a unilateral cease-fire on the part of the government, and official peace talks. A government peace proposal was rejected this week by the armed group that, nevertheless, agreed to respect the cease-fire. The armed group's reply "seems to be more politically motivated than moved by social and justice considerations," he added. "Although there are no formal peace agreements, the cease-fire is being maintained and a political solution prevails," Salinas de Gortari said. "These two results alone confirm that the strategy followed from the very beginning of the conflict was the correct one," the president pointed out. He also recalled that the government is implementing projects to solve social and economic problems in Chiapas, where there is "important progress." Salinas de Gortari added that the work of Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and mediator Samuel Ruiz -- a Catholic bishop -- led to the establishment of talks with the armed group and the consolidation of the cease-fire. President Salinas de Gortari visited Cuba for about six hours to meet with Castro before leaving for Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, to attend the Fourth Ibero-American summit.
