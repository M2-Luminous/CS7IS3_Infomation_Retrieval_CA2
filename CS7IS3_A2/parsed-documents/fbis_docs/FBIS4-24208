FBIS4-24208 "drafr123_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 25-26 Jun South African Press Review for 25-26 Jun MB2606112994 MB2606112994 BFN [Editorial Report] WEEKEND STAR Limits of Tolerance -- "It is time to stop talking of `dirty tricks'" as it implies "low-scale misbehavior, peccadillos" or "at worst, paper burglaries of the Watergate kind. Murder is not a `dirty trick'" to be "shrugged off or glossed aside," notes an editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 25-26 June on page 8. "Now that an inquest court has judicially implicated the Civil Co-operation Bureau in the murder of SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] advocate Anton Lubowski after five years of rumor, suspicion, slow disclosure and considerable hush-up, justice needs to proceed with dispatch and determination to an end result." While the "era behind us involved a psychosis of war" and "wrongs were done on both sides," however "a moral line must be drawn, and the moral line can never encompass cold murder." It is necessary to learn who committed what crimes "and where the chain of command stopped. The Lubowski suspects should be extradited to Namibia. Internally the truth commission should become a priority, unopposed by anyone with a clear conscience." SUNDAY TIMES Disclosure -- "A note of desperation has crept into the attempts of Mr F. W. de Klerk's government to prevent disclosure of criminal actions committed in defense of apartheid." The "common feature" of the Windhoek inquest into the Lubowski case, the Goniwe inquest, the David Webster case and others "is that neither judicial inquiries, nor inquests, nor prosecutions succeeded in penetrating the web of deceit woven by the Nationalists," states an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 23 June on page 28. "All these inquiries seem to peter out just below the level that would implicate either the top officers of the security services, or the politicians who guided them. The glue that holds the conspiracy together is secret amnesty and secret indemnification, in terms of laws crafted by the de Klerk government." "We know that our present government includes killers and torturers, and people who sent them to kill and torture." "To fix responsibility for crimes or atrocities committed in the past, whether in defense of apartheid or in the struggle against it, does more than identify the guilty: it also exonerates the innocent." THE CITIZEN Robin Hood Budget -- "It is called the Robin Hood budget, Minister of Finance Derek Keys taking from the rich to give to the poor," states an editorial in the Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 23 June on pages 1 and 2. "However the 5 percent transition levy on taxpayers and companies earning more than R50,000 [rand] is hardly confined to the rich." The "levy aside, Mr Keys produced a somewhat bland budget." He did not remove or increase the VAT [value-added tax], "imposed modest increases in excise duty on cigrettes, wines, spirits and beer," "cut the corporate tax from 40 percent to 35 pewrcent, but raised the secondary tax from 15 percent to 25 percent." "This was to our minds a sleight-of-hand budget, socking the middle amd upper-income taxpayers and giving little to the poor directly in pension and other social benefits." "In essence, what his Budget has given is fair warning that the redistribution of wealth has begun." Their Role -- While the "hand of the ANC" can be seen in some of the budget decisions, "the government as a whole has to take the blame," for "there is joint Cabinet responsibility for all decisions taken by the government and all actions by the ministers, whatever their portfolios," notes an editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English also on 23 June on page 6. With the "overwhelming" ANC "majority of votes and seats in the Cabinet, it will increasingly have its way on issues that put it into power like the Reconstruction and Development Programme and the redistribution of wealth and land. How the National Party [NP], as a junior partner in government, handles this situation remains to be seen. It can either become a comfortable ally of the ANC or a vigorous opposition party in Parliament and outside it." IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Buthelezi "has an even more difficult task" since "he continues to be under attack from the ANC." "As there is no opposition of any consequence in Parliament, it is left "to the NP and IFP to be standard bearers of opposition politics. Will they, especially the NP, do so? The political future of these parties and of the opposition will depend on the answers." RAPPORT Red Recipe -- "Red lights are starting to flicker," notes a page-22 editorial in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 26 June as it criticizes the appointment of Ronnie Kasrils as deputy minister of defense. "The appointment of Ronnie Kasrils, a communist activist of the highest degree as deputy defense minister, does not only give an indication of the ANC's `security course,' but is symptomatic of how the South African Communist Party [SACP] is quietly getting its hand on important levers of power." Another communist, Mr. Sydney Mufamadi, is already minister of safety and security, the former police portfolio. The Red recipe is clear for everyone to see: "Get control of a country's security apparatus firstly, and work further from there on." "The exact same strategy was adopted in the former Czechoslovakia, in Poland, in Bulgaria and many others." Defense Minister Joe Modise said about the appointment of Mr. Kasrils that the ANC has been very generous, as it is capable of running the country on its own, but prefers not to do it. Mr. Mandela has also referred to Mr. Kasrils as his favorite. "Indeed a meaningful remark, to say the least." Shortly after his appointment, Mr. Kasrils rejected the nine generals' disapproval of the proposed Truth commission as "irrelevant," and added that there had always been an "openness" in the ANC/SACP freedom struggle. The editorial goes on to call Mr. Kasrils a "shadowy figure" who "played a dubious role in the Bisho massacre," and concludes by asking: "What has he and his party, and by implication the ANC, up their sleeves? And which further Red strategy is quietly being devised at the SACP headquarters?"
