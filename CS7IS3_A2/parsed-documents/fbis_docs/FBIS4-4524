The two countries' foreign ministers shared the view that North Korea should respond positively to the UNSC president's statement no later than mid-April since the statement urges it to allow additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] before the end of this month, and they decided to cooperate in urging China to persuade North Korea. Reminding his counterpart of the remark made by Japanese Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa during the recent ROK-Japanese summit, that "Japan will join UN sanctions against North Korea within the scope allowable by law," Minister Han requested that, while continuing to make efforts for dialogue with North Korea, Japan consider controlling its trade with North Korea, restricting the amount of money being sent to North Korea by Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang association of Koreans in Japan, and prohibiting North Korean ships from calling on Japanese ports in case North Korea does not observe the UN statement. Regarding Minister Han's request, Minister Hata said that he would try to persuade North Korea to the utmost in cooperation with China to denuclearize the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way and that he would carefully consider the sanctions against North Korea suggested by Minister Han. On 4 April, Minister Han will also call on Prime Minister Hosokawa to explain the ROK Government's position on the UNSC president's statement and to discuss international cooperative measures in preparation for the case in which North Korea, despite the UN decision, does not allow the IAEA to conduct additional inspections.
