On Wednesday evening, the acting Presidium of the MDF presented its resignation to the National Presidium, which accepted it. MDF acting chairman Sandor Lezsak had resigned a week earlier. Instead of a new acting chairman, the National Presidium chose to give the chair to a five-strong acting Presidium until the next, unscheduled National Convention. The five are Laszlo Salamon, Laszlo Medgyasszai, Ivan Szabo, Geza Jeszenszky, and Zoltan Bogardi. Herenyi said that no members of the former acting Presidium have applied to be reelected. Thus neither Sandor Lezsak, nor the five deputy chairpersons of the Presidium (Prime Minister Peter Boross, Peter Nahimi, Gabriella Farkas, Ferenc Kulin, Tamas Szabo) stayed in their posts. The five on the new acting Presidium are all equal in rank. The date of the next, unscheduled National Convention will be set at the July session of the National Board.
