During the election campaign, however, the prospects improved. Opinion polls showed that voters considered the CSU "competent" on European policy, and they honored this by giving the party almost 7 percent. Edmund Stoiber's criticism about "Brussels," about the flood of directives and expenditures, about the danger that, through the Community, France's bureaucratic centralism and interventionism would be spread throughout Europe, has apparently impressed people. Thus Stoiber would have won the elections -- if Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union [CDU] had not been even more successful. Those who do not like the Community as it has developed in the past 30 years should not vote for the CDU in European elections, because this Community undisputedly is the product of the Christian democrats of the six founding countries; France, Italy, Benelux, and the Federal Republic. Logically, they hardly ever criticize Brussels. However, the Bavarian sister party is led by someone who has not entertained the public or the electorate with loud criticism, but has frequently adopted a certain tone in Brussels itself -- Theo Waigel. That is why he should be declared the winner of the European elections, even though there is no scientific basis to say so. No one will doubt that he is a convinced European. Nonetheless, in the Council of Ministers, he kicks against the pricks -- or, rather, against the zeitgeist -- time and again, and frankly tells his counterparts what Germany would consider good European economics policy -- self-imposed moderation instead of hunting for responsibilities, austerity instead of distributing subsidies in a self-important way, primacy of price and monetary stability instead of inflationary employment policy. In Brussels, by the EU, most ministers mean something else. However, that does not worry Waigel, and now it looks as if the elections had shifted the club of 12 in his direction. For this direction, the term "subsidiarity" was introduced. In the new European Parliament, a clear superiority of Christian democrats and conservatives over social democrats and socialists has developed. The latter are working for a centralist and interventionist Community, because they intend to give employees in the EU equal, and the highest possible, social security, irrespective of the country where they work. For social democrats, this forms part of the solidarity in the Community and it forms part of the single market, which in theory is supposed to give employees mobility between Scotland and Sicily. The Christian democrats are equally dedicated to this goal. The conservatives, who have now risen to become the third force, tend toward a basically different policy -- competition between the systems. Brussels does not impose the system, but cultivates competition and makes sure the rules are respected. Solidarity and help for the weaker members have a place here. However, they are not the Community's most important task. Following European elections, the economic policy helm in Brussels will not be turned abruptly, but will at best be slightly changed. According to economic expert Horst Siebert, the Community will only stay together if it learns to see itself as a competitive society.
