FR940825-1-00103 FR940825-1-00009 In keeping with the principle of Indian self-government, the Agency will view Tribal Governments as the appropriate non-Federal parties for making decisions and carrying out program responsibilities affecting Indian reservations, their environments, and the health and welfare of the reservation populace. Just as EPA's deliberations and activities have traditionally involved the interests and/or participation of State Governments, EPA will look directly to Tribal Governments to play this lead role for matters affecting reservation environments. See November 8, 1984 ``EPA Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian Reservations'' at p. 2. EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner reaffirmed the 1984 policy in a Memorandum issued on March 14, 1994. 2. Consultation With Tribal Representatives In addition, EPA has consulted with Tribal representatives in developing this proposed rule. EPA discussed preliminary issues associated with the proposed rule at the ``First National Tribal Conference on Environmental Management'' held in Cherokee, North Carolina in May 1992 and the ``Second National Tribal Conference on Environmental Management'' in Cherokee held in May 1994. In the Fall of 1992, EPA met with Tribal representatives at three outreach meetings in Chicago, Denver and San Francisco. These meetings included a discussion of issues raised by this proposed rule as well as EPA's efforts to assist Tribes in obtaining training in air quality management. Overall, representatives of approximately 70 different Tribes attended. In September 1993, EPA discussed a draft of this proposed rule with representatives of approximately 40 Tribes at a seminar sponsored by EPA and the Office of Native American Programs at Northern Arizona University and a subsequent meeting with representatives of State and local governments sponsored by the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators/Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials. EPA has also consulted with Tribal and State representatives periodically throughout the development of the proposed rule. EPA received comments both during and following the Tribal and State outreach meetings. EPA has considered these comments in developing today's proposed rule. To the extent any such commenters have concerns that have not been adequately addressed by today's proposal, they should submit formal written comments to EPA in response to today's action. Any such comments must be received by the deadline indicated at the outset of today's notice and submitted to the EPA address specified above. B. General Structure of the CAA In order to fully understand this proposal, a basic understanding of the structure of the CAA and its division of responsibilities between EPA and the States is necessary. Such a description is set forth below. In addition, a brief description of some of the many programs contained in the CAA is set forth in Addendum A, as an introduction and guidance to Tribes wishing to develop their own CAA programs. Reading Addendum A in conjunction with today's proposed action will also facilitate the reader's understanding of the discussion that follows. The CAA is implemented in two basic ways. The principal method is through a cooperative partnership between the States and EPA. While this partnership can take several shapes, generally EPA issues national standards or Federal requirements and the States assume primary responsibility for implementing these requirements. However, as a prerequisite to assuming implementation responsibility, States must submit their programs to EPA and must demonstrate that their programs meet minimum Federal CAA requirements. Among these requirements is the mandate that States demonstrate that they have adequate legal authority and resources to implement the programs. If a State program is approved or if the authority to implement a Federal program is delegated to a State, EPA maintains an ongoing oversight role to ensure that the program is adequately enforced and implemented and to provide technical and policy assistance. An important aspect of EPA's oversight role is that EPA retains legal authority to bring an enforcement action against a source violating a CAA program implemented by the States. Thus, if a State fails to adequately enforce CAA requirements, EPA can step in and ensure that they are followed. An example of this cooperative Federal/State arrangement is provided by Title V of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7661&hyph;7661e, which contains requirements for an operating permit program. Generally, the program requires that certain sources of air pollution obtain permits which contain all of the requirements under the Act applicable to such sources. EPA has issued rules specifying the minimum requirements for State permit programs. 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992). States are required to develop programs consistent with minimum Federal requirements and to submit those programs to EPA for approval. In those instances when State programs are approved by EPA, the approved States will be primarily responsible for implementing these provisions of the CAA. EPA will maintain an active oversight role to provide necessary assistance and to ensure that the EPA-approved State programs continue to be implemented consistent with minimum Federal requirements.
