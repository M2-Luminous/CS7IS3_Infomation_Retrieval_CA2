This morning, without any explanation, the Muslim side refused to send its representatives to participate in the continuation of the work of a tripartite commission, which has already shown results, Milovanovic said. The task of the commission, made up of representatives of the Serb and the Muslim sides and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] officers, is to draw up a solution for the control of the cease-fire. The commission should have reached practical solutions on the basis of a direct insight into the situation in the field, which for the most part has been done, between 10 February and today, Gen. Milovanovic explained. Due to the discontinuation of the work of the joint commission, it is necessary to hold a meeting as early as today between Serb and Muslim corps commanders and UNPROFOR troops in Sarajevo, Milovanovic said. He added that by hampering the work of the tripartite commission the Muslim side has shown how much importance it attaches to the control and observance of the cease-fire in the Sarajevo area.
