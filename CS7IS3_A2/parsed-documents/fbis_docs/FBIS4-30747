On the one hand, Poland has the highest economic growth rate in Europe -- some people even speak about the future "European tiger." On the other hand, your successor in the "Solidarity" trade union, Krzaklewski, said recently that there have been as many as 774 strikes this year. Doesn't that prove that a large part of the population does not see any progress? [Walesa] If you view Poland from the perspective of stable democracies, you may consider what is happening in our country as anarchy. But you cannot measure us by your standards. Prior to our revolution, we were all equally poor. Now we are building capitalism -- which has led to gross inequalities. The people do not strike because they are worse off than in the past, but because others are better off than they. The strikes are not protests against the reforms. They are protests for the reforms -- for more justice, more law, and more security. [Heller] How large are the percentages of "winners" and "losers"? [Walesa] I would say one-third of the people have already the same or even a better living standards than the people in the West. Another 30 percent live a bit better than they did four years ago. Approximately 20-30 percent are a bit worse off. These latter people live in small towns where the only factory was closed down and no new ones have been set up. [Heller] Is the number of discontented people large enough to provoke serious social unrest? [Walesa] A total of 20 percent discontented people would be a lot if they were concentrated in Warsaw or Gdansk. But these people are spread throughout the country. That is why a massive outbreak of dissatisfaction cannot be anticipated. [Heller] However, the success is measurable. Last year, the gross domestic product increased by 4 percent, production and consumption by 8 percent each. Where do you see the cause of this success? [Walesa] It was important for us to get rid of our handcuffs. [Heller] That does not always work. Many reform states have made similar efforts. [Walesa] There are cleverer and less-clever people. The Poles have always found a way out. [Heller] However, regarding foreign investment, Poland is still lagging behind Hungary, which is much smaller. German and Austrian investors see more favorable conditions in the Czech Republic. What advantages do your neighbors offer? [Walesa] Today they are better, but tomorrow, our system will at least be twice as effective. The Czech Republic has had good results with small changes. Take agriculture, for instance. We are about to really privatize everything. In the Czech Republic, they have not even started privatizing the agricultural sector. The Czechs also proceeded differently with the privatization of industry. They distributed shares and vouchers in their companies. If I said that this is a "higher form of socialism," they would perhaps be offended -- but it actually was a sort of distribution system. That is why everything went relatively fast. What we are doing is try and find new individual owners for as many companies as possible -- and that takes longer. [Heller] Don't you see a danger that privatization in Poland will be slowed down by the new left-wing government? [Walesa] No. The change of government last fall has led the process a bit off course, but it will get back on the right track again. [Heller] Do you think Poland will, in the foreseeable future, be accepted into the European Union and NATO? [Walesa] The West should be more interested in our membership than we are, for the following simple reason: We are lagging 10 or even 20 years behind. We will catch up, whereas you will run the risk of falling behind, if you isolate yourself. The West suffers from overproduction. We lack production capacities. That is why the West should have an interest in taking us in, in order to make money and fill the gaps. You also draw superficial conclusions in connection with NATO. You say that we are afraid of Russia and therefore want to seek refuge with the West. However, that is not true. The Russians do not threaten us; they had us, and we did not do them good. If the Russians want to have someone, it is you, the West -- not us. [Heller] If Poland is not threatened, could it not become a neutral state like Switzerland? [Walesa] Poland is too large. Its central position between east and west, north and south plays a role in this respect. Poland cannot afford neutrality, nor will the world permit it to be neutral. [Heller] One of the factors deciding on Poland's future is inner stability. We are having doubts in this respect. You fight against every government, and there is a permanent "war of the elites." [Walesa] Do not forget that we do not yet have a ready system, we do not even have a new constitution! I provoke, in order to point out shortcomings. The point is not my person. I have assumed the task of leading my country in this difficult time, in order to build a new and modern Poland. A good system is created by way of discussion and debate. [Heller] Why are you seeking a presidential system? Could a strong government, controlled by Parliament, and a merely "representative" president not serve Poland equally well? [Walesa] Of course. But the difficulties regarding the reforms are like a storm at sea. In such a moment, there cannot be 10 captains on board. That is why we need a good helmsman with more options than in the past. In addition, you will certainly also have heard that my popularity is declining. However, it is only declining because I am not efficient. I know what to do, but I cannot carry it out, because I do not have executive powers. The people tell me that I promised something but did not keep my word. All this will repeat itself with the next president. [Heller] How do you feel as president? You complained the other day that you do not have enough time to fulfill your duties as husband. [Walesa] In times of large changes and great reforms, it is, of course, a tough job. Once law and order and stability have been restored, one will like this office.
