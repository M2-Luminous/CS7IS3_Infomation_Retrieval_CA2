The last of nine missiles of the Feodosiya Red Banner Order of Suvorov Missile Regiment is leaving the country today. The strategic systems leaving for Russia will most probably be sent to the Transbaykal region or Nizhniy Tagil. They are not subject to the START treaty and will, according to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, continue to serve as the main guarantor of Russia's security at least until the turn of the century. In the course of this year four regiments and 36 "Topol" [SS-25] missiles are to leave Belorussia. In accordance with international agreements, the republic is destined to become a nuclear-free state next year. Irrespective of all these goings-on, the nuclear arms will remain in full readiness during the entire period in question. At the same time, none of the servicemen will ever know where the missiles were targeted, or what the yield of their warheads was. [video shows officers working in front of consoles] [First officer] Attention! Combat orders received. [Second officer] Understood. Operational mode of apparatus changed. [First officer] Personnel to shelter. [Words indistinct] complete isolation [words indistinct]. [Second officer] Air alert, air alert! [Gerasimov] Russian officers claim that the redeployment of strategic missiles is a completely safe operation. The nuclear warheads, removed from the carriers beforehand, are conveyed to Russia by means of specially designated trains. The missiles themselves are safely camouflaged in specially equipped railcars, externally indistiguishable from ordinary refrigerator railcars. [video shows transporter on the road, watch tower, refrigerator-type railcar with missile inside] As distinct from Ukraine and Kazakhstan -- the other post-Soviet nuclear republics -- everything connected with ensuring the combat capability of the missile systems is being withdrawn from Belorussia. The Minsk authorities are not obstructing the Russian military. They will be inheriting the garrisons and army accommodations and property whose future is yet to be defined. The Belorussian Interior Ministry has its eye on the secret launch position facilities. The concrete structures surrounded by barbed wire are ideal sites for prisons. The Belorussian Army wants the barracks. The Chernobyl State Committee would not mind taking over divisional areas as rehabilitation centers. But so far none of these agencies have funds to maintain these facilities. Army housing units could turn into dead zones. Because of their location in the forests, far away from populated areas as a rule, they are of no interest to the local population. Unemployment will rise sharply in Belorussia with the withdrawal of the Russian missile troops. Most of the warrant officers and contract servicemen are local inhabitants. The crisis-ridden economy will not be able to provide them with jobs. In many rural areas of the republic cash may simply disappear. Ninety percent of the money in circulation came from the budgets of the Russian units. Nonetheless, the local authorities are viewing the army withdrawal calmly. [Vladimir Malets, chairman of Lida City Soviet, identified by caption] I wouldn't say that the Russian Army created problems for the local population, as is sometimes claimed in the press, saying that there was friction. In my opinion this is not true. Relations were normal. If we had problems, such as forest fires, we had their understanding and cooperation. They even helped us with things like that. So I think that all this talk that we can sigh with relief now that the Russian Army is leaving is just words. We have lived normally side by side. [Gerasimov] Serving in Belorussia was always the dream of officers in the former Soviet Army -- a mild climate, excellent staffing by virtue of its being a border district, and firm social guarantees. The Russian military are leaving the republic with understandable regret. But leaving nonetheless. Before, the army and the people were one. Now it is the army and politics.
