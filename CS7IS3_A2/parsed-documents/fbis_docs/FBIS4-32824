Upon arriving in Cairo last night, Robaina emphasized that although times are not the same as 40 years ago, the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] maintains its importance. Robaina pointed out that NAM members have the right to be heard in the concert of nations since the organization encompasses more than two-thirds of mankind. He added that this right can be justified today more than ever due to increasing international instability, the emergence of a militarily and politically unilateral world, and the concentration of economic power in the countries of the North. Robaina said: This is more than enough reason to attend a meeting such as this, with the interest of not only establishing positions but also putting things into motion. The meetings for experts, who will discuss the topics to be covered by the foreign ministers beginning tomorrow, began this morning.
