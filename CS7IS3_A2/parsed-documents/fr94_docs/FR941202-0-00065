FR941202-0-00065 FR941202-0-00010 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 9 and 63 [AD-FRL&hyph;5111&hyph;3] RIN 2060&hyph;AC31 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Halogenated Solvent Cleaning AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule and test method. SUMMARY: This final rule promulgates national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for halogenated solvent cleaners. These standards implement section 112 of the Clean Air Act (Act) and are based on the Administrator's determination that halogenated solvent cleaning machines emit halogenated organic chemicals identified in the Act list of 189 hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The halogenated solvent cleaner NESHAP requires batch vapor solvent cleaning machines and in-line solvent cleaning machines to meet emission standards reflecting the application of the maximum achievable control technology for major and area sources; area source batch cold cleaning machines are required to achieve generally available control technology. The rule regulates the emissions of the following halogenated HAP solvents: methylene chloride (MC), perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), carbon tetrachloride (CT), and chloroform (C). The EPA is also finalizing Method 307 with the standard. This method can be used to demonstrate compliance with the idling standard. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 2, 1994. See Supplementary Information section concerning judicial review. ADDRESSES: Background Information Document. The background information document (BID) for the promulgated standards may be obtained from the U.S. EPA Library (MD&hyph;35), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;2777.
