Zhelev reiterated Bulgaria's stance for non-intervention in the war in former Yugoslavia and its call on the other Balkan and neighbouring countries to refrain from such intervention. The Bulgarian position is motivated by the fact that the Balkan countries are burdened with their past and any military intervention in the former Yugoslavia on their part, even if prompted by the noblest of motives, would arouse old suspicions and hostility. According to the Bulgarian president, such a development would aggravate the situation in the Balkans and increase the danger of a new Balkan war.
