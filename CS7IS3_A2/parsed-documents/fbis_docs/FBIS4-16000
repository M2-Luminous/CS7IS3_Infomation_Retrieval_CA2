This last resort on the part of Ukrainian gas distributors under the State Committee for Oil and Gas (Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz) follows from the government's resolution No. 196 "On enterprises' settlement for natural gas." The Cabinet's earlier resolutions (No. 91 of 4 February, and No. 789 of 22 September 1993), which demanded repayment of natural gas supplies by consumer enterprises and reduced gas supplies to those of them, which failed to timely pay for gas supplied to them, were virtually ignored. It was only in March, that the agents under the State Committee for Oil and Gas took a series of actions to make the debtor-enterprises, primarily those under the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Engineering, MIC [Military-Industrial Complex] and Conversion, remarkable for their power-consuming production, start repayment of their accumulating debts, or, as a most promising alternative solution, switch to other sources of energy. However, the State Committee for Oil and Gas can not discontinue gas supplies to many of its clients, be they most inveterate defaulters, without running the grave risk of breaking their technological processes, which may cause technical failures and accidents. The latest resolution, No. 196, allows the State Committee for Oil and Gas to resort to complete suspension of gas delivery, if the debtors fail to settle by 10 April. The responsibility for likely consequences will lie entirely on the debtor-enterprises' managers. In view of this qualitatively novel situation, the managers will have to rely on their enterprises' currency means, including those on accounts with foreign banks, however reluctant they may be to do this. For several months by now, the government has been very unswervingly trying to make Ukrainian export-capable enterprises share the burden of payment for imported Russian fuels. As Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz spokespersons maintain, the thus changed system of payments (prepayments thrice a month by consumer-enterprises of their contractual gas consignments) and final settling for 1993's supplies, will allow the State Committee for Oil and Gas to accumulate, within a relatively brief period, means, necessary for settling with the Russian natural gas suppliers. Moreover so that the government's earlier resolutions contain provisions demanding settling in hard currency by those enterprises, which have currency means on their bank accounts. However, natural gas supply reductions by the government's decision do not extend to enterprises, which operate in the housing, communal services and public amenities sector of Ukraine's national economy, financed through the state budget. Instead, regional administrations have been instructed to tighten their control over rational gas consumption by these enterprises. To speedily implement the mechanism for mutual settlement with Russia's gas suppliers, the Ukrainian Government has endorsed a scheme, which provides for the debt's repayment with Ukrainian commodities through the agency of Ukrzarubezhneftegaz (Ukraine's Foreign Oil and Gas), Ukraine's authorized go-between. In line with this scheme consumer-enterprises are supposed to remit their karbovanets sums to Ukrgazprom's bank accounts. The latter organisation then remits them to Ukrzarubezhneftegaz, which, in turn, purchases the agreed assortment and amounts of Ukrainian commodities (the resolution endorsed this list of commodities including automobiles, trucks, equipment, foods) for karbovanets, thus pooling the necessary resources to settle with the Russian suppliers. Earlier, Ukrgazprom had to buy Russian rubles or hard currency on its own, paying for the prices at the NBU-set [National Bank of Ukraine] official rates. In many instances, however, it could not raise the necessary sum, anyway. The latest scheme is said to replicate, in many of its elements, its precursor, which proved to be inefficient (see UBN No. 2/1994). The two parties' authorized agents, Ukrheftesnab and Rosneftekomplekt, failed to reach the objective of materially and technically extinguishing the Ukrainian debt for Russian fuels. The Ukrzarubezhneftegaz scheme is very much resemblant of the one, which the Austro-Swiss Nordex Group applies. However, its efficiency in Ukrzarubezhneftegaz's interpretation and application is to be tested. On 4 April the Cabinet of Ministers adopted yet another resolution of the same gas series, "On prices for natural gas supplied to enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Engineering, MIC and Conversion in 1994." The resolution specifies that settling for imported gas by enterprises of the said ministries is effected in Russian rubles or hard currency at price rates, which are equivalent to 65 US dollars per 1,000 cu. m [cubic meters]. The price includes haulage payable gas piping agencies, which is equivalent to 4.1 USD per 1,000 cu. m. The above stated prices, however, are not applicable to enterprises, which manufacture fertilizers and pesticides in contracted amounts, intended for vernal agricultural purposes. The government's previous resolution No. 23 of 3 January 1994 "On settling for natural gas by enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Engineering, MIC and Conversion," specified, however, that these enterprises were to pay charges for gas piping across Ukraine's territory with Ukrainian karbovanets. This item's abrogation may testify to the government's determination to make the said gas consumers follow the government-designed strategy, which provides for the Ukrainian enterprises paying not only for imported fuels, but also charges involved in fuel delivery to end-users. The piping agencies under the State Committee for Oil and Gas are supposed to be safeguarded by the government's resolution against the consumers' non-timely payments for natural gas imported from Russia and supplied to them. The January No. 23 resolution also specified that the two above listed ministries and the State Committee for Oil and Gas were to ensure conclusion by their subordinate enterprises of contracts for additional acquisition by each ministry of 6 billion cu. m. of natural gas for the national economy's needs. The price to be paid for these amounts of natural gas was not specified earlier. However, as it is quite obvious now, industrial enterprises were none too eager to conclude such deals by late January, as instructed by the government. So, the 4 April resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers, in addition to making it incumbent on the enterprises to conclude such agreements (without setting the deadline, though), contains a provision, which specifies the price to be paid, to wit, 52.4 USD per 1,000 cu. m. The State Committee for Oil and Gas, same as before, is to pay for this amount of natural gas to industrial enterprises with Ukrainian karbovanets at "the official currency (exchange) rate set by the National Bank of Ukraine, as of the date of payment." The resolution does not mention any additional payments by enterprises, which did conclude agreements and which did pay the previous price. If any such enterprises are found their position will be most enviable, anyway. Obviously, by hooks or by crooks, the government has thus been trying to make state-owned enterprises pay for the bulk of fuels, consumed by state-budgeted entities. The state's financing is not enough to cover the fuel expenses of state-budgeted entities at least by 50 per cent by the State Committee for Oil and Gas, as its chairman, Mikhail Kovalko, noted in late 1993 (see UBN No. 5/1994). Nonetheless, the Cabinet of Ministers instructed the State Committee for Oil and Gas to fully and continuously ensure fuel flows to the state-budgeted sector of Ukraine's national economy. Probably, industrial enterprises will have to offset the financial gap through currency rate margins. However, the government's apparent determinedness on the issue does not mean that enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and Ministry of Engineering, MIC and Conversion will rush to pay for fuel imports. The new settling system places the State Committee's gas piping organisations in a favorable position. If previously they had to willy-nilly credit industrial enterprises and were unable to settle for imported fuels, the situation has radically changed now. According to utterances by Ukrgaz's and Ukrgazprom's senior officers, if Ukrainian domestic consumers repay all their fuel debts and start regular prepayment of fuel supplies (as specified, on a thrice a month basis). Ukraine's gas piping organisations will be able to redeem the major part of Ukraine's tremendous fuel debt to Russia, which is Ukraine's major fuel supplier, by 1994 with very good prospects for final settling by October and ability to purchase Russian gas in required amounts henceforth. Ukraine's is reported to have succeeded in settling with Russia for gas supplies over 1994's first three months (about 100 million dollars). However, 1993's remaining 700 million USD indebtedness is a major challenge.
