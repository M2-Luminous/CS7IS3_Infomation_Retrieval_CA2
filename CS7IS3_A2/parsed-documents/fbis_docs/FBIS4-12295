In Damascus yesterday, a highly placed Iranian official reaffirmed Tehran's support for the 10 Palestinian factions opposed to the PLO-Israel Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement. A Palestinian spokesman said that Iranian Deputy Majles Speaker Hasan Ruhani emphasized that position when he met with the leaders of the 10 factions at the Iranian Embassy in Damascus yesterday. The spokesman said that the talks covered the situation in the region after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and that the Iranian official reaffirmed his country's support for the Palestinian intifadah against the Israeli forces in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. He added that the discussions also covered means and ways of providing aid for the intifadah and the 10 factions. Ruhani, who leads a high-ranking delegation, told reporters on his arrival in Damascus the day before yesterday that he was carrying two messages for Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad from 'Ali Khamene'i and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani on the issues of peace, the Gulf region, and bilateral relations between the two countries. Some observers in Damascus believe that the two messages also deal with President al-Asad's forthcoming visit to Tehran scheduled to take place in the second half of this month.
