Foreign and defence ministers of the 10-member Western European Union [WEU] signed treaties with Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The treaties will heighten fears among Euro-sceptics that British military policy is following a federalist path. A recent defence white paper highlights plans to develop gradually Britain's defence policy around the European dimension. Mr Malcolm Rifkind the Defence Secretary, said the evolution of an EC defence policy was an "inevitable consequence" of the Maastricht Treaty. Efforts would be made at the EC Intergovernmental Conference in 1996, which will review and enlarge upon the Treaty, to "look at ways in which we might give flesh" to the WEU as the "European pillar of a future common defence policy." Although the treaties offer the nine none of the security guarantees extended to NATO members, they do get direct political links to the West's defences at a higher level than is available through NATO. The new partners will attend ambassador-level meetings of the WEU twice a month and will be invited to participate in WEU peacekeeping operations and military manoeuvres. The nine are already members of NATO's Partnership for Peace, a scheme which will allow them to take part in joint exercises with a view to their eventual integration into NATO's command structure. But the Partnership arrangement carries no promise of NATO membership, unlike WEU associate partner status. Mr Willem van Eekelen, the WEU's Dutch secretary-general, said the agreement was a signal that the nine "belong to the process of European integration." Herr Volker Ruehe, the German Defence Minister, called it a "historic step," and Mr Rifkind said: "European security is indivisible. The security of any one country is the security of all." The Brussels-based WEU comprises all EC countries except Ireland and Denmark, which are not NATO members. Under Maastricht, the WEU which was formed in the l94O's, is designated as Europe's defence arm but it is only in the last few months that it has started to take shape. At present, three European military units, all assigned to NATO, are designated as available to the WEU under new "re-hatting" procedures. The first of these is the Eurocorps, based on the old Franco-German brigade but now including soldiers from Belgium, Spain and, soon, Luxembourg. Based in Strasbourg, the Eurocorps is to have about 30,000 men assigned to it by the end of next year. The nucleus of a future European army, Britain has so far refused to assign troops to it. The other two units the WEU can call on are both traditional NATO elements. They are the UK-Dutch Amphibious Force and the Multinational Division Central, part of NATO's Rapid Reaction Corps. Britain contributes a brigade to each of these units, and so now has 8,000 men theoretically available to the WEU. Mr Rifkind said Britain was considering making more military assets available to the WEU in the future, though he stressed that no request for more had yet been made nor decision taken. So far, the WEU's military activities are limited. It has patrols on the Danube looking for sanctions-busting cargo bound for Serbia and has ships on patrol in the Adriatic. In addition, it has plans to send military police to Mostar to help the European Community's planned administration there. At the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, the EC's common defence policy will be a key subject for discussion. Mr Rifkind said that preparations for the conference had already started.
