Public security organs recorded approximately 300,000 criminal cases, up 9.2 percent from the same period last year, and close to 120,000 were serious, up 23.1 percent from the same period last year. The authorities smashed 28,031 criminal gangs boasting 105,582 members, which were respectively 9 percent and 7.8 percent higher than the numbers recorded in the same period last year; the gangs were responsible for 1.4 billion yuan in property losses, up 42.9 percent over the same period last year. Robbery remained one of the most serious crimes. There were a total of 30,316 robberies in the first quarter, up 9.8 percent over the same period last year; 20,709, or 46.4 percent, were serious, which was 19.5 percent higher than the figure in the same period last year. There were 1,694 robberies involving over 10,000 yuan each, and 290 over 100,000 yuan each, both an increase over last year. "Highway and train robberies" were on the rise again in some localities. Robberies on highways, railways, and other means of transportation in the first quarter totalled 9,100, almost as many as in the same period last year. In areas in Guangdong, Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Jilin, highway and train robberies occurred earlier than they did last year. There were 52 train robberies in Zhejiang in February, up 73.3 percent from the same period last year. In economically advanced areas, there were more kidnappings, with criminals abducting people for ransom. Murders and assaults greatly undermined the people's sense of security. The first quarter recorded 6,196 murders, up 8.9 percent from the same period last year. Of these murders, those motivated by personal disagreements and disputes accounted for the greatest number. Assaults rose continually, with 12,285 such cases reported in the first quarter, up 5.4 percent from the same period last year. Thefts rose even faster. The first quarter saw 211,473 theft cases, up 8.8 percent from the same period last year, of which 70,746 were serious, representing a 28.3 percent rise. Car thefts and safe burglaries accounted for a large percentage of crime and respectively rose 54.1 percent and 47.6 percent. Banks and other financial institutions remained prime targets for criminals. Crimes against financial institutions in the first quarter numbered 470, 59 more than the figure recorded in the same period last year. Since early this year there have been five bank holdups, each of them involving more than 200,000 yuan. The cases were all perpetrated by workers of the banks and resulted in losses of approximately 7 million yuan. Serious fraud and forgeries rose considerably, and cigarette smuggling was on the rise again. There were 7,700 fraud cases in the first quarter, up 16.3 percent from the same period last year, of which 4,493 were serious, 31.5 percent higher than the same period last year. Fraud cases involving 100,000 yuan numbered 632, up 80 percent. Some criminals defrauded banks with massive check overdrafts. Some even set up banks themselves and later absconded with huge amounts of savings in cash. There were a total of 797 cases of forged money reported, up 77.1 percent from last year. Public security organs across the country seized millions of yuan worth of forged money in the first quarter. On the whole, smuggling dropped, with 187 cases reported in the first quarter, down 17.6 percent from the same period last year. However, following the ban by the State Tobacco Bureau on imported cigarettes, there have been a spate of extraordinary foreign- igarette smuggling cases. Wuxi City in Jiangsu, smashed a 10-strong cigarette-smuggling ring and seized 954 cartons of contraband cigarettes. Gun and drug trafficking remained serious in the southwest border regions. Public securities in the region solved a series of drug cases involving over 10 kg of drugs. Public security organs across the country are deepening and extending the struggle against various crimes, are strengthening investigative efforts, and are working hard to curb the rise of crime to ensure stability and public order in the spring and summer.
