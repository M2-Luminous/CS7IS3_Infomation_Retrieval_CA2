It said: What Japan seeks in its nuclear design is not to merely join "the nuclear group" but become a nuclear power. The way of achieving this goal is to develop destructive devices in secrecy and, at the same time, produce and stockpile large quantities of fissionable materials behind the "non-nuclear" curtain. Japan sees the decisive key to the fulfilment of its nuclear design in importing large quantities of plutonium and developing a fast breeder reactor which can breed the imported plutonium. The Japanese authorities started the development of the prototype reactor "Monju" with the investment of 600 billion yen in 1985 and began charging "Monju" with plutonium as its nuclear fuel in June, 1992, and finally put it into full-dress operation on April 5 this year, despite repeated accidents. Not content with this, Japan plans to enter "the age of a full- scale fast breeder reactor" by developing a conventional reactor through the stage of a demonstration reactor. As for the fast breeder reactor whose development the Japanese authorities are hastening, it has been scrapped in most countries because its safety and economic advantage have not been guaranteed in the world. Worse still, "Monju" is a time bomb fatally fraught with three factors of dangerous accidents. Japan has already developed a destructive device which can explode in a one-ten millionth of a second and then started the development of a super-high speed destructive device which can explode in a one-one hundred millionth of a second long ago. So, the operation of "Monju" which can breed plutonium 1.3 times the amount of the charged materials means a leap in the conversion of Japan into a nuclear power. Japan's development of the fast breeder reactor and its surfacing as a nuclear power which pose a great nuclear threat to Asia and the rest of the world can never be allowed, the letter said, and continued: The Japanese ruling quarters must draw a lesson from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the nuclear victims, renounce the design to become a nuclear power, stop the operation of "Monju" and promptly give up the mass production and stockpile of plutonium. The United States must direct efforts to checking Japan's moves to become a nuclear power, feeling fully responsible for the fact that it offered to Japan an excuse for nuclear armament, groundlessly charging the DPRK with "nuclear arms development," and connived at Japan's nuclear development. Hanminjon calls on the governments, political parties and organizations of the Asian-Pacific nations and other countries of the world hoping for denuclearization and peace and international organizations to invigorate the struggle for checking Japan's scheme to become a nuclear power.
