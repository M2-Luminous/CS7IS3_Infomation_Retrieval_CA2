Provincial leaders and more than 200 veteran comrades and liaison men in charge of the work toward veteran cadres happily gathered together to jointly celebrate the Spring Festival. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the tea party. On behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, first offered, at an earlier date, the Spring Festival greetings to the veteran comrades and the liaison men in charge of the work toward veteran cadres who were present at the tea party, the veteran comrades retired from various fronts in the province, and their families and relatives; and also extended cordial greetings and sincere respects to them. He said: In the past year, the province ensured the political and social stability, the economy of the province was developed, and all provincial undertakings were flourishing. A good situation characterized by vitality and progress has emerged. New headway has been made in improving party style, administrative honesty, spiritual civilization, democracy, and legal system and developing various social undertakings. Such a good political and economic situation results from the diligent and arduous labor made in a unified manner by the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people across the province. This cannot be separated from the warm concern and enthusiastic support of all veteran comrades and all seniors. The practice has fully proved that the vast number of retired cadres are the precious wealth of the party as well as a key force to promote reform and construction and stabilize the society. The party committees and governments at various levels should be concerned with, respect, and cherish the veteran comrades and enable them to bring their key roles in the building of the two civilizations. He urged: On the premise of taking care of their health, the veteran comrades will continue to be concerned with and support the work of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, do some work according to their ability, and make new contributions to consolidating and developing the province's gratifying situation. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The year 1994 is a key year to promote the package reform and build the socialist market economic operation mechanism as well as the first year to realize the second-step strategic target. At the time of deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening up, and ensuring a sustained, fast, and healthy progress of the economy, we should continue to attend to party building, the improvement of party style and administrative honesty, the setup of democracy and legal system, and the improvement of spiritual civilization. The tasks are glorious and arduous. Now, we are confronted with not only favorable opportunities for development but also many difficulties and problems. Both favorable opportunities and challenges coexist. Under the new situation, we should be prudent and modest and guard against arrogance and rashness; persistently use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm our brains; grasp favorable opportunities to deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability; and creatively carry out our work with new ideas, new pose, and new work style. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as its nucleus, we should deeply implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, persist in the principle of taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough, emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, be united to keep forging ahead, do solid work, and further capture a bigger success in building socialist spiritual and material civilizations. Present at the tea party were some other leading comrades of the province, including Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, Han Xikai, Li Zhen, and Lu Maozeng; some veteran comrades, including Pan Qilong, Su Yiran, Liang Buting, Zhao Ding, Gao Keting, Qin Hezhen, and Li Zichao; some retired cadres at the deputy provincial chief level; and families of the late cadres at the provincial chief and deputy provincial chief levels.
