The Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for radio and television put out a trial television transmission late Monday beamed from a converted hotel. The corporation's circular logo, bearing the letters PBC in English, followed by the name in Arabic and the Palestinian flag on the side, was to appear on television screens for 24 hours. The initial transmission covered Jericho only, and was beamed from a hotel which has been turned into a press center for the visit of PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat, expected here later this month. As technicians connected cables and put up giant aerials on the roof, painters and carpenters were hurriedly renovating the 30-room building which has been closed to the public. At a cost of around one million dollars, the television center's main function will be to cover 'Arafat's visit. Transmission to the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be ready within a week, technicians promised. After 'Arafat's visit is over, the station will continue to operate as a relay for the permanent broadcasting center, the location of which is at the centre of a dispute between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Palestinians want to set it up in the Israeli-occupied town of Ramallah, also on the West Bank, where a pre-1967 Jordanian center stands. But Israel wants them to stay in Jericho. "We are happy to see the word 'Palestine' on the screen," said corporation head Radwan Abu-'Ayyash. "We've been watching and listening to others, now it's time for others to listen to us." It is the first ever Palestinian television station. Until recently, the PLO beamed radio programs from stations in Cairo, Baghdad and Tunis. However, not all residents were able to tune in their sets to the new station which used a higher frequency channel than usual. Palestinian technicians said they may later adjust the channel for wider reception. Among the many problems facing the new station is the location of Jericho. At more than 400 meters (1,300 feet) below sea level, this valley oasis is one of the lowest spots in the world and will make transmission difficult. "Our plan was to have a main studio in Ramallah, connected with one in Gaza and one in Jericho," Abu-'Ayyash said. "Because we have no other choice, we will transmit from Jericho although it is terrible from such a low area." He said two French-made boosting towers were to be placed on a surrounding mountain and on a nearby highway. Most of the small equipment and transmitters was bought from Israel. A French-donated vehicle for external transmission, and other equipment donated by Germany are on their way to Jericho, he said. The corporation's major headache however is a lack of funds. Abu-'Ayyash said 55 million dollars were needed to establish the permanent broadcasting center and its studios, most of which have been promised by the European Union but not yet arrived. "The money is locked up in Brussels," he said. "We have the skills and the goodwill. But we have a political problem with Israel, and without solving the political and money problems, we can't do much."
