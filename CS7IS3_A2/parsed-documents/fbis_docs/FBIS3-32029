We interrupt this program to announce an item of general interest. This is Octavio Cogley, live from the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] headquarters. The PDC officially announced this evening its presidential slate for the May elections. The slate is led by Engineer Eduardo Vallarino as the presidential candidate; Raul Ossa, first vice presidential candidate; and Rene Orillac, second vice presidential candidate. We repeat, the PDC revealed this evening the slate that will represent it in the May elections. The slate is led by Eng. Eduardo Vallarino, as the presidential candidate, with Raul Ossa as the first vice presidential candidate, and Rene Orillac as the second vice presidential candidate. The PDC also revealed a medical certificate issued by Dr. Fernando (Groce), a clinical neurologist, who states that Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon suffers from a chronic injury to a vertebral disc and a recent fracture of the third lumbar vertebrae. For this reason, Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon declines the presidential candidacy. The party has decided to participate alone in the elections, but it leaves open the possibility of being joined by other parties before the 8 May elections. It was also reported that a special congress will be held on 6 February to ratify the presidential slate chosen by the PDC to participate in the next elections.
