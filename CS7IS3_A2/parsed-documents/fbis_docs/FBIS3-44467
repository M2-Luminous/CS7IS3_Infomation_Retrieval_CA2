The director of the Wuhan-based Chang Jiang River Harbor and Shipping Superintendent's Bureau, Huang Jianping, said today that from January 1, all vessels sailing the international channel would need only to stop once at the Liuhe Anchorage on the upper stream in Shanghai Port to get in and out of the Chang Jiang River. Currently vessels traveling along the Chang Jiang River have to anchor twice, when going in at Wusong Anchorage and going out at Liuhe, to allow Shanghai Port pilots and those of the Chang Jiang Shipping Bureau to go on board. Too many stops and formalities, plus the problem of the shrinking Wusong Anchorage due to sludge deposits, have caused delays to many vessels and led to complaints by shipping companies, the director said. After a working group investigated the problem, the Ministry of Communications recently approved the new scheme. While improving the traffic and telecommunications at the Liuhe Anchorage, the director said that his bureau would also seek to expand the anchorage by 30 percent to allow 15 vessels of 30,000 dwt [deadweight tonnage] to anchor simultaneously.
