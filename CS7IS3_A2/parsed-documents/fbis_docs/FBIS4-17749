However, as President Boris Yeltsin stressed today at a meeting with the leadership and members of staff of the Foreign Intelligence Service, some politicians in the West regard this as proof of the revival of the former imperialist claims of Russia. In his opinion this far- fetched thesis is being used to cause an artificial exacerbation of relations among the CIS and the Baltic countries with Russia. Rejecting the concept of "global" and "total" intelligence activity, Boris Yeltsin thinks it necessary to systematically keep track of the situation throughout the perimeter of the frontiers of Russia. In this connection, he stressed, the Foreign Intelligence Service has a crucial task to tackle -- to obtain advance information on the relevant plans and intensions of the leading countries of the West with regard to Russia's neighbors, and to make timely proposals to neutralize this type of design.
