FR940106-0-00136 FR940106-0-00022 18. Job search program. The NYDL recommended that §617.11(a)(1)(vii) on the job search program (JSP) be deleted from the regulations since retroactive TRA claims approved for weeks prior to November 21, 1988, will no longer require participation in a JSP. After November 21, 1988, individuals involved will not know about the requirement. The UAW made a similar comment on the JSP requirement. However, the UAW commented further that this proposed rule creates a likelihood that workers will not be informed by State agencies of the deletion of this requirement in the 1988 Amendments since the Department is ``encouraging'' States to continue the program. Department's response. Various provisions of the 1988 Amendments became effective on different dates. The proposed rule was structured to address those statutory requirements that applied prior to, and apply on and after November 21, 1988. The JSP requirement was applicable through November 20, 1988. The training requirement became applicable on November 21, 1988. Therefore, it is essential to delineate the statutory requirements for each time period, and set them forth clearly in these regulations. Also, appeal actions may be pending on workers who were denied TRA eligibility because they failed to begin participation in or failed to complete a JSP. Some of these cases could eventually be resolved in the courts. The retention of the regulations on the JSP will continue to provide the basis for supporting determinations made by State agencies during the period the JSP requirement was applicable. In the proposed rule, a new paragraph was added to §617.49, specifically providing that JSP is not a requirement for any week which begins after November 20, 1988, and this provision is included in the final regulations. In addition, the Department believes that a JSP is a very useful employability service for adversely affected workers and should be encouraged. Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations. 19. Temporary work. The OBES commented that §617.11(a)(3)(iii) specifies that State agencies are to take into account local labor market characteristics in giving effect to the terms seasonal employment and part-time, temporary work. The OBES recommended that the final rule should provide a definition of temporary work to ensure uniformity among and between States. Department's response. As noted in item D. above, the Department decided to add to the regulations definitions of the terms ``seasonal employment'', ``odd jobs'', and ``part-time, temporary employment'', to provide State agencies with guiding instructions for implementing section 1426(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the OTCA, so that the Department, rather than the States, defines the limits of Federal liability under §617.11(a)(3) as under other aspects of the TAA program. The explanation for each of these definitions is noted in item D. In more specific response to the commenter, notice that the definitions go beyond simply defining temporary work separate and apart from ``part-time, temporary employment'' as used in the statute. To fit into this category, as is made clear in the amended regulation, such work must be both part-time and temporary. 20. Enrolled in training. The Governor of North Dakota and the Job Service of North Dakota, commenting on §617.11(a)(2)(vii), point out that the definition for ``enrolled into training'' is when the worker has been accepted to an approved training program that will begin within 30 calendar days. Both recommended that the definition provide that a worker be considered as enrolled in training upon acceptance into an approved training program and scheduled to commence training on the next regularly scheduled program starting date. Rural States have a limited number of training facilities offering open entry and open exit options. Virtually all training programs offered by both public and private facilities have designated enrollment dates. The 30-day limitation would cause States to invoke the waiver provision unnecessarily. Department's response. The Department included the 30-day provision in the definition for ``Enrolled in training'' to help reduce the number of waivers of the training requirement that would have to be issued by State administering agencies because approved training would not begin immediately. The Department recognizes that schedules for some training institutions may involve periods longer than 30 days for training to begin. In such situations, a waiver may and should be granted. States must search for training programs for individuals which will begin within 30 days, or as soon as possible thereafter. To allow fewer days in the definition for ``Enrolled in training'' would generate more waivers of the training requirement and increase administrative costs. The Department believes that extending this period in regulations would be difficult to justify. Under the statute, the objective of the training requirement is to get workers actively engaged in training as soon as possible, as a condition of entitlement to TRA. The 30-day requirement eliminates the need for a waiver where the training program is to begin within 30 days, but does not subject the worker to the EB work test while awaiting the start of training. Accordingly, no change is made in the final regulations.
