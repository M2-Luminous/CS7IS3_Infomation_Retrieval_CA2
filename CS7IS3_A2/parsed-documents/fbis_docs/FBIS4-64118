It is located at No. 42, The Arbat. Leonardo Devdariani, the 47-year old Georgian trade representative, says that he was offered the post of head of trade mission in any country, but he believes that "no other state in the world can do what Russia can do for Georgia both from the positive and the negative point of view." And Georgia has something to offer Russia. Russia may count on the use of maritime ports, the railroad (virtually the only one in the entire Transcaucasus region), air transportation, and resorts. In Georgia there is an abundance of raw materials which are scarce in Russia -- manganese, marble, metal arsenic, and ferroalloys. There is the output of the Rustavi metallurgical plant, and citrus fruit and tea grow in Georgia.... A free trade regime has now been declared between the countries -- there are virtually no customs or excise duties on imports, with the exception of around 200 categories of strategic and military goods from Russia. The trade mission intends to create an international association for insuring commercial deals and investments in Georgia. It has the right to conclude direct contracts with Russian producers -- Georgia cannot afford to pay huge commissions to trade agents. Branches of the trade mission are also opening in Tyumen, Saratov, St. Petersburg, and Kaliningrad at the same time as the main office at No. 42, The Arbat.
