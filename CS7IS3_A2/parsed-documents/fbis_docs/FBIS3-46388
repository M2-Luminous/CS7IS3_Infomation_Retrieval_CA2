The Chinese people in particular realize the truth in this because they have led difficult lives owing to grain shortages for considerably long periods of time. Some 30 years ago, we were proud of our lofty aspirations that "we may make the land yield as much grain as we wish so long as we are bold enough to command it," and we were also delighted at the "good news" that "10,000 jin or even 100,000 jin of grain was reaped per mu." However, in 1958, a year full of vigor and dynamism, the total grain yield throughout the country was only 200 billion kg. After that, we worked hard unflinchingly to strive for the targets of 200, 250, and 400 kg per unit area yield in different regions as stipulated in the National Program for Agricultural Development. But, it was not until 20 long years had passed that the country's grain output was raised to the level of 300 billion kgs. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee lifted the curtain of China's rural reform, under which the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output was universally practiced like a spring tide which pushed forward substantial increases in grain yields. Document No. 1 of the Party Central Committee discussed the agricultural issue for five consecutive years from 1982. In 1984, China's grain yield hit a record high by breaking through the level of 400 billion kgs, and per capita grain possession approached 400 kgs for the first time. The total yield of 400 billion kgs considerably mitigated the contradiction between demand and supply of grain in China. In the few years that followed, given some short periods of fluctuation, demand and supply were relatively stable, and great ups and downs did not occur in the markets. Even in 1991 when China was seriously afflicted by floods, demand and supply were basically balanced, and grain prices in the market were stable. The year 1993 once again saw brilliant achievements in grain production as output reached 456.4 billion kg. What needs to be pointed out is that, while guaranteeing the grain production level, peasants have paid greater attention to grain quality, with the proportion of refined and quality grain substantially enhanced, which is quite different from the past. Counties in which grain yield per mu exceeds 1 ton have emerged not only in the south, but also in northern provinces, including Shandong, Henan, and so on. Of course, in order to achieve the goal of 500 billion kg -- total grain yield per year -- by the end of the century, greater efforts are still necessary. Compared with countries that are rich in per capita land resources, our per capita possession of grain is still very low and, compared with countries with high agricultural production levels, the gap is rather big in terms of per unit area yield. However, since the old structure which hindered growth of the productive forces in grain has been broken, we are able to make limited land yield more grain so long as we have appropriate policies and powerful measures.
