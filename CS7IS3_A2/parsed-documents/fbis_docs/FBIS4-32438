Are these five minutes finished now? [Mazowiecki] These five minutes have already lasted five years, and those five years could well have been 15 if we judge by the larger-than-life scale of the events that took place then. Whether our five minutes are still going on is a different question altogether. Certain fundamental issues have been resolved already. We are an independent and autonomous state, all decisions about us are made here and not somewhere else, and the direction of our economic future has been determined. You could say that we are now at a new moment in our history: The first stage is gone, and we must begin to build the second one. [Onichimowski] But is the run of good luck for Poland in the international arena still with us? [Mazowiecki] It is quite surprising, but Poland's economic achievements are noted with approval against the background of Central and East Europe as a whole. It is even said that we are the "economic tigers" in this part of the continent. So you can see that the judgment of outside observers is much more favorable than those from commentators at home. Of course, I understand that such outside arguments are no good when it comes to convincing an unemployed person that our economy is good, but when you look at the problem in the light of all considerations, the opinions and the forecasts are good. [Onichimowski] A few days ago, Jacek Kuron said that our road to Europe leads through the East--via Minsk, Kiev, and Moscow.... [Mazowiecki] I believe that this slogan conveyed the idea that good, open relations with these countries will result in an extended Europe, and, from Europe's viewpoint, the way in which Poland relates to these neighbors is most important. [Onichimowski] But do you not believe that, at present, cooperation with these states has, as it were, slowed down a little? [Mazowiecki] There is something in what you are saying. I believe that we must galvanize our foreign and economic policies. I can also say that I believe Minister Olechowski is trying to do just that. I agree with those who believe that any oversight on our part in these areas would be a serious mistake. However, there is also a wider phenomenon to be considered: The green grass of our new social and economic processes often grows faster than we think. I was once guest at a conference organized by the Robert Schuman Foundation, attended by delegates of a variety of associations and organizations of a pro-European persuasion, and I realized that there are very many such bodies in Poland. So I hope that there are also associations and organizations that are thinking of developing the eastward direction. And, if there are none, we must set them up and encourage them to be active. [Onichimowski] We heard recently from a group of Bundestag deputies visiting Szczecin that our full participation in European structures would be conditional on making land available for sale without any restrictions. Would you accept such a condition if you were prime minister? [Mazowiecki] All countries have certain regulations regulating the sale of land to foreigners. You must not preclude the possibility of such transactions, but the state can control their form and extent. Such control mechanisms are a normal thing and should be preserved. [Onichimowski] As I point out that next year will see the 50th anniversary of the inclusion of Szczecin within our national territory, let me also remind you that you have special obligations toward the citizens of Szczecin. Should we remember our city's 50th anniversary, or should we forget it because it was politically incorrect forces that captured the city and politically incorrect decisions that decreed it would henceforth belong to Poland? [Mazowiecki] No, no.... The anniversary is a most important occasion, and Szczecin, which is a very fine port city, has a significant role to play in both Poland and Europe. [Onichimowski] This sounds a bit as if you were trying to canvas for Szczecinians' votes in the forthcoming election.... [Mazowiecki] I intend to do that, too. I believe that the vote of confidence I received here will be extended to accommodate voters' confidence in the Union of Freedom. I have already noted that the influence wielded by the Union of Freedom in this region is growing steadily, and our activists and sympathizers are dynamic individuals who want to achieve great things not so much for the party as such, but for the whole region--and who are capable of achieving it. Let me tell you--and this is not a superficial compliment--that the Szczecin region could easily become one of the best-developing areas of Poland. [Onichimowski] Thank you for talking with us.
