Eid Franco also confirmed that former President Paz Zamora testified as a witness before the military court in Tarija in connection with the TAB [Bolivian Transportation Airline] case on the alleged irregular purchase of five aircraft during his government. [Begin Eid recording] I want to confirm that at 1700 on 3 March at his residence (El Picacho), Jaime Paz Zamora was questioned as a witness by the Supreme Military Court regarding the TAB case. This legal procedure was fulfilled on 3 March and the Military Court already has the necessary information at hand. I also would like to protest and report the attempt to abduct and arrest fellow partisan Susana Seleme on 3 March in Santa Cruz, a procedure that fully violates our laws. We regret this sort of thing happening in democracy, especially because we already have asked Congress to carry out an investigation. Therefore, these procedures only mar the image of our organization because the only information valid for the adoption of legal measures then will be from an investigation. [end recording]
