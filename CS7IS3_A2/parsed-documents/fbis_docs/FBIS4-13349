The following is the text of the statement: [Passage omitted] Every year and in days similar to these, a happy occasion hovers over Muslims, when the hearts of believers flutter as they go through these days with their hearts full of faith. [passage omitted] This Ministry has noticed that brother individuals coming here are carrying -- either with good intentions, and that is what we believe, God willing, or with a desire to exploit this honorable occasion -- books, photographs, and leaflets for political, propaganda, or ideological aims which would have an effect on some people or directly harm others, contradicting the noble aim of the pilgrimage. Accordingly, the Ministry of the Interior, acting on the information it has received, draws attention to the fact that such things are totally prohibited. The Ministry hopes to give pilgrims the chance to perform their rituals with reverence and without being distracted from the worship that is the purpose of their visit. While stressing this, the ministry hopes that everyone will abide by the above and not overstep the rules. Anyone breaking the rules will be punished and returned to the place he came from. Punishment will be decisive for anyone found carrying prohibited material of any kind. The Kingdom's system of punishment will be applied without leniency or mercy, because this Ministry's responsibility is to protect the safety of pilgrims and citizens and to ensure that this Kingdom is an oasis of goodness and safety for all those coming to the house of God or to visit the Prophet's mosque. While the Ministry stresses the above to all pilgrims, it would like at the same time to remind them of Allah's words: "For hajj are the months well known. If anyone undertakes that duty therein, let there be no obscenity nor wickedness, nor wrangling in the hajj. And whatever good ye do, be sure Allah knows it. And take provision with you for the journey, but the best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me, O ye that are wise." [Koranic verse]
