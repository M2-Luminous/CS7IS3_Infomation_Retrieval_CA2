It covers a land area of 42,794,200 square kilometers, occupying approximately 31 percent of total living space of the world; in 1992 it had a population of 2.094 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the world's population. Compared with the scene of collapse after a setback in the world economy in recent years, a considerable number of countries and regions in this district have maintained an annual average growth rate of over 7 percent for more than 10 years in succession, and so far there has been no slow-down in the momentum of growth. In 1992, the gross domestic product (GDP) of 17 APECO members totalled 12.22745 trillion dollars, which accounted for 50 percent of the world's total; the same year, the total volume of their import and export trade amounted to 3.07145 trillion dollars, which accounted for 43.5 percent of total volume of world trade. Trade among members already occupied 67 percent of total volume of their import and export trade, nearly 50 percent higher than the percentage of trade among European Community members. APECO is the largest regional organization of economic cooperation. The emergence of APECO, fundamentally speaking, is an inevitable outcome of the vigorous development of regional economic integration in the world arena. Following the independence of developing countries one after another in the vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the postwar period, economic development became a major problem they faced together. However, the old international economic order still fettered and impeded the economic development of developing countries whose emphases were on agriculture and the production of raw materials and other primary products. They came to realize that the limited "favor" and "sympathy" given by their original suzerain states could not change the features of their economic backwardness, and that the only effective choice for them was developing south-south cooperation and strengthening collective self-reliance and collective negotiation in dealing with developed countries to improve the environment for economic development and achieve economic progress. Soon afterwards, the Latin American Free Trade Association, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the West African Economic Community, the Caribbean Community, and other regional economic integration organizations of developing countries came into being. After the 1970's, the struggle to set up a new international economic order reached a high ebb, and regional, sub-regional, and inter-regional economic integration organizations of developing countries were built. Currently, there are nearly 30 different governmental regional economic integration organizations and economic cooperation arrangements which include a few developed countries but mainly consist of developing countries. In the last ten years, the rapidly developing progress of regional economic and trade cooperation in the world arena, the enlarged scale of cooperation, and the drastic growth of the extent of integration also promoted the rapid emergence of APECO. In particular, a big united European market already started operation on January 1, 1993, and is moving toward the European Union with economic, currency, and political union as the final goal. Prior to this, the European Economic Zone built up in the form of agreement by the European Community and the European Free Trade Association (except Switzerland), and the new development of multi-lateral economic and trade cooperation arrangements between the EEC countries and some central and east European countries posed fierce challenges to various countries. After many setbacks, the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1, 1994, and became the largest free trade zone in the world. Regional economic integration organizations of developing countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and various places in central, east, and west Africa started developing from loose to close economic cooperation. While continuing to emphasize collective self-reliance, they actively explored the possibility of developing regional or trans-regional economic cooperation with nearby or related developed countries to avoid being excluded from cooperation arrangements and loss of trade opportunities. This proves that with the development of the world economy toward integration and conglomeration, international economic ties have become increasingly close, and strengthening cooperation and exchange with each other has become an indispensable part of economic development. It was precisely under the push by this tide that APECO was set up to better meet global and regional economic and trade challenges, and to make use of and create more opportunities to develop and promote economic prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. APECO has developed rapidly in the last three years. The most important reason lies in consensus brought about among various member states on the basis of joint economic development, with the same goal of and identical steps toward cooperation. The "Seoul Declaration," adopted at the Third APECO Conference at ministerial level, defined the purpose and goal of reducing barriers, upholding opening-up, interdependence, and developing common interests. In the past few years, to achieve these goals, APECO did fruitful jobs at multiple levels. The ministerial-level conference held every year has provided a place for high-level consultation and exchanges of views among members on Asia-Pacific economic issues and trends, the strengthening of the multi-lateral trade structure, regional free trade, and other issues of common concern, thereby deepening mutual understanding and exchanging information. The results of the conferences at ministerial level have not only provided policy guidance, supervision, and inspection for all kinds of work and activities of APECO, but also directly promoted the strengthening of a multi-lateral trade structure for the whole world, and become a catalytic agent for the successful completion of the Uruguay round multi-lateral trade negotiations. The "APECO Trade and Investments Framework Declaration" adopted at the fifth ministerial-level conference laid down a firm foundation and principles for developing substantial economic cooperation among members in the sphere of trade and investments and formulated working plans. If this "Framework Declaration" can be effectively carried out, it will be favorable to the balanced development of APECO economic and trade cooperation and to enlarging economic and trade exchanges among members. At the working team level, trade, investments, science and technology, energy, human resources development, and other departments were bustling with activities which included all sorts of specific items of economic cooperation among members. In the sphere of trade alone, a large amount of cooperation has been developed in a few short years in trade statistics among members, setting up trade and investments data bases, building an Asia-Pacific information communications system, compiling a guidebook to Asia-Pacific investments systems, examination and approval of administrative measures related to market admission, coordination of procedures for passing through customs, setting up Asia-Pacific tax rate data base, unanimity of standards, and promotion of trade for small and medium enterprises. Positive preliminary results have been achieved. The convening of an unofficial meeting of APECO leaders in November, 1993, pushed economic cooperation of the organization to an unprecedented height. Leaders of the original 15 members gathered in Seattle to discuss principles and matters of vital importance concerning Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and to promote economic co-prosperity among members. The "Economic Prospects Declaration" adopted at the meeting once again emphasized that an open multi-lateral trade structure was the basis of economic growth in Asia-Pacific region, and it was determined at the meeting to continue dismantling trade and investment barriers by partnership and in an open spirit to promote greater free flow of commodities, services, and funds among members and between APECO members and other regions in the world. The "Declaration" reiterated its support for developing APECO into a forum devoted to creating practical economic interests for the region, encouraging broadening of economic dialogue among members, strengthening specific cooperation items, and initiating entrepreneurial spirit and a market guidance policy. Feeling no need for reticence, this unofficial meeting of leaders has achieved the results that leaders of most members had expected. However, the convening of this meeting itself is of more profound significance and more far- reaching influence than the specific results achieved at the meeting. The gathering of leaders showed the high degree of concern for and importance attached to APECO and its activities and their determination and confidence in successfully developing Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. The convening of the meeting of leaders has evoked strong repercussions in the world. People are watching closely the movements of APECO and the impact they may possibly have on the world. China is a large developing country in Asia with 9.6 million square kilometers of area and a 1.17 billion population. Since China began the policy of reform and opening-up in 1979, its economic development has advanced full steam ahead and presented a scene of prosperity. In 1992, China's gross domestic product (GDP) amounted to 424 billion dollars, ranking fourth after the United States, Japan, and Canada among APECO members; total volume of China's import and export trade reached 165.6 billion dollars, ranking fifth after the United States, Japan, Canada, and Hong Kong region. In the total volume, China's trade with APECO members amounted to 126.3 billion dollars, accounting for 76 percent of China's total volume of foreign trade. The same year, China actually drew a total of 11 billion dollars of direct investments from outside, of which 10.26 billion dollars from APECO members, 93.2 percent of China's total of direct investments China from outside; the contracted amount of China's technological transfer with APECO members was 3.5 billion dollars, 44 percent of China's total technological trade that year. It can thus be seen: Whether judged by land, population, or by economic scale, including market, China occupies an extremely important position in APECO, and without China's partial or full participation, Asia-Pacific economic cooperation will not be complete and truly effective. On the other hand, APECO is also in extremely important strategic position with regard to China's expansion of foreign economic relations and trade. The prosperity of the Asia-Pacific economy depends to a very large extent on development of China's economy, and development of China's economy must also have the Asia-Pacific economy as an important support. China has traditional and close economic and trade relations with vast numbers of countries and regions in Asia-Pacific district. We attach importance to economic and trade cooperation with all APECO members, and are willing to constantly push such cooperation to further develop in depth. Since joining APECO in 1991, then, and again in 1992, China sent Qian Qichen, state councillor and foreign minister, and Li Lanqing, economic relations and trade minister, at the head of Chinese delegations attending the third and the fourth ministerial-level conferences held respectively in Seoul and Bangkok. In 1993, as foreign economic relations and trade minister, I accompanied Qian in leading a delegation to attend the fifth APECO ministerial-level conference held in Seattle, and set forth the principles and position of the Chinese Government on Asia-Pacific economic trends, the Uruguay Round multi-lateral trade negotiations, progress of free trade in the region, and future movements and the direction of development of APECO. China also actively participated in projects organized and sponsored by other APECO members and did constructive work. In shenzhen in June last year, the first APECO cooperation project in China was held -- a seminar on promotion of export by small and medium enterprises. In May and June this year, China will hold in Beijing an APECO scientific and technological strategic development industrial park seminar and a trade promotion training class. In May and June, 1995, the official conference of APECO trade promotion working teams among governments will be held by China for the first time, also in Beijing. To the above projects and conferences China has already undertaken or promised to undertake, other APECO members respond actively and showed immense interest. They unanimously believe that the activities we hold in China deal with concrete matters related to work and play an important role in promoting visible economic cooperation in Asia-Pacific region. In November, 1993, at the invitation of President Clinton of the United States, President Jiang Zemin went to Seattle to attend the unofficial meeting of APECO economic leaders, which indicated the high importance and enthusiasm attached by the Chinese Government to the cause of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and its concern about the future development of APECO. During the meeting, President Jiang Zemin met officially with President Clinton. This meeting between the chinese and U.S. heads of state has enhanced understanding between China and the United States, is conducive to the development of Sino-U.S. relations and shows that Sino-U.S. relations have entered a new stage. President Jiang also met with the leaders of nine countries, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, exchanged views with them extensively on how to promote Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and on other matters of common concern, and further strengthened China's bilateral relations and economic and trade exchanges with these members. Five years have elapsed since APECO was set up, and there is still a long long way to go. In the large environment of the world today, along what direction and how APECO will further develop economic cooperation among members plays a very important part in whether or not Asia-Pacific economic cooperation can be carried out on a long-term basis, healthily, and effectively. Therefore, this has also become the focus of attention of the fifth APECO ministerial-level conference and an unofficial meeting among leaders. During the Seattle meeting, President Jiang put forward the 16-character policy that should be followed for developing Asia- Pacific economic cooperation: "Mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, opening-up to each other, and common prosperity", and proposed that "Asia-Pacific nations should be geared to the needs of both the Asia-Pacific region and the world; they should be open up to both inside and outside the region"; to develop Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, one "should proceed from the practical situation and characteristics of the region itself, and follow in order and advance step by step," and "APECO should be an open, flexible, and practical forum of economic cooperation and an organization for consultations, and not a closed economic group of mechanisms" and a number of other important propositions. APECO members include both developed countries in the north, with the world's most powerful economic strength, and newly emerging industrialized countries in the south, as well as other developing countries and regions that are rising economically; they each have their own advantages in funds, technology, management experiences, places of investments, labor resources, consumer markets, and other fields. Therefore, they are economically highly compatible with each other and complementary to each other, and have extensive and broad prospects of cooperation. Similarly, compared with economic cooperation arrangements of other regions in the world, APECO also has characteristics that are extremely diversified. The 17 members are varied in size and have great disparity in wealth; there are both sovereign states and regional economies; there are both oriental civilizations and western cultures, and there are immense differences in national tradition and historical backgrounds among members. It is precisely because of such diversity that we are required to adhere to equality and mutual benefits, following in order and advancing step by step, and other important principles, which are both the basis for developing Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and the fundamental guarantee for maintaining long-term and healthy cooperation. Except for the fact that it is impossible for sovereign states and regional economies to be completely equal politically and legally, APECO members should uphold the principle of equality and mutual benefit in every aspect related to economic cooperation. Equality means that each member has the same say on all issues of economic cooperation in which it is interested, and such a say should be respected by other members; in decision-making involving economic cooperation and organizational matters, APECO members should follow the principle of reaching unanimity through consultation on the basis fully developing democracy, and no member should be allowed to control and manipulate any major decision- making or resort to power politics. Disputes arising from cooperation among members should be resolved through every effort of friendly consultation without resorting to wielding and using sanctions or a unilateralist baton. Mutual benefit means that all activities carried out within APECO should be beneficial to all APECO members and not just one party or a small number of members, and not harm the interests of other members. In this respect, we should especially be opposed to the despotic conduct of openly violating the standards of international economic and trade relations by any member to meet the needs of its domestic policies. To develop Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, it is necessary first of all to pursue various important principles laid down in multi-lateral trade structure of GATT, including that of granting each other member unconditional MFN treatment, and it is also necessary to take into full account the actual difficulties of members with low levels of economic development and grant them differential favored treatment. In APECO, if some members set up artificial barriers in their economic and trade relations with other members, and are unwilling even to respect and follow the basic principles of global trade structure and even to grant trading partners in the same regional organization the most minimum treatment laid down in multi-lateral trade structure, then how can we talk about equality and mutual benefit, and about strengthening regional economic cooperation? Regarding opening-up, so far as regional economic cooperation organization is concerned, it is to pursue open regional cooperation. APECO members should first of all open up to each other economically. They should not endlessly demand others to abolish administrative measures and open up their markets to them, while they themselves set up quotas, "automatic export restrictions", and other non-tariff barriers, and close their own markets to others. APECO should not only adhere to opening-up internally, but also to opening-up to the outside world. We must not build ourselves into a closed economic and trading group open only internally and look upon the outside world as competition and objects of contention. The criterion for judging whether or not APECO is open is to see whether or not its code of conduct and activities match with the principles of GATT. Open regional cooperation upheld by APECO is not to go our own way while deviating from the global multi-lateral trade structure, but should coincide with the principles of GATT and the world trade organization that will come into being. All APECO conduct should be based on the global multi-lateral trade structure, and as an important supplement to this structure, APECO should promote its improvement and strengthening. Economic cooperation among APECO members must not affect economic and trade exchanges between its members and other partners outside the organization. The two should supplement and complement each other. The basis of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation is neither common social and political systems, nor common political viewpoints and ideas of value, but the common economic interests of various parties working together. However, when we decide on the mode of cooperation, its growth rate, its direction, and the final structural goals, we cannot but seriously consider and make allowance for the level of development, differences in social and cultural background, and other factors. Within APECO, we neither maintain formulating impractical working plans and goals that aim too high, nor favor designing working speed and a structural frame divorced from reality, and we are all the more opposed to introducing into the sphere of economic cooperation so-called "democracy," "human rights," and other ideas that are not in the least related to economic cooperation. At present and even in the foreseeable future, on the basis of full consultation and seeking common ground while reserving differences, and within the sphere unanimously approved, we should take some feasible action and measures, following in order and advancing step by step, and steadily push forward development of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. Changes and developments in the cooperation mechanism of APECO should also respect and be in accord with the will of all members, and accomplish the situation that when a melon is ripe, it falls off its stem, and that where water flows, a channel is formed. If we go against the will of most members, and push setting up by force some kind of structure when conditions are not yet ripe, it would be in the end like water without a source, or a tree without roots, and it will do harm to the healthy operation and development of Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation.
