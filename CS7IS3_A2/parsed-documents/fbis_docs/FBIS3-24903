He was asked on Thursday [3 February] for comment on reports that the ANC National Executive Committee had given its negotiators a mandate to offer the double ballot to the FA in a further round of constitutional talks scheduled for later in the day. "At present there is no firm proposal yet. When it comes we will have to look at it," he said. Mr Meyer did not deny that the proposal was in the offing, but said much depended on the context within which it was made. He said the government in principle had always favoured a double ballot, "but for pragmatic reasons we favour a single ballot in this election". "However, if a double ballot will bring about an all inclusive settlement, then we will support it," Mr Meyer told SAPA while attending the NP's [National Party] one-day federal congress at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park. Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel and Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte said they understood the two-ballot offer was imminent and that ANC negotiators had even more to offer than just the compromise on the ballot. Both men were confident that progress would be made in what may be the last round of three-way talks between the parties in Pretoria. "I understand the ANC negotiators have been given an ample mandate and that we will be able to do something," Mr Schutte said. At a news conference on the NP's [National Party] election manifesto, NP leader F.W. de Klerk confirmed the government's position on the ballot issue, saying its commitment to a single ballot came about as a result of more important concesssion having been "traded" with the ANC [African National Congress] in December. There were other issues at stake, however, and the government would present its own package of proposals to Thursday's talks. He said the government had started out in favour of a double ballot and was therefore not against it in principle. "But in the final throes of the negotiations here (at the World Trade Centre) the negotiation council reached agreements on points of difference which were more important to us than the double ballot. And because we got important concessions, we said we would accpt one ballot. If we move back to a double ballot then, in a sense, we will get what we wanted originally." Mr de Klerk said that his signing of the the election promulgation on Wednesday did not proclude further amendments to the constitution. "It is a wrong perception that we cannot change the constitution anymore -- I had that specially checked -- but there are time constraints. We cannot do so in March, but we can do so in the next week to ten days," he said.
