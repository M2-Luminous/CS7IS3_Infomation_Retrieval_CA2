Later they were forced to walk for about a kilometre through no-man's-land between Bosnian Serb and Croat forces, before being taken to a UN Protection Force post by Croats. After the theft of their vehicles, the drivers were loaded into a lorry and taken towards the nearby front line, UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] spokesman Peter Kessler said. "They were then lined up in front of a house. At this point it became very, very terrifying for them," he said. "They were told to empty their pockets, to give their belongings to the Bosnian Serbs. When they saw their personal property being thrown on the ground they then feared that they would be shot." After being searched the UNHCR drivers were told to walk on their own to a minefield, holding white flags over their heads and to look out for snipers as it was no-man's-land. It was only after walking about a kilometre they located a post manned by Bosnian Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces at Zepce, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of where they were abducted. The Croats drove the team to a UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] base. "The entire situation was terrifying for the convoy team," Kessler said. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic earlier Thursday told Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy in former Yugoslavia, that the local Serb commander had acted without authorisation. He would be punished, Karadzic said, according to Kessler. The Serb leader also promised his forces would return the nine stolen UN aid-convoy trucks which have since been located. Convoys would again start moving from the Croatian capital Zagreb to the Maglaj region once the United Nations obtained security guarantees, said UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski, adding that convoys were nevertheless still leaving from Zenica, in central Bosnia.
