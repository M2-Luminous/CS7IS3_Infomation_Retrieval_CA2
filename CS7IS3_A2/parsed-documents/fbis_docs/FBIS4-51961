She is a university teacher in Pyongyang. In her letter to the headquarters for the promotion of the repatriation of old Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, the Human Rights Committee of the National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar Association for Democratic Society and the Family Movement for Realizing Democracy in South Korea, she appealed to them to cooperate in the return of her father to the North. She said her father should have been returned to the North at the time of the repatriation of POWs according to the international law on POWs because [words indistinct] while active as a guerrilla, his route blocked in the strategic retreat, after going to the South Korean area during the war. "The South Korean authorities kept my father behind bars for 33 years and seven months for he refused ideological conversion," the letter noted, and stated: "This is a very wrong act ignoring the international law and the humanitarian idea of the Red Cross." She went on: "That my father who is a POW should be returned to the North where his children live at an early date unhindered by any condition and reason, is a unanimous call of the entire fellow countrymen and the conscience of mankind. "I earnestly request once again your organisations which are engaged in righteous activities in South Korea for national reconciliation and unity, democratisation of society and national reunification to continue to show deep concern for the misfortune of my family and make persistent efforts for an early repatriation of my father." Kim Hwa-sim in the letter to her father said the DPRK Red Cross Society urged the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan last year and on April 19 this year, but the South side is taking an unjust attitude toward it. "This is an act ignoring the international law on the POWs," she said. Recalling that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il recently expressed concern over the fate of the unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea and said they should be brought back to the homeland, the letter expressed the firm belief that her father would come back to the hometown, removing obstacles lying in his path to the North, just as he won the struggle for justice for 40 years.
