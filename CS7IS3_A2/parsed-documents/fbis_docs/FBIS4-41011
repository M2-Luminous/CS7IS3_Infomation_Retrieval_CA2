People's Diplomacy As Means of Solving Interethnic Conflicts"] [Text] Shmidt Dzoblayev, general secretary of the Assembly of North Caucasus Democratic Forces, told journalists yesterday about his experience of shuttle diplomacy in establishing contacts between Chechen Republic President Dzhokhar Dudayev and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to Mr. Dzoblayev, he was visited Chechnya 13-15 June to hold talks with the republic's top officials, including President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Shmidt Dzoblayev said that Dzhokhar Dudayev is ready for personal talks with Boris Yeltsin, but he insisted that the meeting be held without mediators, meaning the State Committee for Nationalities Policy, which was earlier headed and is currently supervised by Sergey Shakhray, "the enemy of the Chechen people," and also the President's Administration for Work With Territories, where Doka Zavgayev, former first secretary of the Chechen-Ingush Communist Party organization, currently holds a job. The Chechen president's proposals were passed by Mr. Dzoblayev to Boris Yeltsin through Sergey Filatov and Georgiy Satarov. According to Mr. Dzoblayev, the Chechen president counts on Boris Yeltsin's goodwill despite "the unwillingness of certain forces in Russia to reach accord." Mr. Dzoblayev assured journalists that Chechnya wants to have treaty-based relations with the Russian Federation. Unfortunately, the leader of the North Caucasus democratic forces could not shed light on how precisely the Chechen Republic is going to straighten out its relations with Russia -- whether this will be an agreement between two independent states or whether it will be modeled on the treaty between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan. However, Mr. Dzoblayev said, the Chechnya leaders plan to request guarantees that the republic's citizens be granted immunity from political reprisals by the Russian authorities; in addition, Chechnya fully supports the idea of creating "a CIS defense shield." He noted in particular that according to high-ranking Chechen officials, Dzhokhar Dudayev "sees himself as a Russian officer and is proud of it." As for the geopolitical situation in the region, Mr. Dzoblayev pointed out that many people are concerned by attempts to squeeze Russia out of the Caucasus, something in which Britain is taking a particularly active part, Chechen Republic leaders think. In addition, Shmidt Dzoblayev expressed his regret that the leaders of the North Caucasus republics meet with each other only with Moscow's mediation. Apparently in order to prop up "state diplomacy" Shmidt Dzoblayev and his colleagues are planning to set up 25 June an Assembly of National-Democratic and Patriotic Forces of Russia, which will include various public and political organizations from the republics within the Russian Federation, the Russian Movement for Democratic Reform, and also the Assembly of North Caucasus Democratic Forces. In Mr. Dzoblayev's words, the new organization's activity may become a new level of people's diplomacy aimed at settling interethnic disputes.
