[Dimitrov] There are no reasons to do this. [Denev] Mr. Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary group, and other members of the group have stated that the boycott is a great mistake and only makes things easier for the Communists.... [Dimitrov] The problem is that the answers are given on different planes. If one is referring to slowing down proceedings, to parliament not working particularly well, it is true that this was achieved to a large degree, even previously. In and of itself, the boycott does not slow down proceedings. Nevertheless, in one way or another (slowly and with difficulty, thanks to our deputies' efforts), the proceedings have made progress. Now only 10 clauses of the bill on the judiciary remain to be examined. Meanwhile, over 200 clauses of this bill gave gone through, including some aimed at uncontrolled recommunization, like Article 113. The same is true in many other cases. There is no need to mention that certain dangerous deadlines are drawing near. In the final analysis, we are losing most battles, although we are succeeding in delaying them. I cannot be elated that we have postponed the next tragedy by one day. This is also tormenting our supporters. We are postponing things, but they do not know until when, and they ask themselves whether this state of affairs will not continue until the end of this parliament's term. In other words, they are beginning to suspect that we like this situation and have no inclination to alter things. [Denev] Nevertheless, why did you decide on the boycott and what will you gain from it? [Dimitrov] First, I would like to make one thing clear: No political action, especially in the present situation, carries a 100-percent guarantee of being successful. Politics includes risks, and they are great, especially now. It is childish to demand cast- iron guarantees from anyone. The National Assembly deputies should not demand this either, they should have an excellent understanding of the complexity of the situation. Now, about the boycott. The crisis in Bulgaria is a fact. The Constitution has been violated. Because of the actions of the majority, the public regards parliament as a negation of parliamentarianism. The government is discredited, it has received a vote of no confidence, and its policies are rejected on a mass scale. Public opinion wants elections. Most of the institutions favor elections. Even the Communists [Socialists] at their congress found themselves obliged to issue a call for elections (albeit in rather vague terms). On the other hand, everyone apart from the SDS has his own secret designs: to saturate public opinion with stories about elections, while gradually slowing the ball down and exploiting the summer vacation and the seasonal easing of the economic drama, in the final event, to retain the present government or one similar to it to carry on with the same policies that are so disastrous for Bulgaria. Such a false mitigation of the crisis will have ominous consequences, and we must not allow this to happen. [Denev] Will the boycott help to achieve this? [Dimitrov] The boycott is one of the ways. Parliament is managing to pass some laws, but tension within it is increasing. The Constitution is being violated every day because of the lack of a quorum in the plenary hall. The majority is confused, and processes of disintegration are under way within it. Certain positions are being reassessed. The crisis continues to be evident, and this compels them to seek solutions instead of "mitigating" the situation. In other words, by itself, the boycott is an inadequate means for forcing elections, but it is our most effective method of ensuring that the facts of the political crisis remain evident, of preventing it from being glossed over and consequently gradually sharpening public opinion, all the more because in this manner the SDS clearly dissociates itself from the absurd conduct of this parliament and makes its contribution to future elections. [Denev] Is it not true that some of the laws that are being passed in the meantime may cause great harm? [Dimitrov] This is also a matter of opinion. Most of the laws that the present parliament is considering were drafted by the SDS government of SDS deputies. Now the majority is making them dangerous by amending a small number of specific clauses. In this way, they change the law into its opposite. Unless elections are held, this parliament, with the present majority, will inevitably adopt these laws -- a month earlier or a month later. If we win the elections (and I personally believe that we will have the best chance of doing so precisely now), these clauses will be amended immediately, especially if, when the new parliament is formed, we make slight changes to the National Assembly's rules of procedure so that parliament can operate more quickly. [Denev] Why then, precisely, did you assume the responsibility of suspending the boycott while the clauses of the bill on the judiciary are being considered? [Dimitrov] I think you are asking me this question in the wrong way. We are not stopping the boycott. We declared at the outset, and the SDS National Coordinating Council approved it by vote, that we will enter the plenary hall on all occasions when votes are taken that are connected with the fate of the government and when the electoral law is debated. (I should also say that we will take part then other acts connected with the electoral law are being debated, such as the resolution on personal files.) However, I insisted also including in the formula that we will also enter the hall in the event of a gross violation of constitutional order. This is the case with the restrictions on magistrates and members of the Supreme Judicial Council, which in practice exclude noncommunists from these institutions. Under the Constitution, judges cannot be removed. This means that they are now aiming to gain control of the judicial system for years in the future. This differentiates this bill from every other law. Of course, I have no particular illusions about the parliamentary majority, despite the outright condemnation of this law that is contained in the report of the Council of Europe rapporteurs. Nevertheless, I would not want the Communists to be able to hide their intentions precisely on this issue. Since we will deal with these clauses in the bill later, I do not intend to discuss them now, but I repeat: For me, violation of constitutional law is the dividing line. [Denev] Is it not strange that you, who were in fact against the adoption of this Constitution, are now defending it? [Dimitrov] The Constitution indeed has many shortcomings, and recent events prove it. Under this Constitution, we cannot even get rid of a government that received an outright vote of no confidence. I very much hope that the next parliament will make changes in the Constitution, which includes amending it in accordance with the principles of the Turnovo Constitution, which provides for a sensible division of powers. These principles will have to be further elucidated, and I am ready to discuss them separately. Otherwise, arbitrary rule is being established in the state, and this means that any human right may be violated with impunity. This has nothing in common with democracy. We must fight against arbitrary rule by all means.
