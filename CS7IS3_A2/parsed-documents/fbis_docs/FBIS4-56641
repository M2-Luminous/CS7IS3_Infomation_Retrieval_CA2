Official sources advised the press of the decision today. The decision was made by President Luis Alberto Lacalle at the suggestion of Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas. The minister argued that Uruguay must pay dearly for maintaining a very high external tariff and cannot permit other countries in the region to use the American free trade zone to allow products into Brazil "at a significantly lower cost."
