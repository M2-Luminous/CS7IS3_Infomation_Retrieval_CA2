While deepening its internal reform and accelerating its business development, the autonomous regional radio and television broadcasting department, decided in May 1993 to establish a new mass medium, the Neimenggu economic radio and television broadcasting station, responsible for its own income and expense. This was then approved by the autonomous regional people's government and the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television. Thanks to the year of effort and the enthusiastic support and assistance given by various social circles, the preparation and construction work for this station has been completed. On 18 May, the station will transmit its economic TV programs on a trial basis on channel 26 and its programs will be joined by Neimenggu and Hohhot cable television broadcasting stations as it is fed into the broadcasting network. In addition to the daily relay of the "news hookup" from the central broadcasting station, the region's economic television station will transmit "children cartoons", "television theater", "US television programs digest", and "well-selected domestic and foreign films and TV programs". It will also provide its own columns, such as "economic news", "economic hot line", "information slot", "ETV evening service", "dream about factories", "health guidance", "reporter being beside you", and "regular weekend train".
