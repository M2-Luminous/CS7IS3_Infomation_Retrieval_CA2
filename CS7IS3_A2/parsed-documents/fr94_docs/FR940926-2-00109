FR940926-2-00109 FR940926-2-00088 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing [Docket No. D&hyph;94&hyph;1072; FR&hyph;3781&hyph;D&hyph;02] Redelegation of Authority for Issuing Loan Guarantees AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Notice of redelegation of authority. SUMMARY: Within this notice, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing is redelegating authority under the Section 184 Loan Guarantees for Indian Housing program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z&hyph;13a, to the Director of the Office of Native American Programs, the Deputy Director for Headquarter Operations, the Deputy Director for Field Operations, and the Administrators of Field Offices of Native American Programs. In this program, the Department guarantees certain housing loans made to Indian families and Indian housing authorities. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dominic A. Nessi, Director, Office of Native American Programs, Office of Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room B&hyph;133, 451 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20410, (202) 755&hyph;0032 or (202) 708&hyph;0850 (voice/TDD). (These are not toll free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 184 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992), codified at 12 U.S.C. 1715z&hyph;13a, authorizes the establishment of the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Fund (the Fund) to provide access to sources of private financing to Indian families and Indian housing authorities who otherwise could not acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of Indian trust land. In general, these lands, held in trust by the United States for the benefit of an Indian or Indian tribe, are inalienable. Trust lands under this program also include lands to which the title is held by an Indian tribe subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States. Because title to individual plots does not convey, and liens do not attach, conventional mortgage lending practices do not operate in this forum. The Fund addresses these obstacles to mortgage financing by guaranteeing loans made to Indian families or Indian housing authorities to construct, acquire, or rehabilitate 1- to 4-family dwellings that are standard housing and are located on trust land or land located in an Indian or Alaska Native area. The guarantee of the loan will cover 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest. Borrowers will be required to pay a 1% guarantee fee at closing. A loan term of up to 30 years is permitted by statute, but is not required. In a delegation of authority appearing elsewhere in the Federal Register today, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has delegated all of his authority under the Section 184 Loan Guarantees for Indian Housing program, to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. Within this notice, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing retains and redelegates this authority, except for certain power and authority specifically excepted from the redelegation, to the Director of the Office of Native American Programs, the Deputy Director for Headquarter Operations, the Deputy Director for Field Operations, which positions are at headquarters, and to the Administrators of Field Offices of Native American Programs, in the field. Therefore, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing redelegates as follows: Section A. Authority Redelegated 1. The Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing redelegates, to the Director of the Office of Native American Programs, the Deputy Director for Headquarters Operations, and the Deputy Director for Field Operations, all power and authority of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing with respect to the Loan Guarantees for Indian Housing program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z&hyph;13a (section 184 of the Community and Development Act of 1992), except for the power and authority to issue waivers of regulations. 2. The Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing redelegates, to the Administrators of Field Offices of Native American Programs, all power and authority of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing with respect to the Loan Guarantees for Indian Housing program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z&hyph;13a (Section 184 of the Community and Development Act of 1992), except for the power and authority to issue rules, regulations, and waivers of regulations. Authority: Section 7(d), Department of Housing and Urban Development Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3535(d). Dated: September 19, 1994. Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
