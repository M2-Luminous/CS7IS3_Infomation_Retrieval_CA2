Martin; place and date not given: "Mr. Berlusconi, What Do You Like About Germany?"] [Text] [BILD] Prime Minister, what should the new Italy be like? [Berlusconi] The new Italy will be a happy, more just country that is in a position to deal with its affairs better. Italians have an inclination toward the practical and can also imagine their future. That means they can dream with their eyes open. In other words, the new Italy must demonstrate pragmatism in solving its problems, but at the same time, it cannot lose the ability to develop utopias and possess visions. [BILD] Germany is the first country that you are paying an official visit to. [Berlusconi] There is, of course, a special relationship between Italy and Germany. It is a question of deep ties, of established traditions, mutual contacts, and common cultural origins that have their roots in Christian values. Our economic ties are striking proof of that: Ties between our companies are particularly intensive. Siemens has just bought 50 percent of "Italtel." There is also a significant Italian presence in the eastern German laender. What links us above all is a common, firmly established belief in ideals and democratic patterns of behavior. That is how we triumphed over communism and that is what led to the reunification of Germany. These ideals and patterns of behavior have bolstered our determination with regard to intolerance, racism, and totalitarianism. [BILD] What do you particularly like about Germany? [Berlusconi] To my mind, the most attractive thing about Germany is the mixture of the old and the new. A great classical culture reflected in your exceptional countryside, your geographical landscapes, and your cultural greatness. At the same time, some of your cities are modern machines that produce work, prosperity, as well as science and technology at the highest possible level. What has always impressed me about the speeches I have heard when I visited your country as a businessman or tourist is your sensitivity regarding the environment. One can see that this sensitivity has very deep roots. [BILD] Why have you made neo-fascists ministers in your government? Reservations are also being voiced about that in Germany. [Berlusconi] There are no neo-fascists in my government. The ministers from the National Alliance have nothing to do with fascism. It is enough to read their biographies and ideas. They are firmly anchored in democracy. The party they come from rejected a nostalgic attitude toward its roots years ago. [BILD] There are problems with militant right-wing radicals throughout Europe. [Berlusconi] Right-wing extremism is a problem that has nothing to do with the Italian Government. It is a serious problem and it worries me as well as the German chancellor It is intolerable that 50 years after the defeat of European fascists, nationalism, racism, hostility toward foreigners, and anti-Semitism have appeared once again. I hope that a new climate in Europe, developed by its leaders at the urging of the people, will cause these old ideological phantoms to disappear; phantoms that have been fed by the economic and social crises that we have experienced over several years.
