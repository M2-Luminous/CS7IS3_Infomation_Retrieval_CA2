One of the main elements of Hungarian foreign policy is to catch up with the West and to join the various Western European organizations. Do you consider it conceivable that we will be a full member of the EU before the end of this century? [Thuermer] The opinion of the Workers Party is that not only the means of the foreign policy followed in the past four years but also the objectives of that are wrong. This includes the forced march into the European Union too. I cannot imagine, neither politically nor economically, that Hungary would become member of the European Union before the end of the turn of the century. [Announcer] What is the situation with NATO? Is our membership necessary from a security point of view? [Thuermer] While our opinion regarding EU membership is somewhat ambiguous, for we think that we should not be in such a hurry, but wait until conditions will be more favorable for us, our views regarding NATO membership is totally unequivocal. We think that Hungary has no place in NATO whatsoever. [Announcer] Do you accept the Partnership for Peace? [Thuermer] The Partnership for Peace is a deceiving matter. It is totally without advantages. [passage omitted] We pledge various obligations which only question Hungary's independence even more. [Announcer] As you reject the idea of joining the western organizations, what sort of alternative do you offer? [Thuermer] Our opinion is unequivocal: Hungary should be a neutral country. We are in a situation today when large international processes have not finished yet. [passage omitted] If we cooperate with NATO, all possibility of neutrality will be lost. [Announcer] We have not talked about our eastern neighbours yet. I am thinking of Russia and Ukraine. Would the Workers Party change the relations vis-a-vis these countries? [Thuermer] [passage omitted] We think that Hungary as a Central European country needs balanced and good relations with the great eastern powers, Russia and Ukraine and, at the same time, of course, with the west. The most important thing is to be on good terms with the neighbors. [Announcer] How does the foreign policy of the Workers Party deal with the rest of the neighbouring countries? [Thuermer] I would offer a treaty to all our neighbors. Three things should be laid down in this treaty. The sides should mutually renounce any change of the borders. This is the first thing. [passage omitted]. Second, we should spell out that we mutually guarantee the rights of the national minorities, taking into consideration the European practice and each other's means. The third issue is that we should express our intent that we will cooperate in every field. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Can the southern Slav crisis be solved and how? [Thuermer] The southern Slav crisis could have been settled a long time ago if others had not interfered in it. We have always said that the settlement should be left to the denizens. [passage omitted] The Hungarian Government should say that we are not to take part in any peacekeeping action which concerns the neighbors. It should also be said -- let it be a war situation or not -- that the AWACS planes need to be sent home. [passage omitted]
