The head of the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], Fernando Brito Ruiz, yesterday revealed the start of an ambitious plan to incorporate those ex-rebels into rural DAS units all over Colombia. The official said yesterday that they have reached an agreement with organizations of former rebels all over Colombia, which clearly establishes the commitment that the ex-guerrillas will now have to the state and this investigation organization. Former combatants will be given highly specialized training covering investigation, law, and democracy before being assigned to rural DAS units all over Colombia. The program is based on the knowledge of these areas that the former rebels acquired during their antigovernment activities. DAS sources said the program is designed to boost effectiveness in obtaining information, which should generate better results in the fight against subversive groups. "We are being very careful," said Brito, "about giving them good training and maintaining good control. The status of their activities and the responsibility of each of these men must be very clear." The official also said that leaders of the demobilized groups have made direct commitments to the DAS about supervising the activities of these new rural detectives. The DAS said the leaders will monitor the situation of each of the former rebels, and said that "when a situation arises that is not very clear, they will bring it to the attention of the government or of the organization." Brito also said that at the present time 150 former guerrillas who have been demobilized are working to protect their own leaders. These men were trained by the DAS for this program. The DAS director stated: "Now we are going to begin a rural security program that we will implement through a reasonable process of explanation, training, and evaluation of the aptitudes of the ex-rebels." These men will be subjected to intensive counterintelligence scrutiny in order to minimize the risks of infiltration by subversive organizations operating in Colombia.
