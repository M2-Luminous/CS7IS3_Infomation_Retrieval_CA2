The measures were decided after violent demonstrations by pupils and students shook the Malian capital on 15 February. Four persons, including a gendarme, were injured, and there was considerable material damage. These troubles have led the Malian Government to close down the country's educational institutions "until further notice," and to order the arrest of those suspected of instigating the revolt. The identities and number of persons arrested have not been given. The government did, however, announce that it had ordered the closing down of Radio Kaira," a private FM station that broadcasts in the Bamako area. The radio is said to have close ties to the National Committee for Democratic Initiative, an opposition political party that recently withdrew its three ministers from the government. On 15 February, it opened its studios to demonstrators, who seized the opportunity to call for another gathering the following day. It also denounced the "kidnapping" by "two unknown persons" of a student leader, who was receiving treatment in a Bamako hospital. Unauthorized marches and demonstrations have been going on regularly in Mali since the advent of democracy in March 1991, and it has cost the state about 100 million CFA francs to maintain order, according to some sources.
