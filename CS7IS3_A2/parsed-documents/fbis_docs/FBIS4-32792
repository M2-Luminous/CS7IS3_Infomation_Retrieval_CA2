FBIS4-32792 "drlat104__a94025" FBIS-WEU-94-104-A Daily Report 25 May 1994 ANNEX Cuba Ambassador Explains Position on Rwanda to UN Ambassador Explains Position on Rwanda to UN PA2805012594 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 2326 GMT 25 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA2805012594 Havana PRENSA LATINA Spanish BFN [Text] Geneva, 25 May (PL) -- Cuba today described as unacceptable the link being sought here between the UN Security Council and the Human Rights Commission, indicating that it is up to the Rwandan people to find a solution to the dramatic conflict. The Cuban position was expressed by Ambassador Jose Perez Novoa, who explained that his country will not break the consensus for a special session on the Rwandan situation to adopt a resolution whose concepts Cuba rejects. For Cuba, it is extremely essential that there be a cease-fire, a dialogue and negotiation among all the parties, support for the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its member states, as well as the full application of the peace agreements signed in Arusha, Tanzania, in 1993. The Cuban Government, the diplomat stressed, believes that the Rwandan people are the ones who must find a solution to this dramatic and unfortunate conflict. If the Rwandan parties do not decide to end the confrontation and seek a negotiated solution to their common problems and differences, Perez Novoa said, we will be sad witnesses of the continuation of hostilities, as has been occurring in other conflicts addressed in special sessions by this same commission. Without mentioning it, he referred to the situation of former Yugoslavia, which was discussed in two special sessions of the Human Rights Commission in 1992. In his opinion, the text that was presented created a new dilemma for the participants: approving it to declare themselves against extremely grave violations of human rights would mean acceptance of the imposition of concepts that distort the functions and mandates conferred by the UN Charter to its various bodies. This, he stressed, sets a totally negative precedent for the functioning of the bodies of the UN system. However, he added, by rejecting them, one would turn one's back and remain silent about so dramatic a situation which affects the rights and lives of thousands of human beings. Without a doubt, we cannot refrain from expressing an opinion on the Rwandan events, but neither can we endorse concepts that Cuba has systematically opposed and that some countries are trying to impose by taking advantage of such serious situations, the ambassador added. He stated that the linkage that is being sought by the Security Council is totally unacceptable, as is the inclusion of concepts relative to preventive diplomacy and the eventual establishment of an international tribunal, which in addition, he said, is under discussion. In tacit reference to the situation in the former Yugoslavia, he indicated that it is not a matter of using the same prescription for different illnesses. Prescriptions which, in addition, he said, have been unsuccessful in the cases in which they have been applied. [sentence as received] Considering the seriousness of the events in Rwanda and the feelings of the African peoples, Cuba did not hinder the approval of the resolution, even though it contained concepts that Cuba believes to be unacceptable and which, if submitted to a vote, it would have expressed opposition to.
