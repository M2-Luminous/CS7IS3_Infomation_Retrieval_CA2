The minister and his group were taken to the Sarajevo Presidential Palace in the armored tanks of UN peacekeepers to have talks with Bosnian Vice-President [Presidency member] Ejup Ganic, Foreign Minister Irsan Ljubijankic, as well as Arif Smajkic, minister responsible for refugees and social welfare. Hungary supports a canton system in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Long-suffering Sarajevo could show the world an example of how people can live together in peace, despite different national and religious backgrounds, Jeszenszky said. Lubijankic thanked Jeszenszky for the visit and expressed the Bosnian government's willingness to expand interstate cooperation. After official talks, Jeszenszky met representatives of Sarajevo's 300-strong Hungarian community, mostly connected with the university there, and handed over some of the aid sent for the Humanitarian Association of Hungarians in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
