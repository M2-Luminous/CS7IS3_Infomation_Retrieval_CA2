The article notes that 20 percent of voters approved of Lacalle's administration while 50 percent disapproved. It adds that although the net result "continues to be negative," this is "the best result ever scored by the president nationwide" in all public opinion surveys conducted by Equipos Consultores during Lacalle's term. The second highest was in August 1990 with 33 percent. The article remarks that this growth in Lacalle's popularity is contrary to the general trend in Uruguay since presidents' popularity generally deteriorates at the end of their term. With regard to Mayor Tabare Vazquez, the article states that he continues to command "the approval of more than half" of Montevideo residents. The survey shows that "52 percent" of Montevideo residents approved of Vazquez' administration "while 26 percent disapproved of it." The article remarks that this approval rate was "slightly lower than in previous months." The article concludes by saying: "The information analyzed suggests that, for the time being, the assessment of the president's and mayor's administrations does not show the loss of face that is allegedly expected during the election campaign."
