FBIS3-48800 "dreas019__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-019-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 January 1994 ANNEX Japan * Local Government Ties to Construction Sector * Local Government `Amakudari' 942B0010B Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 8 Oct 93 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0010B Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by YOMIURI SHIMBUN investigation team: "Twenty-Two Urban and Rural Prefectures Do Amakudari Introductions; `Intimate Arrangement' of Local Government and Construction Industry; Allotment and Selection of Persons for Jobs"] [Text] On 7 October it was learned through an investigation by the YOMIURI SHIMBUN Company that 22 urban and nonurban prefectures throughout Japan, and three government-regulation designated cities are using their good offices to enable officials who are scheduled to retire to find employment in the construction industry and are transmitting to industry members information on officials who are scheduled to retire. At least seven urban and nonurban prefectures among these 25 autonomous bodies have established "amakudari [the practice of retiring officials assuming good positions in the industries with which their agency deals] systems" in which reemployment committees, construction-related departments, and so on become interface points to handle such business as selecting former officials and allotting them to each company. In response to it being pointed out that amakudari has become a hotbed of "government-industry adhesion," in August [1993] the Ministry of Construction set forth the policy that it would independently refrain for the time being from amakudari of executive-level officials, but in local government, only Okayama Prefecture gave up amakudari recommendations. And only two prefectures, Chiba and Tottori, indicated that they would "reconsider." Local governments that are using their good offices and introducing retiring personnel are of two types: 1) ones in which the autonomous body allots and selects personnel if there is a request from contractors for their former officials to take a position upon retirement--Iwate, Miyagi, Tokyo, Shiga, Wakayama, Yamaguchi, and Ehime; and 2) ones which, if there is a request, ask the retiree's own wishes and make an introduction--Hokkaido, Aomori, Chiba, Kanagaws, Niigata, Shizuoka, Mie, Osaka, Hyogo, Tottori, Kagawa, Kumamoto, Nagasaki, Oita, and Miyazaki Prefectures and the cities of Sapporo, Chiba, and Nagoya. Typical of the first type is Miyagi Prefecture, whose former governor, Shuntaro Homna, was arrested. The usual practice is for such industry members as general contractors to submit to the prefecture documents called the "application for transfer of talented staff" and "employment application," and for the Construction General Affairs Section, for example, to allocate reemployment positions by checking the inclinations of the retiree with those of the company. In Yamaguchi Prefecture an employment committee headed by the lieutenant governor studies reemployment positions for those scheduled to retire based on "transfer applications" from construction companies. Finding reemployment via one's own connections is called "self-development," but such cases are 20 to 30 percent. The majority are said to find new positions in the private sector through the good offices of the prefecture. In Tokyo, each bureau coordinates through its own connections, and at the Bureau of Construction the bureau's executives become the point of interface, receiving requests from companies and introducing staff to prospective new employers. There are also many cases in which the contractor-side designates the person desired; in Aichi Prefecture contractors were making inquiries to the persons in charge of the Civil Engineering Division and Construction Division regarding such things as prospective employees' efficiency reports and state of health. The Ministry of Construction not only independently refrained from amakudari for its own officials at the division-chief and office-chief levels, and at the department-chief and above level in local construction bureaus, but also made a practice of obtaining from general officials a written promise that they "will not engage in the operation of public works construction." But on the local government side there is a strong view that, "in order to make the most of officials' experience and technology after their retirement, one ought not establish limits to the places in which they can be reemployed. Firms in which former officials find employment do not have an advantage in bidding and so on." In regard to using good offices and making introductions, standing out are such opinions as "We are different from places like Sendai and have no special problem, so there is no need to change" (Yukio Yamauchi, chief of Niigato Prefecture's Civil Engineering Department), and "Civil Engineering Department former officials who have found positions in the private sector are generally in charge of operations, but the objective of operations is to receive designation [as an approved bidder], it does not go beyond that" (Tetsuo Enamiya, chief of Kochi Prefecture's Civil Engineering Department). For Okayama Prefecture, which has a positive attitude toward independent restraint, it had become a usual practice for two to five of the 10 or so persons who retire annually from the Civil Engineering Department to find new employment by receiving recommendations from the department chief, but beginning in the current fiscal year the prefecture stopped serving as a connection.
