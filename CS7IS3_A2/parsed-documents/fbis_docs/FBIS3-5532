Taking advantage of his visit, the Japanese Government plans to seek ways to resume the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain suspended, and to seek an understanding with the United States about Japan's efforts to open its market by explaining these efforts to Christopher. He will be the first U.S. cabinet member to visit Japan since the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act was revived. Christopher will meet separately with Prime Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata and will deliver a speech to the opening ceremony of the "International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia" to be held 10-11 March in Japan. He will also attend the first Japan-U.S. security consultations (the so-called 2-Plus-2 talks) to be held on 11 March in Tokyo, with senior foreign and defense officials from the two countries attending. U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan Spero, who is in charge of economic affairs and who arrived in Japan on 8 March prior to Christopher's visit, will meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Matsuura on the morning of 9 March. At separate meetings with Secretary of State Christopher, Prime Minister Hosokawa and his cabinet ministers will brief him on a new package of economic stimulus measures, as well as Japan's measures to open its market, measures which the government plans to map out by the end of March. They will also seek his understanding of Japanese plans to create an environment for reducing its current account surplus through a steady expansion of domestic demand. In addition, they will consult with him on a set of compromise proposals by the Japanese private sector for settling bilateral negotiations on such sectors as cellular phones, automobiles, and semiconductors. During the separate meetings, they will ask that the United States cautiously deal with the revived Super 301 provision.
