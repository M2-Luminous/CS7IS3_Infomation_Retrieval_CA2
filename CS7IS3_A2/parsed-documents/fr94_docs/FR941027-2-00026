FR941027-2-00026 FR941027-2-00014 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket Nos. CP92&hyph;595&hyph;002 and CP92&hyph;606&hyph;003] Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff October 21, 1994. Take notice that on September 29, 1994, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes) tendered for filing First Revised Sheet No. 4, Original Sheet No. 4A, and Second Revised Sheet No. 6 to its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1. Great Lakes states these proposed tariff sheets were filed to reflect Great Lakes' compliance with the Commission's January 26, 1994, orders in Docket Nos. CP92&hyph;595&hyph;000 and CP92&hyph;606&hyph;000. Great Lakes states that the Commission's orders authorized Great Lakes to construct facilities to provide Part 284 blanket transportation service to Rochester Gas and Electronic Company and Sithe/Independence Power Partners, L.P. Great Lakes explains that the Commission recognized that there would be an additional 12,000 Mcf of capacity available per day. Great Lakes relates that it conducted an open season which resulted in Mercury Exploration Company becoming the shipper for that capacity. Great Lakes asserts that the sheets reflect the separately stated incremental rates set forth in the Commission orders for such services. Great Lakes requests that the tariff sheets become effective November 1, 1994. Great Lakes relates that construction was completed earlier than expected, and the facilities authorized in Docket No. CP92&hyph;606&hyph;000 will be able to be placed into service on November 1, 1994, rather than the originally estimated date of January 1, 1995. Great Lakes states that this filing has been served on all of its customers and the Public Service Commissions of the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Any party desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before October 28, 1 994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
