FR940217-0-00014 FR940217-0-00005 However, the FAA has been advised that 56 of the affected U.S.-registered airplanes have been inspected in accordance with the requirements of this AD. Therefore, the future economic cost impact of this rule on U.S. operators is now only $322,080. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

Applicability: All Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the flap vane lugs, which could ultimately lead to separation of the flap vane from the airplane and pose a danger to persons and property on the ground, accomplish the following: (a) Within 1,800 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, inspect the inboard and outboard lug of each flap vane to detect cracks and corrosion, in accordance with Lockheed TriStar L&hyph;1011 Service Bulletin 093&hyph;57&hyph;199, Revision 1, dated May 5, 1993. Note: Inspections and rework previously accomplished prior to the effective date of this AD in accordance with the original issue of Lockheed TriStar L&hyph;1011 Service Bulletin 093&hyph;57&hyph;199, dated January 21, 1988, are considered in compliance with this paragraph and do not need to be repeated. (b) For any lug that shows no evidence of cracks or corrosion, prior to further flight, rework the lug bore in accordance with part II of the service bulletin. (c) If any lug has corrosion or cracking that is within the limits specified in the service bulletin, prior to further flight, accomplish the rework procedures in accordance with Part III of the service bulletin. (d) If any lug has corrosion or cracking that exceeds the limits specified in the service bulletin, prior to further flight, replace the lug with a new or serviceable part in accordance with the service bulletin. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office (ACO). Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Atlanta ACO. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (g) The inspection, rework, and replacement procedures shall be done in accordance with Lockheed TriStar L&hyph;1011 Service Bulletin 093&hyph;57&hyph;199, Revision 1, dated May 5, 1993.
