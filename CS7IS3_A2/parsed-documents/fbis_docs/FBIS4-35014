In addition, the bank will handle interest rates, exchange rates, international monetary reserves, and other variables to counter exchange market speculation brought about by the political climate and international financial instability. The bank says it has not changed its pledge to the Congress on monetary policy, according to which, at the end of the year, the difference between the lower and upper limits of the floating rate would be 13.9 percent with a daily decrease of 0.0004 and the exchange rate would close at 3.4760 pesos. Official and private sources have reported that international monetary reserves at present exceed $26 billion, more than $1.5 billion above the figure at the end of 1993, and that reciprocal credits, which were granted by Canada and the United States to shore up Mexico's monetary stability and which are worth nearly $7 billion, have not yet been used up. The sources said that, despite difficult circumstances, political concerns, in particular, the flow of foreign capital into the country remains constant and that this situation will continue as long as the macroeconomy remains steady. This has helped keep the interbank exchange rate within the limits of the central bank's intervention guidelines. The bank reports that, until 11 June, government securities in circulation -- treasury certificates [cetes], federal government development bonds [bondes], treasury bonds [tesobonos], and adjustment bonds [ajustabonos] -- and in the hands of foreign investors amounted to 76.791 billion new pesos, the largest amount since 5 April and the equivalent of 31.81 percent of the total. In addition, stocks of Mexican enterprises operating abroad continue to be bought in the stock market. In the past 15 days, Banxico has countered speculation on the Mexican peso, mainly through interest rates and the issuance of treasury certificates and bonds for amounts below the investors' demand, as was observed in the most recent two auctions. The Bank has allocated larger amounts of the issuances less in demand, those to mature in 28, 182, and 364 days. Also, the bank applies a mixed policy regarding interest rates; it lowers the rates on short-term issuances and maintains or raises them slightly on the issuances that mature in 182 and 364 days. A small amount has been made available for the more popular issuances, those that mature in 91 days. Furthermore, the bank lowers or raises the interest rate with these instruments as necessary to control speculation. The yield rate of treasury bonds has even been reduced. The trend toward stability in financial markets was disrupted by Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination on 23 March. Since then, the bank has used either an interest rate policy -- the Bank even establishes ceilings -- higher exchange rates within the flotation rate, monetary reserves, or other variables to deal with instability and speculation. The sources consulted also described as wild the devaluation suggestions presented by economist Rudiger Dornbusch because, the sources said, this policy is not necessary to increase exports and because the dollar's devaluation regarding other currencies improved the competitiveness of Mexican exports to Europe, Asia, and Japan. Banxico pointed out that its main goal is to strengthen monetary stability, that the effect of a devaluation would be more negative than positive, and that such a move would create considerable mistrust among the economic agents and the people in general. The Bank closely monitors the status of foreign markets and their effects on the local market in order to counteract any incoming turbulence, particularly because of the departure of large speculative capital from repercussions, in an operation that seeks to make quick profits, especially in emerging markets.
