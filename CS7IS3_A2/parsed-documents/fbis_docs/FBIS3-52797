They made the decision after talking with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, who promised that Force 17 in Hebron was not set up at his instruction nor that of the organization's leadership. 'Arafat blamed "an Arab intelligence apparatus" (he was apparently referring to Jordan) for setting up the body. The activists who withdrew their resignations -- Jibril al-Bakri, Dhiyab al-Sharabati, and Ihsan al-Nazir -- telephoned 'Arafat Friday night in order to inform him that they resigned because of organizational deviations by the Fatah leadership, various appointments in the region, and an attempt to set up a security apparatus, Force 17. The activists said that "bad elements, which have always been outside the national consensus and constitute the remnants of the village associations, headed by Muhammad al-Nasir, are responsible for the establishment of the force. A message sent to 'Arafat in the name of the activists in the various Fatah committees in the region was disseminated Friday. It detailed the reasons for the resignations and the demand to correct Fatah's internal situation, including the election of the organization's committees by mass conferences and democratic elections. 'Arafat made clear to the three activists his positions on the issues they raised and called on them to withdraw their resignations. He stressed that no order has been issued by any authorized body in Fatah Tunis for the establishment of "a presidential guard apparatus" or "Force 17 militias" in the territories. He said that Fatah has nothing to do with any militia or with Muhammad al-Nasir. 'Arafat told the three that a hostile Arab intelligence service is behind "the announcements about appointments and the establishment of bodies outside Fatah's legal organizational framework." He claimed that only the organizational framework that existed prior to 13 September is considered legal and binding, and that Fatah's central committee in the Hebron area would be in charge of dealing with all the attempts by others to intervene in Fatah affairs. Despite the tension among Fatah activists in the Hebron region, a festive gathering was held in East Jerusalem by Fatah activists in the town on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the organization's establishment, which really took place on 1 January. Activists who participated in the event said the delay was because "the Jerusalem gathering was held after similar events took place in various regions, in order to underline the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Falastin, where the main rally was held."
