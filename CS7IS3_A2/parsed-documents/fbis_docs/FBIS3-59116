Information provided by the Commission reveals the following: (a) Following the G-7 meeting in Munich in July 1992 (which should be considered the starting point of international assistance to improve nuclear safety because it gave rise to a multilateral action program and the decision in principle to create a multilateral fund of 700 million dollars), the EC accepted responsibility for coordinating implementation of the program agreed in Munich within the G-24. In early 1993, work to create the multilateral fund was concluded and its administration has been entrusted to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD]. Since the implementation of the Munich action program, a total of 506 assistance programs have been listed in the G-24 data bank, involving 16 donors (including the European Union), five international organizations and 15 beneficiary countries. These 506 programs involve a total of ECU461.25 million, of which more than 60 percent is provided directly by the EC (through its PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] and TACIS [CIS Technical Assistance] programs) and by the member states; (b) Regarding the organization of implementation of the Munich action program, the EC has contributed to a large measure in the achievement of several positive results, in particular: - three working groups (Kozloduy, Training and Civil Liability) are fully operational, while three other issues (Slovakia, RMBK and Regulatory Authorities) are being handled in ad hoc working groups; - institutional arrangements are fully operational (the Plenary Group meets twice a year and the Steering Committee four times a year). A secretariat has been established with the status of an independent unit within Directorate-General XI of the European Commission (it comprises European civil servants and national experts from Germany, Belgium, France, Japan, United Kingdom and Russia); - the data bank has reached an advanced state of development and is now being used by the secretariat and members of the G-24 as a tool for the administration of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. The system will be perfected soon so as to make distance access possible. Moreover, the secretariat's missions in Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria have made it possible to incorporate the data bank into national programs for the improvement of safety being developed in these countries without Western assistance; - information on projects underway is provided by means of a quarterly publication (NUSAC News). (c) In addition to participation in decisionmaking and multilateral fund management bodies, the EC has established close technical cooperation between the G-24 secretariat and the EBRD secretariat (meetings are held regularly in Brussels). The Commission notes that this cooperation has already proved productive regarding the case of the nuclear power station in Kozloduy (Bulgaria), with approval of an initial project totalling ECU25 million on which the G-24 Kozloduy working group has issued a favorable technical opinion. An identical procedure is underway for the Ignalina station in Lithuania and will be used subsequently for a number of projects in Russia. (d) Regarding the outlook for 1994, a stepped-up effort will be made to improve coordination of aid to beneficiary countries in the area of legal matters so as to establish international confidence facilitating the exchange of know-how. Two specific aspects will be the focus of this initiative: - the development of an appropriate framework in terms of civil liability to enable Western suppliers to more easily deliver equipment and material. The G-24 ad hoc group on civil liability will continue providing follow-up to national developments in nuclear law and will continue its contacts with the nuclear industry and the insurance sector; - the development of legislation on intellectual property.
