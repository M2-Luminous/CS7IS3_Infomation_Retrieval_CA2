This introduction resulted in compensating the Zionist enemy for an incomplete condemnation of the massacre with a new and serious U.S. position on the occupation of Jerusalem. Washington abstained on an article of the draft resolution that considers Jerusalem as an occupied territory. This is a tragic position that needs an open U.S. explanation. His majesty's statements to AFP stressed his disappointment and great fears about the shift in the U.S. position. Despite all the efforts his majesty made before the vote on the draft resolution, the United States maintained its position because the Palestinian-U.S. dialogue, which other Arabs did not join, led to this devastating result and placed the entire Arab nation at a serious turning point concerning the occupation of Jerusalem. This requires an explanation by the PLO first, and also by other Arabs, particularly those who have always stressed their determination to perform prayers in Jerusalem! Resolution 904 is one of the bitter fruits and devastating results of the Arab situation. Certain people are eager to maintain Arab estrangement and differences. At a time when these people are encouraging capitulation to the Zionist enemy and giving material and moral bribes to each party that shows readiness for this capitulation, we find out that these people continue to pay such bribes in order to maintain Arab fragmentation, grudges, and weakness. This tempted others into destroying us during the Gulf catastrophe, and is now tempting them into bringing about further destruction and humiliation. King Husayn's statement was replete with bitterness and disappointment. To his majesty and to all genuine Arabs and Muslims, Jerusalem is our spiritual capital, so any position hostile to its Arab and Islamic character will evoke the king's anger and indignation. Resolution 904 was another opportunity for the Arab nation to identify those who really care for both Jerusalem and every inch of our holy places, and also to identify those who do not hesitate to sell out both Jerusalem and these holy places. Meanwhile, we have not seen or heard a move designed to condemn the attempt to legitimatize the occupation of Jerusalem. Instead, we have seen people reversing all their bargaining chips and standing alongside the enemy, despite the fact that the Arabs denied the United States neither funds nor subservience, but rather kept serving the United States. Naturally, we are referring here to those Arabs who were not shocked by the serious U.S. position and who did not make efforts to crystallize an Arab or Islamic position that would enable us to confront this situation. Moreover, these people demonstrated grudges, bad manners, and rancor to their brethren whereas they demonstrated love, cordiality, and good treatment to the enemy!
