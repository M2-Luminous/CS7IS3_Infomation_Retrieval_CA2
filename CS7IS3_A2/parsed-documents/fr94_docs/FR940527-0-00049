Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;12 applies only to selected sources in Cuyahoga County. Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;13 applies only to selected sources in Jefferson County. Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;14 applies only to identified sources in Cuyahoga and Jefferson Counties. A second group of elements of Ohio's submittal is the documentation of the State's demonstration that the regulations provide for attainment in Cuyahoga County and in the Steubenville area, including a comprehensive emissions inventory and documentation of a dispersion modeling analysis. A third group of elements in Ohio's submittal is administrative and regulatory material, principally to demonstrate the adequacy of the State's rule adoption process. III. Summary of Review in Notice of Proposed Rulemaking The notice of proposed rulemaking provided a regulation-by-regulation review of the State's submittal. Since the public comments did not question the review of most of these regulations, this review is not repeated here. The test method for measuring solids in quench water, given in Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;03(B)(10)(c), was found not approvable because the provision for monthly averaging provides insufficient limitation on 24 hour average emissions levels and allows noncompliance with the limit for a majority of the time. The quench water limit in Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;12(P)(6)(a) was found not approvable simply because it is inseparable from the unapprovable test method in Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;03(B)(10)(c). Otherwise, the conclusion of this review was that all regulations are approvable. The stack opacity provisions of Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;07(A) contain several provisions allowing sources to claim exemptions from the applicable opacity limitation due to factors such as malfunction, startups, shutdowns, soot blowing, and ash pulling. Generally, under the CAA and U.S. EPA policy, sources are required to meet, without interruption, all applicable emission limitations and other control requirements. For an exemption from such requirement of continuous compliance to be justified, the source must prove that an exemption applies and that the violation could not have been prevented. In accordance with these principles, USEPA has conducted a further evaluation of various aspects of the stack opacity provisions of Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;07(A). This rule provides that stacks must generally exhibit 20 percent opacity or less, except for one 6-minute period of up to 60 percent opacity. Exempted from these limitations are restricted conditions of malfunctions, startups, shutdowns, soot blowing, and ash pulling. The rule authorizing the exemptions is approvable so long as it is interpreted and applied consistently with the requirements of the CAA and U.S. EPA policy regarding such exemptions. In the case of malfunctions, the exemption is not available unless the malfunction was unavoidable and unless the source has notified the State of the claimed malfunction, demonstrated that it performed proper operation and maintenance, and met various other conditions. USEPA policy requires such regulations to place the burden of proof on the source to demonstrate that the conditions for applicability of the malfunction exemption are met, including: that the claimed malfunction was caused by circumstances entirely beyond the control of the source; could not have been prevented through installation of proper control equipment, or through proper operation and maintenance procedures; and that any activity which is or should be planned, or can be foreseen and avoided, is not properly excused as a malfunction. USEPA interprets Ohio's regulation to place this burden of proof appropriately on the source. In accordance with USEPA policy, USEPA interprets Ohio's regulation to provide that the enforcement authority (Ohio EPA, USEPA, or both) must then evaluate whether the exemption has in fact been demonstrated to apply. Similarly, in the case of startups and shutdowns, an exemption from the general opacity limit is available only until flue gas temperature reaches 250 ○F or for a 3-hour period, depending on the control equipment in place. In cases where a source claims high opacity values are to be exempted, USEPA interprets Ohio's rule to place the burden on the source to document, based on temperature or operation records as appropriate, that the exemption applies. USEPA also interprets the exemption for soot blowing and ash handling to apply only if the source can provide documentary evidence to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency (Ohio EPA, USEPA, or both) that the exemption criteria are satisfied. USEPA is approving the rule containing above types of exemptions based specifically on these interpretations of Ohio's rules, and with the understanding that the exemptions are to be strictly interpreted, as well as applied in a method that is consistent with the prohibition of relaxation of existing control requirements in section 193 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7515. For further guidance on interpretation of exemptions see 42 FR 21472 (April 27, 1977). Additionally, with regard to the above exemptions, U.S. EPA will treat the submission of any incomplete or erroneous information by a source as a violation of this regulation, and will not allow an exemption supported by such information. U.S. EPA's action does not constitute advance approval of any exemptions which may be claimed or issued under Ohio's regulations. Thus, U.S. EPA may take independent enforcement action to the extent allowed by sections 113 and any other applicable provisions of the CAA, notwithstanding the issuance of an exemption by the State. The fourth section of the notice of proposed rulemaking provided a review of whether the submittal satisfied the requirements of section 189. These requirements apply to plans for particulate matter nonattainment areas, which in Ohio include Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County in and near Steubenville. Section 189(a)(1)(A) requires a suitable new source review program, and is being addressed in a separate rulemaking. Section 189(a)(1)(B) requires a demonstration that the plan will provide for attainment no later than December 31, 1994, or, alternatively, a demonstration that attainment by this date is impracticable. Section 189(a)(1)(C) requires the implementation of RACM by December 10, 1993. Finally, Section 189(e) provides that ``control requirements *␣*␣* for major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 shall also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the standard in the area.'' The notice of proposed rulemaking provided a lengthy review of the attainment demonstrations for Cuyahoga County and the Steubenville areas. This discussion included a detailed description of the limits and means of estimating corresponding allowable emissions from stack sources, process fugitive sources, and open dust sources, as well as the modeling procedures used to evaluate the air quality impacts of these emissions. Although the State used appropriate estimates of emissions allowed under applicable limitations for most sources, the emissions estimates for a few sources in the Steubenville area were found to significantly underestimate the emissions permitted by the applicable regulations. The notice discussed emissions from Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel's basic oxygen furnace (BOF) in particular detail, as well as discussing coke oven emissions and condensible particulate matter. Most aspects of the dispersion modeling analysis were found acceptable. However, the notice referenced various deficiencies in both the emissions inventory and modeling analysis identified in the technical support documents for this rulemaking, including improper selection of an allowable emissions rate for certain boilers, use of urban dispersion coefficients in modeling area sources, and inadequate consideration of complex terrain. Based on a further modeling analysis, USEPA proposed to find that the Cuyahoga County plan assures attainment, provided the State makes its quench water limit fully enforceable, but that the Steubenville area plan does not assure attainment. The next element of the notice of proposed rulemaking concerned the requirement for RACM. In accordance with the ``General Preamble,'' published April 16, 1992, at 57 FR 13498, USEPA believes this requirement can be satisfied without full implementation of all potentially reasonably available control measures, provided attainment is assured by the RACM deadline of December 10, 1993, and provided attainment could not be expedited by more rapid implementation of measures. (See 57 FR 13543.) For most of Cuyahoga County, these provisos were found met, and the RACM requirement accordingly satisfied. However, for Ford Motor Company's Cleveland Casting Plant, certain measures necessary for attainment were not required to be implemented until the end of 1994, nor did the State demonstrate that measures required by December 1993 represent the full set of reasonably available control measures. On the other hand, USEPA concluded that the Steubenville area plan did require the full set of reasonably available control measures by December 1993.
