Through Eurovision exchange, we received brief statements by Akashi and the leader of the Bosnian Muslims after their meeting in Sarajevo in the morning. [Begin recording] [Akashi in English with superimposed translation in Serbo-Croatian] The attack stopped as of 1800 yesterday. However, we have to work first on a greater UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] presence. A larger number of armored vehicles should be sent and General Rose will go there very soon -- tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. At the same time, we are determined to work on a general, global cease-fire, not only the one between Muslim and Croatian sides, but also including the Serbian side, so as to establish basis for a real, lasting, and global peace. [Izetbegovic] As regards a general cease-fire, we are of the opinion that one should place the surrender of heavy weaponry in the center of the question. In our opinion, there will be no peace without that. [end recording]
