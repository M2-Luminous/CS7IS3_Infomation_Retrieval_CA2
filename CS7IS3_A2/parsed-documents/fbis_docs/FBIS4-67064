Perez Balladares stressed that if he wins the presidential elections, he will implement a vigorous policy against drug trafficking. [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I came for a drug test because I think the Panamanian people have the right to demand and to know whether their candidates are using chemical substances. I also had a stress test because I think the next president should have enough physical stamina and be in good enough health to keep the promises made to the Panamanian people. [Ortega] Could this be viewed as a prelude to your government's policy against drugs? [Perez Balladares] You can be sure that if I took the test, I will demand that everyone else do likewise. [passage omitted] [Ortega] Why did you take the drug test? Have other candidates done the same? [Perez Balladares] I hope we all do it. I think it should be done as a sign of respect for the Panamanian people so they can be sure that none of us use any type of chemical substance. [end recording] [passage omitted]
