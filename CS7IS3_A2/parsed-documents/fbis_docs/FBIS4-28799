"If a resolution is adopted, we will take responsible action within the bounds of our constitution," the premier was quoted as saying in a telephone talk with Clinton. He was referring to a possible UN resolution calling for sanctions against Pyongyang because it refuses to allow further inspections of its nuclear facilities, suspected of being used in a push to develop nuclear weapons. During the 20-minute conversation, Clinton said the U.S. perceives the North Korean nuclear issue as posing problems for nuclear nonproliferation and global security, the official said. The U.S. President also spoke of the need for the United States, Japan and South Korea to take a united front in persuading Pyongyang to allay international concerns over its suspected nuclear program. Clinton voiced grave concern over North Korea's reported decision to immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), adding the international community should keep an eye on any move by the communist nation, the official said. North Korea said Monday it will immediately withdraw from the IAEA over the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog's "unreasonable sanctions" and its attempt "to intrude even into our military sites." Noting China has to play a key role in encouraging North Korea to clear its suspicions on its nuclear program, Hata said Japan will keep in close touch and cooperate with the U.S. in pursuit of resolution of the issue. The premier also said he shares with Clinton the view that the UN Security Council is nearing the stage of deciding on appropriate steps, including sanctions, in dealing with North Korea, the official said. Hata denied Tokyo's reported reluctance to levy sanctions on Pyongyang, saying it is way off the mark. Asked to comment on Russia's proposal to call an eight-party international conference to resolve the nuclear fray on the Korean peninsula, Japan's chief executive responded he evaluates highly Moscow's efforts but noted the Security Council's move should not be affected by such a gathering. While showing understanding of Hata's view, Clinton said the U.S. will seek to cooperate with Russia on the matter, the official said.
