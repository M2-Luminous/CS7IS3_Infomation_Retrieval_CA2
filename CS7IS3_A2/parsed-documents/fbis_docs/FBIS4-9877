In statements to the press at Jose Marti International Airport, Robaina said he will discuss with the authorities of the countries he will visit the two summits scheduled for this year: the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and the one in Miami convened by U.S. President William Clinton, in which Cuba will not be participating. Robaina described his visit to Paraguay, with which Cuba has no diplomatic relations, as semiofficial, and said it will be useful to expand mutual understanding. Foreign Minister Robaina reiterated his wish for Cesar Gaviria's success as head of the OAS, a post to which he was recently elected.
