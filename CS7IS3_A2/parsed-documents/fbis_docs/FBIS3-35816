According to him, the lifting of tough state control over the press does not mean the press is now free, because mafia-like structures are all too eager to snatch control over information outlets. "Unless the press becomes economically independent, one monopolist will only be replaced by another," Poltoranin said. For this reason, demonopolisation of the press is seen by him as the key issue in the work of the Russian State Duma's Information Policy Committee he heads. Poltoranin, who said in an interview published by ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA today that the committee he is now heading has many ideas concerning the demonopolisation of the press, stressed that his ultimate goal was to "to deprive all power structures of their own pocket information outlets". "All publications must be independent", Poltoranin said, "and the government should subsidise new publications only during the first year of publishing. If authorities want their decrees and resolutions to be published, they must sign contracts," Poltoranin concluded.
