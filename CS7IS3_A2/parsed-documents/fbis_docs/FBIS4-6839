Emerging from a meeting of senior party lawmakers, Acting Chairman Kim Won-ki also told reporters that the DP would call for the entire cabinet's resignation. "The Constitution requires that the cabinet be appointed through the recommendation of the prime minister. Moreover, the resignation of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, according to the announcement of Chongwadae [presidential office], is something like reprehension. So the cabinet must resign en masse in consideration of the spirit of the Constitution and the mistakes made by the incumbent cabinet," said Kim. The major opposition party also decided to take issue with the constitutional, political and even moral procedures of Yi's resignation before dealing with the approval of the new prime minister at the National Assembly. According to Kim, the DP will demand that the National Assembly convene a separate, full assembly session to discuss Lee's resignation. The demand will be made during Monday's National Assembly meeting, called to handle the Sangmudae scandal involving suspected bribery in the relocation of military facilities in Kwangju, the southwestern provincial capital. Kim also cited the poor performance of Prime Minister-Designate Yi while serving as unification minister as the party's reason for opposing his appointment. DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek, now on a U.S. tour, will return to Seoul Monday to tackle the volatile domestic political situation, Kim said.
