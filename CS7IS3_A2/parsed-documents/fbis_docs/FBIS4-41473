A sketch map [karta-skhema], published today, has been provided for by the agreement on a cease-fire and the disengagement of forces. The security zone must be devoid of heavy combat hardware -- artillery weapons and mortars of a caliber exceeding 80 mm, as well as tanks and APC's. This hardware will be withdrawn into "collection areas" which are under the control of UN military observers. It is also planned to pull Georgian troops out of the Kodori Gorge and back across Abkhazia's borders, as well as to disband and withdraw from Abkhazia armed detachments which arrived there from beyond its borders. Aleksandr Arinakhin, chief of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Sector [napravleniye] for the Leadership of Peacekeeping Forces, explains: "I have just returned from Abkhazia, where, by decision of the Federation Council, the Russian forces' peacemaking operation is getting under way. Right now, our subunits are being moved out there. We are expecting other Commonwealth countries to participate in this operation. I think it will be a success: Third time lucky, as they say, and this is the third time we will be separating the warring sides.... So the third attempt should be successful. A dispute is now going on over why Russia does not have an international mandate for the right to conduct such operations. But it had no such mandate before, during the previous operations, and it would seem that, owing to the indecision of the United Nations, we will not get one in the near future either. Although nor do we see evidence of any ardent wish on the part of the international organizations to quell the conflicts on the territory of the former Union.... Which is why we have to act on the basis of our laws and international treaties. Let me remind you: Both Abkhazia and Georgia requested Russia to carry out the peacemaking operation. I will add that the experience of past years has shown that Russian peacemaking forces operating in conflict zones do not under any circumstances use weapons against peaceful inhabitants. So it is that our soldiers understand the complexity and the specifics of the forthcoming operation, and they are prepared for it."
