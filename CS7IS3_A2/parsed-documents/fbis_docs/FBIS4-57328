According to the magazine, Honduras is on the same economic risk level as Nicaragua and Bosnia, among others. Adolfo Facusse, president of the Honduran businessmen's association, said the problem is that such publications do not receive any response from the authorities in their country. He admitted, however, that Honduras is experiencing an economic crisis that could scare away investors. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1856 GMT 16 May 94)
