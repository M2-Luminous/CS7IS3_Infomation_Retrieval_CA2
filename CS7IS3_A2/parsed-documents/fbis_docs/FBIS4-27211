Hata made the comment during a meeting with Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), at his official residence, a Keidanren official said. Toyoda urged Hata to finish work on the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget and carry out political reforms by redrafting the electoral map for single-seat districts. Acknowledging deregulation is the Hata cabinet's priority, Toyoda pointed to the need to establish a system to monitor progress in relaxing government controls. Hata replied that market opening and deregulation is a task Japan can accomplish on its own, but not one which can be done purely at the behest of foreign governments. In other remarks, Hata reiterated that if snap elections are called, they should be held under the new system of single-seat districts. Opposition parties are pressing Hata to resign or call snap elections as soon after the state budget goes through the Diet. They have threatened to submit a no-confidence motion against the minority Hata administration once the budget is passed.
