The Canadian Government had opposed air strikes, out of concern for the safety of its 800 peacekeepers on the ground in Bosnia. But Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Canada had changed its position, in order to protect the civilian population in Sarajevo. [Begin recording] [Chretien] The Bosnian Serbs have accepted to see the Canadians replaced by the Dutch before the end of this month. So, the situation is progressing normally there, and according to the news that I've heard a few minutes ago the Serbs have agreed to accept the ultimatum in relation to Sarajevo. So there will be no need for air strikes, but indeed we are [as heard] accepted, in order to protect the civilians in Sarajevo and not to see the repetition of the massacre of the last weekend. [end recording] [Announcer] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Canada's foreign affairs minister, Andre Ouellet, says a major factor in Ottawa's reversal against the air strikes was a promise by U.S. President Bill Clinton. He telephoned Prime Minister Chretien twice yesterday to give assurances that the U.S. will be very involved in the process to ensure a peaceful solution to the conflict.
