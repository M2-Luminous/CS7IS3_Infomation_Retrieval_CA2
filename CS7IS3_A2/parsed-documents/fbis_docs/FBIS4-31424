Sources suggest Papoulias has sent this proposal to the Macedonian authorities through the envoy Nimetz, and go on claiming that PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] is all ready to accept the name of Macedonia, and the Greek Government is more inclined to the latest proposal than to the prefix "North" or "New" Macedonia.
