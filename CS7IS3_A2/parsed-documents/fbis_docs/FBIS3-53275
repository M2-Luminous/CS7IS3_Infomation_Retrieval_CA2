[Al-Ghamrawi] I have been asked these questions many times, even by people working in war production. I always answered with another question: Why should the Armed Forces be maintained and why should there be a constant call for developing and upgrading these forces? If peace is the goal a state seeks to achieve and maintain to curb political and military tension and therefore provide more favorable conditions for best use of its resources to enhance the state's strength and enable it to continue its march toward progress, there must be a power to protect that peace. A general rule in the military, though, says that if you want peace you should be ready for war. Whoever advocates peace and tries to protect it through his own weakness would be signing his own death warrant. It is wrong to think that peace means doing away with or reducing the numbers of the armed forces because they are no longer needed for pursuing the state's national interests. The truth is that the lack of power makes the state a prey for ambitious persons and vulnerable to various risks at all times. This creates domestic instability and directly affects development plans. [passage omitted] [Kamal] But there are international calls to control armaments and curb the expansion of war production. Steps have actually been taken to prevent the export of arms production technology. [Al-Ghamrawi] What is being said about controlling armaments or curbing expansion in military production is meant to make the various forms of war production exclusive to a group of states that monopolize it and control its prices. The best evidence of this can be found in the fact that the major states' arms exports to the Third World in two years alone exceeded arms exports for 10 years. Besides, what does armament control have to do with developing your military industry, if your goal is to satisfy the needs of your Armed Forces and develop the equipment they already have? Developing the military industry does not mean exporting it or trading in it in a way that undermines stability. [passage omitted] [Kamal] What is the major goal behind the development of the Egyptian military industry? [Al-Ghamrawi] The goal is to enhance the ties between the Ministry of War Production and the Ministry of Defense, which is the main user of military products. In other words, we want to provide for the needs of the Armed Forces and to link our plan for production to the Armed Forces' armament plan. [passage omitted] [Kamal] How can Egyptian military production be developed while there are restrictions on the transfer of arms production technology? [Al-Ghamrawi] This is an important issue that forms a large part of the new development strategy. This strategy is based on a new reading of the actual situation and on developing a new vision to cope with that situation. Egypt's moderate policy and its belief in mutual interests and interrelation has helped it acquire many technologies without fear of abusing them. Egypt succeeded in acquiring the latest technologies from the United States, France, and some East European states. Our moderation provides us with the needed grounds to obtain what we want. As for our vision, it is based on two main factors: 1. To utilize what we already have. 2. To develop and update what we already have and conduct further research. [passage omitted] [Kamal] What are the markets for Egyptian weapons under the current international competition? [Al-Ghamrawi] The Arab and African states. I think that with some political effort we can find the best marketing formula so that the revenue can be spent on developing the weapons. [Kamal] Do you think it is possible in the current situation in the Arab world to establish an Arab military industry? [Al-Ghamrawi] I still believe that Arab states have many capabilities to cooperate in military industry without fear. We are capable of entering the sphere of military production with products that meet international levels. [Kamal] Why do foreign papers attack the M-1 tank factory every now and then? [Al-Ghamrawi] The Egyptian factory for the production and repair of armored vehicles -- which began with the production of the U.S. M-1 tank -- was a considerable addition to the power of Egyptian military production. It is one of the most modern military factories built in the world recently. Military industries are always questioned and are subjected to attacks every now and then. It seems that Egypt's and its workers' success in building the factory and absorbing the tank manufacturing technology, the peak of military technologies, frightens some people. But we will go on with the project according to plan. [Kamal] But the project will be completed in 1997. Does this mean that the production license will be withdrawn and the factory closed? [Al-Ghamrawi] There is no such thing as withdrawing a production license. The hypothetical shelf life of the tank is 20 to 25 years. Tanks in general need overhauls, maintenance, and development. The M-1 tank we are manufacturing is only a developed version of the M-60-A-3. There is also the M-1-A-2. Moreover, can anyone take back from you the technology you have learned? We started the overhauling of the M-60-A-3 in the factory and we will start the overhauling of the M-1. We are studying how to meet new demands. A joint study is under way with the Armed Forces to select an armored combat vehicle to be manufactured in the factory. [Kamal] Since the 122-mm and 130-mm guns were manufactured, the Egyptian artillery factory has not produced new pieces of artillery. Why? [Al-Ghamrawi] We obtained a license to manufacture the 120-mm barrel of the M-1 tank in the artillery factory. This is one of the latest technologies in the world and it is different from that of ordinary artillery. There is also a project to produce the strategic steel needed for the artillery industry in the factory. [Kamal] Some foreign newspapers once in a while report that Egypt is producing chemical weapons. [Al-Ghamrawi] We have an established and unchanging principle: We do not manufacture any type of chemical weapons. We only manufacture the equipment needed to protect ourselves against these weapons. [Kamal] Some people talk about the need to privatize military production. [Al-Ghamrawi] Privatizing the war industry is out of the question. Like the Armed Forces, war production is one of the elements of Egyptian power and national security. If it is not possible to buy security from any state, then war production cannot be sold. Privatization is unsuitable for war production. [passage omitted]
