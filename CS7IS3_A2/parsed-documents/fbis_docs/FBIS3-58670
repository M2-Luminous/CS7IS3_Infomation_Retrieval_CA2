This is surprising, the newspaper suggests, given Zhirinovsky's statements during his visit to Sofia, when he advised Bulgaria to extend by annexing Greek Thraki and Skopje. TA NEA also blames government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, who "induced the newspaper into error" by characterizing the news of Zhirinovsky's Salonica visit, which surfaced in the Italian newspaper LA STAMPA, as a "journalistic mishap." TA NEA cites Greek diplomatic sources as saying that a more serious problem would have ensued had the Greek side refused to allow Zhirinovsky into the country, given that he was a big winner in the recent Russian elections. According to the 3 January TA NEA, the Greek Government is preparing a demarche to the "Russian side" to protest Zhirinovsky's remarks on Thraki, while Yiorgos Papandreou is claiming that the Russian's Salonica stay was a "transit, not official, visit." TA NEA quotes Papandreou as saying in an interview on the SKY radio station that "the issue at that time was not substantive and was faced as such." Papandreou also maintained that Zhirinovsky's Sofia remarks were made after the Russian's departure from Greece. The deputy minister further argued that the Greek Government decided to downgrade the visit because it thought the incident was not serious .
