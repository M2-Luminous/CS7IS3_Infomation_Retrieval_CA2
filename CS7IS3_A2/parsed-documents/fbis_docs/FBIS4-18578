Heading the Albanian delegation was K. Meksi, bother of the Albanian prime minister. The meeting aimed at specifying the conditions for the supply of natural gas following the initial signing of a protocol between the Albanian Government and Promitheas Gas in November 1991. According to a statement by the Greek-Russian company, Albania is particularly interested in developing the natural gas market as soon as possible. The supply of natural gas to the neighboring state will be achieved with the construction of a pipeline that will go through the area of Ptolemais, thus allowing for the supply of natural gas to the western Greek region. For the construction of the pipeline, a study is already underway with the support of the European Union through the PHARE [Poland-Hungary Assistance for the Reconstruction of the Economy] program. According to reports, Albania is interested in the supply of 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to resume operations of fertilizer factories in southern Albania that today are idle due to a lack of raw materials. As is known, Promitheas Gas was founded by the Russian company VEP Gasexport, the largest exporter of natural gas in the world, and the group of companies of Kopelouzou Brothers, which has the exclusive rights for the sale of natural gas that transits through Greece to third countries.
