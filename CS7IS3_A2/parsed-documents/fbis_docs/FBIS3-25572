This decision was taken by Cabinet during its Fifth Ordinary Session on February 15, and was yesterday announced by Nguno Wakolele, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The former permanent secretary at State House will now be called secretary to the President, and will have an equal rank with that of secretary to the Cabinet. Eddie Amukongo, who now holds that position, has been acting secretary to the Cabinet. Wakolele said the former deputy permanent secretary at State House, would now be deputy secretary to the President. That post was held by Dr. Ndeutala Hishongua. The post will be the equivalent to a permanent secretary and its holder will be the accounting officer at the Presidency. The permanent secretary in the Office of the Prime Minister will now be deputy secretary to the Cabinet but still keep the first position. Dr. Peingeondjabi Shipo holds that position. The acting permanent secretary for Home Affairs, Shetu Hamunyela has been confirmed as permanent secretary. He has been acting in that position since the relocation of Frieda Williams to the Ministry of Works, Transport and Telecommunication as permanent secretary. Explaining the reasons for the changes, Wakolele said the permanent secretaries to State House and the Cabinet were serving in sensitive positions and should be able to attend Cabinet meetings. Only the deputies would not be allowed to attend. In addition, the permanent secretary to State House could receive delegates should the President not be present, he said. The changes had been planned since December last year. The changes had nothing to do with an individual, said Wakolele, responding to a question on whether they had anything to do with the transfer of former Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Petrus Damaseb, as Namibian Representative to the Joint-Administrative Authority.
