The averaged cost of vital foods in the consumer basket was 431,500 karbovanets in prices charged by state-run and non-state-run shops. The gap between the consumer basket's minimal and maximal costs widened to 45.5 per cent with the city of Sevastopol and the Kirovograd region forming two poles with 536,000 krb. and 368,500 krb., respectively. In urban collective farm market prices the basket weighed as much as 523,000 krb. to exceed the state-run retail trade's prices by 21.2 per cent. Food prices grew by 3 per cent in March, on the average, and were virtually unchanged for dairy products, sunflower seed oil, margarine, rice, buckwheat, sausages, mayonnaise, and yeast. Prices for meat, pork fat, eggs, citrus fruits, vodka dropped by 8 per cent, on the average. Prices grew, however, for certain manufactured goods, such as children's clothes (by 11 per cent) and footwear (by 21 per cent), pharmaceutical products (by 21 per cent), books, newspapers and office materials (by 14 per cent). The 23 March - 5 April period witnessed a steeper price growth versus the preceding 10-day period; food prices in state-run shops and co-ops grew by 2.1 per cent, and collective farm market prices by 1.4 per cent versus the previous 10-day period's figures of 1.2 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively. Food price growth rates were the highest in Crimea (by 11 per cent), while in Ukraine's 12 regions (Zhitomir, Transcarpathian, Zaporozhye, Poltava, Ivano-Frankovsk, Kiev, Rivne, Kherson, Khmelnitski, Cherkassy and Chernigov) the price growth rates were between 3 and 4 per cent. Bread products baked from first and extra brands of flour became sizably more expensive with prices for them having grown by 72 per cent in Crimea, by 20 per cent in the Cherkassy region (in both cases higher prices were imposed by the republican and regional administrations), and by 18 per cent in the Transcarpathian region, by 28 per cent in Ivano-Frankovsk region, by 12 per cent in the Kirovograd region, by 20 per cent in the Lvov region, and by 9 per cent in the Ternopol region because of flour prices raised by suppliers. Inter-regional wide variations persisted in prices for certain food products. Thus, prices for cheeses with low fat content varied by as much as 6.8 times (2,778 krb. per kg. in the Chernigov region and 18,930 krb. per kg. in Kiev city), farina prices by 5.6 times (1,800 krb. per kg. in the Ternopol region vs 10,000 krb. per kg. in the Volyn region), flour prices by 3.5 times (2,390 krb. per kg. in the Kirovograd region and 8,480 krb. per kg. in the Kiev region), prices for rolled oats by 3.2 times (3,180 krb. per kg. in the Rovno region and 10,200 krb. per kg. in the Nikolaev region). Food price hikes were the steepest in the Kherson (by 16 per cent), Rovno (by 8 per cent), Kirovograd and Volyn (by 7 per cent) regions. Vegetables were most affected by price growths, while beef, pork and pork fat prices were largely immune to these. Dairy products and butter, sunflower seed oil, potatoes and eggs were slightly cheaper (prices for them dropped, respectively, by 1 per cent to 2 per cent, 4 per cent and 9 per cent). It should be noted that urban collective farm markets witnessed a two-times lower price growth for basic foods, as compared with state-run retail trade, with some food products sold by farmers at lower prices than what government-owned shops charged for similar foods. Prices for manufactured goods charged by state-run shops grew by 25 per cent in the Transcarpathian region followed by the Kirovograd (by 17 per cent), Rovno (by 13 per cent) and Ivano-Frankovsk (by 10 per cent) regions, over the last ten-day period.
