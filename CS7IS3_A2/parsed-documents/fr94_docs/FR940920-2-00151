For over two decades, the Federal Government has funded the activities of State councils to advise on and assist in the development of vocational education programs in the States. While the 1992 JTPA amendments allow the States to consolidate their vocational education councils into broader State Human Resource Investment Councils, most States have continued to operate separate councils for vocational education. Have the State vocational education councils fulfilled their objective of monitoring quality and ensuring business involvement in the operation of programs in the States? Should they continue to be separately funded, or should their operation be at State discretion? Is maintaining the independence of councils chartered under the Perkins Act important? Does the existence of separate councils for vocational education contribute to a fragmentation of State policymaking within the broader areas of human resource development and employment? Should consolidation with the State Human Resource Councils be required in order to ensure coordination between JTPA and vocational education? •Program Accountability. According to the NAVE, most States have gone beyond the accountability requirements established in the 1990 amendments to the Perkins Act, developing fuller arrays of performance measures than required and applying them to all vocational programs, not just those receiving Perkins funds. However, while as of 1991&hyph;1992 State agencies had given a high priority to developing performance standards and measures, local implementation had not yet occurred. Have States and localities found the standards and measures useful for improving programs? How have States' experiences implementing these requirements compared to experiences with the accountability requirements under the JTPA? Should the reauthorization encourage States and localities to give more attention to development and implementation of performance standards and measures? If so, how can program performance best be evaluated and measured so as to benefit the grantees, allow for replication of successful projects, and provide meaningful information to the Department and to Congress? Additionally, should federally supported vocational programs, which currently must meet the accountability requirements set forth in the Perkins Act, be aligned with the standards-based reform activities States and localities will undertake under Goals 2000 and the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act? Even beyond the standards and measures requirements, the 1990 Perkins amendments greatly increased the Act's focus on accountability, including adding language on ``program improvement'' to ensure that local grantees, and then States, take action to improve ineffective programs. Is this working? Should it be continued? Should the statute incorporate more incentives for success? How are the incentives and adjustments for special populations working? Should the statute allow States to take ``corrective action'' or cut funding to programs that repeatedly fail to reach the standards? More broadly, how can the reauthorization better emphasize accountability for results? •Skill Standards. Development of occupational and industry skill standards has become an important component of Federal policy. The Goals 2000: Educate America Act establishes a National Skill Standards Board to encourage the creation of a comprehensive system of voluntary skill standards and certification. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act includes, as a basic element of the school-based learning component, high academic and occupational skill standards to be developed under Goals 2000. Previously, the Departments of Education and Labor funded 22 grants to promote the development of skill standards and certification in a variety of industries. How could the reauthorization support the development of voluntary industry skill standards and portable skill certification? How would skill standards and certification of work-related skills affect educators developing curricula and employers seeking skilled workers? •Coherent Sequence of Courses. The NAVE found that, in general, secondary vocational programs are not as coherent or rigorous as they should be. They usually lack prerequisites, which maximizes access but reduces chances of aligning vocational courses with each other or with academic courses. In addition, the NAVE reported that most districts, including Title II grant recipients, do not meet the Perkins requirement for a coherent sequence of academic and vocational courses. Should the next reauthorization do more to ensure that more students have the opportunity to take a coherent sequence of academic and vocational courses? If so, how? •All Aspects of the Industry. The Perkins Act encourages local recipients to use basic State grant funds to provide vocational education programs that educate students in all aspects of an industry. The NAVE found that, as of the second year of implementation of the 1990 Perkins amendments, the ``all aspects'' language had only a minor impact on vocational programs. Should the reauthorization continue this area of statutory emphasis? If so, how can it be made more effective?
