Vladimir Ionkin, the press secretary of the Russian Embassy in Latvia, told ITAR-TASS that the militants detained two generals -- Nikolay Tailakov and Anatoliy Vodopyanov -- who were sent to the facilities by the commander of the Northwestern Group of Russian Troops. They handcuffed them and drove in an unknown direction. The generals were freed only after the intervention of the Russian Embassy. The Latvian authorities sent their apologies for the incident and assured the Russian Embassy that the facilities were being unlocked. Early on Monday a group of Latvian militants stopped a car of the Russian ambassador and refused to let it pass despite the ambassador's protests. After long deliberations they allowed the car to pass but waved their guns at it. The Russian Embassy issued a protest to the Latvian Foreign Ministry, describing the incident as a potentially dangerous provocation. The embassy expressed the hope that the Latvian authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent such incidents in the future. The note considered the incident as an attempt to thwart the talks on the troop withdrawal.
