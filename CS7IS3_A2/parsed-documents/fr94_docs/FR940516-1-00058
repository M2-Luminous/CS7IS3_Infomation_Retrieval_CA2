FR940516-1-00058 FR940516-1-00004 The hearings themselves will begin at 10:30 a.m. and continue until 5 p.m., with a lunch recess to be determined by the Hearing Officer. The hearings will resume at 7 p.m. and will continue until 10 p.m. or thereafter until all speakers have been heard. In order to have productive and meaningful hearings and to ensure that those who wish to speak at the hearings are able to do so in a fair and orderly manner, the following procedures will be observed: _Persons wishing to testify must register at the hearing site between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. Speakers will be heard in the order in which they register, with the exception of elected Federal, state or local officials, who will speak first at the beginning of each session or as otherwise arranged with the Hearing Officer. _Each person may present testimony only once. However, if time permits, the Hearing Officer may allow each speaker additional time after all other witnesses have had the opportunity to speak. When provided, such additional time will be granted to speakers in the same order in which they originally testified. _Because a large number of speakers is anticipated, it will be necessary to limit the amount of time of each speaker. Since the number of speakers may vary greatly from location to location, the time allocated to each speaker may also vary among the hearings. However, within any one hearing, all speakers will be allocated an equal amount of time. The amount of time allocated to each speaker will be left to the discretion of the Hearing Officer. Time limitations will be strictly followed. _The purpose of the hearings is to elicit comments from the public. A technical representative from the BLM and Forest Service will be present to ask clarifying questions of witnesses. Time spent asking and answering these questions will not count against the time allocated to the speaker. Because of the time constraints and the desire to maximize public input, the technical representatives will not respond to questions from or otherwise engage in discussions with the speaker. Speakers who wish to ask questions should do so during the informal information session. _A transcript of the hearing will be made and become part of the rulemaking record. Speakers are encouraged to submit a written copy of their statements to be included in the hearing record. The record of the hearing will remain open through June 13, 1994 for submission of supplemental written statements or other exhibits. The name and address of the designated official to receive these statements or exhibits will be announced at the hearing. Location The hearings are to be held at the following locations: ARIZONA Fountain Suites Hotel, 2577 W. Greenway, Phoenix, AZ, on the Southeast Corner of the Black Canyon Freeway.
