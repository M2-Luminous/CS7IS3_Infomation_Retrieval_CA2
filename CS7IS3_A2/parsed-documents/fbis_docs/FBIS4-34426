[Begin Camacho Solis recording] In addition, I am hereby announcing that I will not participate in any political activities during the present administration. [end recording] He said he will surely be criticized for quitting because he did not attain the expected results. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] But we have attained all results possible at present. I quit the commission committed, more than ever, to peace and democracy. [end recording] Regarding the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate's recent remarks, Camacho said this. [Begin Camacho recording] His remarks on the Chiapas conflict have weakened the political negotiations and the role that I, as commissioner, could have continued to play to take new steps toward peace. For him, the problem focuses on the fact that a petition was answered but not accepted and that, therefore, the negotiation process failed. In the current situation in Chiapas, the PRI candidate's position and its effects have resulted in a kind of censure on my work, all of which makes peace even more difficult to achieve. [end recording] Camacho Solis pointed out that it is necessary to view the problem, not only in terms of social policy, but in terms of political concepts as well, to create conditions for a respectable and lasting peace that can be accepted by the Zapatist National Liberation Front, thus sparing Chiapas and Mexico the social price of a protracted war. Camacho Solis announced his resignation in a Mexico City hotel.
