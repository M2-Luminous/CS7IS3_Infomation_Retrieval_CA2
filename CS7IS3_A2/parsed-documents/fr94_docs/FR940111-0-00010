FR940111-0-00010 FR940111-0-00004 7 CFR Part 959 [Docket No. FV93&hyph;959&hyph;1IFR; Amendment 1] South Texas Onions; Increased Expenses and Establishment of Assessment Rate AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Amended interim final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim final rule amends a previous interim final rule which authorized administrative expenses for the South Texas Onion Committee (Committee) under M.O. No. 959. This interim final rule increases the level of authorized expenses and establishes an increased assessment rate to generate funds to pay those expenses. Authorization of this increased budget enables the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers. DATES: Effective August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994. Comments received by February 10, 1994, will be considered prior to issuance of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this action. Comments must be sent in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, FAX 202&hyph;720&hyph;5698.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 143 and Order No. 959, both as amended (7 CFR part 959), regulating the handling of onions grown in South Texas. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, South Texas onions are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable onions handled during the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period, which began August 1, 1993, and ends July 31, 1994. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 47 producers of South Texas onions under this marketing order, and approximately 34 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of South Texas onion producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The budget of expenses for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period was prepared by the South Texas Onion Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculture for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of South Texas onions. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.
