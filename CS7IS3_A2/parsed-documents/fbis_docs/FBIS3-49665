Then the foreign minister answered the question of Jozsef Barath: [begin recording] [Barath] Mr. Minister, at your press briefing you welcomed the results of the NATO summit. Did anything happen there which could not have been expected or taken for granted in advance? [Jeszenszky] There were worries and hopes in connection with the summit. In my view, the latest developments, the Brussels NATO summit, and the statement and document adopted there made the hopes come true. It is certain that more could have been envisaged and there were many who expected more. However, realistically, nobody expected that Hungary or a few other countries would be admitted to NATO in January. For that one has to be prepared; among other things, an appropriately trained army is necessary both professionally and in language, competible weaponry is needed, etc., thus this is a process. I think that in the present international situation, NATO gave an appropriate answer. It tried to give an encouraging answer to the peoples of Central Europe for their worries, it offers a prospect for them regarding their membership and at the same time, it is trying to tackle a bigger question, namely, how to avoid new conflict between the superpowers, how to avoid Russia becoming a new danger for Europe or for us. So it is quite clear to me that the Partnership for Peace program tries to influence the world developments to follow a favorable direction. Thus, in the case of Russia, it tries to support democracy by this means, and to ensure that Russia should not consider NATO an enemy, or should not consider NATO's expansion as a provocation, but to make Russia see that a road is open for cooperation here.
