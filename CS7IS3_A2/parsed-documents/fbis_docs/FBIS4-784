Let us recall who they are: There is Ferdinand Nahimana, whom you know, who was minister of higher education and scientific research. He belongs to the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic [MRND-CDR] and is known for dividing Rwandans. He made this the law of Rwanda and the law became MRND ideology. You also know Simeon Nteziryayo, minister at the Presidency. He was too powerful in the office of the president recently. There is Cyprien Munyankundu, secretary general of the National Assembly that was imposed by the president. The head of the deputies, Theodore Sindikubwayo, is the one who imposed himself as president of the Republic. There is Faustin Ruzindana, (Fidel Ntuyenabo), and Supreme Court President Alphonse Marie Nkubito, who is among those who fought for change, who fought the dictatorship. He escaped the presidential guard killers. There is also Lieutenant Colonel Charles Uwihoreye and Mrs. Casimir Bizimungu, wife of former Health Minister Casimir Bizimungu, who is a staunch member of the MRND-CDR. He is not in Burundi; he fled to Zaire. There is Daniel Mbangura who was minister of higher education and scientific research. You know him. He belongs to the MRND-CDR. There is Mrs. Deo Nsabimana, wife of Major General Deo Nsabimana, who was chief of staff of the Rwandan Armed Forces. He died in the crash with the Rwandan and Burundi presidents on 6 April. There is Mrs. Sylvestre Nsanzimana, wife of the former prime minister of the first coalition government and Mrs. Pascal Ndengejeho, wife of Ndengejeho of the Republican democratic movement, who is known to have refused to take part in the government of the late Agathe Uwilingiyimana. There is Mrs. Faustin Maniraho, Mrs. Felicien Kabuga, wife of Kabuga, head of the divisionist Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines radio, and Mrs. Ntagerura, wife of former Transport and Communications Minister Ntagerura, a staunch MRND-CDR member. All these people have fled. So, the clique of killers has fled along with its families. The clique which started the war has fled. They have left the Rwandan youth they sent to war behind. Those who are still fighting for the clique, why are you fighting now that those you fought for have left you at the front? What is the relationship between you and those who left you at the war front? Unite with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to search for all those who supported the clique wherever they are, whether in the communes of (Bicumbi), Gikoro, and elsewhere.
