But the poll found also that more than half of the Hong Kong public believe that China will overturn the whole three-tier political structure in 1997 and that there will be no "through train" arrangement for those selected next year to sit beyond the changeover. The survey, conducted by Asian Commercial Research Limited, found that up to 30 percent of respondents would vote for candidates of the United Democrats if an election were held tomorrow. In all, United Democrats and the other candidates considered to be liberals would command 56 percent of the votes, compared with 21 percent for the Liberal Party and pro-China forces. However, up to 23 percent of 604 people interviewed by telephone this month said they had no opinion on who they would vote for. The strong support for the United Democrats is despite China's labelling as subversive its chairman, Martin Lee Chu-ming, and veteran member Szeto Wah. Both have been warned repeatedly that they will not be allowed to sit on the legislature of the Special Administrative Region. There are 13 United Democrats in the 60-member Legislative Council. The party swept the 1991 elections by winning 12 of the 18 directly elected seats contested then. Support for the Liberal Party is running at only 12.6 percent. The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood managed to be the third most popular party 9.2 percent of the poll's respondents said they would vote for association candidates. It was followed by the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, with a score of 5.4 percent, and another liberal party, Meeting Point, which scored 4.3 percent. Up to 12.6 percent of respondents said they would vote for a pro- Hong Kong independent candidate in an election, compared with 2.6 percent who said they would support a pro-China independent. A third of respondents maintained that the Legislative Council should delay voting on the remaining parts of Governor Chris Patten's electoral package, despite chances for the resumption of talks seeming unlikely. A total of 12 percent said the electoral package should be amended to make it acceptable to China. However, another 28 percent of respondents said the package should be passed, compared with the nine percent who said the whole package should be voted down. The same poll also showed that 42 percent of the respondents believed the Governor's political reform proposals would have a negative effect on Hong Kong's political situation after 1997, compared with the 31 percent who say they would make Hong Kong better. Only two percent said they would have no effect. The remaining 25 percent said they held no opinion on the question.
