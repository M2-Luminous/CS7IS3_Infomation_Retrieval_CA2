FR940224-0-00034 FR940224-0-00003 One of the ordinary meanings of the word ``predominant'' is ``the most common.'' WEBSTER'S II NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY DICTIONARY 927 (1988). Since in the context of this statutory framework a neighborhood can only be either a minority neighborhood or a non-minority neighborhood, the most common or prevalent of two categories means a majority or more than half. Moreover, consistent with the legislative purpose of preserving and promoting minority ownership and service, in the case of any exact 50% split between the two categories, minorities should be viewed as predominant. Therefore, if half or more of the residents of a neighborhood are minorities, that neighborhood is predominantly minority. The word ``minority'' is defined by statute to have the meaning given such term in section 1204(c)(3) of FIRREA. Sections 21A(s) & 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA. Section 1204(c)(3) of FIRREA defines ``minority'' to mean ``any Black American, Native American, Hispanic American, or Asian American.'' This interim rule provides a definition of the word ``minority'' which incorporates the statutory definition but permits the use of equivalent classifications used by the Census Bureau in collecting the Census Data. Among other categories, the Census Bureau collects and publishes population Census Data by State, County, County subdivision, Place, Zip Code (available on CD-rom or tape) Census Tract or block numbering area, Block group, and Block. Each census of the U.S. population provides data on the minority composition of those areas in a manner which corresponds with the statutory definition of ``minority'' in FIRREA. The population classifications utilized in the Census Data for the 1990 census are: Hispanic origin and the following racial categories: White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander; and Other Race. Bureau of the Census, Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF POPULATION, GENERAL POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS (1992). Since Census Data is readily available, its use to determine the minority composition of a particular geographic area is not only reasonable and efficient, but also consistent with the RTC's statutory Cost Constraints. The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word ``neighborhood'' is a district or area with distinctive characteristics. WEBSTER'S II NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY DICTIONARY 789 (1988). Neighborhoods vary in size and can be contained within each other. Since the only reasonably reliable population data which is readily available on a nationwide basis is Census Data, it is both reasonable and cost-efficient to define ``neighborhood'' in terms of the geographic areas utilized by the Census Bureau. Census Data, including minority composition, is available for specific geographic areas, including among others, State, County, County subdivision, Place, Zip Code, Census Tract, Block and Block group. Census Tracts and Zip Codes appear to be the only such categories which might approximate the size and characteristics of a ``neighborhood'' served by an ``institution, or any branch'' thereof. 2 2 The RTC has found no indication that an extensive, customized survey and analysis of the demographics and other characteristics of the geographic area surrounding each branch of a failed institution would yield results significantly different from those obtained by using Census Data and Zip Codes or Census Tracts. In addition, reliable population data for individually determined areas is not readily available on a consistent nationwide basis. The nature of the RTC's statutory Cost Constraints in marketing and selling a failed depository institution dictates that the identification of ``predominantly minority neighborhoods'' be accomplished with relative speed and minimal expense. The failed institutions the RTC resolves suffer significant operating losses on a daily basis. An increase in those operating losses due to a delay in the resolution of the institution caused by the implementation of a definition of ``predominately minority neighborhood'' which is difficult and time consuming to utilize is clearly inconsistent with the RTC's statutory duties. The United States Postal Service has subdivided the United States and its territories into discrete geographic areas for purposes of the distribution of mail, and has designated each such area with a 5-digit numeric Zip Code. See, U.S. Postal Service, 1993 NATIONAL FIVE-DIGIT ZIP CODE & POST OFFICE DIRECTORY. The individual areas defined by the Zip Codes generally correspond to a district or area with distinctive characteristics. The Zip Code itself is one distinctive characteristic that ties the area and its residents together. Moreover, most Zip Code areas are further distinguished by the presence of a postal facility designed to service those neighborhoods. Accordingly, Zip Codes constitute an existing, comprehensive system for describing areas that generally approximate neighborhoods.
