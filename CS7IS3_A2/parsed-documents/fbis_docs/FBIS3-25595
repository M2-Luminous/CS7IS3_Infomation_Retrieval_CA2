This follows the leaking to rank-and-file members of the contents of a top-level directive demanding the names of all policemen in the Witwatersrand region who have fired their weapons two or more times in the line of duty. The order was given by commissioner Lieutenant-General Koos Calitz and sent out in a confidential February 2 letter from the SAP's Human Resources Department to all specialist units and station commanders. Coming less than three months before election, the demand is being seen at grassroots level as extremely sinister, especially in light of the ANC's [African National Congress] promise last year that once in power, the file of each and every SAP member would be reviewed to rid the force of those with "blood on their hands." The SAP was quick to deny this week that the information was part of a "witch hunt," saying it was needed to identify SAP members suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and who may be in need of counselling. SAP spokesman Colonel Dave Bruce also denied that the list was linked to a request from the ANC for details of shootings involving Lance-Sergeant Allan Kruger, found by an inquest court to have been responsible for the death of Ismael Moloane, one of ANC deputy president Walter Sisulu's bodyguards, during a high-speed shootout on the Soweto highway last July. But grassroots members remain unconvinced. One, who resigned this week, said: "The ANC just asks for something and that's it. No one gives a damn about us." Senior police officers said they did not believe the information was being sought in the interests of individual members. "All you have to do is fire warning shots on two separate occasions, and your name goes on the list -- so almost every cop in uniform will be on it." said one. Said another: "What are we supposed to do? Get out there and chase car hijackers armed with AKs, knowing that if we use our weapons, we'll end up on some list?" Morale in the SAP -- already at an all-time low according to SA [South African] Police Union (Sapu) president Andy Miller -- has been further eroded by the directive. But the biggest danger to law and order lies in the warning by the newly-formed and 10,000-strong Sapu that the lists could lead to widespread labour unrest within the force. National secretary Peter-Don Brandt says: "It seems as though these lists could form part of so-called 'commissions of truth,' with the police being blamed for enforcing unjust laws of the past, when everyone knows it's the politicians who should take that responsibility." This week, a number of policemen who have resigned since January told the SUNDAY TIMES they were disillusioned and disgusted by the "lack of direction and uncertainty which is not being addressed by the brass."
