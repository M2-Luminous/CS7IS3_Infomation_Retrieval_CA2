Military aid is needed "to save Cambodia from the yoke of the Khmer Rouge, from genocide ... (and) maintain Cambodia as a liberal democracy and member of the free world," King Sihanouk told reporters at the Royal Palace. "They need everything: new weapons, planes, helicopters, tanks and also ... ambulances," the king said. The appeal followed comments by a U.S. State Department official in Washington on Wednesday that the United States was considering "the possible provision of lethal assistance" in view of recent guerrilla activities. But the official, U.S. Deputy Assistant of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Peter Tomsen, told a congressional committee that the United States would have to consult other members of the international community before taking any action. The king last week said he favored having foreign countries -- including the United States, France and Australia -- arm, equip and train Cambodia's army. King Sihanouk said the failure of government troops to maintain their hold on the Khmer Rouge base at Pailin in northwest Cambodia, which they captured March 19, showed how badly government forces were in need of training. The Cambodian government has admitted that corrupt commanders spent more time dividing the spoils of the resource-rich region than defending it. "Their behavior in Pailin was not good at all, so there is a necessity to re-educate our soldiers, to train them and to equip them," he said. He added that the forces needed "lessons on behavior," referring to reports from human rights watchdog Amnesty International, who condemned the beheading of a Khmer Rouge prisoner of war by government troops last week in Cambodia's northwest. King Sihanouk said the West "should not say on the one hand that we must save Cambodia from the yoke of Pol Pot ... and on the other hand give nothing to the royal government.
