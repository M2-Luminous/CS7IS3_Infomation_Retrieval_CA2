According to the 1,153 responses received, the largest number of votes, 798, went to [Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement Chairman, MKDH] Vojtech Bugar. [Chairman of the MKDH parliamentary group] Pal Csaky was second, with 683 votes; [Coexistence Deputy Chairman] Arpad Duka-Zolyomi third, with 492 votes; [Coexistence Chairman] Miklos Duray fourth, with 357 votes; and [Hungarian Civic Party, MOS, Chairman] Laszlo Nagy fifth, with 257 readers' votes. Similarly, the MKDH received from the readers of the Hungarian-language daily 533 votes; Coexistence was second, with 380 votes, and MOS third, with 231. The editorial team does not claim that the survey was representative. Nonetheless, it is interesting and, for the uninitiated, perhaps even surprising that Miklos Duray finished only in fourth place and was even overtaken by his party colleague Arpad Duka-Zolyomi. Vojtech Bugar's popularity is the result of his politically prudent decisions. When we consider that it is the result of a longer-term trend, it also signals that our Hungarian fellow citizens prefer a realistic policy to a radical one.
