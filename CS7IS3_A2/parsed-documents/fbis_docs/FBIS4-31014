During the dialogue that occasioned an extensive exchange of information and views on the progress of the reform in the two countries, they agreed that the bilateral relations were, along with each state's development efforts, the only way out of the economic crisis, the way of relaunching the production and speeding up the reform. Reference was made in that context to the possibilities of collaboration that, as agreed, would be analyzed during the session of the joint commissions due at the end of June. Premier Vacaroiu noted that, although the Romanian-Bulgarian trade has kept at a constant level lately, there were unlimited possibilities to increase the bilateral relations, which needs the completion of a new legal framework. Sharing that opinion, Aleksandrov showed that during his Romanian visit two important agreements were signed on economic relations (the convention on avoiding double taxation and the agreement on mutual promotion and protection of investments.) He highlighted the necessity of periodical contacts between similar institutions in the two countries, of a permanent exchange of information concerning each party's positive experience.
