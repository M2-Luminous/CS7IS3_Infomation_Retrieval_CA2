Figures from the city's Individual Laborers' Association show that Beijing residents buy 80 percent of their foodstuffs, including meat, eggs, vegetables and fruits, from individual peddlers. More than 80 percent of the city's 140,000 businesses engaged in commerce, catering, repairs and other services are managed by individual laborers. Self-employed laborers are playing an indispensable role in Beijing people's daily life. Officials from the association noted that Beijing used to have few individual laborers. In 1978, there were only 259 self-employed workers in Beijing. Private businesses had little to do with residents here. As the country adopts a more flexible and diversified economy, private business has been encouraged by the municipal government. The number of individual workers in Beijing has grown in leaps and bounds. In 1992, the city's individual-business households increased by 35.5 percent, setting a national record. By the end of last month, the city's individual-business households had risen to 336,000. That is, every ten households in Beijing are served by one individual-business household. In addition, the association officials say, those private businesses are more than adding employment opportunities for surplus rural laborers -- they facilitate people's daily life, make the market prosper and help adjust the economic structure. The annual retailing volume of the city's individual-business households registers at 3.4 billion yuan (400 million U.S. dollars), accounting for 6 percent of the city's total. Each year, the city's individual workers hand over about 280 million yuan (31 million U.S. dollars) in state taxes. Meanwhile, more and more private workers have been involved in the management of small state-owned enterprises, giving a shot in the arm to firms in the red. Officials said that some 6,000 small state commercial firms have taken on a good shape after introducing private management. At present, there are 4,100 private ventures in the city, employing 56,000 workers, offering over 130 million yuan (15 million U.S. dollars) in state taxes. These private firms have extended their businesses from the previous handicraft, catering service and merchandise to wider areas, such as clothing, trade, transport, house construction and technology. Many firms have created by now well-known brands which are welcomed by consumers.
