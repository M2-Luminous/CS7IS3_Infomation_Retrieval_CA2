According to his calculations, the lease of four Boeing 767 airliners is "too costly" as the expenses may amount to $300 Mn. Tikhonov believes two jumbo jets will be quite enough, while the term of the lease may well be reduced to three to four instead of the proposed five years. Tikhonov said he was sceptical about the experience of exploitation of five A310-300 in Russia. According to Airbus Industry which supplied the airliners in 1992, their leasing inflicted losses worth $15 Mn on Aeroflot in 1993 alone, while Aeroflot states the losses reached $22 Mn. [passage omitted] Tikhonov said the high cost of the airbuses' use was caused by the exceptionally high amount of the lease ($46 Mn a year) which covers the entire profits from their exploitation. Commenting on the lease of foreign-made jets, Tikhonov said it was a "forced measure called to cover the deficit of modern long-range jets until new Russian airliners such as Il 96-300 and Il 96M are supplied in sufficient quantities."
