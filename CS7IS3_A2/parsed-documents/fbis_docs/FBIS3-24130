Shprygin, director of the Center for Studying the Price and Market Situation ("Tsenakor" EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN) and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Economic Sciences: "Price and Finance Ratios: Economic Regulation Is Required"] [Text] The steps recently taken by the government to improve the economic situation and strengthen the social orientation of the reforms inspire hope that they will finally begin to work. However, one must take into consideration the fact that the actual state of affairs in the national economy is an extremely complicated one -- if not to say, becoming worse. During the last two years or more, the reforms have raised more questions than they have provided answers and positive solutions. As before, the main question is: When will a change for the better finally arrive -- what must be done to overcome the drawn-out crisis? Its solution is directly connected with eliminating the disproportions that have recently intensified in the national economy, lowering inflation rates and strengthening the reforms' social orientation. Estimates of the future show that if appropriate adjustments are not made in the reforms, the decline in production during 1994 will be at least 10 percent with an inflation of 1000-1200 percent. Taking into consideration the impending revaluation of capital stock and the increase in transportation costs and prices in the raw-material branches and fuel and energy complex, inflation could increase: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Inflation, % | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Consumer basket c-|December 1993 |January 1994 |February 1994 (fo-| |alculated for: | | |recast) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |19 goods and serv-|18 |20 |23 | |ices | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |72 goods and serv-|23 |25 |28 | |ices | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The fact that the growth in prices, which has been accompanied by a reduction in investments in industry, significantly -- approximately 1.6-fold --outstrips the increases in prices in agriculture evokes special alarm. This creates the threat not only of a protracted decline in production but also of a further intensification of price and exchange disproportions between these two very important sectors of the national economy. The situation in this area really resembles the celebrated 1922-1923 price discrepancy. Whereas the gap between the prices of industrial and agricultural products was 340 percent in favor of industry during 1922 and 1923, which cheapened the labor of the peasants and was one of the main reasons leading later on to a food dearth and the unwillingness of peasants to sell their products, the gap has reached 400 percent during the two years of these reforms (1992-1993). Thus, the gap in the price discrepancy between these branches has become even larger than it was during the crisis year of 1923. It could reach a full 500 percent in 1994. Today, for a peasant to be able to acquire the same amount of industrial products that he did in 1991, he must sell fivefold more crops than in 1991; to acquire tractors and grain harvesting equipment -- 20-fold more. A forecast[.sup]1[/] of prices for the most important goods, which the Center for Studying the Price and Market Situation ("Tsenakor" EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN) made, reveals the following price index changes during the second quarter of 1994 without considering the increase in expenditures connected with the rise in costs of the capital stock in industry as a result of its revaluation: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gasoline |1.5-1.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bar rolled stock |1.4-1.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Steel pipes |1.7-1.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mineral fertilizers |1.6-1.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tires of all brands |1.3-1.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Row-crop tractors |1.2-1.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grain loaders |1.2-1.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Animal feed |1.5-1.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rye bread |1.3-1.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sunflower-seed oil |1.4-1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cereals of all types |1.3-1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Meat of all types |1.4-1.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The revaluation of capital stock will cause an increase in costs in industry and, consequently, the price gap with agriculture will increase even more. Today, agriculture is losing approximately 45 percent of the national income created in it because of the price discrepancy. It is not surprising that many farms in such oblasts as Vladimir, Orel, Voronezh, Tambov, Kursk, and Bryansk did not acquire a single tractor during 1992-1993 as a result of this economic policy. On the whole, the agricultural capital-worker ratio has decreased by 36 percent and labor productivity by almost 20 percent during these years. Thus, the disproportions in exchange relations between industry and agriculture have reached their critical limit. Steady production cuts in many food items and their supplanting with imported food have begun. The saturation of the Russian market with domestic food was approximately 82 percent in 1993, including 75 percent of the 1991 level for animal husbandry products. This means that at least a fifth of the domestic market has given way to foreign commodity producers and we are expanding the economies of other states by curtailing our production. In order to prevent a further worsening of the state of affairs in agriculture, the state should intervene in the economic relations between agriculture and other sectors of the national economy and move to their regulation. However, this does not mean that one must without fail move to increasing purchase prices everywhere in order to eliminate the price disproportions arising between industry and agriculture. Under the conditions that have been created, any price increase for one product leads to inflation throughout the price system. It is advisable to eliminate the price disproportions between these sectors of the national economy not only by increasing purchase prices but also by reducing the prices for industrial products going to agriculture. For many industrial commodities, this can be done without pain to their producers since their profitability varies from 25 to 100 percent and more. In this case, the overall level of purchase prices can be increased by not more than 10 percent and subsidies to agriculture reduced to the minimum. They should be retained only for the production of a limited number of basic agricultural products. Large disproportions in exchange relations have also arisen within industry itself between the processing and raw-material branches. The discrepancy in prices between these branches reached 180 percent in favor of the processing branches during the two years of reforms. As a result, coal and oil-extracting industry enterprises, for example, must today sell 1.8-fold more of their products than they sold in 1991 in order to acquire the same amount of equipment that they got in 1991. It is not surprising that labor productivity is falling in these branches and that many enterprises have not modernized for a long time and are on the verge of bankruptcy. Raw-material branch enterprises themselves are not interested in acquiring domestic equipment, preferring to sell their products abroad and purchase equipment there. Serious disproportions have arisen in the fuel and energy complex branches. As is known, our industry, especially power engineering, has been mainly oriented for a long time toward the use of coal. All the major price and exchange ratios in the national economy have been built on the relationship to the price of coal. However, the liberalization of prices at one fell swoop led to upsetting the price ratios, which were keeping their balance, and the production processes, which were formed considering this. All coal-using enterprises -- and they represent approximately 70 percent of the total number of enterprises -- were placed in a difficult financial situation and forced to feverishly switch their production processes over to the use of other energy sources or shut down. Thus, the question of equalizing price ratios on the basis of regulating exchange relations between branches should be the pivot for all the states' future economic policy. When consistently following a policy of economic liberalization and expansion of the branch's use of market relations, the state should be concerned about their long-term economic interests. That is why it is necessary to move toward regulating (including primarily economic regulation) the most important price ratios for the purposes of balancing economic growth and adjusting the equivalent exchange of work results between branches and producers. This can be done on the basis of price agreements concluded through the mediation and under the control of state bodies between enterprises (branches) participating in the output of end products. These agreements can be fully concluded for technological chains: TEK [fuel and energy complex] - transportation - TEK, TEK - metallurgy - machine building - TEK, etc. In this case, the low prices for services, for example, transport for the fuel and energy complex, can be compensated for by the distribution of fuel and energy to transport at low prices. Financial policy also needs changes. The strict monetarist financial policy, on whose basis rests the idea of balancing the budget by systematic delays in paying wages, all-embracing price liberalization and high taxes, is already incapable of improving the financial and monetary system. It is losing its economic sense more and more, acquiring a narrow departmental nature and, like any departmental policy in the final analysis, is beginning to be at variance with the interests of expanding the national economy. Without a doubt, one cannot improve the economy without a balanced budget. However, one should not reduce financial policy only to the achievement of this goal because the budget can also be balanced by organizing the disproportions which are hurling the national economy back dozens of years and worsening the population's social condition. That is why the problem of balancing the budget cannot be solved by any means -- by a landslide curtailment of production and the bankruptcy of an enormous number of enterprises -- since physical production is the main source for the receipt of the state's financial assets. However, the financial policy, which has been recently followed, has also contributed a great deal to this. Thus, the country's industrial potential decreased by 34 percent during the two years of the reforms and approximately 40,000 enterprises were chronically insolvent during 1993. As a result of the strict monetarist financial policy, which is limiting the issuing of credits, and the establishment of high taxes, which have led to a production curtailment, the sources for replenishing the budget have been reduced by almost 20 percent. The country has thereby been deprived of significant financial assets and the financial and monetary system itself has been destabilized even more. Calculations show that with the further conducting of the selected financial policy in 1994, approximately 20 percent of all coal mines and metallurgical complex enterprises, 28 percent of machine building enterprises, 16 percent of the timber industry, 22 percent of printing plants, 32 percent of light industry, and 21 percent of the food industry could become bankrupt. This once again testifies that the financial policy should be changed. Its meaning should consist not of limiting the issuing of credits in every way possible and searching for additional taxes but of stimulating the expansion of production by the sensible use of existing financial assets, thereby contributing to expanding the base for new financial revenue for the budget. Entrepreneurs, who have invested their assets in expanding production facilities that are most profitable for them, have understood this for a long time. Unfortunately, the state is not doing this. The massive denationalization of enterprises and their transfer to private property without appropriate guarantees for their stable functioning and the insuring of tax receipts for the budget from their activity are occurring. As a result, tax receipts for the budget from privatized enterprises are being constantly reduced. They decreased by 17 percent during 1993. It is necessary to introduce certain adjustments in order to expand the reforms successfully. First of all, we must strengthen the social orientation of the reforms so that the individual's interests occupy the central place in them, the expansion of production and the balancing of national economic priorities are done on this basis, credit emissions are carried out, and the financial and monetary system strengthened in the final analysis. All necessary conditions for this exist today.
