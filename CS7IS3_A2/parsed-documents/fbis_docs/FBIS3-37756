In the morning, he held talks with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, as a result of which eight documents were signed. As BELAPAN learned, the documents concern, first of all, the state border between the two countries. The border is to remain the same as it was on 16 June 1940. During the talks, both sides agreed that it is necessary to expand cooperation between the two countries in various spheres of economy and politics. They particularly expressed their willingness to reach an agreement on mutually beneficial utilization of the Navapolatsk refinery and the Ventspils seaport. Also discussed was the possibility of establishing department stores in the capitals of both republics. Latvian products will be displayed, for example, by the Minsk supermarket Ryha. The situation of Belarusians in Latvia was also discussed at the meeting.
