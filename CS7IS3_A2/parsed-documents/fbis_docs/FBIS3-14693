This resolution represented the utmost in racial discrimination and hostility toward the Arabs. It was a new U.S. stab in the back of the Arab nation and dignity, as well as a violation of simple human rights and Security Council Resolution 715, which clearly provides for the lifting of the oil embargo once the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction is completed. This elimination, however, was achieved two months ago as was stated by the chief inspector Ekeus. Each time Iraq meets the Security Council's demands, despite their arbitrary nature, the United States presents impossible new demands and terms. The blockade is not meant to liberate Kuwait, dispose of Iraq's nuclear capabilities, or eliminate weapons of mass destruction; it is meant to subjugate Iraq to the United States. U.S. sources say that 397,226 Iraqis died as a direct result of the blockade from 1990 to the end of 1993. This figure includes 140,181 children under five years of age. This is a true massacre and "a holocaust" committed against the Arab race. The world is still feeling guilty due to its silence over the racist Nazi crimes, but, the world's conscience is still asleep despite the continuous massacre against Iraq's children, old people, and patients. There are other significant statistics to measure the repercussions resulting from the crime of this age. Iraqi medical laboratories issued 1,494,050 reports in 1989. This figure declined by 27 percent in 1990; by 57 percent in 1991; by 60.5 percent in 1992; and by 61.4 percent in 1993. Due to the lack of necessary medical supplies, surgeries carried out in Iraqi hospitals declined by 43 percent in 1990; by 57 percent in 1991; by 63.7 percent in 1992; and by 65.6 percent in 1993. Moreover, diseases caused by malnutrition have risen 13.6-fold since the blockade began. The real pleasure for those in the U.S. Administration, who pursue the hobby of torturing and annihilating human beings, is to compel the Arabs and Muslims to join the blockade. This is a unique way of coercion and humiliation under the slogan of international legitimacy. The United States committed a bloody massacre in Iraq in 1991 using the most sophisticated lethal weapons under the Republican George Bush. Today, the United States is committing another, yet more atrocious massacre, under the Democrat President Clinton, represented by denying an entire people their natural rights to obtain food and medicine. This constitutes an open call for terrorism, bigotry, wrath, and extremism in the Middle East. The humiliating Arab submission to the unfair U.S. blockade on the Arab people in Iraq means that the Arabs are bending their heads to the neo-Nazis who describe the wars of annihilating peoples as a conflict among civilizations.
