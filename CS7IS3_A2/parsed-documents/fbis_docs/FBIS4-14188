The sources stated that these measures were taken after the passports of Muhammad Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah, Hamas officials in Jordan, were confiscated even though their passports are valid for five years. The sources added that such an action is unconstitutional. In a telephone conversation with AL-BILAD, Interior Minister Salamah Hammad refused to comment on the passport issue considering it an issue not worth discussing. On the issue of arrests, Hammad said: I have not heard about it, and I have no idea about what you are saying.
