Fu Quanyou noted: Agricultural and sideline production of the Army is a component part of the country's agriculture. The Army's engaging in agricultural and sideline production plays an important role in relieving the state's burden, supplementing supplies to troops, improving officers' and men's lives, and promoting military reform and building -- this is an important matter benefiting the state, the Army, and the people. Over the past years, all troops in the Army have conscientiously carried out the directives of the CMC and the General Logistics Department in increasing agricultural and sideline production through hard work and have basically established a production structure with military farms as the mainstay, brigade- and regiment-run nonstaple food production bases and life service centers as the central links, and part-time production of companies as the foundation. The infrastructure has been gradually improved and the application of science in farming and livestock raising has been upgraded constantly; as a result, the overall production capacity has remarkably increased and a good trend for sustained and stable development has emerged. Last year, the entire Army reaped a good harvest in agricultural and sideline production, producing 650 million kg of grain; 225 million kg of meat, fish, poultry, and eggs; 600 million kg of vegetables; and 700 million yuan in total profits. This has effectively subsidized the lives of troops. Currently, commodity prices on the market are rising rapidly; this has greatly influenced the military life. Despite the fact that the CMC has decided to readjust the standard of military food expenses under the condition of a tight budget for military expenditure, there is still a large gap between the food expenses and the actual prices demanded by the market. To narrow this gap, it is necessary to vigorously increase agricultural and sideline production and increase the Army's self-supply capacity. Fu Quanyou said: Vigorously increasing agricultural and sideline production is the CMC's constant guiding ideology in strengthening Army building, the basic demand for comprehensively implementing the "Outline for Grass-Roots Military Building," and an important measure for maintaining military stability. As early as 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping noted: "It is necessary to run Army's agricultural and sideline production properly." Comrade Jiang Zemin also stressed: "The Army's engaging in agricultural and sideline production is the display of the Nanniwan spirit, which should be continued persistently." All troops in the Army, particularly leading cadres at all levels, must unify their thinking with the CMC's decisions, adhere to the orientation of serving life with production, and make subsidizing the lives of troops the starting point and goal of expanding agricultural and sideline production. Fu Quanyou stressed: Party committees and leaders at all levels must strengthen organization and leadership, place agricultural and sideline production on an important position, divide the work and assign special persons to take charge of the work, and study and settle problems on a regular basis. Leaders at all levels should use reform as the driving force, be oriented by the troops' demand and the development in the market, deepen reform, and intensify management to promote the all-Army agricultural and sideline production to a new level.
