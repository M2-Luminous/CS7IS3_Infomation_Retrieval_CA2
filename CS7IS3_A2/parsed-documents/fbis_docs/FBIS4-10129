In the message, Wasmosy says his government has studied and approved nearly 100 industrial projects, and created an Industrial Development Fund for granting immediate financial assistance to those projects. The message states: "Before the year end we will have a considerable number of new job opportunities for our young people, professionals, and technicians who anxiously expect to overcome the unemployment that afflicts thousands of our fellow countrymen." The eight-page message is signed by the president. Wasmosy did not talk to the media. In another paragraph Wasmosy says: "The allegation that the executive branch wants to maintain a harmful influence on the judicial branch is absolutely false. Very soon we will have a new judicial branch, reorganized according to constitutional mandates. No one is more interested than the executive branch in a sovereign, independent, and trustworthy justice system. We want a judicial branch capable of assuring not only to our own citizens, but also foreigners who might want to work and invest in our country." The message says: "The fight against corruption has enabled the government to increase its fiscal collections week after week. These collections are at record levels compared to the same periods in previous years. The government will be able to fulfill its obligations in time." Wasmosy's message adds that the political difficulties faced by the government to administer situations and conflicts of various kinds has sometimes made relations between government and Congress more or less critical. He comments: "Events will show that our commitment with opposition leaders who consider democratic governability an essential factor for the consolidation of this historic process will not be destroyed with the ease forecasted by those who miss the autocratic system." In the message, Wasmosy recognizes "the valuable cooperation of various opposition leaders who intellectually contributed to our diplomatic efforts, because in my government the national interest is more important than any egoist sectarian interests, which are a permanent source of mediocrity." Wasmosy says he faced the numerous labor conflicts "with calm," stressing that negotiation is the appropriate instrument "to transform confrontation into agreement." Wasmosy adds that he has "the necessary calmness and equanimity" to listen to representatives of groups who have not had the opportunity to make themselves heard before. He adds: "We are not impressed by force, but we are very sensitive to the force of reason used by the different groups in their arguments." Wasmosy concludes by committing himself to seek "the well-being of all in freedom, democracy, and peace."
