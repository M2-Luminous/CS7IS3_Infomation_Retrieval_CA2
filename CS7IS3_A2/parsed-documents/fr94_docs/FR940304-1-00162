FR940304-1-00162 FR940304-1-00014 Table 4&hyph;13._ Standard Levels Analyzed for Pool Heaters Annual Efficiency [In percent] 1Product class 1Standard level 2Baseline 21 22 23 24 Gas Fired 66.8 78.0 82.2 90.7 95.7 The Department considered one class of pool heaters, gas-fired pool heaters. For gas-fired pool heaters, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by incorporating an electronic ignition, level 2 assumes heat exchanger efficiency at the noncondensing limit, level 3 assumes condensing flue gases with a fan-assisted combustion system, and level 4 assumes condensing flue gases utilizing pulse combustion. 2. Payback Period Table 4&hyph;14 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed. Standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year.

Significance of Energy Savings To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new pool heaters under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings could result for each: Level 1_0.07 Quad Level 2_0.23 Quad Level 3_0.58 Quad Level 4_0.78 Quad The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy. 4. Economic Justification A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $39.39; to meet levels 2&hyph;4, the manufacturers' incremental cost increases are $95.05, $405.68, and $760.68, respectively.
