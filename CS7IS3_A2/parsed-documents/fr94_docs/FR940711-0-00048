FR940711-0-00048 FR940711-0-00011 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;222&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8960 AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;08] Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 (CL&hyph;601&hyph;3A) Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes, that requires inspection to detect chafing of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), modification of the wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness. This amendment is prompted by a report that the wiring harness on certain airplanes was produced in a configuration that is subject to chafing and electrical shorting. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent chafing or shorting of the wiring harness, which could result in loss of ADG power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed during an emergency situation. DATES: Effective August 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Bombardier, Inc., Canadair, Aerospace Group, P.O. Box 6087, Station A, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3G9 Canada. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, Room 202, Valley Stream, New York; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michele Maurer, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANE&hyph;173, FAA Engine and Propeller Directorate, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, Room 202, Valley Stream, New York 11581; telephone (516) 791&hyph;6427; fax (516) 791&hyph;9024. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11735). That action proposed to require inspection to detect chafing and modification of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), and repair of any chafed harness. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,375, or $55 per airplane. The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modification and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $199 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $17,350, or $694 per airplane. Based on the figures, above, the total (inspection plus modification) cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $18,725, or $749 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
