One is to win extension of the most-favored-nation status from the United States, and the other is to strive to restore China's contracting status in GATT (called "returning to GATT" hereafter). At present, the first objective has been achieved. As for returning to GATT, Tong Zhiguang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation who has represented China to attend the relevant talks many times, said in March that China might return to GATT by August on the grounds that the planned economic structure, which used to be the greatest obstacle to China's return to GATT, was no longer a problem after the establishment of the socialist market economic system was written into the PRC Constitution. Moreover, China has adopted a series of measures to reform its foreign trade system. Beginning this year, the system of assigning mandatory business quotas was terminated, and the system of assigning export quotas and licenses has also been replaced with a system of tender invitation. Import duties have been gradually lowered, and the overall foreign trade system has basically met GATT requirements. China has basically built up the framework for returning to GATT. However, in late May, Peter Sutherland, GATT director-general, said that it would be possible for China to return to GATT by 1 January next year, but this would still be an extremely difficult task because the decisive power is in the hands of other signatory states to GATT and the time for China's return to GATT will be decided collectively. China has spent eight years applying for a return to GATT. Certain progress was made in this regard, but the process was full of twists and turns. The issue thus once again aroused a debate inside the State Council. The debate was focused on whether China should strive to return to GATT at any costs. According to sources in Beijing, when talking about the issue of returning to GATT at a meeting of responsible officials in late May, Vice Premier Li Lanqing said that China now still cannot return to GATT not because China has not made sufficient preparations but because the United States is putting up obstructions for political reasons; China must not give up the principle of "balanced rights and duties" in order to return to GATT. He said: "In order to return to GATT, China has done all that it should to meet GATT requirements in terms of institutional structures and operational regulations. China still cannot return to GATT not because China is still short of any hard and soft conditions. It is because the United States deliberately makes things difficult for China according to its political strategy and imposes harsh terms on China. Some West European countries also follow the United States. It seems that we were too optimistic about returning to GATT in the previous period. Now we should more calmly consider this issue, and see which measures are unrealistic and out of keeping with our national conditions and which measures may expose our country to unnecessary impact after returning to GATT. We should be better aware of all this and make corrections in order to prevent losses we should not incur. Zou Jiahua, another vice premier of the State Council, also pointed out that although it is still necessary to create conditions for returning to GATT at an early date, we cannot and also should not make any promise we cannot fulfill at the current stage; still less can we behave like a supplicant begging for favors. He said that according to what he learned from his visit to the United States in May, after returning to GATT, China's machine-building, car-making, textile, and food-processing industries may be facing new difficulties, so they should take sufficient precautions and countermeasures against the unfavorable factors. Some people in economic and trade circles in Beijing said that in the process of returning to GATT, China must seek the common point (or compromise point) between the demands of existing GATT contracting parties and China's acceptability degree. The remarks of the two vice premiers, Li Lanqing and Zou Jiahua, show that China would, as usual, continue to adhere to the principle of "balanced rights and duties," and would never pay any costs in exchange for the return to GATT. If other contracting parities set forth unusual, discriminatory, and harsh terms for China's return to GATT, China will certainly make no compromise and adhere to its own position. In reality, the process of China's return to GATT is contingent on the political environment more than on the negotiations. When China clearly sees the other side's demands, it will come to understand that it cannot be overanxious for a quick result and should only try to gradually knock open the door for the return to GATT through making steady progress. According to sources, Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing Committee and the CPC Central Political Bureau and also vice premier of the State Council, held that China should still actively create conditions for returning to GATT. In early March, Zhu Rongji instructed Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission, Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, to jointly draft an outline about the main problems and measures for China's return to GATT in 1994 in order to submit the outline to the State Council for deliberation after the end of the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress. Zhu Rongji's main viewpoint was: The return to GATT will provide more favorable conditions for China's across-the-board opening and involvement in fair and free trade and business competition, and this will also remove the political obstacles set by the United States and Western Europe to China's foreign trade. Moreover, the cost of returning to GATT within this year will be smaller than that in two or three years. Therefore, China should continue to strive to return to GATT at an early date. For this purpose, China may now act according to GATT rules, and should overcome difficulties in adapting domestic systems to them. In order to return to GATT, China may first make certain compromises. The concessions will serve the purpose of gaining greater benefit. According to sources, Zhu Rongji's opinion on returning to GATT as soon as possible was supported by CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Political Bureau, and was also supported by many experts in GATT affairs. In Beijing, an expert in GATT affairs said that Zhu Rongji's idea was reasonable. If China makes certain concessions and carries out reforms in certain fields where conditions are not ripe enough for the purpose of returning to GATT, this will force the United States to show its hand on the issue of China's return to GATT. China will then be able to know its real intention, and will adjust its industrial structure and better orient its reforms in the fields of foreign trade and customs tariff to the world practice. Thus, even if China cannot return to GATT within this year, it will have better internal conditions for returning to GATT next year. It will then be more difficult for the United States and its Western followers to find any excuses. As for the United States using political factors to make things more difficult for China, the expert said this was a bargaining tactic that the United States would certainly use. If China is too inflexible and thus enables Taiwan to be admitted to GATT ahead of China, then the political factors will become more complicated. China may be facing the impact of its return to GATT in various realms. For example, the growth rate of the national economy may be slowed down, basic industries may be affected, the number of jobless people may increase, China's renminbi currency may be further devalued, and the shortage of foreign exchange worsen. The expert said that one should not overreact to such problems, because they will also appear even if China postpones its return to GATT one or two years. It is better that the pains come earlier than later. China may promote its reform and development through the return to GATT. The expert stressed that precisely proceeding from such strategic considerations, China announced the termination of issuing import licenses and quotas to 195 commodities on 25 May after it announced the termination of import control over 283 commodities. This not only showed China's sincerity for returning to GATT, but also pushed Chinese enterprises to the forefront of the international competition. China will have a stronger bargaining position in the talks on its return to GATT. If the United States allows China to return to GATT earlier, China may lower the tariffs earlier; on the contrary, China's tariffs will not be lowered and the American goods will find it hard to enter the Chinese market. The expert added: China's relations with GATT and the future World Trade Organization are two-way relations. That is, China needs them, and they also need China. China can now survive without the support of the world's free trade organization. In such circumstances, if the United States does not make positive responses and adopt a realistic approach, it will certainly be facing heavy pressure from American business circles and be asking for trouble.
