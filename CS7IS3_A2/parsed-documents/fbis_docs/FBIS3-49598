Food prices went up by 13 percent, services by about 20 percent, and public catering prices by 20 percent as well, Klaus said. He stressed that the overall figure was greatly influenced by the 8 percent price growth in January 1993 when a new taxation system was introduced. The aggregate price increase for the next 11 months was only 10 percent, Klaus pointed out. This means that the internal rate of inflation is about 10 percent, the lowest of all Eastern European countries and close to the level common in Western Europe, Klaus said. The rate of inflation in December was 0.8 percent.
