FBIS3-18498 "drweu043__a94016" FBIS-WEU-94-043-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Steinmetz' Role in RAF Not Clarified by Bundestag AU0203201294 Hamburg DPA in German 1722 GMT 2 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0203201294 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The role of liaison man Klaus Steinmetz, who was uncovered during the antiterrorism operation in Bad Kleinen, in the Red Army Faction (RAF) has not been finally clarified by the Bundestag's Parliamentary Control Committee. There are also still "incongruities" concerning his relationship with the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the Constitution, participants revealed after a meeting of the Committee in Bonn on Wednesday [2 March]. Thus, it is unclear what Steinmetz did for the authority and why the Land Office for the Protection of the Constitution did not tell the Federal Government earlier about the liaison man, who was allegedly infiltrated in the RAF command echelon, it was said. It was stressed that the suspension of the criminal proceedings against Steinmetz, which was ordered by the chief federal prosecutor's office, is only a temporary measure. Further insights might be gained from the criminal proceedings against Birgit Hogefeld, who was arrested in Bad Kleinen.
