He said this was necessary to reduce the increasing numbers of asylum-seekers (who have no prospects for life) entering the Netherlands via these countries. Lubbers spoke of an "administrative emergency situation." In a confidential letter to his fellow ministers on Monday 14 March the prime minister said among other things that "difficulties with expulsion (of rejected asylum-seekers, etc.) make it necessary to stop them from entering the Netherlands." The prime minister's proposal diverges from the intention to achieve open borders within Europe. Lubbers said this measure was necessary because the Schengen Treaty, which would oblige Germany to take back asylum-seekers, was not yet applicable. "What is involved is fixed check points and flying brigades in border areas, which must be reintroduced, at least until Schengen has actually taken effect," Lubbers wrote. [passage omitted]
