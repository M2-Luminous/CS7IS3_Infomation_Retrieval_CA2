Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 13 (CNA) -- The government is promoting the "Southern Strategy" to cut Taiwan's investment risk in Mainland China, Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said Thursday [13 January]. The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to invest more in Vietnam and member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which groups Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Brunei. Chiang made the remark in a nationwide radio program aired by the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) in the morning. Although the new investment drive is a "win-win" policy for both Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries, the government will respect whatever decisions domestic investors make, he noted. The minister, however, cited active participation in the new investment strategy as the best policy, saying traders should follow business benefits. Under the "Southern Strategy," which is also touted as the "Guidelines for the Strengthening of Trade Ties With Southeast Asia," the government will take the initiative to deal with various governments to help promote the interests of Taiwan investors, he elaborated. If Taiwan investors don't go to Southeast Asia now, their counterparts in other countries such as Japan, South Korea, and the United States will, he warned. In the initial stage, he added, the strategy will target Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The three countries boast rich natural resources and an abundant labor force, he said, suggesting that Taiwan investors invest in agriculture, forestry, fishery, petrochemicals, and labor-intensive industries. Moreover, he revealed, the government is also pondering cooperation with Indonesia on aerospace industry development. The aerospace development package is still in the planning stages, he added. Chiang stressed that the "Southern Strategy" will produce reciprocal benefits, saying increased Taiwan investments will help boost the economies and upgrade the living standards in the Southeast Asian countries, whose peoples in turn will have more purchasing power to buy Taiwan-made products.
