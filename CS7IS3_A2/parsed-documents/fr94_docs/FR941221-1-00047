The standardized test procedure to be used to determine the method detection limit (MDL) for these test procedures is given at appendix B, ``Definition and Procedure for the Determination of the Method Detection Limit'' of this part 136. 3``Methods for Benzidine: Chlorinated Organic Compounds, Pentachlorophenol and Pesticides in Water and Wastewater,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, September, 1978. *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ * 7Each analyst must make an initial, one-time demonstration of their ability to generate acceptable precision and accuracy with Methods 601&hyph;603, 624, 625, 1624, and 1625 (See appendix A of the part 136) in accordance with procedures each in section 8.2 of each of these Methods. Additionally, each laboratory, on and on-going bases must spike and analyze 10% (5% for Methods 624 and 625 and 100% for Methods 1624 and 1625) of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality in accordance with sections 8.3 and 8.4 of these Methods. When the recovery of any parameter falls outside the warning limits, the analytical results for that parameter in the unspiked sample are suspect and cannot be reported to demonstrate regulatory compliance. 8``Organochlorine Pesticides and PCBs in Wastewater Using Empore TM Disk'', 3M Corporation Revised 10/28/94.
