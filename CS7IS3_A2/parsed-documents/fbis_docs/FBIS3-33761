The paper said the delegation wanted to "stop the fundamentalists coming from Afghanistan from reaching Cairo through Yemen" to carry out attacks. The paper said the delegation was "carrying documents with the addresses of the homes of fundamentalists" implicated in recent attacks in Cairo. The report said Islamic militants arrested in Egypt, including the alleged perpetrators of an abortive attempt to assassinate Egypt's Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi in November in Cairo, had supplied police with these addresses. They also provided information about camps located in Yemen where they received training in weapons handling and explosives. The visit to Sanaa follows a recent meeting in Tunis between the Egyptian and Yemeni interior ministers, Hasan al-Alfi and Muhammad Salim al-Mutawakkil. Al-Mutawakkil told AL-AHRAM then that they had discussed the possibility of signing a an extradition treaty to enable Egypt to recover fundamentalists who had fled to Yemen. He said Yemen had "set up lines of coordination with Egypt in the fight against terrorism."
