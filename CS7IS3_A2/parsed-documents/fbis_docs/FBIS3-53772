The Afghan official is currently here for the international seminar on the process of development in Central Asia and the Caucasus. He told IRNA that incompetency of jihad groups in establishing order and security and improving economic and administrative condition had added to the people's dissatisfaction. The Afghan official further noted that warring sides should declare ceasefire and search for solutions to their differences through negotiation. Otherwise, he stressed, the Afghan people would suffer heavy financial and human losses. He dismissed some analysis that the recent war had an ethnic nture and said it was merely a struggle for gaining power. Shams stressed the need for international assistance to reconstruct his war-devastated country.
