FR941221-1-00015 FR941221-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 168 [CGD 91&hyph;202a] RIN: 2115&hyph;AE56 Escort Vessels in Certain U.S. Waters AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of meeting; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard will conduct a public meeting to discuss criteria for identifying U.S. waters where escort vessels should be required. Public comment is sought on how to evaluate the navigational risks of a waterway (with respect to a ship experiencing a loss of propulsion or steering control or both), and how to determine if escorting is an effective strategy to offset those risks. DATES: The meeting will be held January 23, 1995, from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Written comments must be received not later than February 13, 1995. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held in room 2415, Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW, Washington, DC. Written comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 Second Street SW, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to room 3406 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Comments will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 3406, Coast Guard Headquarters, between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Thomas Jordan, Project Manager, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90), phone (202) 267&hyph;6740. This telephone is equipped to take messages on a 24-hour basis. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Participation in the Public Meeting Attendance is open to the public. With advance notice, and as time permits, members of the public may make oral presentations during the meeting. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should notify the person listed above under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT no later than the day before the meeting. Written material may be submitted prior to, during, or after the meeting. Reason for Public Meeting On April 27, 1993, the Coast Guard published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking comment on U.S. waters where tanker escorts should be required, and what other vessels should also be escorted (58 FR 25766). At that time, however, the escort regulations of 33 CFR part 168 had not yet been published, nor did the ANPRM include any special guidance on how waterways should be evaluated and nominated for escorting. Therefore, public comments in response to the ANPRM were made without the benefit of either 33 CFR part 168 or any guidance criteria.
