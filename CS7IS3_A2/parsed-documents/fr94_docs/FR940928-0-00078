The authority citation for Part 305 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6294. 2. Section 305.2(i) is revised to read as follows: §305.2 Definitions. * * * * * (i) Energy efficiency rating means the following product-specific energy usage descriptors: annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) for furnaces; energy efficiency ratio (EER) for room air conditioners; seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) for the cooling function of central air conditioners and heat pumps; heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) for the heating function of heat pumps; and, thermal efficiency (TE) for pool heaters, as these descriptors are determined in accordance with tests prescribed under section 323 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6293). These product-specific energy usage descriptors shall be used in satisfying all the requirements of this part. * * * * * 3. In §305.3, paragraph (d) is revised and paragraph (o) is added, to read as follows: §305.3 Description of covered products to which this part applies. * * * * * (d)(1) Water heater means a product which utilizes oil, gas, or electricity to heat potable water for use outside the heater upon demand, including_ (i) Storage type units which heat and store water at a thermostatically controlled temperature, including gas storage water heaters with an input of 75,000 Btu per hour or less, oil storage water heaters with an input of 105,000 Btu per hour or less, and electric storage water heaters with an input of 12 kilowatts or less; (ii) Instantaneous type units which heat water but contain no more than one gallon of water per 4,000 Btu per hour of input, including gas instantaneous water heaters with an input of 200,000 Btu per hour or less, oil instantaneous water heaters with an input of 210,000 Btu per hour or less, and electric instantaneous water heaters with an input of 12 kilowatts or less; and (iii) Heat pump type units, with a maximum current rating of 24 amperes at a voltage no greater than 250 volts, which are products designed to transfer thermal energy from one temperature level to a higher temperature level for the purpose of heating water, including all ancillary equipment such as fans, storage tanks, pumps, or controls necessary for the device to perform its function. (2) The requirements of this Part are limited to those water heaters for which the Department of Energy has adopted and published test procedures for measuring energy usage. * * * * * (o) Pool heater means an appliance designed for heating nonpotable water contained at atmospheric pressure, including heating water in swimming pools, spas, hot tubs and similar applications. The requirements of this part are limited to those pool heaters for which the Department of Energy has adopted and published test procedures for measuring energy usage. * * * * * 4. In §305.4, paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) are revised to read as follows: §305.4 Prohibited acts. * * * * * (e) * * * (2) Any covered product, other than central air conditioners, pulse combustion and condensing furnaces, fluorescent lamp ballasts, showerheads, faucets, water closets, urinals, pool heaters, instantaneous water heaters, or heat pump water heaters, if the manufacture of the product was completed prior to May 19, 1980. Any central air conditioner or any pulse combustion or condensing furnace if its manufacture was completed prior to June 7, 1988. Any fluorescent lamp ballast if its manufacture was completed prior to January 1, 1990. Any showerhead, faucet, water closet, or urinal if its manufacture was completed prior to October 25, 1994. Any pool heater, instantaneous water heater, or heat pump water heater if its manufacture was completed prior to December 29, 1994. (3) Any catalog or point-of-sale printed material distributed prior to May 19, 1980, pertaining to any covered products, other than central air conditioners, pulse combustion and condensing furnaces, fluorescent lamp ballasts, showerheads, faucets, water closets, urinals, pool heaters, instantaneous water heaters, or heat pump water heaters; any catalog or point-of-sale printed material distributed prior to June 7, 1988, pertaining to any central air conditioners or pulse combustion or condensing furnaces; any catalog or point-of-sale printed material distributed prior to January 1, 1990, pertaining to any fluorescent lamp ballasts; any catalog or point-of-sale printed material distributed prior to October 25, 1994, pertaining to any showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals; and, any catalog or point-of-sale printed material distributed prior to December 29, 1994, pertaining to any pool heaters, instantaneous water heaters, or heat pump water heaters; except that any representations respecting the energy consumption, energy efficiency, or water use of any covered product or other consumer appliance product, or the cost of energy consumed or water used by such product, are subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. * * * * * 5. In §305.5, paragraph (a)(9) is redesignated as (a)(10), and a new paragraph (a)(9) is added, to read as follows: §305.5 Determinations of estimated annual energy consumption, estimated annual operating cost, and energy efficiency rating, and of water use rate. (a) * * * (9) Pool heaters_§430.22(p). * * * * * 6. In §305.7, paragraphs (e) through (j) are redesignated as (f) through (k), and a new paragraph (e) is added, to read as follows: §305.7 Determinations of capacity. * * * * * (e) Pool heaters. The capacity shall be the heating capacity in Btu's per hour, rounded to the nearest 1,000 Btu's per hour, as determined according to Appendix P to 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. * * * * *
