Menem acknowledged that "there were some arguments" over the issue of the secretariat, although he made it clear that "there is no confrontation" and that activities "are going on as usual." The head of state commented that "this situation will affect the Constituent Assembly, but not in a major way; it will have only a slight, practically insignificant bearing on the assembly." He confirmed that he will attend the opening session to be held in Parana [Entre Rios Province] on 25 May. Menem did not rule out that "as in any election campaign, an offense of defamation, insults, and slander will be launched." He noted that newspaper headlines, which reported on controversies within the cabinet, "will have some effect on people's way of thinking," but he stressed that "this does not influence the working of the administration in the least because there were only arguments, and not confrontations as the media reported." The president labeled the arguments within the cabinet "normal," "especially in a government like this, in which changes are really dramatic." Hence, one "should not be surprised or alarmed." With regard to the Secretariat for Community Protection, Menem said it will be "like any other thing that was established at cabinet level, many of which came directly under the jurisdiction of the president." Menem, speaking on the La 9.90 radio station this morning, said "it is a secretariat like any other. The problem lies in the fact that there are eight laws on security, and they must be made compatible with the areas in which they are inserted." He pointed out that the government "has been working" on the establishment of this secretariat "for a year." He nevertheless conceded that "perhaps information about the subject was deficient; some hasty words were uttered, and the events that are now public knowledge supervened." Notwithstanding this, he reiterated that "these kinds of organizations pertaining to people's security already exist in the leading countries of the world, and it never crossed their minds to think they are like the Gestapo. These words (Gestapo-KGB) are used in the world of politics to stir up uneasiness among citizens," he added. Menem again said that "once the law on ministries is amended following the constitutional reform, there will be a new ministry that will be entirely and exclusively charged with ensuring that the community is protected." He went on to say that "those who feel ill at ease are obviously the ones who are going to wield less power and are therefore trying to create problems in the community." The head of state believes that "those who are openly against the establishment of this secretariat are those whose actions seek to destroy the peace that reigns in Argentina, cause problems for democracy, and hamper the complete freedom we enjoy in our country."
