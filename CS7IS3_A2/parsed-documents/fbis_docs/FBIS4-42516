With the winding down of the postwar boom period in the late 1960's, the old fear that sooner or later society would run out of work after the most pressing demands of consumers were satisfied appeared to be confirmed. Even in subsequent recovery periods unemployment rates did come down on a sustained basis. According to OECD estimates, nearly 35 million people--that is, 8.5 percent of the entire labor force--are without work in the Western industrial countries; in the 12 EC countries, this rate will even climb to a record 12 percent. Has the Western economic system therefore failed? Has full employment become a chimera from an economic wonderland that at best can still be achieved with the aid of massive state employment programs or by way of a redistribution of scarce work through reduced working hours? This question is by no means being posed any longer only by those who have always had little faith in the self-healing powers of the market. Resignation is increasingly taking hold of the traditionally free-market oriented economists of the leading international organizations such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund. Yet it is surprising how little attention is being paid in all this to two circumstances that are of paramount importance to a careful analysis of the problem: For one thing, it is not true at all, for example, that jobs have been lost in the last two decades. On the contrary, the number of people gainfully employed has increased by more than 25 percent in the OECD area with the result that 76.5 million more positions were filled in 1991 than in 1970. In Europe alone a good 19 million new jobs were created, which, after all, amounts to an increase of just under 3 percent. To be sure, this increase did not keep pace with the simultaneous growth in the numbers of persons seeking employment and consequently the problem must obviously be formulated entirely differently than it is in the simplistic and empirically false notion of a permanent process of labor cutbacks. The question must be raised as to the economic mechanisms that can actually satisfy the demands for jobs by additional numbers of persons of employable age who are coming onto the labor market and the question must be asked as to why these mechanisms have functioned in a progressively less satisfactory manner in the last 20 years. The second and perhaps more important aspect concerns the extremely varied successes of the individual industrial countries in overcoming their employment problems. It is by no means the case that all countries reacted to the challenge to their employment policies in the same way; moreover they were, as a result of their basic economic policy orientation, prepared for it in different ways. The national rates of unemployment also differ radically: Hidden by the average 7.3-percent unemployment rate for the OECD countries in the 1980's are rates ranging from 2.5 percent and less for Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland, to that of a good 10 percent for Italy or even 18 percent for Spain. Development during the decade was also very nonuniform: While Japan, for example, was able to essentially maintain its low unemployment figures and even lower them at the end of the decade, Italy, by way of example, with its unemployment rate of 12 percent, was worse off in the last year of the 1980's than in any previous year. There must be reasons for such differences. In less successful countries, special influences are quickly cited as an explanation for the better performance of other countries. In the case of Switzerland, for example, its role as a center of and magnet for large capital flows is cited, as is its high percentage of foreign workers that serves as a convenient employment buffer. For Japan, the principle of lifelong company employment--hardly reproducible in other countries--as well as its large export surpluses are cited as special factors--often in connection with explicit or implied recriminations of protectionism. A closer examination reveals the superficiality of such explanations, however. In comparison with earlier times, Switzerland has by no means "exported" more unemployed persons in the past 20 years; the number of foreigners as a percentage of the overall labor force during the recession of the early 1980's remained unchanged for all practical purposes. The oft-cited Japanese system of lifelong employment exists there only in the large corporations and thus affects only about a quarter of the labor force. And, in the final analysis, it is not only Japan that can show large export surpluses but, for example, the Federal Republic as well, and yet nevertheless it, in contrast to Japan, has not been able to maintain full employment. Thus, to find the causes of such differences, one has to dig deeper. In so doing, it is reasonable to take the basic tenants of current economic explanations for the origins of unemployment as a point of departure. There is, to be sure, a considerable number of relevant hypotheses and some of them are totally contradictory. It is, for example, a highly controversial issue as to whether technological progress is a jobkiller or a jobfiller: On the one hand, it is almost always associated at first with the elimination of jobs through rationalization, yet on the other hand it reduces costs and creates margins for new demand. Even the role of economic growth is evaluated in completely different ways: To be sure, new demand is created, yet it appears to have a progressively less beneficial impact on the employment situation and thereby creates even more ecological problems than it solves economic ones. There is also controversy among the specialists over the efficacy of state labor market policy--such as wage subsidies or job-creation programs, for example. Is it necessary compensation for the insufficient vitality of competition or does it, in the final analysis, hinder the creation of private-sector jobs? Such a plethora of opinions on the part of economists literally cries out for empirical examination and there is indeed no dearth of relevant research--for the most part restricted to only a few countries or to individual hypotheses, to be sure. To date, however, there has not been a study that for once compared the most important fundamentals of the theories and tested their validity in regard to the respective employment trends on a cross-section of all the large industrial countries. Our study, commissioned by the Berthelsmann Foundation, makes that attempt. The questions were: What are the causes for the differences in the employment trends of the 17 most important industrial countries since the early 1980's and what lessons regarding economic policy can be learned from them? The difficulties involved in such a comprehensive research project are considerable. They begin with the issue of what criterion should be used to measure the success of a country's employment policy in the first place. Of course, a possibility immediately presents itself in the form of unemployment rates that are available for most countries based on a standardized calculation. Yet the annual increase in employment should also play a role: After all, higher growth in the number of jobs is also to be considered a success even if it does not result in an immediate lowering of the unemployment rate--for example, in the case of a sharp increase in the size of the labor force. For a specific case, a target figure--a combination of the unemployment rate and the increase in the gainfully employed population--was chosen as the measure of success. Of course, job growth was given progressively less weight as the level of full employment achieved by a country rose. In the final analysis, it makes little sense to downgrade a country on the basis of insufficient new job creation when the full employment target there has been largely achieved. It is, of course, far more difficult to identify the operative factors that are critical to the success of employment policy. Relevant hypotheses, if they are to be scientifically validated, must fulfill at least three requirements: They must be theoretically plausible, they must be quantifiable in a comparative manner applicable to all countries, and they must be statistically significant--that is, they must contribute in a demonstrable way to explaining the success of the employment policy. Out of the multitude of possible hypotheses, 10 operative factors ultimately emerge that satisfy all these requirements. For purposes of better comparison, they were rated on a point scale in which the country with the best individual score (the highest rate of growth, for example), was given 10 points and the remaining countries were given correspondingly fewer in accordance with their ranking. Applied to the period under investigation--1980 to 1993--the differences in the employment policy successes of the 17 industrial countries studied can be 80 percent explained by these 10 performance figures, although, to be sure, the relative importance of the individual factors are quite different. They were grouped into four categories ("Unions/Labor and Management," "Labor Market Policy," "Growth," and "Fiscal Policy"). The greatest influence can be attributed to the behavior of unions/labor and management. Viewed purely statistically, the differences can be 40 percent explained on the basis of this factor alone. To wit, it is of critical importance for the situation on the labor markets whether unions/labor and management respect the distributive margins created by growth in productivity and utilize them in a cooperative manner or whether they attempt--in the form of unproductive distribution conflicts--to distribute more than growth provides--an attempt that, after all, is ultimately doomed to failure. Nonetheless, this is attempted repeatedly in Spain and Italy and in Canada and Australia as well--all countries in which there is an extraordinarily great willingness to strike as well as an alarming growth in unit labor costs. Indeed, during the period studied, an average of 667 working days per 1000 workers were lost due to strikes in Spain compared to only 30 days in Germany, all of four days in Austria, and less than one day in Switzerland. At the same time, unit labor costs--calculated in the national currency--rose in Spain by an average of 8.3 percent--far more than twice as much as in Germany (3 percent), for example, or in Austria (3.9 percent) or Japan (2.3 percent). Even though these differences were partially compensated for in international competition by corresponding exchange rate fluctuations, they demonstrate that the domestic distributive margins in the countries in question were constantly overstrained. The labor markets degenerated into closed shop establishments for those who (still) had a job. As a result, incentives and latitude for the creation of new jobs could hardly be created. Of course, the issue is not solely the average growth in wages. The extent to which attention is paid to the differing degrees of factory and sector productivity is just as important--as is how flexible, for example, working hours are arranged and terms of termination are formulated. All of this, of course, can only be measured with difficulty. Nonetheless, if the percentage of part-time jobs in the overall employment picture is taken as the most important indicator of flexibility of working conditions, then in this case too it is evident that Spain and Italy--with rates of only a good 5 percent--rank at the very bottom of the scale. In Sweden and Norway, on the other hand, every forth job on average was a part-time job during the 1980's, and Germany too--with, after all, a good 13 percent--showed a rising trend. As far as the two Nordic countries are concerned, they, to be sure, owe their comparatively good employment growth to another circumstance--to wit, to an active and innovative state labor market policy. In all the countries under comparison it has obviously been beneficial when unemployment--once it had come about--was not merely compensated for with commensurate subsidy payments, but when active measures such as job-creation programs are given emphasis. The latter in particular are highly important because in this case the causes of difficulty in placing somewhat older or very young unemployed persons are directly attacked. On a purely statistical basis, about 30 percent of the international differences caused by labor market policy can be explained. Here, of course, it must be borne in mind that the employment relationships created in this manner have a predominantly different quality than do jobs that are created and can be sustained in the private competitive sector. The example of Sweden in particular creates doubts as to whether this course can be successfully pursued in the long term because its negative consequences--in the form of excessive demands on public finances, permanent jeopardizing of currency stability, and lack of efficiency--have meanwhile become readily apparent there. The Swedish unemployment rate has skyrocketed in the past four years from 1.5 percent to 7.4 percent. The attempt to change to a more free-market and stability-oriented course has suddenly revealed the failures of past decades. As far as growth is concerned, it is time to take leave of the widespread notion that the employment problem can be solved solely by high growth. Countries such as Australia, Italy, and Canada that, to be sure, have all grown at faster-than-average rates over the past 15 years yet at the same time are suffering much greater unemployment problems than countries with weaker growth, are examples that contradict this notion. Indeed Switzerland, for example, had the lowest average growth rate of all the countries but at the same time had the lowest rates of unemployment. Growth is, of course, essential for countries such as the Federal Republic that find themselves confronted with a sharp increase in the size of the labor force. If the number of persons seeking jobs grows, full employment without cuts in real wages can only be maintained with the aid of investments and high growth. This, of course, applies especially when income expectations include additional increases. This explains why economic growth--calculated across the board for all countries--nonetheless proves to be responsible for 20 percent of employment policy success. But what is really important, after all, is not the absolute level of economic growth but much rather the degree to which the distributive margins that make it possible are respected. Not only unproductive distribution conflicts between unions/labor and management are at issue here, but also the demands that the state places on the distributable national product. Since the early 1970's, these demands have been progressively ratcheted upwards in virtually all countries and, in the Scandinavian countries in particular, they amounted on average over the period studied to well over 50 percent--and in Sweden to even more than 60 percent--of the national product. Along with this came a progressively increasing burden on the citizenry in the form of taxes and social security contributions that drove an ever-greater wedge between what had to be earned on the job and what in the final analysis remained leftover from real income. To be sure, the importance of these burdens for explaining the international differences in employment growth is, at about 10 percent, not apparently very high, yet that is probably due to the fact that essentially all countries have embarked upon this fateful course equally, and partially due to proliferating national deficits. There are, certainly, two notable exceptions: To wit, Switzerland and Japan, countries that with government expenditure rates averaging only 24 percent and 32 percent respectively for the years 1980-1993 rank at the very bottom end of the scale. Is it a coincidence that these two countries have by far the best employment situation? All too facile monocausal explanations of the situation on the labor markets should, of course, be avoided. None of the cited factors can adequately explain the varying employment policy successes in the industrial countries by itself and examples can be easily found contradicting any such attempt. Only when all performance figures can be viewed in context does the picture become clearer. The 17 industrial countries studied can then grouped into four fundamentally different categories that in each case have adopted very different strategies. Analysis shows that a direct correlation exists between these strategies and the respective success of employment policy. Japan and Switzerland, for example, are thus in both respects--in regard to performance figures well as employment policy success--ahead of all the countries, while conversely Italy, Denmark, and Spain, for example, rank at the very end of the scale in regard to both point scores for performance and target figures. For the countries ranked in the middle, the proportionate correlation is, with a few exceptions, striking. If a mean value is derived from the point scores for target and performance figures, a graphic ranking of the 17 industrial countries results that illustrates both employment policy success and the performance figures critical to it (see table). Since it is, after all, based on mean values of a time period spanning 14 years, it is to a great extent independent of incidental--for instance cyclical--influences. The point scores of the individual countries are derived from their performance as it relates to the factors of growth, fiscal policy, labor market policy, unions/labor and management, as well as the increase in the gainfully employed population and the rate of unemployment. The highest theoretical score is 10.0 points. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Employment Policy Results 1980-1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Switzerland |8.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Japan |8.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Norway |7.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sweden |7.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Austria |7.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Germany |6.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Portugal |6.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |United States |6.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Netherlands |5.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Australia |5.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |France |5.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Canada |5.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Great Britain |5.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belgium |4.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Italy |4.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Denmark |4.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Spain |3.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One thus has a basis for more precisely analyzing which strategies countries have pursued in individual cases and how successful they have been with them. Among the most successful countries, one group can be initially identified which includes--in addition to Japan, Switzerland, and Austria--Germany and, with some qualifications, the United States. They can best be characterized as stability-oriented free-market economies because they have a high degree of social and monetary stability and their employment policies rely primarily on free-market economy instruments. The salient characteristics of these countries are few strikes and a relatively small increase in unit labor costs in association with low inflation and comparatively modest overall tax and revenue burdens. All this, of course, is interdependent. If wage-price spirals could be avoided to a great extent in these countries, then this has been due to the soundness of their monetary and fiscal policies as well as to a sense of responsibility on the part of unions/labor and management. Thus, the vitality of their markets was sufficiently strong to create competitive jobs that are not critically dependent upon labor cost subsidies and government aid. From the German perspective it may appear surprising that West Germany (the new federal laender could not be taken into account) is represented in this top group. In fact, the situation on the western German labor market can hardly be satisfactory, yet here we are dealing with a relative comparison to other industrial countries--and as is well-known, among the blind the one-eyed man is king. It should also not be overlooked that the gap between Germany and the model countries Switzerland and Japan is considerable and that particularly in recent years Germany has diverged in many respects from the model of a stability-oriented free-market economy--and not solely due to the special burdens of German unification. Thus, unit labor costs have risen alarmingly, and the burdens upon the economy caused by social and fiscal policies have reached record levels--even without nursing care insurance. Germany, especially in respect to fiscal policy, has moved in the direction of a second group of countries that can most appropriately be characterized as active employment policy welfare states. This group, in which, in addition to Sweden and Norway, Portugal can also be placed--at least for the first half of the 1980's--also has, to be sure, comparatively good employment policy results to show. It has achieved them in an entirely different manner, however--namely, with the aid of wage subsidies and job-creation and training programs as well as--and not least of all--the expansion of employment in the public sector. Whoever advocates imitating this course of a second or third labor market should certainly pay attention to its niceties as well: In both Sweden and Norway great emphasis is placed upon ensuring that when a job or opportunity for advanced training is offered at the employment office, it is accepted as well--slackers are eliminated in this way. Above all, however, this manner of providing employment as a function of government is associated with extremely high costs and losses in efficiency. The Swedish example makes the viability of it in the long term appear doubtful. Countries that have neither sufficient free-market economic vitality nor an active labor market policy but simply attempt to ameliorate the evil of unemployment through comparatively generous social safety net systems are, of course, even worse off. These welfare states that have passive employment policies--which include Denmark, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands--are caught in a true welfare trap: The creation of new jobs is impeded by high taxes and social security contributions while, on the other hand, the taxes cannot be reduced because unemployment is high and because individual incentives for reentering the labor market are often lacking. The fact that the Netherlands, for example, with a million work-disabled persons and an astonishingly large number of young people among them, has the highest rate of work-disabled people of all industrialized countries, has certainly less to do with any particular health hazard in that country than it has to do to a far greater extent with tangible negative economic incentives. Once a country is deep enough in the quicksand of the welfare state, however, the employment policy consequences are not long in making themselves felt, as the poor showing of the countries in question in the ranking list shows. The employment situation is similarly miserable in a final group of industrial countries which includes Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and (at least until the mid-1980's) Great Britain. Individually, these countries have admittedly very divergent problems but their common characteristics are serious distribution conflicts among the socially relevant groups and in particular between unions/labor and management as well. They are thus the exact opposites of stability-oriented free-market economies: many strikes and permanent wage-price spirals usually associated with a grim fiscal situation and little imaginativeness in government labor market policy. That is the scenario that gives rise to the highest rates of unemployment and the lowest growth in jobs of all industrialized countries. The poor ranking of the countries in question are thus not surprising. The upshot of all the research can be stated in summarized form in one sentence: Social and monetary stability in association with a government economic policy that is able to unite social security with the preservation of adequate performance incentives is the best guarantor for full employment. This conclusion may not be very surprising to economists, but the unambiguous manner in which it can be extrapolated from international experience over the past 15 years probably will be. It seems that not only has full employment been lost in the industrialized countries, but the knowledge of relatively simple economic relationships that should have been observed for the maintenance of a high level of employment has been as well.
