Speaking at the FDP's Research and Scientific Congress entitled "Is Germany Sleeping Through Its Own Future?," Kinkel said: "Germany has not yet realized what damage these occurrences are causing us abroad. Germany is no longer first choice among foreign students. Out of 800 Turkish students who had won scholarships, 770 have chosen to study either in the United States or Great Britain. Only 12 have chosen a German university," said Kinkel. [passage omitted]
