FBIS4-48066 "drafr091_a_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda President's Attendance at Inauguration Ridiculed President's Attendance at Inauguration Ridiculed EA1005160894 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda 1100 GMT 10 May 94 EA1005160894 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura English BFN [Text] Radio Rwanda has announced that the self-imposed President Sindikubwabo will attend Mandela's swearing-in today. Sindikubwabo has nothing to celebrate in Mandela's victory. Mandela has been fighting for democracy and the creation of a just society for all, while Sindikubwabo is responsible for the massacres of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. Sindikubwabo has been committing genocide against the people of Tutsi origin in Rwanda. Oppression of one group of people against another group is what Mr. Mandela has been fighting throughout his life. Mr. Mandela is seen as a symbol of freedom the world over. Sindikubwabo is a wanted criminal for committing crimes against humanity. Sindikubwabo has not even been invited to attend today's occasion in South Africa because his government is illegitimate and has been denounced by the whole world. The victory of South Africans against apartheid should sound a warning for Sindikubwabo and his fascist colleagues that their days are numbered.
