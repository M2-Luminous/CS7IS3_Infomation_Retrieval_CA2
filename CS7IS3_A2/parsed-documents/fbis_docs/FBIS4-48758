He is also due to meet Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg at midday and Freedom Front leader Gen Constand Viljoen later in the day. Emerging from his official Tuynhuys offices flanked by the nine premiers and second deputy president Mr F W de Klerk, Mr Mandela said there was a need for him and the provincial leaders to exchange views. "We will listen to people ourselves; our style is one of intensive consultation. The agenda is going to come from such meetings," Mr Mandela said. An earlier statement from the Tuyhhuys said the meeting with the premiers would include matters such as the relationship between the central government and the provincial administrations, and relevant constitutional matters. Also of importance were the implementation of programmes for reconstruction and development. Mr Mandela, who is to meet Dr Hartzenberg about midday at his official residence Westbrooke, said he was due to meet Gen Viljoen later on Wednesday. This followed their meeting on Friday and another between Mr de Klerk and the Freedom Front leader. Mr Mandela said he was prepared to listen to Gen Viljoen in what he called a preliminary discussion. The Conservative Party had also indicated it wanted to raise certain issues with the government, including the question of amnesty of 32 Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] members implicated in pre-election bomb blasts. Other CP concerns included a licence for Radio Pretoria and the question of the "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland].
