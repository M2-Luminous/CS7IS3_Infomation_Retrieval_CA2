During a regular session this Saturday, IFE members unanimously agreed to order the institution's Radio Broadcasts Commission to file a report on their findings by the end of the month at the latest. The Commission is to report to the Council every 15 days until the political campaigns conclude on the handling of information reported by the media. Over 40 million Mexicans will go to the polls during 21 August's federal elections to choose a president, 500 deputies, 128 senators, and 66 Assembly members. The IFE General Council plan includes a recommendation to the media, mainly radio and television stations, to balance information on the political campaigns of the various parties. It also asks the electronic media to respect, in their radio and television newscasts, the right of Mexicans to be informed about the campaign activities of the nine presidential candidates.
