This is why we have determined this is not an Indian uprising but, rather, a deliberate action by this violent faction that heads the rebellion. There has never been a country in which such an action has led to social advancement for those who have less, nor has such an action ever brought about democratic progress. The events in Chiapas sadden all Mexicans, because even after recognizing inequalities, as we have done, for many years Mexicans have worked together for generations to open the way for respect, dialogue, and peace. In addition, it is not fair to make attempts on anyone's life. They are all Mexicans; they deserve the greatest respect. At the same time, it is disturbing that, by taking advantage of this situation of violence in this region of Chiapas, some are trying to damage the name of Mexico, which has taken so much time and effort to build. Therefore, this is an action that goes against national interests. This armed group is against Mexico. Several Indian and rural communities have rejected these people. The roads of participation are open to everyone. New avenues may be opened if we persevere in our way of doing things. No one wants a Mexico in which liberties are reduced in an effort to guarantee security. Standing before you, I want to point out the fact that violence does not generate more freedom or democracy but, rather, hatred and political narrow-mindedness. The Army and the state's security forces are fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law. The government's actions have had two purposes: the first, to protect the lives of the civilian population; and the second, to reestablish normalcy in the region. The actions of the government of the Republic are within the framework of the Constitution. The law will be applied strictly. The authorities' firm action will not be exercised against the communities, which we respect and support, or against the many organizations that work in the area in a dedicated manner and with which we have held dialogues. There is a clear commitment to respect for human rights. There is a national consensus in favor of peace. In light of the events that have taken place in Chiapas State, this Monday I asserted, before the Permanent Commission of the Congress of the Republic, that within no region of Mexico are differences so great that they preclude our capacity for dialogue, nor is there enough distance to undermine our fundamental unity. This will always be the way things are. At the same time, I want to express my gratitude for the responsible support stated today by all the political forces of the country -- support against violence. By standing united, we Mexicans will continue to progress and will be able to make Mexico's democratic life stronger for the wellbeing of everone and, above all else, for the wellbeing of our children.
