The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking [Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotrafico--FELCN] has disclosed evidence indicating that Paz Zamora received and obeyed instructions from alleged drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" Echevarria. The FELCN also reported the alleged ties of several leaders of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) with drug trafficking activities during Paz Zamora's administration (1989-1993). In a short communique, the Ministry of Social Communications said, "The FELCN investigations against several MIR leaders are not political in nature and, instead, result from the law's mandate." In a message to the nation broadcast Saturday night, Paz Zamora asserted, "it seems this case is being given perverse treatment." He also said the charges against him were "ill-intentioned" and attempted "to cause political damage and slander the dignity of the people." The government, however, said, "actions have to be carried out in the future by the judicial branch and, in some cases, by the legislative branch," to clarify the charges. Regarding Paz Zamora's "irrevocable resignation" announcement saying that he would withdraw from politics, the Social Communications Ministry said this is Paz Zamora's "personal decision" and that the people will be the ones to judge it.
