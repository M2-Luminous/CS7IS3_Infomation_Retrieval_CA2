An agreement on Albanian-Austrian economic cooperation has been reached in Vienna, but both sides are of the opinion that the potential of cooperation relations between Austria and Albania is still unexploited. Based on information provided by our diplomatic representatives in Vienna, our reporter Arben Karapici has prepared the following report: [Karapici] The intensification of Albanian-Austrian inter- governmental contacts and the exchange of visits to Vienna and Tirana have inspired experts and observers to express the opinion that economic cooperation between Albania and Austria seems to be frequent and fruitful. After the agreement on freeing the Albanian foreign debt, which was reached in Vienna in early March by our bank governor, Dylber Vrioni, another important document has been signed in the Austrian capital -- an agreement on bilateral economic cooperation. The agreement was signed by our industry and trade minister, Selim Belortaja, and his Austrian counterpart Wolfgang Schuessel. According to the agreement, the Austrian side is committed to encouraging the development of projects with priority in our country's economy through financial means. This applies to industries dealing with the extracting and processing of minerals, metallurgy, energy, forestry, etc. This latter Albanian-Austrian agreement of Vienna also anticipates direct Austrian investment in all the priority fields of bilateral economic cooperation, with the participation of third countries as well. This concrete Austrian commitment has already been expressed with the introduction into Albania of companies such as Rogner, Suag [as heard], OeMV, etc., which are already involved in important projects in tourism, airports, aqueducts, etc. According to all the experts and observers who closely follow the frequent Albanian-Austrian cooperation, the results of the economic revival of our country should not be far away, as long as Austria shows itself as a very active partner in Albania. More convincing is the argument that both parts still see unexploited potential in the economic exchanges between Tirana and Vienna. This was pointed out during the visit of Minister Belortaja to the Austrian capital, where they held long discussions about further cooperation possibilities. Thus, the support that Austria is committed to granting to projects of railroad network privatization should not be far off. In this regard, it is reported that Vienna has accepted Tirana's proposal to sign a new agreement in the field of goods and urban transportation. There are chances to achieve this, and they are considered high if we add the special interest shown in this case by the Austrian Industrialists Association and businessmen during Minister Belortaja's visit to Vienna.
