The total national power output for the year was 815 billion kWh, 9.44 percent over last year, of which 671 billion kWh was from thermal power, an increase of 9.16 percent, and hydropower was 144 billion kWh, a 10.77 percent increase over last year. The entire electric power industry earned 19.9 billion yuan in profit taxes, an increase of 15.4 percent over the previous year. Although China's power industry has grown rapidly, the national economy has grown even faster and the power supply is more than 20 percent short of needs. In order to put electric power ahead of the curve, the Ministry of Electric Power is planning to add 15,000 MW of new units annually from 1995 to 1997, and 20,000 MW annually from 1998 to 2000, which will be an increase of about 300,000 MW of installed capacity by the end of the century, and will basically meet China's domestic needs. The government will make a great effort to raise the money for this, and will encourage joint efforts among administrative areas to get electric power and develop hydropower resources, and will encourage coastal economic development zones to make even greater investments into energy bases to get power, and for sending power out of energy rich areas; Economically developed areas will be encouraged to raise funds for power, and power enterprises will be allowed to go directly to the banks and other financial institutions for loans, or to issue bonds and shares.
