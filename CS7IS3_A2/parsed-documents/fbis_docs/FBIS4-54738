The leaders of the 560,000 ethnic Hungarians have demanded that the law be passed. Its adoption was among the conditions Slovakia pledged to observe when it was admitted to the Council of Europe (CE) last June. The law in force, passed under former Meciar's cabinet, did not fully comply with the CE conditions. The members of ethnic minorities will be allowed to write their first names and surnames as it is usual in their languages, Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said. This means that the female surnames will not have to add the Slovak suffix "ova," and may retain the Hungarian suffix "ne." "Retroactive change in first names and surnames, stipulated by the law, will be free of charge," Pittner told CTK. After the law is passed, there will remain only one unmet pledge to the CE: bilingual names of the communities inhabited by ethnic minorities. Last autumn Meciar's cabinet decided to remove bilingual (mostly Slovak-Hungarian) signposts, replacing them with only Slovak ones.
