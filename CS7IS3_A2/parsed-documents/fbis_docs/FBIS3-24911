FBIS3-24911 "drafr023_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP Supporters Protest ISD Withdrawal From East Rand MB0202165294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1437 GMT 2 Feb 94 MB0202165294 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Johannesburg Feb 2 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters ruled the streets of Thokoza on Wednesday [2 Wednesday] as they marched to protest against the withdrawal of the police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] from East Rand townships and its replacement by SA Defence Force [SADF] troops -- announced on Tuesday in the release of the peace plan for the region. While most peacefully demonstrated down Khumalo Street, a small criminal element from the Thokoza hostel looted shops, robbed street vendors, stoned passing cars, intimidated the elderly and stripped cars. IFP supporters who sat on the Khumalo Street bridge refused an invitation by SADF regional commanding officer Cmdt Michael de Goede to be part of SADF policing. The IFP believes black SADF soldiers sent to Thokoza are in cahoots with the African National Congress [ANC] and has cited situations where the SADF has allegedly harassed and even killed IFP supporters. "I want to work closely with you. You can even work with my soldiers on patrol," Cmdt de Goede said, appealing to the militant crowd to give the SADF a chance to create peace and stability. The crowd called for "stability, stability" and refused to negotiate with Cmdt de Goede. They told him if the ISD had to go, the SADF should be removed as well. One angry man said: "We would rather be left to fight it out to the death with the ANC. At least then we will have a fair chance." Roads into Thokoza were heavily blockaded by SADF troops on Wednesday, while IFP supporters set up their own blockades with taxis inside the township. Hundreds of terrified pensioners collecting their money were trapped inside the Thokoza Town Council offices while IFP supporters, armed with pangas, axes, knobkerries and steel bars, threatened to rob them. Payment of pensions totalling more that R[Rand]3 million was postponed until Thursday, the venue was transferred to Wadeville in Germiston and the pensioners were escorted home by SADF troops. Violence nearly erupted when ANC supporters celebrating the ISD's announced withdrawal marched to the foot of the bridge to confront the IFP gathering. The IFP supporters and SADF troops took cover when shots were fired from the residential area but nobody was injured or arrested. Cars forced to stop at the taxi blockade were stripped. Reporters watched while a masked man and his gang smashed car windows and made off with radios, tape-decks and tyres. Taxis passing on the highway were stoned and street vendors were chased away and their stalls were looted. IFP Transvaal Chairman Themba Khoza, in the township to quell the unrest and negotiate with the police, said the impromptu gathering was the consequence of the ANC and government making decisions without consulting the IFP. He was referring to the East Rand peace plan. An eight-member task group has been appointed to oversee the plan, but so far the IFP has refused invitations to join the peace process. East Rand Deputy Commissioner Maj-Gen Obie Oberholzer told the IFP crowd police had not taken the decision to remove the ISD from the area. "It was a political decision and I suggest your leaders consult other political leaders," he said. The crowd, waving posters which read "The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] has fed us to the SADF" and "Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] are back to kill us", dispersed only when Mr Khoza agreed to set up an urgent meeting with government ministers. By late afternoon the area was still tense with IFP members standing guard at Thokoza hostel, while residents gathered across the road. A large SADF contingent with rifles at the ready separated the two factions and armoured cars filled with soldiers waited at street corners.
