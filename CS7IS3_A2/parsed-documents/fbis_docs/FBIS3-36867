This decision by the Latvian Government was motivated, Birkavs said, by the claim that in the event that Latvia continues to decline to compromise on the issue of the withdrawal of the Russian troops, it could lose the support of European countries and the United States. According to the (?previously) reached agreement, Russia will maintain the Skrunda radar station for four years as its property, and after the end of this period, dismantling of the site will be carried out over 18 months.
