The listing of franchises recorded at the Communications Ministry shows that the Marinho family has the largest number of main stations in markets where the purchasing power is greatest. The Marinho family has stations in Brasilia, Recife, and Rio de Janeiro. It has four of its own and two in partnership in the state of Sao Paulo; two of its own and one in partnership in Minas Gerais; and four more in partnership in Parana State. The SBT (Brazilian Television System) of the Silvio Santos group has nine television stations in the name of companies that belong to the Abravanel family (Abravanel is the surname of Silvio Santos). The group has six franchises in the southeastern region (four in Sao Paulo and two in Rio de Janeiro), one in Rio Grande do Sul, one in Brasilia, and another in Para. The Saad family, which owns the Bandeirantes network, has four television franchises in the state of Sao Paulo, and one in each of the following capitals: Curitiba, Brasilia, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador. The Saad and Sirotsky families hold the largest number of radio stations; each own 21 stations. The Manchete group, according to Communications Ministry records, has three stations in the southeastern region (Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and Rio de Janeiro) and two in the northeast: Fortaleza and Recife. According to a survey conducted by Intermeios (of the magazine MEIO & MENSAGEM [MEDIA AND MESSAGE]), the amount collected from advertisements by television stations last year was approximately $1.3 billion, while the amount collected by radios was approximately $100 million. The market estimate is that Globo and its affiliated members collect more than 60 percent of the money obtained from television adverstisements, while SBT and its affiliated members receive around 20 percent. The strongest radio broadcasting groups in the country are affiliated with Rede Globo, as are the stations belonging to the most influential political leaders, which increases Roberto Marinho's political power. In the southern part of the country the market is dominated by the Sirotsky family, owner of the RBS [Rede Brasiliera do Sul] network, affiliated with Globo. Members of the family have 10 television franchises in Rio Grande do Sul (plus two under its administration by commercial agreement), and three in Santa Catarina. In addition to the south, the Sirotsky family also appears as shareholders of one station of Itapemirim television, in Cachoeiro do Itapemirim. The shareholder of this company is the Gazeta group from Espiritu Santo, which is also affiliated with Globo. In the northern region, the Amazonas Radio and Television group, which belongs to the Daou family, has main stations -- affiliated with Globo -- in Roraima, Rondonia, Acre, Amapa, and Amazonas. It is the strongest group in the region. In the central west, the two strongest groups -- the Camara family in Goias and Tocantins, and the Zahran family (Mato Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso) -- are also affiliated with Globo. The Camara family has seven television and 12 radio franchises, while the Zahran family has four television and one radio franchise. In the northeast, the only group that has franchises in more than one state is the Jereissati family (Verdes Mares group): two radio and one television station in Ceara (affiliated with Globo), one radio station in Rio de Janeiro, and another in Alagoas. The strongest local groups in the largest northeastern states are linked to politicians. In Bahia, Federal Deputy Pedro Irujo Yaniz (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]) has two television franchises (affiliated with the SBT) and four radio stations. His son Luiz Pedro Irujo is a partner of the Marinho family in two Globo radios in the state. The main Bahia State television station affiliated with Globo is TV Bahia, which has among its shareholders federal Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes (PFL [Liberal Front Party]), son of former Communications Minister and former Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, and Cesar Mata Pires, Carlos Magalhaes' son-in-law. In Sergipe, the family of Senator Albano Franco (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]) makes up the strongest radio broadcasting group: It has two television stations (one affiliated with Globo and another with SBT), and three radio franchises. In Alagoas and in Maranhao, the stations affiliated with Globo belong to the families of two former presidents of the Republic. In Maranhao, TV Mirante, affiliated with Globo, is listed as being under the name of Jose Sarney's sons (1985-90), who also own four radio stations. Former President Fernando Collor de Mello (1990-92) is among the shareholders of Gazeta TV, affiliated with Globo, in Alagoas. In Rio Grande do Norte, former Regional Intergration Minister Aluizio Alves is among the main partners of TV Cabugi, affiliated with Globo.
