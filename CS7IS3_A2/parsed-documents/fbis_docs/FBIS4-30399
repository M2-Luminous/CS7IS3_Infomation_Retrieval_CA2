Regarding the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development plan, he said that Japan will not necessarily insist on the need to carry out inspections on the DPRK's application of plutonium for military purposes in the past. So far, the foreign minister has been saying that it is important to find out whether or not the DPRK ever tried to develop nuclear weapons. On 22 June, however, Kakizawa commented on the U.S. Government's view, saying: "It seems that the U.S. Government plans, for the time being, not to force inspections on the DPRK over its history of nuclear reactor operation but to seek, at the high- level talks, complete implementation of [nuclear] inspections, including special inspections." He then said: "In this way, the suspicions over the DPRK's nuclear issues, including the doubts about the past, will be dissolved. We will ask the United States to keep our views in mind as it holds U.S.-DPRK talks." He made these comments in response to a question by Shouzou Harada (of the Liberal Democratic Party).
