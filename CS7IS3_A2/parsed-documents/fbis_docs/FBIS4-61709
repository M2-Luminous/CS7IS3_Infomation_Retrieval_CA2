Despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, people of Russia are waiting for this day to come, the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI said. "Although our souls are often filled with worries and concerns about how to survive in this hard time, Victory Day returns us to the Russian roots," it said. "There are no military parades anymore... But there is the eternal flame at the soldiers' tombs. There are war veterans. Many gray-hair defenders of the fatherland will get together for their holiday to reminisce about their war days and their youth," the newspaper said. Its article "The Altar of Victory" reminds the readers that "only consensus may help the nation survive in critical conditions. It will always be like this in spite of differences in historic situations." The newspaper RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA shares this opinion. It publishes an excerpt from the memoirs of Aleksandr Buchin, the chauffeur of legendary Marshal Georgiy Zhukov. The military daily KRASNAYA ZVEZDA stressed the need to restore spiritual values in Russia. "As never before this task is urgent today when our society is in a spiritual crisis." For many young people, profit is the only goal in life. The once sacred notions of duty, honour and patriotism are no longer revered and respected. As a result, the future of the state may be put at stake, the newspaper said. The trade union daily TRUD has started a new rubric, "How Is Life, Veteran?" The newspaper said that only 4,300,000 war veterans have survived. Many of them have been denied privileges that their colleagues enjoy. TRUD called on the heads of local administrations and local councils to adopt programmes of assistance for war veterans and do everything possible to make their life easier. The newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA recalls that the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition, which included, apart from Russia, the United States, Britain and France, also celebrate May 9. "The war veterans of our allies also contributed to the victory," the newspaper said. It described Viktor Suvorov's book (former Soviet KGB agent who defected to the West) "Icebreaker" as a myth. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA also ran a big article devoted to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's new book "The View From the Kremlin." The president is trying to "convince himself and others that he had done everything possible to prevent the October 1993 bloody drama and that his policy is the best and the only way out for Russia," the newspaper said. The youth daily KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes photographs of former residents of the village of Isakovo near Moscow who were killed in the war. Thankful villagers unveiled a war memorial on 9 May 1984 in their memory. "How many are there such obelisks in Russia -- thousands? Dozens of thousands? Ten years ago KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA shorthand typist Yekaterina Blagodareva told the story of just one because she would not have the heart to talk about others," the newspaper said. PRAVDA carries a series of photographs of war photographer Aleksandr Ustinov. The events he caught on his pictures "belong to history -- celebrations in Moscow in May 1945, legendary Marshals Georgiy Zhukov and Konstantin Rokossovskiy and other unforgettable scenes and faces," it said.
