FR941028-2-00007 FR941028-2-00004 Granite Mountain Timber Sales, Okanogan National Forest, Okanogan County, WA AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Cancellation of an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: On June 13, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Granite Mountain Timber Sales, which included the Little Granite, Pebble and Baldy Timber Sales, was published in the Federal Register (56 FR 27227). The notice of intent was revised on April 15, 1993 in the Federal Register (58 FR 19646), in which the Baldy Timber Sale was dropped, and timelines for completion were extended. A Notice of Availability for the draft EIS was published in the Federal Register on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49996). Because of the current emphasis on fire recovery, watershed analysis and the Eastside Ecosystem Management Project, the notice of intent is being cancelled, and no final EIS will be issued for the project. The Forest expects to issue a new notice of intent to prepare an EIS for the project area in Spring of 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Direct questions regarding this cancellation to Teresa Wurschmidt, Project Coordinator, Tonasket Ranger District, P.O. Box 466, Tonasket, Washington 98855 or telephone (509) 997&hyph;5116. Dated: October 14, 1994. Sam Gehr, Forest Supervisor.
