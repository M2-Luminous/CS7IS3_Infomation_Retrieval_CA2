FR940930-1-00021 FR940930-1-00009 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 51 [FRL&hyph;4895&hyph;4] Air Quality: Revision to Definition of Volatile Organic Compounds_Exclusion of Acetone AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA is proposing to revise its definition of volatile organic compounds (VOC) for purposes of preparing State implementation plans (SIP's) to attain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone under title I of the Clean Air Act (Act) and for the Federal implementation plan for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The proposed revision would add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of VOC on the basis that these compounds have negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation. DATES: Comments on this proposal must be received by November 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in duplicate (if possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6102), Attention: Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;26, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Comments should be strictly limited to the subject matter of this proposal, the scope of which is discussed below. Public Hearing: If anyone contacts EPA requesting a public hearing, it will be held at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Persons wishing to request a public hearing, wanting to attend the hearing or wishing to present oral testimony should notify Mr. William Johnson, Air Quality Management Division (MD&hyph;15), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone (919) 541&hyph;5245. The EPA will publish notice of a hearing, if a hearing is requested, in the Federal Register . Any hearing will be strictly limited to the subject matter of the proposal, the scope of which is discussed below. This action is subject to the procedural requirements of section 307(d)(1) (B), (J), and (U) of the Act, and 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1) (B), (J), and (U). Therefore, EPA has established a public docket for this action, A&hyph;94&hyph;26, which is available for public inspection and copying between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, at EPA's Central Docket Section, room M&hyph;1500, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Johnson, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Air Quality Management Division (MD&hyph;15), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, phone (919) 541&hyph;5245. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Three petitions have been received by the EPA asking that acetone be added to the list of negligibly-reactive compounds in the definition of VOC at 40 CFR 51.100(s). These petitions were submitted by Eastman Chemical Company and Hoechst Celanese Corporation on April 26, 1993, Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company on May 6, 1993, and the Chemical Manufacturers Association on May 14, 1993. Along with their petitions and in supplemental submissions, these organizations submitted a variety of scientific materials which support the assertion that acetone is of negligible photochemical reactivity. These materials have been added to the docket for this rulemaking. The petitioners based their request for the exclusion of acetone on a demonstration that the photochemical reactivity of acetone is not appreciably different from that of ethane, which is the most reactive compound on the current list of compounds which are named in the definition of VOC as being of negligible reactivity. Acetone's photochemical reactivity arises through two chemical pathways: through reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radicals (k OH reactivity) and through photolysis. Data on the reaction of OH radicals with various organic compounds are reported in a review article (Atkinson, R. (1990), ``Gas_Phase Tropospheric Chemistry of Organic Compounds: A Review.'' Atmospheric Environment, 24 A:1&hyph;41) which gives the following rate constants for reactions of ethane and acetone with OH:
