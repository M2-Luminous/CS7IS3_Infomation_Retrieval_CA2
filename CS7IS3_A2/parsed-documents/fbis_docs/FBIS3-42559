It appears that we will not have to wait long for the outcome of a bold experiment. However, let us have everything in proper order. Few people know that the plane carrying B.N. Yeltsin has already repeatedly been on the brink of crashing, and that this has not been arranged for him by his foreign partners but rather by his own pilots. The first case. Returning from Yakutsk on 18 June 1993, chief pilot A. Larin, the commander of a separate aviation detachment of civil aviation of the Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation, landed the plane in Vnukovo flying 1,350 meters further than prescribed. B. Yeltsin was on board the plane at the time. The second case. Without restricting himself to what had already been achieved, A. Larin flew an excessive 1,400 meters at the already mentioned Vnukovo when returning from Warsaw on 24 August 1993 (the president was on board the plane on this occasion, too). Incidentally, if excess flight by an Il-62 comes to no more than 800 meters, the pilot receives a grade of "three" for such a blunder in the flight critique. There is no need to say what the aforementioned numbers "merit." The length of the runway at Vnukovo is 3,050 meters; the flight operations manual for the Il-62 says that the runway for its landing should be no shorter than 2,700 meters. Therefore, had it not been for good meteorological conditions, the presidential liner would have plowed into the fields of Vnukovo. To be sure, B. Yeltsin is already accustomed to this; he experienced hard landings as early as 1990, and in Spain, when he was "disgraced." Apparently this is what the culprits in these emergencies counted on, as they concealed the emergencies from the leadership of the country. Prior to these cases there had been no flight accidents in "detachment No. 1." The crews of the Separate Aviation Detachment of Civil Aviation of the Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation have carried everyone on their liners! After all, this enterprise, known as detachment No. 235, is intended to carry specifically "the powers that be." Naturally, the professional standard of the flight personnel in the detachment is exceptionally high. Pilots are prepared to fly to any point in the world with the highest degree of flight safety. Cadres for the "Tsar's stable" were selected from the entire USSR, and subsequently Russia. Pilots considered it an honor to work here. Unfortunately, they do not consider it so at present. When the new commander A. Larin came in on 6 November 1992, the detachment changed course in the direction of commerce. Of course, the times are now such that one has got to "hustle." Here are some examples of the new approach. Recently, the Gazprom Joint-Stock Company acquired the French plane Falkon-900-B (the total amount of the contract was $32 million; operating the plane costs $300,000-400,000 per month). Gazprom leased the Falkon-900-B to "detachment No. 1" so that this 14-passenger superliner, which Saudi sheikhs like in particular, would also work for Gazprom. Of course, it is pleasant to fly a farewell circle on such a plane over the undernourished, strike-bound Nadym and fly away, say, to Vienna, which is where representatives of the aforementioned joint-stock company indeed went aboard the plane. However, the same amount of money could have bought eight or 10 domestic planes of the Il-62 or Tu-154 types. A. Larin liked the Falkon so much that he went to France together with his wife in order to learn to fly planes of this type, too. The president's personal pilot got carried away by the miracle vehicle to such a degree that he remained in that hospitable country through the dramatic days of 1-5 October 1993. In the recent past one civil aviation directorate mastered one type of plane per year. Under the new management the "government aviation detachment" intends to master four types in half a year. So, highly rated specialists have been quitting the detachments in the belief that this is adventurism (during the past year more than 30 people have left, and there have been cases of entire crews quitting. These are the flying elite!). They used to think that "high turnover" and this detachment were two incompatible things. The management of the Rossiya airline is seeking truly royal funding from the state. For example, 18 billion rubles have already been paid for two An-124's. The justification for their acquisition was to "develop new equipment," although at present the detachment operates planes of six or seven types, and it is not necessary to spend this kind of money on new aircraft. Seven billion rubles have been requested to purchase a Tu-204 plane. The management of the Rossiya airline intends to carry out service tests on the plane, although this is a function of service enterprises and by no means of the special aviation detachment. Funds have also been requested for a few Il-96's for scheduled rather than special flights. As is known, on 3 December 1993 B. Yeltsin signed an edict on reorganizing the detachment into the Rossiya state transportation company, having agreed "with the proposal of the management and the council of the labor collective" of the detachment. Thereafter A. Larin announced that Rossiya does not report to either the Air Transportation Department or the Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation, but solely to the president. Of course, one may not be subordinated to the department but one cannot fail to be guided by its documents concerning control and, finally, safety. This is fraught with consequences! We will not get away with just a "plowed field" in this case. Where does A. Larin's "clout" come from? From his crying from the rooftops that he is a man appointed personally by the president. This appears to be so. As we have learned, he was appointed detachment commander for personal devotion to the president. It is interesting to know what is more important to B. Yeltsin: his life, which depends on a lack of professionalism, or servility, on which, it seems, nothing depends?
