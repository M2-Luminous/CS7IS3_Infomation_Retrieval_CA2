King Fahd pointed out that the new systems, recently announced, have opended new horizons for the service of the country.

He noted that the kingdom had spent billions of riyals and dollars because of the Gulf crisis caused by Iraq and in addition to that, King Fahd, said the country had extended large amounts of money to a number of Arab, African and Asian countries in forms of grants and loans. King Fahd criticized those who write about the kingdom's economy in a biased way. Thanks to the God who has bestowed on us so many bounties, the kingdom has so many resources inclduing oil 'and a number of new oil wells were recently discovered south of Riyadh'.

On handling over of some of the public enterprises to the private sector, King Fahd said shares would be floated for subscription by the citizens in enterprises like the national airlines, posts, telegraphs and telephones.

Yemen is a dear country and we do respect it, he said and added the kingdom is keen on maintaining good relations with all Arab countries. It is hoped that the Security Council's resolution, which is accepted by the concerned parties, will be implemented because failure of its implemtation will mean continuation of bloodshedding, he elaborated.
