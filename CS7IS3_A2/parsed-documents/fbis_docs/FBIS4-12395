"At the outset of his testimony, the prime minister reviewed the situation in the territories, specifically referring to the conditions in Hebron and in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Among other things, he commented on the worship arrangements at the site and on the permit given to settlers to enter the cave with their weapons. "Another central issue featuring in his testimony was the Shin Bet's warnings about actions by Jewish extremists, in view of Army officers' contentions during the commission's hearings that they had not been forewarned about Jewish terror and the Shin Bet's arguments that it had issued hundreds of such warnings. "An hour into Rabin's testimony, a phone call was received at the Supreme Court building: `Beware, all of you leftists. The building will blow up within the hour.' Security personnel and policemen stationed in the building were put on the alert, and a police bomb disposal expert was summoned to the scene. They began searching the building and the cars parked in the adjacent parking lot. Nevertheless, the building was not evacuated, and Rabin proceeded with his testimony. Eventually, it proved to be a false alarm." Goldberg goes on to write that Miryam Goldstein gave her testimony in camera. "She was smuggled into the building through the entrance reserved for the judges," and "the entire building was closed to the public in order to preserve the utmost secrecy." Goldstein was supposed to testify before the commission on 3 April, but she did not show up. "It is not clear why she changed her mind," Goldberg writes.
