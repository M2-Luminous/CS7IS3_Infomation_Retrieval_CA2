The inauguration of the new ruling body is also to coincide with the disarming of the various factions by the ECOWAS peace monitoring group, ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. Reports say ECOMOG has set up six sites around Monrovia where weapons will be collected. The United Nations is supervising the disarmament process but reports say that Mr. Taylor's faction is still uncooperative. [Begin Taylor recording] We will fight and continue to fight anyone wanting to subvert the sovereignty of this nation by trying to take this land. They will have to fight me and everyone else after me if they intend to stay here forever. [end recording] While the ECOMOG troops man checkpoints and ensure general security of life and property arms are still carried freely by members of the warring factions. Interim President Amos Sawyer is wary of this development. [Begin Sawyer recording] We see that in Somalia; we see that elsewhere. Why are we immune from that kind of business, and why do we need anybody to go out there and stir this up? [end recording] [passage omitted]
