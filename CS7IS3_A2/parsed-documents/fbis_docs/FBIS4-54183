"It is okay for us to join the ranks of the permanent security council countries in the future, provided veto powers are not abused or exercised serving the ego of the big powers," Kakizawa said. Kakizawa made the remarks in response to a question by Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator Setsu Shiga during Thursday's session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee. The foreign minister apparently aims at closing ranks with Germany, another candidate for permanent membership in the key UN body, which already declared it will accept a permanent seat only if given full veto powers. The current council groups five permanent seats held by the major victors of World War II and 10 nonpermanent seats, which are rotated every two years among member states of the United Nations. With its veto, a permanent member can block any council decision. While most of the five have voiced support for Japan's and Germany's bids to become permanent members, they have not made it clear whether they would be vested with the same rights. Asked by another LDP legislator Wataru Hiraizumi how Japan, bound by its pacifist constitution, would respond to calls for UN-led collective defense, Kakizawa said, "Chapter 7 of the UN Charter stipulates that a special agreement be concluded before a country decides to participate in military measures. "Therefore it is not contradictory to participate in UN operations on a scope the constitution allows for," Kakizawa said, noting that Japan has accepted the whole of the UN Charter. Chapter 7 stipulates that member countries in case of breaches of peace and acts of aggression make available forces, assistance and facilities "in accordance with a special agreement or agreements." Countries are subject to ratification "in accord with their respective constitutional processes," the charter says. In a related comment, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Japan "must deepen the ongoing thorough discussion" before deciding on its response if the UN forces are set up.
