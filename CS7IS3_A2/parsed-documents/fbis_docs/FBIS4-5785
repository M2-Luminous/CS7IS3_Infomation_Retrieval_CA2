Paekdu on a joint-venture basis, the semi-official China News Service reported Wednesday. Mt. Paekdu is located on the border between North Korea and China and many South Koreans, who consider it a holy site, like to climb the mountain on the Chinese side. Samson Enterprises Co. of Korea and Yanbian Tourism Corp. of Jilin Province have agreed to invest 8 million U.S. dollars in building a hotel to accommodate 1,200 guests near Mt. Paekdu. The project has been approved by the Chinese State Council. Samson and the Yanbian Tourism Company have set up a joint-venture company to operate the hotel over the coming 50 years and they plan to use the profits to boost farming in Yanbian, largely populated by ethnic Koreans.
