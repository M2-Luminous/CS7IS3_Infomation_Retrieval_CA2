FR941116-1-00030 FR941116-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service 42 CFR Part 60 RIN 0905&hyph;AS87 Health Education Assistance Loan Program AGENCY: Health Resources and Services Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend existing regulations governing the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program to establish performance standards against which lender and holder default rates would be measured, as mandated by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992. The proposal also amends the regulations to reflect various statutory provisions related to HEAL performance standards for schools, lenders, and holders, including the following: The formula for calculating default rates; the requirement that certain schools develop default management plans; the borrower's option to reduce his or her insurance premium by obtaining a credit worthy cosigner; the waiver of penalty fees for schools, lenders, and holders with a low volume of loans; and the option to pay off defaulted loans to reduce default rates. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule are invited. To be considered, comments must be received by December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Respondents should address written comments to Fitzhugh Mullan, M.D., Director, Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr), Health Resources and Services Administration, Room 8&hyph;05, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857. All comments received will be available for public inspection and copying at the Office of Program Development, BHPr, Room 8A&hyph;55, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland weekdays (Federal holidays excepted) between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Heningburg, Director, Division of Student Assistance, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, Room 8&hyph;48, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857; telephone number: 301&hyph;443&hyph;1173. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 707(a) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act) requires that, not later than 1 year after enactment of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;408), the Secretary shall establish performance standards for lenders and holders of HEAL loans, including fees to be imposed for failing to meet such standards. In the report accompanying Public Law 102&hyph;408, the Congress stated that it expects ``*␣*␣* schools, lenders, and holders to assume and share the responsibility for minimizing HEAL defaults *␣*␣*'' (Conference Report 102&hyph;925, p. 112). In accordance with the above, this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to amend the HEAL regulations to establish performance standards for lenders and holders of HEAL loans. Under this proposal, the Secretary would establish requirements and fees to be imposed on a HEAL lender or holder based on the lender or holder's HEAL default rate. The default rate for lenders and holders would be calculated in accordance with the statutory default formula set forth in section 719(5) of the Act, except that loans made to students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) prior to the end of the first 3 years that the lender/holder performance standard is in effect would be excluded from the default rate calculation. The proposed performance standard requirements, including the risk-based fee to be assessed on each lender and holder, are described below. In developing these proposals, the Department has relied heavily on section 708 of the Act, which sets forth fees and performance requirements for HEAL schools with default rates greater than 5 percent. Schools, lenders, and holders all play a significant role in helping to assure the collectibility of HEAL loans, and all benefit from participation in the HEAL program. Accordingly, this approach is designed to assure similar measures of accountability for all parties involved in the HEAL program. This proposal also clarifies various statutory provisions related to HEAL performance standards for schools, lenders, and holders, including the following: (1) The formula for calculating default rates; (2) the requirement that certain schools develop default management plans; (3) the borrower's option to reduce his or her insurance premium by obtaining a credit worthy cosigner; (4) the waiver of penalty fees for schools, lenders, and holders with a low volume of loans; and (5) the option to pay off defaulted loans to reduce default rates. The specific amendments proposed are described below according to the subparts, section numbers, and headings of the HEAL regulations affected.
