This phenomenon is becoming rampant. In particular, pirated CDs earn great profits so their numbers are on the rise and this adversely affects the law-abiding audio visual producers within the country. More importantly, they have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of the original composers and producers and caused grievance in the international community. Regarding these serious lawbreaking actions, the Chinese Government has always strictly banned such actions and has organized many campaigns to crack down on it. However, it still exists despite the efforts to ban it. CD Production Lines Uncontrolled What is the reason? Lu Lu, the person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Audio Visual Management Office, offered an analysis: First, CD production lines are seriously uncontrolled and this is the "source" of illegal pirated CDs. According to statistics, the whole country now has some 30 CD production lines, mostly situated in Guangdong Province. Based on the calculation that each CD production line produces 3 to 3.5 million CDs each year, these production lines produce a total of 100 million CDs every year. The whole country now has some 200 registered publishing units but they do not produce many programs and they require only about one-tenth of the abovementioned supply of CDs. Consequently, many manufacturers do not have sufficient work to fill production capacity. Many CD production lines are established joint-venture style and, when the contracts are signed, most foreign parties promise to fulfill a certain production capacity. Under the condition that the normal channels cannot satisfy their needs, factories acquire pirated CDs from abroad in order to survive and these products are being sold in the domestic market while some have spread to the international market. The reason for this uncontrolled situation regarding CD production lines is, according to analysis, because the audio visual management departments in some localities have different units implementing different policies and many departments have the power to approve the establishment of CD production lines. With approval being granted by different departments, plus the lack of consideration for overall demand, there are more production lines than needed. Second, proceeding from local interests, the local departments in charge of examination and approval duplicate the production lines. Pirated Products Earn Great Profits The second reason for the rampant pirated CD situation is that producing and selling pirated CDs can earn great profits. According to information, the lowest profit rate is 100 percent. At the same time, speaking theoretically, the fidelity of pirated CDs is nearly 100 percent. The production costs of pirated CDs are low and their selling prices are low, so they are acceptable to the consumers in the country and they have their market foundation. In addition, as a distributor who legally imports CDs, China National Publications Import and Export Corporation cannot compete with those who sell pirated CDs because of the tariff (the tax rate for CDs containing popular songs is 120 percent and the tax rate for general CDs is 40 percent). In the market, the price for a pirated CD can be as low as 15 or 16 yuan, while the original CD imported by China National Publications Import and Export Corporation has a price tag of 100 yuan or more. Apart from the abovementioned reasons, lax management of the audio visual market in the country is also a main reason. Manage the Audio Visual Market According to Law How can we check pirated CDs? Lu Lu thinks that the crux is to control the "source" -- the number of production lines. He said that the central authorities have already shown determination in this regard. At the same time, he called for a great decrease in tariff for original CDs, to enable the lawful operators to compete in the market. In addition, management of the audio visual market should be strengthened. Shanghai, as the city with the best management of the audio visual market in the country, has already promulgated the country's first set of audio visual management regulations -- Shanghai Municipality Audio Visual Market Management Procedure, to manage the market according to law. Beginning 1 July 1994, the municipality will thoroughly examine the current 1,200 audio visual products stalls and then issue them with permits and qualification certificates so that they can operate. The relevant department will strictly manage the source of CDs in wholesale units; encourage the establishment of business points; organize classes for people in the trade to teach them the relevant regulations and ethics and improve their quality; and will establish a mechanism to ban pirated CDs and bring prosperity to Shanghai's audio visual market.
