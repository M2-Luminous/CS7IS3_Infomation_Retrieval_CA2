He said this issue has already been clarified in detail and urged all sides not to give credence to rumors because doing so could cause a misunderstanding between Thailand and Cambodia. Regarding the report that Thai tanks were dispatched to support the Khmer Rouge, Anuson said it is false. Such support is impossible and Thailand certainly would not commit such an act. This is because the world would know if Thai tanks were really sent to Cambodia, and Thailand would have been condemned by the world already. Therefore, he assured that Thailand would never have committed such an act because it is a fact that nothing can escape scrutiny. Regarding the report that the Khmer Rouge recaptured Pailin, Anuson said it has been verified that the report is false and that he did not know the motive of the report.
