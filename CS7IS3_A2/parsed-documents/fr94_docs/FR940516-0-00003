FR940516-0-00003 FR940516-0-00001 Under this final rule, all areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties are released from their classification as quarantined areas, and the area in Hillsborough County is released from its classification as a survey area. Citrus plants, plant parts, citrus fruit, and other regulated articles from formerly quarantined areas are allowed to be moved interstate to other areas in the United States, including commercial citrus-producing areas, and regulated articles are allowed to be moved interstate through quarantined areas. Requirements which apply to survey areas are also removed. We have determined that 237 individuals and businesses will be economically affected by the changes. These individuals and businesses include: lawn care companies (82), grove owners (74 persons who own 2,177 acres), retail nursery outlets (21), fruit processors (15), fruit harvesting contractors (12), fruit shippers (12), fresh fruit packing houses (11), nurseries (9), and seed extractors (1). APHIS believes that virtually all of these individuals and businesses are small entities. It should be noted that the costs of compliance were, in many cases, minimal, and that the individuals and businesses affected by the regulations represent less than one percent of all similar individuals and businesses in Florida. One of the largest groups of affected individuals and business is grove owners. We estimate that this rule change will save each affected grove owner approximately $25 per acre, per year, by removing requirements for cleaning and disinfecting vehicles, equipment, and personnel leaving their groves. These costs represent a small percentage of the owners' overall production costs. In addition, this final rule will allow grove owners to expand the areas into which their fruit could be moved interstate, in that they will be allowed to move fruit interstate to commercial citrus-producing areas. We anticipate that any impact from this rule change will be negligible, as approximately 90 percent of all of Florida's citrus production is for the juice market, and only about 10 percent is for the fresh fruit market. In addition to grove owners in the quarantined areas, truckers, packing and processing plants, and lawn services within the currently quarantined areas will no longer be subject to inspection and will no longer need to carry out activities now required by the regulations. This should result in financial savings to these entities. This also means that groves producing regulated fruit for interstate movement, regulated trees, and regulated plants in the current survey area will no longer be subject to regular inspections for citrus canker. This change will reduce the burden on APHIS and Florida State agencies, which currently provide inspectors to perform inspections. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
