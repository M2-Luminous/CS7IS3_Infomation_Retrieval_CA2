FBIS4-1773 "drchi064_n_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural New Foreign Exchange System Taking Shape New Foreign Exchange System Taking Shape OW0104150194 Beijing XINHUA in English 1440 GMT 1 Apr 94 OW0104150194 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- From today on, the exchange rate of Chinese yuan against U.S. dollar will be based on an inter- bank foreign exchange trading, which is carried out on the Shanghai Foreign Exchange swap market, now the country's leading market of such kind. The closing price of the previous day will be used by the central bank as the basis of the inter-mediate price of the RMB [renminbi] against major foreign currencies. This was announced today by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, which also indicated an official introduction of market force into foreign exchange trading. The intermediate prices, or the basic rates, are used by banks and non-banking financial institutions to buy or sell foreign exchanges, but with a maximum floating range of 2.5 per thousand, a bank official said. Today's basic rate for U.S. dollar was 8.6987 yuan. The new system stresses the banks' role as they are now the major supplier of foreign currencies. According to well-informed sources, more than 50 banks and financial institutions have gained the membership of the new center, a dozen of them are foreign banks. But as foreign banks are barred from local currency business, they can only sell foreign currencies to their fellow members within the swap center. The central bank allows them to exchange foreign currencies to some renminbi yuan as their circulation funds, but the total amount exchanged within a day cannot exceed 5 percent of their capital. While the inter-bank market is taking shape, foreign exchange swap markets across the country are kept open, which is used exclusively by foreign funded companies. "Unlike domestic companies, foreign-funded firms are not required to sell their foreign currency earnings to Chinese banks, therefore there is no point for the banks to meet their hard currency needs," said an official from the state administration of exchange control. But he confirmed that the foreign exchange trading in the swap market also follow the central bank's basic rates, and hinted that the central bank will likely intervene in case of big exchange rates taken place. Although some banks complain that the floating range is too narrow to reflect the actual market demand and supply, most of financial experts agree that the limitation is necessary, especially in the initial stage of the new exchange system. The final goal of foreign exchange system reform is to make renminbi a freely convertible currency, experts said. But they added that the authorities will relax the control of the floating scope only when the new system takes roots and both banks and enterprises can afford the cost brought by bigger foreign exchange fluctuation.
