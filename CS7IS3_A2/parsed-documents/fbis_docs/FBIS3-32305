In statements to DPA, Alarcon de Quesada pointed out that Clinton inherited the U.S. policy toward Cuba from the Bush administration, along with the Torricelli Law reinforcing the blockade that has affected Cuba for more than 30 years. According to the same source, Alarcon de Quesada expressed moderate enthusiasm to his German hosts on the possibility of a softening of the blockade on Cuba during the second half of President Clinton's current term or in an eventual second term.
