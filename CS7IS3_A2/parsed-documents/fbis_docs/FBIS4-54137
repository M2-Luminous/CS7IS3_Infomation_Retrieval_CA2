He noted that several conclusions were made especially on a push to lessen protectionism and subsidies for agricultural goods in the world market. On the occasion, the deputy prime minister said that Thailand proposed that the Cairns group include fishery products in its list of agricultural goods so that the group could together push developed countries to minimize their trade protectionism against fishery products from other countries. Their objective is especially focused on the United States, which often sets conditions for imported fishery products from other countries. Moreover, Suphachai noted that the proposal will be greatly beneficial to Thailand. This is because fishery goods make up half of the total value of all Thai agricultural products. This proposal gained support from Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina. Nevertheless, Chile was still reluctant to follow suit for fear that the developed countries would use the proposal as a bargaining tool to open up marine resources as well.
