Its Executive President Nastase, who is also president of the Chamber of Deputies, even offered a grand coalition to the market-oriented opposition in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. Representatives of the largest opposition alliance, the Democratic Convention of Romania (CDR), however, expressed the suspicion that such offers are only tactical and primarily designed to exert pressure on postcommunist or chauvinist parties that reluctantly support the Romanian minority government in parliament. A grand coalition would reduce the influence of these parties. Also, the PDSR no longer wants to be considered an opponent to reform abroad. Nastase stated that his party, which has so far determined the hesitant policy of the independent Prime Minister Vacaroiu, is in agreement with the opposition on the objectives of foreign policy. There is full accord that closer ties should be established with the West. The PDSR, which is considered a reservoir of former communist elites by its opponents, today advocates a European-type social democracy "with a liberal touch." As far as the economy and privatization are concerned, it has numerous elements in common with the opposition. Since the beginning of the year, contacts have been established with all parties to win them over for more radical economic reforms. Romania has committed itself vis-a-vis the IMF to carry out resolute reforms. In return, it received promises for a credit worth 1.16 billion German marks. Nastase stressed that his party wants to accelerate the privatization of the economy. This year, a total of 300 enterprises have been privatized. It is quite natural that this should lead to a rise in unemployment (11 percent). The population and the trade unions are not afraid of reforms. In spite of the government's "very tough" reform policy, polls show that the PDSR has not yet scared off its supporters. Parliament must now draft a competition law and a law on local taxes that would give the communities more power. For these and other projects, the PDSR needs the support of the opposition. The PDSR wants to end the domestic "cold war" and begin a "phase of cooperation" with the opposition. Deputy Ciumara, a leading member of the National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party (PNTCD), the strongest force in the opposition alliance CDR, views such offers with suspicion. He believes that the unofficial government party PDSR does not want to give up its monopoly of power. Nastase, who likes to stress the government's readiness for reform, is only pretending because the government and the PDSR depend on the old directors and cadres of the former regime who are opposed to reform. The 300 privatized enterprises about whom Nastase is talking are not important at all. According to Ciumara, the PDSR ignores the most demands by the opposition in its offers. It is neither willing to comply with the demand that, in a cabinet of a grand coalition, no party must receive more than 50 percent of the seats nor with the request that every minister should be given complete freedom in his office. Also, it ignores the decision by the parties united in the CDR that talks on alliances should only be held jointly. The PDSR is seeking contacts with individual members of the alliance to split the CDR. Nastase speaks of a grand coalition as one of the other possibilities. He demands that "formal aspects," such as the composition of the government, not be stressed too much, and not "party interests" but "common issues of interest" be given priority. Yet this would mean that his PDSR ministers alone would keep their positions and that the circles surrounding President Iliescu could continue to play off the communist and nationalists against the conservative opposition in Parliament. The PDSR has succeeded in so doing recently. Its satellite parties have accepted the agreement with the IMF, despite the fact that they had always vehemently rejected the submission to demands by foreign institutions. Nastase explained their support by pointing out that they did not want to topple the "center-left government" because they might get a "center-right" government which they would no longer be able to influence.
