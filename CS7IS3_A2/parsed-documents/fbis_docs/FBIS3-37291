The tactic of "gently" entering the market has proved correct. With this topic I began my conversation with Mintimer Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of Tatarstan. [Shaymiyev] We should not flatter ourselves, for negative tendencies do, unfortunately, remain: Stability has not come about in the economy, and the financial position of major commodity producers is critical. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that a natural slump has occurred in oil extraction -- the fields, which have produced 2.5 billion tonnes of oil, are getting old. One-third of the oil wells are unprofitable, and many are standing idle. This and the increase in nonpyaments are creating additional difficulties: Subcontractors -- petrochemical enterprises -- are on the verge of coming to a halt. [Sorokin] To this has been added the tragedy at KamAZ [Kama Truck Plant].... [Shaymiyev] Yes, the thread breaks where it is weakest. At the most critical moment, in April 1993, the head plant -- the engine plant -- of the "KamAZ" Joint-Stock Company burned to the ground. By concentrating 100 heavy cranes and 10,000 workers on the site and organizing round-the-clock work according to a flextime schedule, we managed to eliminate the consequences of the tragedy in a shorter time. Construction workers cleared the debris of 90,000 tonnes of metal structures in three months. The final roofing unit was recently installed, and the engine plant will soon start working at full capacity. At the same time I wish to speak about the fate of YelAZ [Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant], which is under construction. The intergovernmental agreement "On the Joint Creation of the Motor Vehicle Plant in the City of Yelabuga" was signed in Minsk last year. The proportions of the investments by the participants -- Russia, Tatarstan, Ukraine, Bashkortostan, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan -- were determined. The "YelAZ-invest" interstate corporation was set up in Tatarstan for the purpose of concentrating the investors' funds for the construction project. It was planned to form the incorporation capital in full within a year. The world's major motor vehicle companies have joined in the YelAZ project. All the conditions are being created for the creation of a modern, competitive motor vehicle production facility. [Sorokin] On the other hand, things are improving in the agro-industrial complex. [Shaymiyev] Our general line is to give the countryside all possible support. The government has channeled from the state budget 156 billion rubles [R], or half the expenditure, into improving the land's fertility, increasing spending on reclamation, supporting seed growing and pedigree breeding, developing the food and processing industries, and constructing housing. As a result, not only has the slump in production volumes been eliminated in the countryside but an increase has also been achieved. Livestock numbers have been restored, and a record harvest for recent years was grown -- 23 quintals per hectare. The volume of purchases, compared with 1992, stood at 107 percent for meat and poultry, 109 percent for milk, and 104 percent for eggs. These indicators stand at 85, 94, and 99 percent respectively for Russia. This year we intend to preserve the system of procurements of the products of fields and livestock units on the basis of contracts. The restructuring of kolkhozes has begun: Kolkhoz members are being allocated a share of property and an allotment of land. [Sorokin] Two years of hard, unpredictable reforms. What are the lessons? [Shaymiyev] The reforms begun in 1992 have become irreversible -- this is the most important result. What are the landmarks of the reforms? First, a partial price liberalization has been carried out. The abandonment of state regulation has brought inflation from a hidden state out into the open. This has made it possible to assess the state of the economy correctly at the macro level and the micro level. Consequently, management has become more efficient. Second, partial convertibility of the ruble has been introduced. Fluctuations in the ruble rate have become one of the indicators and a real tool regulating the movement of capital and, partly, the dynamics of prices. But it is a disturbing fact that inflation has acquired a stable, self-producing nature. Third, the privatization process has begun. Approximately half the property in Tatarstan has already been privatized. Plans have been approved for the privatization of 360 more enterprises with an incorporation capital of more than R500 billion. Unfortunately, small-scale privatization is lagging behind. Before the end of the year we plan to create conditions so that at least two-thirds of small cafes, cafeterias, workshops, and hairdressers find owners. The privatization of housing has begun, and a housing market is coming into being. [Sorokin] What is a strategic area in Tatarstan's economy? [Shaymiyev] Life has brought us to the truth that we will not emerge from the crisis without structural restructuring of the entire economy. It is an alarming fact that labor productivity has not increased but has fallen in some places since the start of the reforms. Compared with 1992, it stood at just 89 percent last year. It will be possible to overcome the monopolized economy with its cost-led mechanism and to attain a competitive level only through painstaking, long-term work. This cannot be done quickly. The Government of Tatarstan has concluded an agreement with the "Mashinoeksport" Association on the joint implementation of 18 projects of innovation and conversion. The republic's former military plants will produce 70 kinds of new products of interest to the world market. There are positive examples. Kazan's "Terminal" Association has been entirely deprived of military orders, which a year ago made up 90 percent of its output. The enterprise has quickly started up production of domestic appliances and other products and has emerged from a complex situation without standing idle and without cutting the work force. We intend to give selective support to life-supporting sectors -- the agro-industrial complex above all. It is planned to reduce oil extraction by 10 percent, while, on the other hand, production of polyethylene, rubber, bricks, foodstuffs, clothes, and furniture will increase. [Sorokin] How is it possible to assess the social position in the republic? [Shaymiyev] The average wage stood at R128,000 in December. In February the living wage is forecast at the level of R30,000, and we intend to increase the minimum wage to the same level. The state subsidizes each city resident for housing and municipal services, transport, food, and medicines to the tune of R39,000. Additional funds will be allocated to maintain children's preschool establishments. [Sorokin] Finally, what is the state of Tatarstan's relations with Russia? Two years have elapsed since work began on a draft treaty. [Shaymiyev] The protracted break in the treaty process has now ended. In addition to examining questions of the economy at the January meeting in Moscow with President Boris Yeltsin, an accord was reached on completing the preparation of the treaty and intergovernmental agreements. An entirely new, previously unknown document is coming into being which proclaims the primacy of the person and the principles of Tatarstan's relations with the Russian Federation, foreign states, and international organizations. It is proposed to form plenipotentiary missions of Russia and Tatarstan in Kazan and Moscow. The treaty, on which we have been working for a long time, will soon happen. It will be a document of the reforming of Russia and of the Federation's renewal on democratic principles and the guarantor of Tatarstan's statehood. Strange though it may seem, politicians have appeared who oppose the treaty. Living by the principles of "the worse, the better," they call for self-isolation. But the people do not support them. It is senseless, to say the least, to speak of Tatarstan's isolation. Are we not seeing how sovereign states are asking to join the CIS and wish to establish or restore economic ties? The people have gotten nothing from wholesale disintegration but new misfortunes. We cannot disregard this. Therefore we favor the treaty. The people are now inclined toward the elections, which will be held a second time in Tatarstan 13 March. We hope that deputies will be elected to the Federal Assembly and the State Duma.
