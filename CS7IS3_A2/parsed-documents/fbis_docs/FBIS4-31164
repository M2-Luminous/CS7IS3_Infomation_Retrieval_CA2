Some of the session was dedicated to relations between Slovenia and Croatia, especially in light of President Milan Kucan's announced visit to Zagreb. He is expected to travel there on 7 June. As it is customary, a news conference was held after the session. Our colleague Nadja Pengov was mostly interested in relations between Slovenia and Croatia: [Begin Pengov recording] The government conclusions were explained by Foreign Ministry State Secretary Peter Vencelj, who said the following: Matija Malesic, Slovene ambassador to Croatia, yesterday met with Croatian Prime Minister Valentic. Nikica Valentic told our ambassador that Croatia will continue with the construction of a border crossing near Secovlje and that the border crossing will be finished before the beginning of the tourist season. Work is underway and should be completed by the end of the week. Nikica Valentic here also said that he was aware of the controversial nature of the construction, however, that Croatia can no longer wait for a resolution of this problem. The information received indicates that Croatia is not inclined to the Slovene proposal regarding Secovlje and sailing in Piran Bay -- according to which temporarily, until this issue is finally resolved, Croatia would assume the manning of the Secovlje border crossing while Slovenia would supervise all of Piran Bay. The final verdict on this will be given by the Croatian Government at the session that started today at noon. Bearing in mind that the conclusions of the Croatian Government are not known at this moment, our government has decided not to make any decisions concerning President Kucan's visit to Zagreb for the time being. Whether the government will propose that President Kucan visit Zagreb or not will be decided by Prime Minister Drnovsek upon receipt of information on the Croatian Government stance on the Slovene proposal concerning the Secovlje border crossing and Piran Bay.
