The report stated: "Kuwait's financial reputation should not be linked with those institutions' situation." The following is the text of the report: Foreign Investments The Kuwaiti press has published a government report concerning the progress of action to prosecute the foreign investments case. This is the case that has caused, and continues to cause, debate. It affects considerably the credibility of all authorities in the country in regard to facing up to other issues. The report contains what would theoretically be expected. The first part lists a number of measures that the government has taken to try or prosecute principals accused of embezzlement over a long period of time, including the occupation period. There is no doubt that there are those in the government who sincerely want to bring the case to its natural conclusion, using all judicial and political means to finish the case by prosecuting the accused. However, the feeling that this is not the position of the entire government raises certain violent, negative reactions. The scope of the incident, the timing of its occurrence, the profuse evidence regarding violations, and the list of the accused names require zealous political pursuit. At the least, we would like to see certain positions change for the positive. In the second part, the report explains the changes that have occurred in the General Investments Board--administrative, functional, and in future strategy. The London office has been incorporated under the board's umbrella, and its powers limited. There is also a pledge to prepare a detailed internal program to regulate the powers and responsibilities of the three offices (London, Kuwait, and the support office) scheduled to be established. Moreover, the board intends to prepare its ideas concerning its investments and directions, with the assistance of specialists from among the directors of its portfolios and its investment specialists, and will periodically change course if the situation requires. This would have been the most complete and strongest part of the report, if there had also been the slightest hint or reference to the board's intent to study the effect of the pressures or tight restrictions that the general financial deficit is exerting, over time, on the size of the investments and on the board's organization and strategy in general. Perhaps the report's weakest part is the attempt to justify the government's deposits in the Tunis International Bank and the Bahrain Middle East Bank among the large group of banks and financial companies in which Kuwait participates. This, of course, also applies to the French-Kuwaiti Bank, since it is unacceptable to link Kuwait's reputation to these institutions' situations. Because of the volume of investments in these banks, one cannot justify intervening in the manner that was done and under the financial circumstances that existed in the country. Despite that, the intervention did not save most of these institutions, as was our case with Spain during the same period. Certain circles are raising fears about a collapse that might occur in the prices of certain assets, as a result of some civilians offering their assets in order to have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations. We do not agree with this, neither in terms of principle nor in terms of the situation's possibilities. With respect to principle, there should be no case of intervention to adjust prices, because market forces are sufficient to modify prices at their true level, even if downturns occur that go below that value in the short term. Perhaps our experiences in intervention, all of which failed after the "climate," are the best evidence of the program's faults. Perhaps Japan's recent experience in not intervening when its share indicator dropped from 38,000 to under 116,000 points [figures as published], including companies whose products we deal with in all aspects of our lives, is additional evidence from the experiences of the world around us. In terms of the situation, despite the country's passing through the disaster of a destructive occupation, the value of the companies registered in the market is still, as of 15 December 1993, slightly higher than their value on the day before the occupation. A reading of the AL-SHALL indicator for 15 December 1993 shows 101.6 points. This is an indicator of value, which means that the value of the investors' shares is higher than it was before the occupation. It is assumed, theoretically at least, that less value would be acceptable. The situation is that the indicator's reading on 7 July 1993, i.e., before talk about being close to agreement on the difficult debt program, was 92.7 points and was within the bounds of acceptability. The indicator rose rapidly and illogically to 111.5 points on 15 September 1993, i.e., after publication of Law No. 41/93. This was a 20 percent rise. The indicators of certain companies rose, due to the possibility of their benefitting from the program, to 2.9 times what they had been before the occupation, while others rose 2.5 times. These increases were illogical or unjustifiable. It was inevitable that the prices that had risen without justification would fall, because of their probable financial performance. The object of pushing their prices to the highest was to achieve profits over the short term. This must have surely affected the possibilities of increase of supply because of the program, or even because of the possibility of a psychological effect that it could leave behind. Despite that, the reading of the indicator last week was higher by 8.9 points than it was on 7 July 1993, i.e., 9.6 percent.
