Nine psychic- subject pairings took part in the experiment. The subject group consisted of five women and four men 21 to 38 years old. The psychic group consisted of three women and two men 33 to 53 years old. All of the psychics had from 5 to 17 years experience and notable success as healers. Each experiment included 1 background and 8 experimental sessions, each five minutes long. The task of the subjects was to detect a threshold signal against a noise background. The task of the psychics was to exert a controlled influence on the performance of the subjects, who were located in covered, soundproof booths. Four types of influence were tested: unconcealed/negative, unconcealed/positive, concealed/negative, and concealed/positive. For each session, the following indicators of success were measured: percentage of correct responses (hits); percentage of false anxiety (fa), the sensory sensitivity index and the beta decision-making criterion, reaction time, reaction time distributions (average reaction time, hit and fa reaction times), and the relevant standard deviations. A comparative evaluation of subject performance showed that the psychics were able to influence the subjects during both hidden and open extrasensory influence. Several subjects experienced changes in sensory sensitivity itself, but these changes on the whole were of a non-specific nature from group to group; no positive or negative effect with a one-on-one correspondence was established. Change in reaction time measurements were detected for both concealed and unconcealed extrasensory influence. There were substantial differences in the verifiable changes of psychophysical characteristics among the different pairings. These differences were attributed to both psychic ability and subject sensory sensitivity. Financial support for this study was provided by the Russian Basic Research Fund (project code: 93-06-10-760). Tables 3; references 7 Russian.
