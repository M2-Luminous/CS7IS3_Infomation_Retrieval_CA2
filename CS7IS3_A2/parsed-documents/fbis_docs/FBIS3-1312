The force is to have political and logistics support from member nations of the commission. This is contained in a communique issued at the end of the eighth summit of the Lake Chad Basin Commission this morning in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. The establishment of the joint security force was agreed upon by the summit because of its belief that programs on the master plan of the commission can only be achieved in a secure environment. The commission therefore decided on a rotational leadership for the joint security force with defined mode of human and material contribution by member states. The headquarters of the force will be at Bagakawa, in Borno State of Nigeria. The summit also adopted a master plan designed to halt ecological degradation of the lake and its basin. The Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha, described steps taken by the commission in this respect as a significant milestone in the search for a lasting solution to a major environmental crisis. He said the master plan contained viable and sustainable strategies for the management and development of the natural resources of the Lake Chad Basin. Gen. Abacha also explained that the water resources of the lake had reduced from 25,000 square km in the 1960's to 20,000 square km at present. The summit admitted the Central African Republic as the fifth member of the commission. The inclusion of that country was in respect of its strategic location as the source of major rivers which are flowing to the Lake Chad. The next summit of the commission is to be held in Chad next year.
