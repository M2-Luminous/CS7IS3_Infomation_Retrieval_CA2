"It is inconceivable that the Diet should end its session before a new cabinet has been formed," said Hata, who announced Saturday his intention to resign along with his entire cabinet. Hata remains in office until his replacement is picked. Hata made the comments as his ruling coalition is stepping up its bid to woo the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] back into its fold to create a stable, majority government. The House of Representatives is to convene a plenary session at 10 a.m. Wednesday. However, it remains unclear whether the lower chamber will be able to vote on a successor to Hata on Wednesday in view of intensifying parliamentary maneuverings by both the coalition and the no. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party to win over the socialists to their respective camps. A source at the lower house's Diet steering committee, "it is in line with common sense that we should extend the Diet session by about a week until the second week of July, while seeking to pick a successor before the Naples Summit begins (July 8)." Some LDP executives are trying to form a new coalition government comprising the LDP, SDP and new party Sakigake by forcing a vote during Wednesday's Diet session, while preventing the coalition from buying time to convince the SDP to return to its fold, Diet sources said. "The coalition would not be able to extend the Diet if the LDP and SDP, which contains the proponents of an SDP-LDP alliance, jointly opposes such an extension," the source said. In such an eventuality, the Diet would be forced to close its session temporarily and then hold an extraordinary session to pick a new premier and approve a bill defining the new 300 single-seat constituencies, the sources said.
