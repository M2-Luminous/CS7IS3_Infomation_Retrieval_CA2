This figure accounts for 4.3 percent of the total overseas-funded enterprises in the country, according to a recent national work meeting on the management of registered foreign-funded enterprises in this capital of Anhui Province. "In line with international conventions, we will fully support enterprises with favorable economic results and have to cancel or revoke licenses for those unable to resolve troubles so as to ensure healthy development of the whole range of foreign-funded enterprises," an official of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce said. China has 175,000 registered foreign-funded enterprises so far, most of which are profitable. The number of countries and regions making investment in the country rose from 122 in 1992 to 146 last year. According to the official, there are still a few enterprises which have gone through necessary formalities but have not made any investment on the mainland at all; are engaged in smuggling, speculation and profiteering; have promoted the sales of inferior equipment at a high price; have existed in name only; or fell into general debility. Analyzing why such practices persist, the official said, "the main cause was that, for a long period of time, it was foreign business people that selected us as partners, and some places paid attention only to the numbers of foreign-funded projects and not the quality." He stressed that this tendency must be checked and called on localities to study and solve the issue. A survey shows that China approved of the establishment of 85,000 overseas-funded enterprises last year, an increase of 180 percent over the previous year. Foreign business people have shown more interest in investing in coastal, interior and border areas including Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Sichuan, Hubei, Henan and Heilongjiang Provinces.
