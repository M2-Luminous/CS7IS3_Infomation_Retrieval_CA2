FBIS3-54462 "drnes016__s94003" FBIS-NES-94-016-S Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 * Voice, Vision Response to Majles Public Relations Office 94LA0050A Tehran SALAM in Persian 14 Nov 93 p 4 94LA0050A Tehran SALAM Language: Persian Article Type:CSO [Text] Following the publication of the statement by the Majles public relations office which was about the radio broadcast of the response by the Voice and Vision organization, protesting the report by the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group, the Voice and Vision organization's public relations office sent a reply, which appears below: The Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran thanks the Majles public relations office for opening the discussion on the rights and prerogatives of government bodies and organizations. This made some important points known to the respected law and policy makers in the three powers, as well as to the ever-present-on-the-scene and martyr-nurturing people of Islamic Iran. 1. While the Voice and Vision organization believes in Article 76 of the Constitution, which has given the responsibility for research and investigation to the respected Majles, it believes that this article guarantees the continuation of the government and the perpetuation of Islamic values. However, the aforementioned organization feels obligated to answer the affronts to honor, which were in a report from the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group in the form of very ugly and inappropriate accusations against the organization's hard-working and hezbollah management and its concerned, active, and committed workers. 2. Article 171 of the Constitution gives people who have been subjected to accusations the right to defend themselves and it makes it obligatory to restore their spiritual and material honor and dignity. In this regard it is necessary to look at Article 39 of the Constitution. Article 39: "Affronts to the honor and dignity of someone who has been arrested, detained, imprisoned, or exiled by legal order in any form are forbidden and subject to punishment." The aforementioned law forbids affronts to the honor of criminals and exiles and considers this subject to punishment. It is clear that affronting the collective and individual honor of those running a government body in any form or pretext is a violation of the Constitution and the criteria of religious law. 3. The Voice and Vision organization, according to Article 6 of the Law on General Policies and Principles of the Voice and Vision organization's Programming enacted on Thursday 17 Tir 1361 [8 July 1982] by the respected Majles, is required to prevent and avoid affronting the honor of individuals. We quote the text of Article 6: Article 6: "Respect the human dignity of individuals and refrain from affronting their honor, in accordance with Islamic regulations." Shouldn't the Voice and Vision organization do its lawful duty in respecting the human dignity of individuals? Moreover, to preserve Islamic, social and security values, the organization is required to act in accordance with Article 19 of the policies law. Article 19 clearly specifies the items whose publication the organization must prevent, and while mentioning their study, we will quote the two relevant paragraphs: Paragraph B, Article 19: "Accusing the nation's official bodies and organizations and groups, societies and parties whose activities are lawful according to the Political Parties Law." The aforementioned law includes the Voice and Vision organization, which is one of the government's most sensitive organizations and has the confidence and trust of the leader and the people. Therefore, the Voice and Vision organization is legally required to prevent the broadcast of accusations and incorrect material from the Inquiry and Investigation Commission during the direct broadcast over the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic. Likewise, in view of Paragraph H, Article 19, due to the fact that the names of the leaders of a counterrevolutionary minigroup were given in the commission's report and caused the false idea to be created for some people that the aforementioned opponents of the government might acquire power, the organization is required by law to stop the direct broadcast and to broadcast the report at an appropriate time for public information after deleting the accusations, affronts to honor, and propaganda for minigroups. Unfortunately, however, since the inquiry and investigation report was broadcast directly, the possibility was taken away from us for monitoring it, observing the law and carrying out our responsibilities. 4. Now that the report from the Inquiry and Investigation Group has been broadcast verbatim with all the inappropriate accusations and affronts to the honor of individuals, outside the lawful responsibility of the Voice and Vision organization, it appears that one must turn to the Constitution and read all of Article 69, which is the result of long discussions by theologians and legal specialists, was approved by the Assembly of Experts and was given final approval by His Holiness the Imam, and apply it. Here it is necessary to study the provisions of the Constitution to clarify the responsibilities of the Voice and Vision organization, and we must study the limits and boundaries in broadcasting the proceedings of the respected Majles. In Article 69 of the Constitution, we read: "Majles proceedings must be public and a complete report of them must be published via official radio and newspapers for public information...." First: In Article 69 of the Constitution mention is made only of the proceedings of the respected Majles deputies and there is no mention of the pre-agenda speeches and the special reports such as the inquiry and investigation report. These kinds of events are beyond the absolute and lawful meaning of the term "proceedings," and the radio is not legally required to broadcast these items. Second: There is no kind of direct or indirect mention of the live and direct broadcast of sessions or even the proceedings of the respected Majles. Third: The law clearly states that a "report" of the proceedings must be broadcast by radio for public information, not the proceedings themselves. If the law had intended the broadcast of the actual proceedings and sessions it would not have used the term "report" and it would have written instead, for example: The "verbatim proceedings" must be broadcast without alteration for public information. The term "report" applies in its meaning and lawful intent to the presence of a third person between the originator of the message and the intended receiver of the message. Fourth: The spirit and intent of the Constitution will be better understood when we read Article 69 along with Articles 40 and 22 as well as with paragraphs B, D, and H of Article 19 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles of the Voice and Vision organization's Programming approved by the Majles, and when we study all the laws as a whole. In this way it is understood that the Constitution makes no kind of reference or even allusion to the direct broadcast of the sessions of the respected Majles, and that its emphasis and explanations are about reporting on them. Therefore, while we thank again the Majles public relations office for opening the discussion on limitations and boundaries, the Voice and Vision organization intends to submit a request for a conceptual study of Article 69 to the competent authorities so that the Constitution can be implemented in this regard and anything resembling heresy will be eliminated. Because of its belief and complete faith in the Constitution and its experience in these 12 years witnessing events, problems and critical dangers in direct broadcasts, and in view of the message from His Holiness the Imam (may his grave be sanctified), as the second [as published] term of the Majles begins, the management of the Voice and Vision organization intends to pursue seriously the important matter of a conceptual study of Article 69 in order to observe Islamic ethics, avoid insults and also to follow recent guidance in this regard from the exalted leader. Again, it expresses its thanks to the respected Majles public relations office. 5. In its statement the Majles public relations office has accused the Voice and Vision organization of heresy. This new point must also be studied carefully. First: Based on Article 69 of the Constitution and the legal explanations, which have been presented concerning it, it is this Inquiry and Investigation Group, which has committed heresy and has made the illegal matter of directly broadcasting its report lawful and assumed it to be within the domain of its prerogatives, thereby making an illicit innovation. Second: Reporting on research and investigation is itself another heresy that could be dangerous for the nation's future and could disrupt national unity and harmony. In the Constitution the matter of research and investigation is considered lawful, and affronting honor, making accusations and publishing lies is prohibited and subject to penalties. Therefore, employing illegal material such as accusations, slander, and insults in the name of lawful research and investigation is itself a new heresy that the aforementioned group has committed, and not the Voice and Vision organization. Third: Under the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other regulations approved by the respected Majles, any person has the right to defend himself against accusations in the same media. How is it that the Voice and Vision organization must broadcast the answers submitted by all the offices to the criticism and protests broadcast by the people, but it does not have the right to answer the incorrect statements and unworthy accusations concerning its own performance and its workers? If it answers, is this heresy and making personal use of public facilities? Based on this, it appears that the accusations in the inquiry and investigation report, in view of Articles 39 and 40 of the Constitution, are heresy. The answer from the Voice and Vision organization on the one hand is the lawful right of every person and legal entity as an answer to insults and accusations against itself, and on the other hand the organization has acted on its lawful duty to fight heresy and the groundwork for heresy. 6. The Law on General Policies and Principles of the Voice and Vision organization's programming requires the organization to fight heresy. Article 26 of the policy law reads as follows: Article 26: Informing public opinion concerning ideological heresy and deviation as mentioned in the Tradition "if deviation arises..." [unattributed Arabic quote] After the reading of the inquiry and investigation report, the Voice and Vision organization was faced with two important heresies. The first heresy was the heresy of making accusations and insults in the sacred name of the lawful duty of inquiry and investigation. The second heresy, which is the largest and most painful heresy possible, is the Inquiry and Investigation Group open and direct opposition to the written views, emphatic statements and guidance from His Holiness the Imam (may his grave be sanctified), and this is intolerable for the managers of the organization. Silence was seen to be the equivalent of treason. The respected members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group were aware of all the Imam's theological guidance and views, and today after the instances of their opposition to His Holiness the Imam's views are made clear, they cannot exonerate themselves on the pretext that they were not aware of them. At the first meeting between the respected members of the group and the chief of the organization, the chief of the Voice and Vision organization explained His Holiness the Imam's theological views and opinions to them. Moreover, at that same meeting the chief of the organization explained: "According to Article 107 of the Constitution, in addition to the fact that His Holiness the Imam is the owner of the revolution and the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, he is recognized and accepted as source of emulation and leader by a decisive majority of the population. Therefore in all matters of religious law such as the veil, music, makeup, and the matter at hand, the Voice and Vision organization has acted in accordance with his theological views. If the Inquiry and Investigation Group wants to study the performance of the organization, it must study and evaluate based on His Holiness the Imam's criteria and standards and not those of some other authority. Likewise, even if there is a member of the Inquiry and Investigation Group who has written a treatise or a fatwa, he cannot use his own view and fatwa." In order to be sure that the group would be able to evaluate based on the views and fatwas of the Imam, the organization sent the theological views and guidance from his excellency in a letter to the chief of the Inquiry and Investigation Group. Therefore if the members of the group declare today that they were not aware of His Holiness the Imam's theological views, criteria, and standards, it is not acceptable or forgivable. 7. Unfortunately under these conditions the Voice and Vision organization cannot defend His Holiness the Imam's (may his grave be sanctified) theological views and criteria any more than this, because it is possible that the Voice and Vision organization will be accused of defending its own performance and then the aforementioned views and criteria may be questioned. However, it does not appear that the deputies and officials who follow the Imam will remain silent in the fact of such rudeness. Therefore the Voice and Vision organization is lawfully and religiously required to inform the public about the aforementioned heresy, which is definitely considered a deviation from theological fundamentals, and it was not the first nor will it be the last instance. 8. In addition to the aforementioned legal proofs, the broadcast of the answer from the Voice and Vision organization to the inquiry and investigation report was based on a measure enacted 8/3/1363 [25 October 1984] by the Voice and Vision organization Supervisory Council, and this measure, because of the presence of representatives of the three branches of law, has the validity of law. It is appropriate to ask the Majles public relations office, is applying the law heresy? Or is the law for the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Commission different than the law for the Voice and Vision organization? It would also have been appropriate if the statement from the Majles public relations office had been written with more study, care, and examination of the record, because the Voice and Vision organization has implemented the measure enacted on 8/3/1363 by the Supervisory Council during the second, third, and fourth terms of the Majles. Moreover, supposing a law is not implemented for 20 years. Does it cease to be a law in the eyes of the respected Majles public relations office, and is it illegal to implement it? In this connection we note that according to Paragraph B, Article 8 of the Voice and Vision organization administration law, which is devoted to the duties of the executive director, the executive director is required to observe the measures enacted by the Supervisory Council. 9. Since the undocumented and unproven accusations from the Inquiry and Investigation Commission were directed at individuals and lawful entities in the organization and in several cases at all the organization's workers, many complaints have been sent to the offices of the organization's managers and its legal unit, and the organization's management cannot prevent them from being sent to the legal authorities. In conclusion, we ask the respected judiciary, which has properly announced that it will investigate the complaints from the respected deputies, will it also investigate the complaints from the workers and managers of the Voice and Vision organization who were insulted, accused, and had their honor affronted, or not? Will it investigate the violation of the prerogatives of Article 39 of the Constitution, which caused all this heresy and these unworthy accusations, insults and slander without proof or documentation, or not?
