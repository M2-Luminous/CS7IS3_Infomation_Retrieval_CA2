FBIS4-29862 "dreas120_d_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 South Korea Hyundai Firms Plan To Register on Securities Hyundai Firms Plan To Register on Securities SK2006064294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0602 GMT 20 Jun 94 SK2006064294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Securities Dealers Association said Monday it would be favorably disposed if three unlisted Hyundai Group companies reapplied for registration on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, a signal that the government has begun lifting financial restrictions on the group. The three firms -- Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Elevator and Hyundai Housing and Industrial Development -- will submit their reapplications by Monday at the earliest, Hyundai officials said. The three applied for OTC market registration in March 1992 and again in October 1993 but were turned down each time. They have not reapplied since, the association said. The Hyundai Group has had "uncomfortable relations" with the government and been subjected to financial restrictions in connection with honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong's run in the 1992 presidential election. If the lifting of financial restrictions is confirmed, Hyundai will also apply for long-term loans from the Korea Development Bank, for floating foreign exchange-denominated securities overseas, and for listing of two unlisted firms -- Hyundai Merchant Shipping and Koryo Industrial Development -- on the stock exchange to reactivate its investment plan for this year, an official said. Because of the trouble it has faced raising funds, Hyundai has had to kill or put off some projects envisaged under the investment plan scaled at 4.5 trillion won (5.6 billion U.S. dollars) for 1994. Among the projects scrapped or deferred were construction of two new automobile factories by Hyundai Motor, completion of a new 16-M DRAM assembly line by Hyundai Electronics, and construction of a 1.5-million-ton-class dock and facilities producing 3,000-megawatt-class generators and turbines by Hyundai Heavy Industries.
