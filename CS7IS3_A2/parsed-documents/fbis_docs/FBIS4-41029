[Masol] Of course, we will form one; there should be a government. The government, in my opinion, will bring together competent, qualified specialists. [Pysarenko] You said that the prime minister must head the Executive Branch... Are you convinced that the Supreme Council will adopt such amendments to the Constitution? [Masol] The parliament will only be adopting amendments in September, after the run-off elections. [Pysarenko] You said that a year or a year and a half is needed to achieve stabilization. Are you convinced that the people will suffer quietly during this period? [Masol] I believe that today one must speak the truth: The situation will not improve overnight. People must understand that everything depends on the harvest. If it is good, stabilization will begin a little earlier. [Pysarenko] Forgive me for asking this, perhaps, unpleasant question: Do you think that you were appointed prime minister as a symbol of 1990, or as a reformer? [Masol] I would have to say the latter. [Pysarenko] The press has reported that Masol is going to nationalize commercial banks. Is this true? [Masol] The press is now free, and it writes whatever it wants. If someone is going to privatize commercial banks, then I would like to ask him: What will happen then; will we live with the old system of planning? I will not. I want to note, however, that all over the world, states draft plans, have economy ministries, and make balance sheets and forecasts. A state must know what it needs and how much. [Pysarenko] After answering deputies' questions, did you not have an impression that you are a better marketeer than they? [Masol] You have already answered your own question. [Pysarenko] What will be your policy toward Russia? [Masol] Russia is our primary market. If you can, please find a state which would buy 2-3 million tonnes of sugar from us. Yet, we should also cooperate with the West. The West means modern technology and structural reconstruction of our economy. Russia means energy resources and a market for our goods. We should sell our products. To buy something, one must sell something. These are normal economic relations, and whether we refer to them as a union or a market... We have yet to see. [Pysarenko] Will you continue the policy of [former acting Prime Minister] Zvyahilskyy on not financing the budget sector? [Masol] More than half of Ukraine's workers are employed in the budget sector. The budget sector is the nation's gene pool. If we want to lose it, we should not finance education, health care, or science. [Pysarenko] To what degree will the cabinet be reshuffled? [Masol] You know, I do not yet know how many people are in the cabinet... [Pysarenko] Are you satisfied with the current form of cooperation between the government and the National Bank? [Masol] The government, the Finance Ministry, and the National Bank should work together. Everything depends not on who is subordinated to whom, but on how they cooperate. [Pysarenko] Who will be finance minister? [Masol] I will think about it. [Pysarenko] For whom will you vote in the presidential elections? [Masol] For those who will be included in the polls... [Pysarenko] What will be your policy toward the Crimea? [Masol] Crimea is a part of Ukraine, it is Ukraine, and territorial integrity must be preserved. [Pysarenko] Would you agree to lease Sevastopol to Russia? [Masol] This issue as a whole needs attention. Still, there is such a practice in the world, and there is nothing new here. Kazakhstan has leased a launch-site to Russia, and it will profit from that. [Pysarenko] What is your position on the idea of relations between Ukraine and the Crimea being based on treaties? [Masol] If we have an integral territory, what kind of treaties can there be? [Pysarenko] I wish you success and support in the reform process.
