According to reports, on 17 June the U.S. Senate babbled about someone else's southward invasion and adopted a resolution urging President Clinton to beef up immediately the U.S. Forces occupying South Korea. This resolution, which passed a full session of the U.S. Senate, calls for, among other things, sending additional U.S. troops and fighter planes to South Korea and deploying an aircraft carrier-based combat unit in this region. This is an attempt to deploy massive aggression forces on the Korean peninsula and clearly discloses the U.S. imperialists' brigandish [kangdojok], aggressive nature. They cited someone else's southward invasion and nuclear issue as a pretext for beefing up the forces. However, this is sophism which cannot convince anyone. It is a well-known fact that the North's nuclear issue, a byproduct of the imperialists' antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuvers, is a falsehood that was fabricated to crush [apsal] our Republic. The same is true with threats of southward invasion. Southward invasion, the nuclear issue, and other things that the U.S. imperialists are talking about are mere excuses to justify their military buildup and aggression maneuvers. Under such excuses, the U.S. imperialists have already brought numerous aggression troops into South Korea and plan to move aircraft carriers Independence and Constellation, which had been mobilized in the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, to the waters close to the Korean peninsula to stand by right after the exercise is over. They also plan to deploy aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk to the waters close to our country. A foreign news agency has disclosed that the scheduled concentration of several aircraft carriers in one region was part of the U.S. plan to beef up naval forces in Northeast Asia. Nevertheless, without being satisfied with this, they plan to deploy more troops and fighter planes and an aircraft carrier-based combat unit in South Korea and in its neighborhood. This proves that they plan to deliberately further aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula to provoke a second Korea war against us at all costs. If this had not been true, why should the United States have continuously deployed aggression forces in South Korea and in its neighborhood and inspected bases of the Japanese maritime and air Self-Defense Forces under the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue, which could not be used as an excuse? Even though the cold war is said to be over internationally, the cold war has continued on the Korean peninsula because of the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists try to launch a surprise preemptive strike at our Republic after deploying massive aggression forces under the pretext of our nuclear issue. However, military adventures, threats, and blackmailing can in no way frighten anyone else or resolve the issue. The United States gave rise to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, which originated from the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward Korea. Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through dialogue and negotiations; it can never be resolved through forcible pressures, threats, or blackmailing against the other side. This is why people from all walks of life in the world denounce the U.S. imperialists for pursuing military strong-arm measures and strongly ask the United States to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiations. Just like a thief turning on the victim with a club, the United States, which gave rise to the nuclear issue, finds fault with us, who are under nuclear threat, and tries to beef up aggression forces. This clearly shows it has no interest in peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but tries to crush [apsal] our Republic by military force. No strong-arm measures will work on us, who consider independence to be their life. We have already made it clear that if the United States chooses to take strong-arm measures, we will take a different road. If the United States tries to get something through military adventures, this will be a miscalculation. The U.S. imperialists must clearly know we are ready for both dialogue and war and act with discretion.
