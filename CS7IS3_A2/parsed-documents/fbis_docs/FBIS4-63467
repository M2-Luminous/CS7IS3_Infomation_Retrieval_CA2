Very probably this is because talks are going to take place tomorrow between the government delegations of Russia and Ukraine concerning the situation on the peninsula. It will be recalled that Kiev's delegation will be led by Yuhym Zvyahilskyy, the acting prime minister. What results does Simferopol expect of this meeting? Our correspondent is talking to Vyacheslav Lebedev, the press secretary of the Crimean president. [Begin Lebedev recording] The negotiating process has begun, and both Russia and Ukraine realize there is a need for talks, so the results are bound to come -- not at once, perhaps, but there will be results. The very fact talks are taking place will have a positive influence on developments in the Crimea. As for the situation in the Crimea, the president is in control -- that is, of the things he can control. He cannot, for example, control the fleet, and the troops are also being controlled by someone different. [end recording] If the representatives of Russia and Ukraine discuss the situation in the Crimea tomorrow, then talks between the parliamentary delegations of Simferopol and Kiev will take place on 24 May. [passage omitted] And what is the current situation like? Once more, here is the press secretary of the Crimean president: [Begin Lebedev recording] The situation is normal and quiet. The tension exists only on the top level and is largely internal. We realize the presidential election in Ukraine is scheduled for 26 June and Kravchuk is making his last attempts to play the Crimean card and disrupt the election or put some sort of pressure on the deputies. We shall try to defend ourselves and not give him a pretext to introduce a state of emergency and thus avoid the election. It is by this that the present situation has been caused and these difficulties are mainly temporary. [end recording] [passage omitted]
