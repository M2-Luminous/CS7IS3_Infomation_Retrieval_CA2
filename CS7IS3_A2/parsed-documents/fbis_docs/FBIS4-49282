Mr. Fu told the British ambassador that reform and opening to the outside world had brought great development to the province. Anhui has in recent years seen a greater economic and social development. The gross national product (GDP) achieved in the province grew by 17 percent in 1992. Economic exploitation in Anhui went ahead at a rapid pace in 1993 and the GDP rose by 22 percent over the year before, ranking the province one of the leading provinces in the country. He said that Anhui possessed the conditions for economic development despite its geographical location in the hinterland. When asked by Sir Robin whether poverty still remained in the province, Mr. Fu frankly said that many rural areas within the province had seen their living standard improved but some remote mountain areas had not yet eliminated poverty and this involved a population of nearly three million. Mr. Fu added that various local governments were adopting measures to reverse the backwardness in these areas. The governor asked for overseas investment for better exploitation in the province. He said that negotiations on 26 possible items for joint ventures was recently held with six of them officially confirmed involving an investment value of up to U.S.$100 million.
