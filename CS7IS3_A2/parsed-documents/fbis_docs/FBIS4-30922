"It would be unwise if the Czech card is played during the coming election campaign," he said, referring to allegations of Slovak federalism. In the Czech Republic or Slovakia there are no serious forces wishing for the restoration of Czechoslovakia, Kovac said. The validity of Benes decrees has not been questioned in Slovakia, he said. Havel said he was glad Slovakia had joined the border regime. Border procedures are time-consuming and facilities are on a lower level than on the borders with other neighboring countries, Kovac said, adding that more finance and better administration are needed. "The (Czech and Slovak) Governments are aware of the painful situation and will have to resolve it promptly," Kovac said. Kovac and Havel are to meet next in Prague after the Slovak elections.
