FR940902-0-00079 FR940902-0-00010 The Department expects assessment of eligible applicants to be used only in those cases when an eligible applicant's suitability for enrollment is unclear. While the regulations afford an opportunity to charge the costs of preliminary assessment functions to the training-related and supportive services cost category to aid in the determination of an applicant's suitability, the Department expects the restriction on the cost categories to act as a natural control on SDA's while still allowing the flexibility for individual decisions. The Department would like to emphasize that the limited availability of funds will restrict over-use of preliminary assessment as part of the decision to enroll. SDA's are expected to finance intensive services expected to enable participants to complete successfully the longer term JTPA service strategies within this cost category. Section 628.515 sets forth the requirements of the objective assessment. The scope of the objective assessment should not be limited to only services or training programs already available in an SDA. A few commenters questioned whether basic skills evaluation was required as part of the objective assessment. The Department intends the evaluation to be of both basic and occupational skills. The definition of ``objective assessment'' in ยง628.515(b)(1) is revised, therefore, to include basic as well as occupational skills evaluation. The objective assessment is ongoing and should not be viewed as a one-time event. It should be a multi-faceted process which includes a full array of options including items such as structured interviews, paper and pencil tests, performance tests, behavioral observations, interest inventories, career guidance instruments, aptitude tests, and basic skills tests. From these options, and others, assessment staff may select the most appropriate tools for each participant to measure skills, abilities, aptitudes, interests, supportive service and financial needs, and to counsel participants on how their assessment results relate to local labor market demands. SDA's are strongly encouraged to prudently select appropriate measuring tools that will provide necessary information for the reasonable development of an individual service strategy leading to a realistic employment goal. JTPA resources are limited and JTPA is not an entitlement program. The Department expects SDA's to develop practical applications for career counseling and assessments for basic skills and occupational training. The objective assessment process should be sensitive to the testing and evaluation environment and the comfort and confidence level of the participant. The temptation to over-test or over-evaluate, providing excess information for which there is no immediate application, does not serve the customer's best interest, is detrimental to the customer/ counselor relationship, and is costly to the SDA. The objective assessment is to be revisited regularly and the resulting information used to amend the ISS, as appropriate, when additional needs are identified or goals achieved. Assessments recently conducted by other human service programs or schools are viable options and their use is encouraged, where appropriate, rather than requiring the customer to undergo additional assessments that duplicate information already obtained.
