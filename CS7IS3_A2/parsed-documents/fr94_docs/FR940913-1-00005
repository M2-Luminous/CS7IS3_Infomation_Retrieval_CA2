FR940913-1-00005 FR940913-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 1250 [Docket No. PY&hyph;94&hyph;004] Referendum on Amendment to Egg Research and Promotion Order To Increase the Rate of Assessment AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, Agriculture. ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of referendum. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend the Egg Research and Promotion Order to increase the assessment rate from 5 cents to 10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. This proposal would also make a conforming amendment to regulations. Notice also is hereby given that the Agricultural Marketing Service will conduct a referendum to determine whether egg producers favor an increase in the assessment rate under the egg research and promotion program. Ballots and instructions will be mailed directly to all known egg producers owning over 75,000 laying hens. DATES: The representative period for purposes of the referendum is May 1 through July 31, 1994. The referendum will be conducted between September 26 and October 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Angela C. Clonts at 202&hyph;720&hyph;3506. Supplementary Information: Executive Orders 12866 and 12778 This rule is exempt from Executive Order 12866 review. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 14 of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, any provisions of such order or any obligations imposed in connection with such order are not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint is filed within 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Effect on Small Entities The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). Currently, 618 egg producers pay assessments to the American Egg Board (AEB). A proposed rule to increase the exemption level from 30,000 to 75,000 laying hens was published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13460). The increased exemption level would exempt 253 small egg producers who represent 41 percent of the egg producers currently paying assessments, but only 4 percent of AEB's total assessment income. It is anticipated that the 75,000-hen exemption level would be in place before the referendum on the assessment rate increase. Therefore, a change in the assessment rate would affect only egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying hens. There are an estimated 365 producers who own more than 75,000 hens. Currently, egg producers must pay a mandatory assessment of 5 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs marketed to fund the research and promotion activities authorized by the Act. The present 5-cent assessment is equivalent to approximately 0.231 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton of Large eggs. An assessment rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case would be equivalent to approximately 0.463 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton of Large eggs. This is based on the Economic Research Service's 3-year average wholesale price for New York City Grade A Large cartoned eggs (1991&hyph;93) of 72 cents per dozen. AEB collects approximately $7.5 million annually from the 5-cent assessment, and it is estimated that it would collect $14 million for a 10-cent assessment. It is estimated that any additional costs would be offset by the benefits to be derived from strengthened research and promotion programs. Paperwork Reduction Information collection requirements and recordkeeping provisions contained in 7 CFR Part 1250 have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB Control No. 0581&hyph;0093 under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. No additional recordkeeping requirements would be imposed as a result of this proposed rule. It has been estimated that it will take an average of about 30 minutes for each of the approximately 380 egg producers to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting.
