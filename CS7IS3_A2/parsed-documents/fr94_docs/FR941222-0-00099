Rates The base rates for the three delivery options are set forth below. The base rates may be reduced by any or all of four additive annual discounts depending on how many packages the customer mails to Japan through IPCS. For each delivery option, the Postal Service will charge the base rates, at 1-pound increments, for the first 100,000 packages mailed by the customer during the 12-month period. Once the customer has mailed 100,000 packages, postage for the customer's next 150,000 packages will be reduced by 4.75% from the base rates. Packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting the 100,000-package threshold. Once the customer has mailed 250,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's next 250,000 packages will be reduced by an additional 5.75% taking into account the first discount. That is, postage will be calculated for these 150,000 packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, and then reducing that total by a further 5.75%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting the 250,000-package threshold. Once the customer has mailed 500,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's next 500,000 packages will be reduced by an additional 6.00% taking into account the first two discounts. That is, postage will be calculated for these 500,000 packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, then reducing that total by a further 5.75%, and then reducing that total by a further 6.00%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting the 500,000-package threshold. Once the customer has mailed 1,000,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's remaining packages will be reduced by an additional 6.25% taking into account the first three discounts. That is, postage will be calculated for the remaining packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, then reducing that total by a further 5.75%, then reducing that total by a further 6.00%, and then reducing that total by 6.25%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting the 1,000,000-package threshold.
