['Abbas] Thank you. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] A new round of Palestinian-Israeli talks has started in Cairo over the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The Economic Affairs Committee also resumed its work in Paris. What have these talks achieved? ['Abbas] Significant progress has been achieved in the latest round of talks in Cairo. The two sides worked out full details concerning the police force. This topic is now closed. Once the signal is given, the police force will be ready to deploy. The issue has been fully discussed. The talks in Cairo also focused on the civilian [local administration] functions. Only one of these functions needs further discussion. The current round of talks may finalize this issue as well. Economic issues are being discussed in Paris. Economic issues, we all know, are numerous and complicated. At issue are concerns such as customs, taxes, trade, merchandise, labor, and currency. I can say there has been some 90-percent progress in this regard. I expect that issues concerning both the economy and the civilian administration will be resolved in the current round of talks. If some issues remain unsettled, the two sides will decide whether to hold further negotiations to resolve them or begin implementing the agreement immediately It all depends on what the two sides will agree upon. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What are the most important of the unresolved issues? ['Abbas] They have to do with security, the crossings, geographic jurisdiction, and the judiciary. There are quite a few snags here and there and although we cannot shrug them off, I think it is advisable to begin the implementation and let the talks go on. This is what we plan to tell the Israelis. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is the real cause of the remaining differences between the Palestinians and Israelis? ['Abbas] It has to do with the interpretation of the Declaration of Principles. Every side is trying to interpret it in the way that suits them, to tell you the truth. The Declaration of Principles is a document that needs interpretation and clarification and gives rise to differing views and a bit of horse-trading. This is the reason for the differences. Naturally, the Israelis want to hold on to the land and the authority they have until the very last. They find it hard to let go. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The recent incidents in the occupied territories have proven that Israel's security claims are unreal and that there is a need for Palestinian security as well. ['Abbas] I hope the Israelis will understand this, namely, that both the Israelis and Palestinians need security. I hope the Israelis will also understand that the issue is actually one of confidence, not security. We are discussing peace. If we have genuine intentions of making peace, real security and other measures will certainly be taken without reference to texts. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Recent Israeli statements say the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement will be signed soon. Is this true? ['Abbas] I cannot give dates or depend on dates. I say that when work on the basic and necessary files is completed, the two sides will be ready for signing and implementation. There is another point: The two sides may finish with some files and agree to begin implementation while negotiations on the remaining files continue. This is decided through negotiations. But we cannot say the signing will be tomorrow, the day after, next week, or in two weeks. A single word or minor problem may obstruct the signing. We cannot give people false hopes that may not be fulfilled. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Should we expect a summit meeting between Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin very soon? ['Abbas] When a summit is decided, it will mean the implementation of the agreement has started. Such a summit will be meant to announce the implementation, not to hold negotiations. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mahmud 'Abbas: The file of the Palestinian police force was closed after an agreement was reached. Is the force prepared to assume security on the Palestinian territory? ['Abbas] Yes. Of course. The force will be ready. It is. When it enters Palestinian territory, it will start assuming its national responsibilities on its land. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This is my last question. The multilateral talks on water are now being held in Muscat, Oman. A Palestinian delegation is participating. What are the Palestinian proposals at these talks? ['Abbas] We make no Palestinian proposals. We make Arab ones. We cooperate with the Arab brothers taking part in these negotiations. The water issue is of concern not only to the Palestinians, but to all Arab sides in the Middle East. Any views we may offer, therefore, must be in harmony with the views of our brothers who are attending the talks or are concerned with this issue. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you. ['Abbas] You are welcome.
