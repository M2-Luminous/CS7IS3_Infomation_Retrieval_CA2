The newly approved projects included 1,039 foreign-funded enterprises, and the contractual volume of investment was $700.2 million, exceeding the figures of the past nine years combined. Investors came from 33 countries and regions. After Maanshan Iron and Steel Company's H shares were listed in Hong Kong, they attracted many overseas buyers because of the company's powerful economic strength and good reputation. A total of $500 million in stocks was sold. This was a new step by our province in utilizing foreign capital. In addition, some foreign capital was also used by the methods of borrowing from foreign banks and foreign governments, conducting compensatory trade, and processing products from materials imported from abroad. Furthermore, last year our province also accepted $16 million in foreign aid. As a whole, our province's utilization of foreign capital is entering a new period as the channels, methods, and scale for its utilization are expanding. The arrival of this new period shows that the scope and channels of our contacts are expanding, that more people in the world are beginning to understand and like Anhui, and that Anhui is advancing in big strides in the world arena. In opening up to the outside world, it is necessary, to a large extent, to expand contacts and ties with various countries. The contacts and ties should include those in the economic, scientific, technological, educational, cultural, and personnel areas. However, these contacts should, finally, be based on economic contacts and should be embodied by economic interests and benefits. How should we expand our province's contacts and ties with foreign countries? From a long-range point of view, an important thing we should do is to use and manage foreign capital well and strive to constantly increase its value and make it yield benefits. The purpose of foreign businessmen who invest in our province is to make money, and it is because there are profits to be made that we introduce foreign capital. This is reasonable. Cooperation and contacts with foreign businessmen will continue to consolidate and develop only if both sides can profit. There is a humorous saying by the people of Hefei which goes like this: When foreign businessmen get rich, we also get rich; both sides "will get fat if they cooperate." Therefore, we must not fear that foreign businessmen will make money; instead, we should create conditions for them to make money. This is an "economic chain" which leads to expansion of contacts and enhancement of friendship. Many practical situations have shown that if foreign businessmen who have invested in our province fail to make money in two to three years, they will lose interest in our province. Besides, this will adversely affect investment by other foreign businessmen in our province. If their capital increases in value quickly and if the projects built with their aid yield profits, they will show greater interest in cooperating with us. Besides, this has also increased our confidence and attracted more people who are willing to invest in Anhui and to cooperate with and aid us. For example, at first foreign businessmen invested only several hundred thousand U.S. dollars in some foreign-funded enterprises such as the Zhongyuan Shoes Manufacturing Company, Limited, in Jieshou and the Hongqing Precision Machine Tool Plant in Anqing. Before long, the value of the U.S. dollars increased like nuclear fission in Anhui, turning the two enterprises into pacesetters in cooperation with foreign businesses. Later, under the influence of the pacesetters, many more foreign businesses came to invest in Anhui. Having achieved great successes, the Huabei [North China] plain agricultural project, the first project of Anhui's agricultural sector that introduced foreign investment, became a banner of China's agricultural sector in introducing foreign investments. It attracted one batch after another of larger foreign-invested agricultural projects. The successes achieved by the Anhui Provincial XINHUA Printing Factory in implementing a project with German assistance also caught the attention of some overseas personages. All these showed that successful utilization and management of foreign investments as well as projects with foreign assistance is an important step in expanding contacts with the outside world, attracting more foreign investment, and achieving greater successes. There are many institutions in Anhui that have made good use of foreign funds. However, there are also some localities that often think the job is finished after foreign funds are introduced. They do not spend the time and effort to use and manage foreign funds. As a result, the value of foreign funds fails to increase quickly, thereby adversely affecting the expansion of cooperation and contacts with the outside world. Actually, the introduction of foreign funds is only the beginning of the job. More difficult work lies ahead. We must establish highly efficient operating mechanisms step by step for the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign- owned enterprises and for other projects under cooperation with foreign businessmen so as to really give full play to the role of introduced foreign funds as a yeast. Some localities in our province are handling the task now. For example, the Hefei City Government last year established an "office responsible for providing services to foreign-owned enterprises," called "Foreign- Owned Enterprises Office" for short, in addition to its "Foreign Funds Office." After the "Foreign Funds Office" has introduced foreign funds, the "Foreign-Owned Enterprises Office" will be specifically responsible for the establishment of the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, for providing services and coordination for them, and for their administration and supervision. It created conditions for highly efficient operation of the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Such a practice is recommendable. At present, the spring tide of reform and opening is surging from coastal areas to the hinterland; our province is benefiting from the development strategy for areas along the Chang Jiang; more foreign businessmen will commit investments in Anhui. In the face of such an opportunity, we must greet it in a more sincere attitude and with more solid work and better services so we may establish more extensive contacts with the world.
