FBIS4-7841 "dreeu067_d_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 SLOVAKIA _O_Prime Minister's Past Reexamined, Revealed _O_Prime Minister's Past Reexamined, Revealed 94P20582A 94P20582A CSO [Editorial Report] Peter Schutz, Kosice-based correspondent of the Prague right-of-center daily DENNI TELEGRAF, claims in his 17 March commentary that Jozef Moravcik, who replaced Vladimir Meciar as Slovakia's prime minister, had been considered "a potential alternative to Meciar" well before his appoinment on 16 March, possibly as early as a year ago. To correct the "erroneous" characterization of Moravcik as "one of the 1968 men," Schutz also mentions a number of biographical details, "which quite likely will not be found in Moravcik's official resumes." Some commentators, writes Schutz, may have been surprised by the emergence of Moravcik as the prime minister. After all, as late as 12 March, halfway through the "hectic" coalition negotiations, [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement] Jan Carnogursky still believed that, while it looked like [former Deputy Prime Minister] Roman Kovac might be the next Slovak prime minister, Lubomir Fogas [a prominent Party of the Democratic Left deputy] was still in the running, because "the SDL was fighting hard" for Fogas's candidacy. Nevertheless, "knowledgeable observers" were not amazed when Moravcik was finally chosen as the consensus appointee. They remembered, says Schutz, that the March 1993 governmental crisis, which resulted in the ouster of Milan Knazko as foreign minister and his replacement by Moravcik, caused certain circles, "particularly the circle around the Castle" [i.e., around President Michal Kovac], to be alarmed by Meciar's increasing authoritarianism and to begin thinking about replacing him. The choice ultimately fell on the new foreign minister, Moravcik. As an article in the weekly DOMINO EFEKT, 26 March 1993, quoted by Schutz, explained: "It seems that certain influential circles are preparing [Jozef Moravcik] to succeed Meciar. These are the same pressure and interest groups that previously sanctioned Meciar's liquidation of the federation, that supported by all available means his ascent to power, and that assisted him via the information media. Moravcik's joining the government gives him now an excellent chance to start building and then to consolidate his [political] base and offers him enough room for maneuvering until such moment when his time will come." That time, concludes Schutz,"is now." Schutz argues that it is false to claim, as Moravcik's supporters sometimes do, that he played a role in Alexander Dubcek's 1968 effort to democratize the communist system--the so-called Prague Spring. While Dubcek's actual supporters were expelled from the party, Schutz points out, Moravcik remained a party member and "did not renounce his membership until the end of January 1990." Even as the communist regime was foundering in the winter of 1989-90, Moravcik was "still trying to convince people from Public Against Violence [the post-1989 Slovak anticommunist movement] that the Communist Party represented the only road to a bright tomorrow." Schutz also notes that, "shortly before November 1989, together with the StB [Communist Secret Service] officer Igor Cibula, who today heads Slovak intelligence, [Moravcik] established the Club of the Leninist Iskra (Spark) [an allusion to the name of the newspaper published by Lenin while in exile], an association of Slovak reform communists that was tolerated by the [former] regime. Moravcik sheltered the club at the Bratislava University Law School, where he taught." It seems likely that Schutz's charges will be exploited by the Meciar forces to score points in the coming election campaign. This is indicated, for instance, by an unsigned editorial that appeared in the pro-Meciar daily REPUBLIKA on 16 March under the title "Founder of Leninist Iskra Club Becomes Prime Minister of Slovakia: Jozef Moravcik and His Developmental Turns." The editorial presents Moravcik as an ambitious and opportunistic politician with the gift of predicting and calculating the course of political developments. Moravcik is alleged to have developed and honed this gift while "the founder and leading personality of the Club of the Leninist Iskra." It was there that he learned "the methodology of calculation," a methodology focused on "the ultimate goal itself--the grabbing of power"--and driven by "the spirit of Leninist and Bolshevist methods, which had been validated by the success of the legendary October Revolution" of 1917. According to the editorial, Moravcik's interest in gaining power can be traced back through his entire political career. He is said to have made his calculated move first in the Club of Leninist Iskra, when he bet on the Communist Party's turn to reformism, then, while a member of Public Against Violence, when he sided with Meciar's "centrists," and again later, when he assisted Meciar in founding the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Allegedly, it was this propensity for calculation that motivated also his very latest move and drove him "to negotiate, behind the back of his movement [i.e. the HZDS] with President Michal Kovac and the leaders of the opposition in order to defeat the government of which he was a member." Thus, writes REPUBLIKA, "with the help and support of college-educated Marxist-Leninists from the Party of the Democratic Left [former Communist Party]," Moravcik has finally reached his goal, "which he had coveted as early as 1989, when he, humble-visaged, huddled at the Leninist circle's bonfire in [the Bratislava] Law School. His development has its logic. From the point of view of Marxist methodology, it is faultless. It is even faultless from the point of view of the power ambitions of those who have put together the current government according to the principle: Shake before use, discard after use."
