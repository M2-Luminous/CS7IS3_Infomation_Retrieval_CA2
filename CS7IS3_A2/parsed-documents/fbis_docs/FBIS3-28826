It is said that the prime minister is thinking of replacing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (head of Sakigake [Harbinger]), and State Minister for Political Reform Sadao Yamahana and other Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] cabinet members, while maintaining the existing framework of the ruling coalition parties. He will now have to obtain the consent of the ruling coalition parties. The main reason for the prime minister's decision to reshuffle the cabinet is his belief that differences of views within the cabinet have become an obstacle to the management of the administration, as seen in the decision-making process leading to the announcement of the "national welfare tax" scheme, wherein criticisms from the people made Hosokawa unable to decide on revenue sources to cover the 6-trillion-yen income tax cut, thus forcing him to leave the issue to further discussions by the ruling coalition parties. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is certain to pursue this point during Diet deliberations on the third supplementary budget beginning on 16 February. Hosokawa thus came to the conclusion that a reorganization of the cabinet would be indispensable. Furthermore, Hosokawa seems to believe that in view of the tasks facing the administration, such as early formulation of measures to reduce the trade surplus -- which he pledged at the Japan-U.S. summit talks -- and the delineation of new electoral districts with the introduction of the new electoral system incorporating both single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, and since these issues bear directly on the realignment of the political world -- which has become highly probable with the passage of the political reform laws -- it is necessary to shake up his administration in preparation for political realignment. Due to such thinking on the part of the prime minister, the focus of the reshuffle is likely to be on what will happen to Takemura, who has been reported to be in conflict with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. It seems that either he will be given a different portfolio in the cabinet, or another Sakigake member will be chosen to replace him. It is also believed that since policy differences with the SDPJ have been complicating the decisionmaking process among the ruling coalition parties -- for instance, the SDPJ's dissent during the deliberations on tax reforms -- Yamahana and the five other SDPJ cabinet members may be replaced with other SDPJ members to strengthen support for the Hosokawa administration. However, it is highly possible that Sakigake and the SDPJ's left wing will come out strongly against the prime minister's reshuffle plan. It is still somehow uncertain whether the prime minister will be able to carry out the reshuffle as planned.
