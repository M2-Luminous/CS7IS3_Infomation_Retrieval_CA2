FR940202-1-00039 FR940202-1-00014 Historic water projects, which accompanied urban and agricultural growth, also had a negative effect on California red-legged frogs. Construction of reservoirs, such as Lake Oroville, Whiskeytown Reservoir, Don Pedro Reservoir, Lake Berryessa, San Luis Reservoir, Lake Silverwood, Lake Piru, Pyramid Lake, and Lower Otay Lake, directly eliminated California red-legged frog habitat or fragmented remaining aggregations (Jennings et al. 1992). Reservoirs also typically are stocked with exotic species of fish and the introduced bullfrog ( Rana catesbeiana ). These species often expand into previously isolated California red-legged frog habitat. The timing and duration of water releases from reservoirs, particularly on the central California coast, can render a stream unsuitable for California red-legged frog production (M. Jennings, in litt ., 1993) or maintain aggregations of exotic predators in downstream areas that would normally be dry in summer (S. Sweet, in litt ., 1993). Hayes and Jennings (1988) found that California red-legged frogs generally were extirpated from a drainage 1 to 5 years after filling of a reservoir. See Factor C below for further discussion of exotic predators. A variety of proposed water projects threaten remaining California red-legged frog populations. Construction of major reservoirs is proposed on Los Banos Creek (Merced County), with Orestimba Creek (Stanislaus County) as an alternative reservoir site (California Department of Water Resources and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 1990), and on Kellogg Creek (Contra Costa County) (Contra Costa Water District 1993). These sites represent three of six sites remaining in the Central Valley hydrographic basin with known or potential aggregations of California red-legged frogs. On the Salinas River on the central coast, raising the height of Salinas Dam (Santa Margarita Lake) is proposed in San Luis Obispo County. Reservoir construction at this site may allow exotic predators access to formerly secure aggregations of California red-legged frogs isolated in upper portions of the watershed (L. Hunt, in litt ., 1993). Other large reservoir projects proposed in California red-legged frog habitat include the Upper Nacimiento River Project and Arroyo Seco Dam Project in Monterey County. In Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, proposed dams on the Santa Ynez River, Sisquoc River, and Sespe Creek also would eliminate or degrade California red-legged frog habitat (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1993). Proposed or existing water diversions, well development, or small reservoir construction projects to supply residential uses on the central coast (e.g., San Simeon, Santa Rosa, Van Gordon, Villa, San Luis Obispo, Chorro, Pico, and Little Pico Creeks, Arroyo del Puerta, and Arroyo Laguna in San Luis Obispo County; the Carmel and Salinas River drainage basins in Monterey County; Canada de Refugio in Santa Barbara County) reduce instream flows and, when combined with drought, degrade or eliminate riparian habitat and create stressful conditions for California red-legged frogs. See Factor E below for additional discussion of the effects of drought. Small reservoirs also serve as a source of exotic fishes and bullfrogs (G. Rathbun and M. Jennings, in litt., 1993). The proposed coastal branch of the State Water Project likely would result in a number of adverse effects to California red-legged frogs in many of the 24 areas receiving State water, including (1) altered water regimes in existing and any proposed delivery facilities of individual water districts, (2) spills, leaks, malfunctions, and operational errors that lead to introduction of exotic predators into isolated stream segments currently occupied by California red-legged frogs, and (3) indirect effects associated with expanded urbanization. Storm damage repair and flood control maintenance of streams is a widespread and ongoing threat to California red-legged frogs. Routine flood control maintenance includes vegetation removal, herbicide spraying, shaping of banks to control erosion, and desilting of the creek. All of these activities degrade California red-legged frog habitat. In San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties, maintenance work is planned for 14 and 11 drainages, respectively. All 25 drainages are known to be inhabited by California red-legged frogs. In Santa Barbara County, a larger channel maintenance project is proposed for a 4.5-mile stretch of the Santa Ynez River near Lompoc and a 10-mile segment of San Antonio Creek, both of which support California red-legged frog habitat. Channel maintenance at San Francisco International Airport threatens one of the three largest remaining aggregations of this subspecies. Regular road maintenance activities involving grading in or adjacent to California red-legged frog habitat can result in increased siltation in the stream. If this siltation occurs during the breeding season, asphyxiation of eggs and small California red-legged frog larvae can result. On the upper Santa Ynez River and Sespe Creek in Los Padres National Forest, Sweet (pers. comm., 1993) observed California red-legged frog egg masses smothered with silt.
