According to reliable sources, Pavel Grachev has approved a draft order abolishing the military press. Officially the reason for closing army publications is financial difficulties. According to another version, however, the main reason lies in Grachev's unhappiness over the lukewarm attitude by the subordinated press to his own personality, especially in the past few months.
