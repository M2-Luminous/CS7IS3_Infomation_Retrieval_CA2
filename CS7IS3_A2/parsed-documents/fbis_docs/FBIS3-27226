The "Regulations (Trial Implementation) on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and Political Education in Grass-Roots Units" were laid down according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of army building in the new period and the relevant guidelines laid down by the Central Military Commission and on the basis of inheriting the fine tradition of our Army's political and ideological education and of summing up our Army's reform experience in political education. Opinions had been widely solicited in the whole Army before the document was issued to units at the lower levels. The document put forward suggestions for improvement and made concrete stipulations on the guiding principles, the content of education, the method of organization and implementation, the system and form of education, and other issues related to ideological and political education in the grass-roots units. Compared with past practices, these regulations realize the spirit of being essential and effective in the content of education and set up, in a relatively stable manner, six branches of study, specifically, the study of the basic party line, the study of current affairs and policies, the study of our Army's glorious tradition and patriotism, the study of the revolutionary soldiers' outlook on life and values, the study of legal knowledge, and the study of circumstances and combat readiness, with each focusing on key points in a concise manner. As far as the goals of education are concerned, attention is paid to different categories of people at different levels; the ideological education of cadres at the grass-roots level is standardized; and different demands are set for new soldiers, veterans, and volunteers. As far as the system and method of education is are concerned, the emphasis is on doing well the three links of preparatory educational meetings, preparing lessons and giving lectures, and organizing class discussions. Units are being asked to set up systems for an educational week, for listening to and watching the news, for reading newspapers and writing reports on current affairs and policies, for taking attendance, for giving supplementary lessons and evaluations, and for inspection and supervision. Moreover, nine patterns and methods of education are summarized: classroom education, individual education, random education, mass self-education, ways to integrate army units with families and society, ways to apply education to cultural life in the barracks, the application of modernized education, ways to publicize typical examples, and ways to create a good educational environment. The document stressed that every ideological and political education activity in the grass-roots units must be close to reality and must strive for practical results. In organizing and conducting educational activities, it is necessary to be familiar with the objects of education; to conduct ideological and political education in military training and various practical activities; to strengthen behavioral guidance so as to cultivate, learn, and manifest decent behavior through education; and to strive to display each unit's distinctive features in light of its own characteristics so as to improve the effect of education and to vigorously guard against formalism. The document made explicit demands on the task of strengthening the administration of ideological and political education in grass-roots units: First, when making arrangements for educational activities, units at all levels must give full consideration to grass-roots units' receptivity, take notice of unforeseen circumstances, and refrain from increasing burdens at each level; second, propaganda departments are in charge of various educational activities; third, brigades and regiments must coordinate the activities, ensuring that they are proceeded in a normal and orderly manner and that the prescribed educational tasks are fulfilled. The document also urged various units to accomplish the work of protecting the service of ideological and political education in grass-roots units and to conscientiously strengthen the building of the contingent of teachers and the construction of teaching facilities.
