FR940526-2-00010 FR940526-2-00006 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement and Public Hearings for the Proposed Piñon Pine Power Project at Tracy Power Station, Nevada AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of availability of draft environmental impact statement (draft statement) and notice of public hearings on the draft. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (Department) announces the availability of the Piñon Pine Power Project Draft Statement (EIS&hyph;0215), prepared to assess the environmental effects of the design, construction, and operation of the proposed Piñon Pine Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Project, a 104-Megawatt-electric coal-fired power generating facility at Tracy Power Station, 17 miles east of Reno, Nevada. As one of the proposals selected under Round IV of the Clean Coal Technology Program, the Piñon Pine Power Project would demonstrate an innovative air-blown, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle technology. This technology, when compared to conventional coal burning technologies, would result in a cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen, and particles from a 104-Megawatt-electric coal-fired (800-ton-per-day) power plant. The proposed action is the cost-shared Federal funding of the project by the Department of approximately $135 million (about 50 percent of the total cost of approximately $270 million). The document assesses the long-term reliability, maintainability, and environmental impacts of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle technology at a utility scale and setting. The technologies to be demonstrated include a KRW Energy Systems Inc., pressurized, fluidized-bed gasifier with in-bed limestone desulfurization and hot-gas clean-up processes, including an external regenerable desulfurization system using zinc-based sorbents and fine particle filters. DATES: The Department invites comments on the Draft Statement from all interested parties. Written comments or suggestions regarding the adequacy, accuracy, and completeness of the Draft Statement will be considered in preparing the Final Environmental Impact Statement (Final Statement) and should be received by July 23, 1994. Written comments received after that date will be considered to the degree practicable. The Department will also hold three public hearings at which agencies, organizations, and the general public are invited to present oral comments or suggestions on the Draft Statement. Locations, dates, and times for the public hearings are provided in the sections of this notice entitled ``PUBLIC HEARINGS.'' Written and oral comments will be given equal weight and will be considered in preparing the Final Statement. Requests for copies of the Draft Statement and/or Final Statement or questions concerning the project, should be sent to Dr. Suellen A. Van Ooteghem at the address noted below. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the Draft Statement should be received by July 23, 1994, for incorporation into the public hearing record. Oral comments will be accepted at the public hearings. Written comments, requests to speak at the hearings, or questions concerning the Piñon Pine Power Project, should be directed to: Dr. Suellen A. Van Ooteghem, Environmental Project Manager, Morgantown Energy Technology Center, 3610 Collins Ferry Road, Morgantown, WV 26507&hyph;0880, Telephone: (304) 284&hyph;5443. If you request to speak, please indicate at which hearing(s). Envelopes should be labeled ``Piñon Pine Power Project Draft EIS.'' FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For general information on the Department's Environmental Impact Statement process and other matters related to the National Environmental Policy Act, please contact: Ms. Carol M. Borgstrom, Director, Office of NEPA Oversight (EH&hyph;25), U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, Telephone: (202) 586&hyph;4600 or (800) 472&hyph;2756. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background and Need for the Proposed Action The Department proposes to provide cost-shared funding support for the design, construction, and operation of a 104-Megawatt-electric (gross) coal-fired power plant at Tracy, Nevada, to demonstrate technology. The Piñon Pine Power Project was proposed by Sierra Pacific Power Company and selected by the Department for negotiation of a Cooperative Agreement for Federal assistance by the Clean Coal Technology program. The Piñon Pine Power Project, when compared to conventional coal-fired power plant technologies, would demonstrate the cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter from a 104-Megawatt-electric coal-fired power plant using innovative Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle and hot gas cleanup technology. Following a 42-month demonstration period anticipated to conclude in August 2000, the facility would enter commercial operation. The proposed Piñon Pine Power Project would be located at Sierra Pacific Power Company's existing Tracy Power Station, a natural gas- and oil-fired 411-Megawatt-electric (estimate based on June 1994 projections) power generation facility located on a rural 724-acre plot approximately 17 miles east of Reno, Nevada. The proposed new facility would be built adjacent to these facilities. On October 23, 1989, Public Law No. 101&hyph;121, ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990,'' was signed into law. This Act, among other things, appropriated funds for the design, construction, and operation of cost-shared, clean coal projects to demonstrate the feasibility of future commercial applications of technologies capable of replacing, retrofitting or repowering existing facilities.
