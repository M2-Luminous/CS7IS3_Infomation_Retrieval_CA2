FR941019-2-00169 FR941019-2-00090 OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE [Docket No. 301&hyph;87] Termination of Section 301 Action and Request for Public Comment: Canadian Exports of Softwood Lumber AGENCY: Office of the United States Trade Representative. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has determined to terminate action taken under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on certain entries of softwood lumber products from Canada. The USTR is taking this action in light of the completion of binational panel proceedings under Chapter 19 of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement concerning countervailing duty (CVD) determinations involving Canadian softwood lumber. During these proceedings, the binational panel directed the Department of Commerce to determine that imports of softwood lumber did not receive countervailable subsidies. As a result of the termination of the Section 301 action, the Customs Service will: cease the extension of liquidation that was ordered pursuant to Section 301 on softwood lumber from Canada that entered from October 4, 1991 to March 12, 1992; de-obligate bonds collected on those entries pursuant to Section 301; and assess no Section 301 duties on those entries. ADDRESSES: Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20506. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Weiss, Deputy Assistant United States Trade Representative for North American Affairs, (202) 395&hyph;3412; or William Kane, Assistant General Counsel, (202) 395&hyph;6800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 15, 1986, the United States and Canada concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which, among other things, Canada agreed to impose a 15 percent export charge on certain softwood lumber products exported to the United States. On September 3, 1991, Canada announced that it would unilaterally terminate the MOU in 30 days. In response, on October 4, 1991, Commerce announced that it would self-initiate a CVD investigation on softwood lumber from Canada. On the same date, USTR initiated an investigation under section 301, and determined under section 301(b) that Canada's acts, policies and practices in terminating the MOU were unreasonable and burdened or restricted U.S. commerce. 56 Fed. Reg. 50738 (October 8, 1991). USTR further determined that action was appropriate pursuant to section 304 to restore and maintain the status quo ante pending issuance of a preliminary CVD determination, and, if warranted, to impose duties to offset the effects of any subsidies found in the investigation. USTR directed the Customs Service, inter alia, to: (1) impose bonding requirements on certain softwood lumber from Canada entering between October 4, 1991 and the date of Commerce's preliminary CVD determination; (2) withhold or extend, as appropriate, liquidation of all such entries of softwood lumber until the imposition of duties; and (3) collect Section 301 duties at the rate specified in the MOU or the rate of subsidy found in the final Commerce CVD determination, whichever was lower. Id. USTR later issued an amended notice of initiation containing certain technical corrections to its original notice. 56 Fed. Reg. 58944 (Nov. 22, 1991). On March 12, 1992, Commerce published its preliminary CVD determination. On May 28, 1992, Commerce published its final CVD determination, and determined an estimated subsidy rate of 6.51 per cent ad valorem. Both the domestic industry and affected Canadian parties appealed the final determination to binational panels established pursuant to Chapter 19 of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA). As a result, on September 28, 1992, USTR published notice of a modification of the Section 301 action. 57 Fed. Reg. 44609 (Sept. 28, 1992). USTR directed Customs to inform importers that they may request extension of liquidation on entries covered by the Section 301 action, and that ``any entries extended pursuant to such a request will be assessed 301 duties in accordance with the outcome of chapter 19 proceedings ( i.e., at the lower of the applicable MOU rate or the Commerce rate at the conclusion of chapter 19 proceedings).'' Id. at 44610. On May 6, 1993, the binational panel remanded the CVD determination to Commerce to reexamine certain of its findings. On September 17, 1993, Commerce responded by issuing a remand determination, finding a subsidy rate of 11.54 per cent ad valorem.
