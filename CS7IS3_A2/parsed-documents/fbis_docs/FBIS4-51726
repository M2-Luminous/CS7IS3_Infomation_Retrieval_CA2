Noting that Kim Chi-hyon, the first-born daughter of Kim Pyong- chu, an unconverted prisoner who died a few years ago after his release from prison, is a righteous-minded girl who attended on Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the Korean People's Army, when he was in a critical condition after a cerebral haemorrhage at the Pusan University Hospital, the news analyst says: She had to have her ribs cut off in an operation for T.B. pyothorax at the hospital. Now, she is in a very critical condition, the inflammation spreading to the region of vertebrae. She is aware that even a moment's suspension of treatment will endanger her life. Yet, she is intending to leave the hospital. She has to take care of three younger brother and sisters without anyone to rely on, and is unable to pay the daily increasing charges for hospitalization and operation. We, as fellow countrymen, can never overlook the miserable situation of the 29-year-old fragile girl who is suffering from both a serious disease and mental ailments. We deem it our bounden duty and obligation to fetch them to the northern half of the country at an early date to give medical treatment and take care of their life. At present, a state of acute confrontation has been created between the North and the South. But that must not be an obstacle to the transfer of Kim Chi-hyon to the North. A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the South Korean Red Cross must take an appropriate step at an early date to ensure that Kim Chi-hyon and her three brother and sisters receive medical treatment and be granted protection for their life in the northern half of the country, as proposed by the North.
