[passage omitted] Some members held that laws related to the Law on the Management of Urban Real Estate, such as the Land Administration Law, should also be formulated as quickly as possible. Some members said that, in order to prevent disputes over trifles among various real estate administrative departments, it is necessary to let one department assume unified management. In examining the draft decision on punishing criminals who violate copyrights, some members said that, without clear and specific laws and regulations, the people's court will find it difficult to make punitive judgments. They eagerly hoped that the decision could be adopted after revision as quickly as possible. The members today also examined the Draft Law on Judges and the Draft Law on Procurators.
