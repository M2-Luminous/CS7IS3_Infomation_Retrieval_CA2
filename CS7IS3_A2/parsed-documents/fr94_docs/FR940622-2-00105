OPM has been evaluating TAPS as an NPR reinvention laboratory project. TAPS will greatly expedite the application process by utilizing the latest in telephone and microcomputer technology. Through TAPS, applicants will be able to apply directly over the telephone for Federal employment. They will be instructed to provide answers to questions using a combination of voice recordings and the keys of a touch-tone telephone. The questions cover minimum qualification requirements, that is, education and/or experience, citizenship, job interest, etc. These responses will be transcribed and computer-rated within a day. The names of applicants who are rated eligible will be placed immediately on a referral list for consideration when Federal agencies have jobs to fill. Currently, Professional Nurse and Border Patrol Agent positions are operating under TAPS. A representative script (Nurse) of the TAPS application is appended to this notice.
