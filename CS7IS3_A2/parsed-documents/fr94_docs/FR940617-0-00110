FR940617-0-00110 FR940617-0-00026 Friday June 17, 1994 Part II Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Parts 9 and 89 Determination of Significance for Nonroad Sources and Emission Standards for New Nonroad Compression-Ignition Engine At or Above 37 Kilowatts; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 116␣/␣Friday, June 17, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 9 and 89 [FRL&hyph;4893&hyph;8] RIN 2060&hyph;AD54 Control of Air Pollution; Determination of Significance for Nonroad Sources and Emission Standards for New Nonroad Compression-Ignition Engines At or Above 37 Kilowatts AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Section 213 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a determination of the significance of the contribution of nonroad sources to nonattainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) in more than one nonattainment area. If the Agency makes a positive determination of significance, it must then promulgate regulations that will result in reductions in emissions from nonroad sources. In today's action, EPA is finalizing the determination of significance of emissions from nonroad engines. EPA is also promulgating standards for carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) and smoke emissions from large nonroad compression-ignition (CI) engines at or above 37 kilowatts (kW) in power, with exclusions for certain types of engines. The NO X standard is expected to reduce average per unit NO X emissions from affected engines by 27 percent before the year 2010, with a 37 percent reduction by the year 2025. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective July 18, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 18, 1994. The information collection requirements contained in 40 CFR 89.114&hyph;96 through 89.120&hyph;96, 89.122&hyph;96 through 89.127&hyph;96, 89.129&hyph;96, 89.203&hyph;96 through 89.207&hyph;96, 89.209&hyph;96 through 89.211&hyph;96, 89.304&hyph;96 through 89.331&hyph;96, and 89.404&hyph;96 through 89.424&hyph;96 have not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and are not effective until OMB has approved them. A technical amendment will be published in the Federal Register when OMB has approved the information collection requirements. ADDRESSES: Materials relevant to this final rule are contained in Docket No. A&hyph;91&hyph;24 and A&hyph;91&hyph;18, located at the Air Docket, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, and may be reviewed in room M&hyph;1500 from 8 a.m. until noon and from 1:30 p.m until 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Electronic Availability The preamble, regulatory language and regulatory support document are available electronically on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN). TTN is an electronic bulletin board system (BBS) operated by EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. Users are able to access and download TTN files on their first call. After logging onto TTN BBS, to navigate through the BBS to the files of interest, the user must enter the appropriate command at each of a series of menus. The steps required to access information on this rulemaking are listed below. The service is free of charge, except for the cost of the phone call.
