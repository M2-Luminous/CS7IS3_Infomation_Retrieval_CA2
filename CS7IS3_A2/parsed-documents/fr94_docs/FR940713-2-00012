FR940713-2-00012 FR940713-2-00008 Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center; Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Grant Award to the University of Arizona. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) under criteria (a), that it intends to award a noncompetitive financial assistance (Grant) to the University of Arizona. This award is for continuation of their research effort entitled ``Regeneration of FGD Waste Liquors: Production of Ammonium and Postassium Sulfate Mixed Fertilizer''. ADDRESSES: Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Division, P.O. Box 10940, MS 921&hyph;118, Pittsburgh, PA 15236. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cynthia Y. Mitchell, Contract Specialist (412) 892&hyph;4862. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Grant Number: DE&hyph;FG22&hyph;93PC92582 Title of Research Effort ``Regeneration of FGD Waste Liquors: Production of Ammonium and Potassium Sulfate Mixed Fertilizer.'' Awardee: University of Arizona. Term of Assistance Effort: Twelve (12) months. Grant Estimated Total Value: $73,899. Objective: Based upon the authority of 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), the objective of this grant is for Arizona University to continue research in the regeneration process for treating the waste scrubbing liquor produced by a thiosorbic lime SO pilot tests and to produce an ammonia and potassium sulfate mixed fertilizer product. This process involves the precipitation of the N&hyph;S compounds followed by their hydrolysis. The magnesium wet scrubbing process is presently being developed for the simultaneous removal of SO&hyph;2 and NO x from the flue gas produced by a coal-fired power plant. In the course of scrubbing, nitrogen-sulfur (N&hyph;S) compounds accumulate and degrade the scrubbing liquor. The primary objective of this project is to develop a regeneration process through which the N&hyph;S compounds in the scrubbing liquors are removed and then converted to a marketable byproduct. The proposed work is considered to be relevant to the DOE mission in that the program will provide a mechanism for communication, interaction and research between DOE and Arizona University in the continuous process for the regeneration of waste scrubber liquors from the combined SO x &hyph;NO x scrubbing systems. The development of this technology would assist utilities in complying with the 1990 Clean Air Act, while still encouraging and enhancing the use of coal, which is a major goal of the DOE Flue Gas Cleanup program.
