That is why the government is always trying to keep Indonesian taxes at a level which is attractive to foreign and domestic investors. These were the statements made by Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad at the dedication of the Tax Service Office in Batam on Saturday (23 April). "We need investments because investments can create the 11 million jobs which we have targeted up to the end of PELITA [Five-Year Development Plan] VI," he asserted. He reminded the audience that there are two dependable sources of funding for the continuation of national development, i.e., raising tax revenues and seeking increased private investment. Both of these play an increasingly important role given the fact that the price of oil has continued to fall and that the market is saturated. The deregulation package recently launched by the government has caused a continued drop in state revenues from excises and import duties. "Some import goods have been given relief and even freedom from import duties in order to support export-oriented industries," he added. For that reason, tax revenues have assumed an increasingly important role strategically. Safeguarding tax revenues is no longer just the business of the Directorate General of Tax or the Department of Finance, but has become a problem for the whole nation and state in order to continue our national development. "We are not going to play games with taxes. We are past the time when we can play games or engage in shady deals with the tax officials, and stealing tax revenues, such as occurred in Surabaya and Tangerang, will no longer be tolerated," he asserted. He acknowledged that almost every province is aware of the need to pay taxes. Tax obligation is required in order to comply with tax regulations and laws. On the other hand, tax officials should not overdo it but should provide service which is proper and humane in accordance with existing provisions of the law. Tax Relief On this occasion, the Governor of Riau Soeripto requested tax relief for local businesses in the Batam region so that they could play a role in the Batam Federated Region. "If foreign companies can be free from taxes, why can't they [local companies] be given tax relief?" he asked, when he was confirmed [as published] by reporters. The governor said that businesses in the Batam region, such as those on Bintan Island and Balai Karimun Cape, could actually supply quartz sand or food to take part in building up Batam. However, up to now the economic costs have been considered too high because there have been too many fees involved. "Up to now they have tended to ship their products to Singapore, even though Batam also needs them," he asserted. Governor Soeripto acknowledged that he had discussed the request for tax relief with the central government, but that no decision had been reached yet. The governor was unwilling to give a detailed explanation about the types of fees which local companies in the federated region have to pay. In his report, the Governor of Riau stated that Riau's economic growth averaged 9.25 percent a year and had taken in 11.13 trillion rupiahs in investments during PELITA V. This was due to industry, mining, agriculture, services and other enterprises in Riau. Tax revenues in Riau reached 369.6 billion rupiahs, an increase of 262 percent over the previous year. Tax revenues in Batam reached 84.7 billion rupiahs, and are expected to reach more than 100 billion rupiahs at the beginning of REPELITA VI, in line with economic growth in that federated region.
