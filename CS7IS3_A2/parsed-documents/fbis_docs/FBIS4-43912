The United Nations would have to vote a request for peace keeping forces under the command of the Western European Union [WEU] or of NATO, Martino said. And to guarantee that force's effectiveness, it would have to be based on an accord among the national forces being deployed, the Foreign Minister added. "Under those conditions we may even consider sending troops, but if those conditions do not hold, we will end up with a unilateral initiative," Martino added. The decision taken Monday [20 June] by the WEU in Brussels to send French troops backed by "logistical support" on the part of Great Britain, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg "is a move in the right direction," the Foreign Minister said. "It involves international coordination, which gives us the guarantee this is not a unilateral initiative but a multilateral effort that puts the emphasis on the humanitarian aspect of the mission," he told reporters, adding he thought it was possible the WEU-sponsored mission "could put an end to the massacres." "What we were worried about was a unilateral move that would have had a neocolonialist flavor and would have aggravated rather than reduced tensions." The Italian government had urged the broadest possible participation among WEU nations. [passage omitted]
