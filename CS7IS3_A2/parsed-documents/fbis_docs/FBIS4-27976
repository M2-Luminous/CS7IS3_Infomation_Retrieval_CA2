(Pak Yong-nam), director of North Korea's Atomic Energy General Department, sent a message to IAEA Director General Hans Blix last night in which he said it was an unjust act to North Korea for the IAEA to reach the hasty conclusion that it would be impossible to analyze samples from nuclear fuel rods because it was still possible. It is analyzed that North Korea sent such a message as a part of its diplomatic strategy aimed at lessening the pressure on it. In the event that the IAEA Board of Governors takes a hard-line measure against North Korea, it seems possible that North Korea will take some tough measures, including its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The IAEA Board of Governors will map out countermeasures tomorrow afternoon after discussing the issue of North Korea's violation of the nuclear agreement as an isolated agenda item.
