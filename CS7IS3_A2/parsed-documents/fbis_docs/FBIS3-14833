So, the U.S. should not be hypocritical, a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax on Friday, commenting on the United States' attempts to attach special importance to the case of the Ames couple, arrested for charges of espionage in favor of Moscow. To quote this diplomat, "if Americans have any queries about specific details, representatives of the Russian and American special services should discuss them in the spirit of our friendly relations." The Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) has neither confirmed nor denied the reports that representatives of the CIA and the EIS have met in Moscow to discuss the Ames affair. "We do not comment on such information," a representatives of the FIS's press bureau told Interfax. He expressed surprise about the hullabaloo raised in the U.S. in connection with the Ames affair. "We are not doing anything in the U.S. that the U.S. is not doing in Russia," he said. "Americans are not surprised that their nearest associates -- Britain and France -- collect information in the U.S. as well, friendship and the secret service are two seperate things," he said. He confirmed that Russian competent bodies had collected compromising information about American diplomats' and Russian citizens' collaboration with the American secret services. He gave to understand that "in a certain situation Moscow might make use of this material," but expressed hope that things would not come to that. Asked about the FIS's possible reaction to the U.S. administration's decision to oust the Russian diplomats who worked with the Ames couple, he said that this is not the FIS's business. Such decisions are taken at a high political level - by the president or government - and are implemented through the Foreign Ministry. The FIS has nothing to do with this, he added.
