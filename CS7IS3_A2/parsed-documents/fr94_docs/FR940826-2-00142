FR940826-2-00142 FR940826-2-00071 The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof. The CHX proposal is designed to achieve a more coherent governance structure while maintaining fair representation of Exchange constituencies and protecting investors and the public interest. Accelerated approval thereof will allow these benefits to be realized as soon as possible. In addition, the proposed rule change was published in the Federal Register for the full statutory period and no comments were received on any aspect of the proposal. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 27 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;94&hyph;15), including Amendment No. 1, is approved on an accelerated basis. 27 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
