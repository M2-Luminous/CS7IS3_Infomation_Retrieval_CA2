FR940216-0-00122 FR940216-0-00010 EPA appreciates this dilemma faced by parties downstream of a refiner achieving compliance on average. However, EPA believes both that the requirements that blenders be held potentially liable for selling averaged gasoline that fails to meet the averaged standard is necessary and that adequate safeguards are available. Potential liability is necessary to effectively prevent the sale and distribution of non-complying product by downstream parties which possess any opportunity to prevent the product from being released into the environment. For example, if a carrier-oxygenate blender receives instructions to add less than 2.00 weight percent oxygen to RBOB (the per-gallon oxygen standard), the carrier should obtain the assurance of the product owner, in writing if possible, that the reformulated gasoline being produced meets the oxygen standard on average. If a violation of the average oxygen standard occurs involving gasoline produced by the carrier-oxygenate blender, and the carrier-oxygenate blender can demonstrate that it made this inquiry in good faith and received an appropriate assurance, EPA will exercise its enforcement discretion and not hold the carrier-oxygen blender liable for the standard violation unless the carrier knew, or should have known, the oxygen standard would not be met on average. This type of inquiry and assurance would be no defense for oxygenate blended outside the per-gallon minimum/maximum standard, however. I. Prohibitions, Liabilities and Defenses 1. Prohibitions The final rule contains certain prohibitions that apply to all parties in the gasoline distribution network, that address the per-gallon minimum and maximum standards for reformulated gasoline and the restrictions related to the time and place of use for reformulated gasoline. Also prohibited for every party are, inter alia, the addition of oxygenate to reformulated gasoline (except reformulated gasoline that is designated for use in an oxygenated fuels program during the oxygenated fuels control period); the combining of reformulated gasoline produced using ethanol with reformulated gasoline produced using another oxygenate during the period May 1 through September 15; and (during 1995 through 1997) the combining of reformulated gasolines or RBOBs subject to complex model standards unless the constituent reformulated gasolines or RBOBs have identical baselines. The final rule also prohibits all parties, other than retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers, from combining reformulated gasoline or RBOB subject to simple model standards with reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is subject to complex model standards during 1995 through 1997. The rational for these prohibitions are discussed separately in the preamble sections dealing with the specific topics which result in the prohibitions. EPA received comments on its proposal to prohibit any party from transporting, storing, dispensing, selling, or supplying reformulated gasoline that does not meet a reformulated gasoline certification. The commenters were concerned that only gasoline that meets all reformulated gasoline standards would be ``certified,'' and that, as a result of averaging, parties downstream of the refinery would have no way of knowing if a particular batch of gasoline was produced to meet standards. EPA agrees with this comment, and has modified the final rule to limit the downstream prohibition involving reformulated gasoline properties to the per-gallon minimum and maximum standards that apply to all reformulated gasoline, regardless of whether the gasoline is produced to the per-gallon or average standards. 61 As a result, downstream parties may determine if any particular gasoline batch meets the per-gallon minimums and maximums through sampling and testing. Moreover, EPA inspections conducted downstream of the refinery/importer will monitor compliance with the per-gallon minimums and maximums, and not compliance with the standards that apply to refiners and importers. 61 For example, the refiner/importer benzene standard is 1.00 volume percent if met on a per-gallon basis, or 0.95 volume percent if met on average with a 1.30 volume percent per-gallon maximum. As a result, no gallon of gasoline may have a benzene content greater than 1.30 volume percent, regardless of whether the gasoline is produced or imported to the per-gallon or average standard. This 1.30 benzene maximum thus may be enforced against downstream parties. EPA's proposal would also prohibit refiners and importers from producing or importing reformulated gasoline that does not meet reformulated gasoline standards. Several commenters observed that the production alone of reformulated gasoline or RBOB that fails to meet required standards does not cause environmental harm, because the product may be corrected before it leaves the refinery. EPA generally agrees with this comment, and has adjusted the regulatory language to clarify that the prohibition against the production of reformulated gasoline that fails to meet standards applies only to gasoline that is intended for sale or use. During the course of any inspection at a refinery or import facility, EPA will rely on the documentation used by a refiner or importer to determine if any particular gasoline is ``finished'' and therefore is intended for sale or use, or is an ``unfinished'' product for which the refiner or importer intends additional blending. Accordingly, the final rule prohibits the manufacture, sale, offering for sale, distribution, dispensing, supplying offering for supply, transporting or causing the transportation by refiners and importers of finished gasoline ``intended'' for sale or use where such gasoline fails to meet reformulated gasoline standards. This approach is consistent with EPA's approach under the Lead Phasedown, Fuel Volatility and Diesel Desulfurization Programs. 2. Liabilities a. General. The final rule provides that where the gasoline contained in a storage tank at any facility owned, leased, operated, controlled or supervised by any refiner, importer, oxygenate blender, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer, or wholesale purchaser-consumer is found in violation of the prohibitions, most parties involved in the chain of distribution upstream of the facility found in violation are presumed liable for the violation.
