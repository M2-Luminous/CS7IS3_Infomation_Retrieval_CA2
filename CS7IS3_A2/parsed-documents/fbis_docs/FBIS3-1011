The slogan for this afternoon's sit-in was the "immediate and unconditional release of our colleague." In a motion read during the sit-in, the finance workers said they will pursue their action until they obtain the "unconditional release" of their colleague. A Finance Ministry workers' union executive committee member spoke to the media about the conditions of arrest of their colleague, noting in particular that "he was transferred from Kalavi to the Territorial Brigade Department and was not allowed any contacts." The brigade approached the human rights committee, which confirmed that the accused "was notably arrested in connection with the 10-million-CFA franc case" and that the committee was working on the case. The union leader further said: "We are mainly fighting for the security of workers."
