Ossetia, Ingushetia LD1904203794 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1526 GMT 19 Apr 94 LD1904203794 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Russian BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- The fact that the leaders of North Ossetia and Ingushetia have sat down at the conference table is no small contribution of the Russian interior troops who are carrying out peacekeeping functions in the region, their commander, Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov believes. He was meeting Russian and foreign journalists at a briefing at the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry today. Kulikov noted that the presence of the interior troops in the emergency situation zone has not only stabilized but also, to a considerable extent, improved the crime situation. The number of people who have been killed in North Ossetia and Ingushetia is substantially fewer than in neighboring republics and oblasts with the same population, and the crime level is an average of 20 percent less. Describing the activities of the troops in the hot spot, General Kulikov cited the following figures: Last year troop details confiscated over 600 fire arms, about 30,000 pieces of ammunition, hundreds of grenades and explosives, 16 artillery systems and grenade-throwers, and nine armored vehicles. This year seven special operations to disarm illegal formations have been carried out. The troops' catch includes 62 firearms, over 240 grenades, mines, and explosive devices, and over 20 kg of explosive substances. In the time the troops have been in the emergency situation zone over 100 special operations have been carried out in which not a single local inhabitant has been killed, Kulikov stressed. Unfortunately, he went on, the servicemen are constantly risking their lives in fulfilling combat and service tasks in the region. Last year, the temporary quarters of units and sub-units and also troop details were subjected to shelling and armed attacks on 126 occasions, as a result of which seven people were killed and 133 wounded. This year there have already been over 20 attacks and shellings. There have been no losses among the men of the interior troops.
