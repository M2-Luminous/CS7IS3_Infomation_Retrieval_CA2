He told the commission supervising compliance with the legislation at its meeting in Tashkent that posters in Russian were still on display in many parts of Uzbekistan. He criticized the ministries and agencies which had not used the Uzbek language in their correspondence. Mutalov attributed this to the want of national pride and patriotism in the mentality of certain officials. Under the legislation adopted in 1990 only the Uzbek is the national language while the Russian is regarded as the language of ethnic communication. People of over 100 nationalities reside in Uzbekistan.
