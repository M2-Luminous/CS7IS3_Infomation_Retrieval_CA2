After all, just before the unification of the Democratic Union [UD] and the Liberal Democratic Congress [KLD], some people said that a union with the Liberals would cause the UD to shift to the right. [Kuron] When discussing the position of various political groups on the left and right sides of the Polish political stage, we must first determine where the front and back of that stage are placed. That is why I do not use the left-right criterion for defining political positions. For me, the basis for such a definition is a given group's attitude to the tenets of the market economy and to public expectations and ambitions. As a result of the transformations that have taken place in the country to date, two camps have emerged, which can be designated, in jest, as the friends of the market and the friends of the people. UD was characterized by considerable sensitivity to social issues, while the KLD attracted a large number of pragmatists who understood very well that no one can introduce free market principles against the wishes of the population. The unification itself could, of course, lead to a reinforcement of promarket sympathies and a weakening of social concerns. In other words, friends of the market will gain domination over friends of the people. This can happen, but it is not inevitable that it will happen. [Sondej] Are you not afraid that the Union of Freedom has lost a proportion of its electorate, the one hailing from UD, and that, consequently, competition for councillors' seats in the forthcoming local government elections will end in a failure for your new party? [Kuron] I believe that the unification itself will not have affected our chances too strongly. Electoral coalitions were formed in individual parishes prior to the UD-KLD fusion. What is more, in some parishes the Liberals would not have gone to the polls alongside the UD activists in any case. Certainly the change of the party's name will to some extent do harm to our chances in the election. It is as if, immediately after a major promotion campaign to advertise the "Mazowszanka" mineral water, I were to change its name to "Warszawianka." Nevertheless, at the local level, the majority of contending parties have adopted their own names in the elections, and the Union of Freedom name and logo will not influence them in any decisive way. Even so, we must always calculate which move will be more advantageous. Politicians must be aware of the possibility that, even if their vision gains acceptance, they may still lose the elections. We must recognize this possibility: It is the fundamental duty of every person who chooses to be involved in politics. [Sondej] But you yourself decided not to put down your name as a candidate for a position in the national leadership of the united party. Some members of the Union of Freedom leadership team maintain that you intend to run for the presidency in the proposed 1995 election. [Kuron] Not at all! I am not interested in winning the president's seat. I want to continue to be actively involved in politics, and I have a program that will make it possible for Poland to overcome the present crisis. Consequently, I want to be prime minister. It is a natural thing for a politician who is active in the political arena to want to become prime minister: If he does not, it means that he chose the wrong profession. I have a vision of creating a kind of "politicians' roundtable" at which people committed to politics would together work out a compact on the ethical principles of their policies. Social dialogue should constitute the foundation of Polish politics. Only in that way can we accomplish the task of transformations in our country. I believe that this vision could lead me to the prime minister's position--although that is not inevitable. I will not take umbrage and go away sulking if someone else is chosen to realize my program. The president embodies the dignity of the Republic's statehood and is therefore obliged to strive for the stabilization of the political arena. He must not in any circumstances engage in pursuing active politics. [Sondej] Thank you for talking to us.
