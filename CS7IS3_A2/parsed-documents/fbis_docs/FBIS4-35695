FBIS4-35695 "drnes106_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 SYRIA Paper Reasserts Rejection of Calls for Secret Talks Paper Reasserts Rejection of Calls for Secret Talks JN3005082594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 30 May 94 JN3005082594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] In its editorial today, the newspaper TISHRIN asserts that Syria has participated in the peace process in response to a U.S. initiative stemming from specific bases and in exchange for a series of U.S. assurances on the implementation of the Security Council resolutions, the land-for-peace principle, and the achievement of a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the conflict. TISHRIN notes that, from the very beginning, Syria insisted that the bases of the Madrid conference should be clear and unequivocal because it knows well that Israel rejects peace. Syria also knows about Israel's procrastination, falsification of facts, attempts to deceive world public opinion, and expression of intentions that are the opposite of its real intentions. Yet, even these former intentions were never shown throughout more than two and a half years of the Washington talks. The paper adds: The United States made efforts and frequently sent its secretary of state to the region. However, the Israeli intransigence remained unchanged, and the Rabin government refused to withdraw from the Golan and other occupied territories, thus rejecting the implementation of the Security Council resolutions in this regard. TISHRIN demands that the United States, which committed itself to playing the role of a full and fair partner, force Israel to commit itself to implementing the Security Council's resolutions, so that the entire Golan will return to Syria and the other occupied territories will return to their Arab owners. This is because it is in the interest of the United States and the international community that international law, the principles of justice, and the UN charters prevail and that national and human rights be respected everywhere. The paper asserts that Syria continues to reject calls for secret talks, and that the Washington talks, which have continued since the Madrid conference, are the most ideal framework. Syria continues to declare its positions publicly, and the Syrian policy has only one face and one consistent position. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Syria can never be dragged into partial settlements. It does not bargain over the territories of Arab brethren, and will not sell out an iota of the pan-Arab soil.
