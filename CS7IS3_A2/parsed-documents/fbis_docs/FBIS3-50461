Ochoa Antich said: The truth is that gun running to Colombia has always occurred. On a number of occasions Colombia has informed Venezuela of the problem, and we have investigated and taken disciplinary action within the FAN [National Armed Forces] to prevent such practices. In reply to a question asked during a year-end toast at Miraflores Palace, the foreign minister said, "The amount of money Colombian guerrillas sometimes offer for Venezuelan weapons is so high that it tempts military or police personnel, but the truth is that the quantities of arms sold are very small." Ochoa Antich added: One cannot say there exists massive arms smuggling from Venezuela to Colombia. Instead, there are small sales because of a lack of control. In no way, however, does this influence the military situation in Colombia. Meanwhile, the foreign minister expressed satisfaction over the Colombian Government's decision to support antiguerrilla measures endorsed by Venezuela. Ochoa Antich said: This is what we have constantly asked from the Colombian Government -- that it take appropriate actions to ensure that attacks from its national territory against Venezuelan territory are not encouraged. Ochoa Antich also disputed information coming from Santa Fe de Bogota that says a force of 20,000 Venezuelan soldiers has been deployed along the border. Ochoa Antich said: According to what the defense minister told me, normal border reinforcement movements are under way because of security problems in the area. Anyway, in our territory we can carry out whatever movements we deem necessary without taking into account any other country.
