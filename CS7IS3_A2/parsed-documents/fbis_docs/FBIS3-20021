Greece's objections are certainly not unreasonable, even though the West will dismiss them as yet another example of Greek nationalist hysteria and paranoia. How could the deployment of 2,700 Turkish peacekeepers destabilise the Balkans, as Greece has been claiming, Western policymakers would ask. And why should Turkey's offer have been turned down considering the shortage of peacekeeping troops and the reluctance of most countries participating in UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], to send more soldiers to former Yugoslavia? Countries like Britain and France, understandably, welcomed this move because it meant they would not have to send more soldiers to the Balkans. Greece on the other hand has every right to complain. First, as Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias pointed out in his letter to the Security Council, the move went against "general principles applying in cases of sending special UN troops". These principles "are the nonparticipation of countries with some historical relation to war in the area and nonparticipation of neighbouring states," he said. Turkey might not be a neighbouring state, but it is very much part of the Balkans which it ruled, in the guise of the Ottoman empire for some 500 years, until early this century. The "historical relation" cannot be denied. And neither could the possibility of destabilisation in the Balkans; Turkey will initially send almost 3.000 soldiers into former Yugoslavia, but the number could increase substantially in the future. Then there is the Cyprus factor which has been completely ignored. It is an amazing paradox that Turkey, an occupying power for 20 years, can join a UN peacekeeping force in one of the most unstable regions in the world. This is a country whose 1974 "peace operation" in Cyprus has meant the stationing of 30 to 40 thousand troops and some 300 tanks on the island ever since. And all indications are that it has no intention whatsoever of withdrawing them. Admittedly, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for Ankara to do the same in former Yugoslavia, but that is not really the issue. The fact is, the UN Secretary-General should not have even considered the sending of Turkish troops as an option, bearing in mind the situation in Cyprus and Turkey's blatantly negative role in UN-sponsored attempts to find a settlement. This makes it quite clear that neither the Secretary-General, nor the UN Security Council consider Turkey has any responsibility for the division of Cyprus and repeated failures to achieve a settlement. Obviously such trivialities are not given a second thought by the Western powers, all of which enjoy excellent relations with Turkey, a reliable and dependable ally. In the case of former Yugoslavia, the Security Council is also trying to keep satisfied the Muslim countries, which were angered by the deployment of Orthodox Russian peacekeepers. Now, with the arrival of the Turks, there is a balance in the peacekeeping presence, at least in the eyes of the Muslim world. As for Turkey, sending troops will help it to promote itself as a country which works for peace and stability in the region, despite the increasingly brutal tactics it is using to suppress the Kurdish revolt in the southeast and the continuing occupation of Cyprus. As one foreign ministry official in Ankara gloated yesterday regarding the sending of troops to former Yugoslavia: "We're very pleased with this. Yet another confirmation of Turkey's position as a country which works for peace and stability in the region."
