Russia Ready To Discuss Crimean Issue at the UN"] [Text] Russia's head of government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and his first deputy, Oleg Soskovets, proposed to Ukrainian acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy that talks on the Black Sea Fleet and the status of Crimea be continued today. Earlier it was expected that the talks would end on Monday [23 May]. However, according to information received by SEGODNYA, the need arose during the meeting for Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov to attend the talks; yesterday afternoon he flew to Moscow. On Monday, Mr. Chernomyrdin suggested during the meeting that his Ukrainian counterpart himself outline the range of problems to be discussed. Yefim Zvyagilskiy named as two priority matters the split of the Black Sea Fleet and the basing of the Russian part of the fleet. The official talks were preceded by a one-hour private meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian prime ministers. Russia "does not object" to a consideration of the Crimean issue by the United Nations, Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian Foreign Minister, said after Mr. Kozyrev's meeting with his British counterpart, Douglas Hurd. Meanwhile, presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS that "the ratcheting up of tensions in Crimea is advantageous only to irresponsible politicians in Ukraine who would like to exploit an emergency situation in the region to postpone presidential elections and to hold on to power." * * * Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of Crimea, said in a conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent that at a time of inflation Kiev has given "yet another batch of newly printed money" to all regions except Crimea. This amounts to an economic blockade, which began after they stopped giving credits for the peninsula's agriculture. "It seems natural to us that Russia, not an overseas power, should assume the function of a mediator," he emphasized. In the meantime, a pro-Kiev organization, the Civil Council of Crimea, which calls itself an opposition parliament, held a constituent conference in Crimea while talks were under way in Russia. The council's constituent documents say that "groups of citizens will select persons loyal to Ukraine from among members of political organizations." The opposition parliament plans "to counter separatism and to take efforts to protect and uphold the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine."
