He spoke at a meeting of the public chamber under the Russian president. The public chamber discussed the implementation of the treaty, signed by 863 representatives of power structures, regions, parties and public organisations. Filatov believes at the same time that it is too early for democratically-minded reformers to relax in conditions of relative political stability. In his opinion, "a period of an easy-term credit of confidence for the reformers is over." He urged the like-minded people to combine two principles in their ideology -- patriotism and democracy, and on their basis to work for accord in society. In order to work out a strategy of joint actions, the reformers will hold a forum of democratic forces next autumn in Moscow. The purpose of today's meeting of the public chamber was to set up five commissions included in it -- on political stability, on socio-economic problems, on the federal setup and inter-ethnic relations, on the safety of individuals and the security of society and on problems of science, education and culture. Those commissions were assigned the task of organising control over the implementation of the public accord treaty and drawing up recommendations to be approved at meetings of the public chamber.
