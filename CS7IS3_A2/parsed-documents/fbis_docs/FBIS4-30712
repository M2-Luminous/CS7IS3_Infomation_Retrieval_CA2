Malaysian Defence Minister Najib Tun Abdul Razak said here Tuesday after a meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Defence Secretary William Perry, that he believed of a very good scope for U.S.-Malaysia defence relationship and expected it to grow stronger in the years to come based on the new realities of the region, particularly in Southeast Asia. ...A stronger Malaysia and a stronger ASEAN means that we'll be in a better position to guarantee the security of not only the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries but the region as a whole. As far as the Asia-Pacific region is concerned, America is still looking towards maintaining a strong presence in Japan and Korea. But as far as our region is concerned they're happy with the present arrangement...bearing in mind the U.S. budgetary constraints, he said on wrapping up his nine-day visit to the U.S. which has taken him to New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Washington. Earlier, Najib was given a ceremonial welcome by American military service men at the Pentagon with a 19-gun salute, and a moving rendition of the Malaysian national anthem Negara Ku [My country] as well as the U.S' national anthem, The Star Spangled Banner by a U.S. army band.
