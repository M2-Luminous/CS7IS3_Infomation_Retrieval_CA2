It had been preceded by two years of evaluation, calculation, and observation of the life and work of country people both in remote parts and in the environs of the oblast center. This was done by Russian specialists in conjunction with experts from the International Finance Corporation. Its product was the Nizhniy Novgorod model of land reform. What are its main features? The principles of voluntary participation by farms and peasants on the basis of their decision to privatize land and reorganize farms; freedom of choice, whereby farm members decide on their own sphere of activity; and priority farm members of farms, including pensioners, when it comes to the acquisition of property and land. And a strong legislative base as well. Since the beginning of the year, land auctions have been held in other farms in the oblast; a total of six farms in different soil and climatic zones in the region were the pioneers. Nearly 40 kolkhozes, joint-stock companies, and sovkhozes are waiting in line, wanting to employ the new system. It must be said that an active quest for agrarian reform options has been conducted of late in Tula, Moscow, and Orel Oblasts and in other regions of Russia. Which one will provide the foundation? It is better to see once than to hear 100 times, as they say. No doubt this is what prompted V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Federation government; A. Zaveryukha and A. Chubays, his deputies; V. Khlystun, minister of agriculture and food; and leading officials of a number of Russian ministries recently to spend a few days studying land reform on the spot, in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. The leaders of nearly 40 Russian oblasts, krays, and autonomous okrugs went to the oblast to size up the situation. The VIP's attended an auction, held this time at the Kolkhoz named for the 60th Anniversary of October, in Gorodetskiy Rayon. The subsequent discussion involving the government head, the hosts, and the guests touched on the local land reform program that had been presented and ways of getting the Russian agroindustrial complex out of the current crisis. According to V. Chernomyrdin, who attended the auction and familiarized himself with the oblast's specific actions and plans, we are all participating in a "major undertaking in Russia," the main aim of which is to get owners to develop agricultural production. Concerning the agrarian program created within the confines of the Nizhniy Novgorod region, the prime minister noted that it could become a national program, although it would have to be refined by the different regions. Viktor Stepanovich also backed the idea of creating a cadre center in Nizhniy Novgorod to train reform specialists. During his stay in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, V. Chernomyrdin visited the "NITEL" joint-stock company and met with the leaders of industrial and defense enterprises and oblast administration chiefs. A. Zaveryukha, deputy chairman of the Russian government, V. Khlystun, minister of agriculture, and representatives of the Finance Ministry and Land Reform Committee visited the Chernyshikhinskiy meat-packing plant that is being constructed in Kstovskiy Rayon and the "Rossiya" collective enterprise. The conference with the oblast's agroindustrial aktiv that followed discussed various agricultural production matters.
