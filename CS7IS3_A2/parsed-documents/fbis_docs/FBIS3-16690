Specialists are thinking through its prospects. The head of the general machine-building design bureau, (?Aleksey Prusanov), said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that a feasibility study for the entire complex will be ready by the end of 1994. The document will envisage the use of initially two and subsequently five silos for launching light booster rockets, and the creation of two launchpads for heavy booster rockets. A missile division used to be stationed on the site where the cosmodrome is being built. The site will be several times smaller in size after it has been converted for its new purpose. The reclaimed land will be returned to the state.
