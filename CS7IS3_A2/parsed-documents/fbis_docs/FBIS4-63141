This time FARID MUKHAMETSHIN, the chairman of the Tatar parliament, expresses his opinion. IF: Do you think the leadership of Tatarstan has properly used the situation of the past two years for conducting economic reforms? MUKHAMETSHIN: The cabinet managed to offer social security to the population which is important. However, not burdened by big payments to the federal budget last year and having advantageous conditions for oil experts the government should have used the situation more actively and launched economic reforms creating favorable conditions for small and medium-sized business. Unfortunately, the government was more concerned about the optimal distribution of the shrinking means it had than about finding new sources of increasing the budget. During the latest session of parliament the Tatar budget came under justified criticism. An analysis of the revenue and spending indicates that the government approach to the economy is conservative. IF: In the absence of its own economic program can Tatarstan collect the planned revenue by increasing the tax burden of unprofitable companies and impoverished population? MUKHAMETSHIN: The parliament approved the budget on condition that the government works out an anti-crisis program within a month's time. If the government has collected merely 400 million rubles in the first four months, one can hardly expect it to collect three trillion by the end of the year. Therefore the main task of the cabinet now is to define priority industries and companies that will be given tax benefits, to work out an effective policy of credits and agree with the federal government on a program of reducing mutual debts that now total two trillion. IF: If this was not done in two years, why do you think the cabinet is going to find a way out of the crisis in one month? MUKHAMETSHIN: I think a month is enough. The anti-crisis program will rely on the resources of Tatarstan as well as outside resources. Today many companies have their own programs and some have even partly carried them out. They should only be helped and by the end of the year they can stabilize their finances. The bankruptcy law should be used and the anti-monopoly committee should be forced to work. Being a part of the economic space of the Russian Federation Tatarstan naturally attaches great significance to coordinating its economic policy with the federal government. This implies the opening of centralized credit lines for agriculture and related industries, investments in federal programs etc. The agreement signed with the Russian government allows the Tatar National Bank to vary lending rates and this should also be used. But it must not be forgotten that Russia has the same problems as we do. We intend to take most active part in working out federal programs. The Tatar government might invite outside economists to work on our economic strategy. Talks are under way, but it is too early to name anyone personally. IF: The parliament did not raise the question of a separate economic policy. Moreover, the prime-minister has declared that Tatarstan will follow the political line of Russia. MUKHAMETSHIN: An absolutely independent economic policy is hardly possible today. However, one should not say that Tatarstan intends to drift along with Russian reforms. Local conditions will be taken into account and appropriate amendments made. IF: Do you think there is a cabinet crisis in Tatarstan? Some political forces believe that the prime-minister must resign giving his place to a reformer. MUKHAMETSHIN: I think it is too early to speak of the resignation of the cabinet. Everything is going to depend on the implementation of the anti-crisis program. IF: Was the budget debate during the latest session natural or was it a manifestation of the conflict between the parliament and government? MUKHAMETSHIN: The budget is always lobbied by certain groups: industrialists, farmers, bankers, that is why its adoption is always a compromise. During the debate I did not notice any wish of MPs to call of the replacement of some cabinet members or the cabinet as a whole even though its capacity to carry out radical reforms was questioned by some speakers. IF: Some observers believe that during the past two years the Tatar leadership has been more concerned about political, domestic and foreign problems than an economic strategy. Do you agree with that? After all social security, support for agriculture are largely a survival program. Do they have a future or will they have to be curtailed? MUKHAMETSHIN: It is true that much money was spent to keep up stability. The leadership felt that this is necessary otherwise the public would have turned its back on reforms. Now a new stage has begun and we must protect the rights we received from the federal government to prove the vitality of sovereign Tatarstan. After signing the treaty with Moscow on the separation of powers the entire responsibility for reforms lies on local leaders.
