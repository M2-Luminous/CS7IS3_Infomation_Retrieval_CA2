Shining Path followers who support surrender have separated from their radical "commanders" and now want peace. And those who have repented demand that the law benefiting them be regulated. Colonel PNP [Peruvian National Police] Gabino Cajahuanca Parra, director of the Miguel Castro Castro Special Regime Prison, said: "Everything seems to indicate that Shining Path inmates are involved in something that can be described as withdrawal." The work of the intelligence service to get Shining Path followers to support Abimael Guzman Reinoso's call to lay down their arms, and the rigorous isolation surrounding indicted and condemned subversives, has apparently affected Shining Path morale. It is not a coincidence that in the past few weeks many Shining Path "commanders" imprisoned in the Castro Castro prison have began distancing themselves from their most radical cadres. "That is a fact that no one here denies," a subversive inmate said. It is known that 35 subversives have repented at the Castro Castro prison so far. But their numbers could increase if the government issues regulations for reducing the sentences of "repenting" Shining Path followers. LA REPUBLICA talked with one "repenting" Shining Path follower whose secret code is A1AA0043. He said that inside the prison "many Shining Path followers want to repent, but the lack of definition of their legal status makes them remain silent." The case of this Shining Path inmate -- number A1AA0043 -- who was leader of a teachers union before being recruited by the Shining Path, could be useful for the government in speeding up the approval of the regulations in question. "I have been under the protection of the Repentance Law for the past four months, and so far no one has helped me. I have more information on Shining Path leaders, but why should I give it away if I am still here?" the repenting subversive said. The information he gave to the police permitted the capture of three important political and military PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist Party -- Shining Path] "commanders." A1AA0043 is supported only by the direction of a penal institution that has decided to isolate him from the rest of the Shining Path following. His case shows the rigidity of a prison system that has began to yield positive results. A1AA0043 emphatically said that "many of those imprisoned here have started to realize what Shining Path really is here in jail." "The situation is such thanks to Col. Cajahuanca Parra, who has reestablished discipline and has taken control away from the old Shining Path leadership," A1AA0043 said. Other reports heard by LA REPUBLICA before support this assertion. Another one who repented said: "In the past, the Shining Path commanders made us work for them. Now their power has been taken away by the isolation into which they have been forced, and this has brought us great peace." He added: "Their abuse made us understand that we were nothing to the commanders." The same source, who pretended to be the "supervisor" of a wing in the penitentiary which is also called Canto Grande, revealed that in the past the "commanders" had physically abused the inmates by beating and raping them if they did not support Shining Path. Now everything seems to have changed in the prison. [passage omitted] Now nothing looks like the old courtyards where the Shining Path members had their murals, rabbit hutches, pigeon lofts, plants, and cubbyholes where they hid their weapons, and where they competed with the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] with bright colors and subversive slogans. That is now gone. Everything has been covered by concrete and heavy paint. One of the supervisors said: "The only time there is noise here is in the morning, when groups of inmates come down to the first floor to fill their containers with water. As far as their hygiene is concerned, they clean themselves in the showers in the courtyards and when they come out into the open." [passage omitted] Policemen permanently watch all activities in each cell, in each floor, in each wing. This is controlled strictly by Colonel Cajahuanca Parra, who visits the wings every day. This officer, a hardliner, is identified by his personnel and the inmates as the one responsible for the changes made. "We want to thank the director for the treatment we get. It is true there is extreme security, but I have been here for the last four and a half years, and I can assure you that life here was worth nothing," said Victor Manuel Miranda, delegate of wing 5B, where the 148 inmates sentenced for drug trafficking are kept. He added: "Now, however, we are calm. There are no longer drugs, liquor, police corruption, and killings." [passage omitted] The discipline and strict security measures are so extensive that there have been no escapes from the penitentiary. [passage omitted] Under the same discipline, the inmates sentenced to life in prison, who number around 50, and the 35 who have repented are kept under special protection. We also entered the wing of those who have repented and those who are kept isolated, which includes former Congressman Yehude Simon Munaro, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for terrorism. Munaro said: "I was isolated because the subversives accuse me of being a pacifist, and the government of being subversive." He added: "The documents for my defense will be submitted to the United Nations in the next few days." [passage omitted] Only time will tell if the new antisubversive penitentiary policy will contribute to the pacification of the country. In any case, the first step and the hardest was already taken by the director of the Miguel Castro Castro penitentiary.
