This is possibly connected with the fact that politicians know sufficiently well how to make use of the ideas of the professors. The Alliance of Democrats has elected Prof. Rudolf Filkus as its deputy chairman, and his ideas have also found their application in the economic program of this party. We took an interest in the political views of Mr. Filkus after his finding a home in a liberal organization, and we received the economist's answers to our questions. [Grycz] At one time the SDSS [Social Democratic Party of Slovakia] offered you the position of chairman. You decided in favor of the Alliance. Why? [Filkus] First of all, no one offered me a position in the SDSS. But the essence of the matter is that I perceive the transformation process in social terms even now, when I speak of liberal steps toward a market mechanism. I understand this process as being without direction by the state while maintaining continuity with the steps we have already taken. This does not mean that I do not perceive the social barriers that could be formed by some liberal measures or that would prevent the transformation of the economy. And this is connected with social democracy. [Grycz] So you see the Alliance as a moving force for the transformation of the economy? [Filkus] Yes, because we will get to a market economy most rapidly by steps of a liberal nature, with the exclusion of direction by the state. In my concept, this is not connected with centralized macroeconomic actions. The economic center is, for example, the National Bank, which must see to currency stability, and the center must take care as well of the infrastructure and take action especially under conditions when the market is still not fully functioning. But it cannot be allowed to act on prices or regulate wages, production, or its composition. [Grycz] The population has been offered declarations of liberalism in the programs of the movements and parties since November. Unfortunately, in its practical political and economic form, the people perceive it more as a negative, which the forces oriented against the liberals are naturally exploiting. Does the Alliance have a chance after its previous failures in the application of liberalism in Slovak conditions to acquire an adequate voter base for its program? [Filkus] The liberal process was discredited especially by insufficient social sensitivity. The social explosions that can take place represent insurmountable obstacles, which prevent any kind of movement forward. In addition to this, I reckon with the fact that the macroeconomic restrictive policies of a budgetary and currency nature have already brought about their sacrifices, and we are now further along. We know more, we know that it works, but, on the other hand, it is necessary to clean up this entire process of transformation. It is not possible to let the process of privatization, which is an economic tool for changing the composition of ownership, become a tool of political power. This has happened and we cannot accept it. [Grycz] But don't these tendances move the voters' opinions rather to the left? [Filkus] That depends on the makeup of the voters. When I put in the program revitalization of the economy through foreign capital, acceleration of privatization, assistance to small and medium-sized businesses, I am addressing a specific group of voters. I meet with them in the okreses and I know that they are the tradesmen, the bankers, the intelligentsia, and the small and medium-sized businessmen. That is, we deal with the countervailing, most affected strata of the populace. [Grycz] Alliance means doing things together. With which personalities and groupings to the right and to the left of the center do you mean to cooperate? [Filkus] We look at this in economic terms. We will join those who agree with us that it is necessary to continue with the liberalization of the marketplace. We will also join those who are against the state directing the economy but who do not exclude some economic initiative by the center. And we also accept those who do not overlook the social aspects of the transformation process. Whoever is against misusing the process of privatization for the sake of acquiring political power--well, we will join them. I think the type of our potential allies should now be clear to you.
