The Belgian prime minister says Belgian troops must come home as soon as possible. One needs to know, therefore, if France will be the only country to keep its troops in Rwanda. The French defence minister said recently that even if they remained in the country they would not fight. No one can understand why they should remain. It is worth recalling that the Rwanda Patriotic Front spokesman in Kampala recently said that if the French troops got in the way of the RPF they would certainly be fired at. They bleed just like anyone else. [passage omitted]
