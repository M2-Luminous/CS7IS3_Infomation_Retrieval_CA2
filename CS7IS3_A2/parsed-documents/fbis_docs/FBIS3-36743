Laar said Estonia had delivered its notification to Israel and the issue is to be settled soon. "The arms purchase agreement is a detailed one and ensures full control of the arms that are arriving," he explained. The head of Estonia's Central Staff, Colonel Ants Laaneots, at a meeting with the chairman of the Committee of Directors of Israel's military industries, General Dan Shomron on Monday [7 February] delivered his department's claims regarding the completeness of the weapons consignment. The prime minister in his remarks indicated there was no connection between the additional arms given by Israel as gift to Estonia and "possible irregularities" in fulfilling the arms deal. Israel granted to Estonia a consignment of older Soviet-made trophy weapons. "Estonia's arms purchase was a very successful one, and in addition were given a gift. Surely we will also in the future consider the possibility of complementing our supply of arms and technical equipment with the help of Israel. For the time being we must determine our defense concept and make clear what kind of army and weapons we need," Laar told BNS. He said Israel offered a wide variety of military equipment, including border guarding technologies.
