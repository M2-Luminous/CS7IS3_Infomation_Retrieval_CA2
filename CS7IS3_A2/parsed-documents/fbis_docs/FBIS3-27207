When the governor started the visit here a week ago, he claimed that his purpose was to promote the economic and trade ties between Hong Kong and Australia. It sounded good, but Patten soon forgot it. In most of his speeches here, he talked in a big way about his proposals on Hong Kong's political system. it's not a surprise. When he unilaterally introduced part of his proposals to the Legislative Council last December, he undermined the ongoing Sino-British negotiations on the issue. Yet, he, regardless of the fact, blamed China for being responsible for it . He said that he came to Australia to seek "understanding and support" and that his proposals were to ensure Hong Kong's democracy and future. However, people here in the Australian society have their own judgement about Patten's so-called proposals. While some may regard it as "admirable," many others took it the other way. Australian former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in a column article before Patten's visit said what Hong Kong needs during the transitional period is stability, but Patten's proposals will only bring about chaos there. Anyone who's familiar with the British colonial history knows that the british Government had never shown any interest in democracy in Hong Kong over the past 150 years. So why does Patten raise the issue when the territory is to return to China? the article said. It said that it's clear that Patten simply wants to maintain the prestige of the colonial empire of Great Britain even after 1997. To achieve that, he used the word "democracy" as his pretence. David Lague, "THE AUSTRALIAN" newspaper's Hong Kong correspondent, said while Patten upholds his proposals of "democratization," he "has made little effort to end the arrogant and undemocratic style of his administration". "More fundamentally, he has failed to take the Hong Kong people into his confidence," Lague said. During talks with Patten this week, Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, who once said his government was not impressed by Patten's proposals, stressed again that the "continuing prosperity and stability" in Hong Kong is important to his country.
