She was party to the ANC National Health Plan released this week, which promotes the liberation of abortion laws. However, Dr Zuma says: "Any law should respect the right of people not to have a termination of pregnancy if they do not believe in it. "Health workers should not be made to perform that termination if it is against their morals and religious beliefs. "People feel it may be un-Christian. As a Christian, I find it difficult to be judgmental of women wanting a termination. "That is something they have to sort out with their God. It is not for me, as a doctor, to judge them." Dr Zuma moved into her slightly shabby ministerial suite high in the Civitas Building in Pretoria on Monday. Brightening the meagre decorations were the South African flag and a bouquet of flowers sent by the dean of the University of Pretoria. Already immersed in a formidable schedule and en route to Cape Town for the opening of Parliament, Dr Zuma paused for a second to wonder about the fate of the flowers. "I was touched," she said. Dr Zuma's first task will be to guide the National Health System [NHS], which will unify South Africa's fragmented health services, through Parliament. She intends retaining and supporting the valuable parts of the old health service -- like research and academic hospitals -- and rebuild the entire health edifice around primary health care. "I don't want the impression created that once we go the primary health care way, academic medicine and research goes out of the window," said Dr Zuma. "I see both primary health care and academic medicine as essential to the health service." While there would have to be "some rationalisation," Dr Zuma said she believed anxieties that academics would become poor relations in the new health service were unfounded. Dr Zuma's priority will be the well-being of South Africa's children. Everything else -- from streamlining inefficient provincial hospitals, to nudging the private sector to co-operate, to setting up free medial care for those who need it and establishing a primary health care network -- will follow. She intends the changes -- at least in child care, with free medical services for under-sixes -- to be visible by the end of this year, depending on legislation. "Children are the first priority. If you have a nation of stunted, malnourished individuals, children whose brains have not grown to their full potential, then you can't hope to have a nation that will be prosperous and able to compete with the rest of the world ..." If this mother and professional woman has one pang about her new post, it is that she has had to leave her four children and one step-child, aged between five and 12, behind in Durban. She is confident the money for restructuring health services -- about R[Rand]2-billion or 14 percent of the Budget -- will be found. "Unless we're saying that the changes taking place should only be meaningful for me as a minister and not for anybody else, then we have to find the money. The restructuring has to happen." Maritzburg-born Dr Zuma, 45, was raised at Pholela in Zululand. She matriculated from Adam's Mission in Amanzimtoti and went on to study at Durban's medical school. In exile with her husband, ANC deputy secretary-general Jacob Zuma, she completed her MB [Bachelor of Medicine] ChB [Bachelor of Surgery] degree at Bristol University and received a diploma in tropical child health from the University of Liverpool. She then worked at the Mbabane Government Hospital in Swaziland and at the ANC health department in Lusaka before joining the Medical Research Council in Natal in 1991 to research AIDS and maternal and child health. Academic hospitals -- now called academic complexes to include their teaching function -- are regarded as national resources. They will fall directly under the NHS, rather than under provinces. "They should be seen as national assets shared across provinces," Dr Zuma said. One possible way of streamling services would be for specialised operations like heart transplants to take place in one centre.
