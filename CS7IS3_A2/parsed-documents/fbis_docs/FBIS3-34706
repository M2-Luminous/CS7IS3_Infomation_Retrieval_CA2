The weapon of terror is in the hands of those who oppose us. Today, we are in control of the territories, yet we are unable to foil terrorism. If our partner realizes that security is important to us, and if he understands that he will not attain his goals as long as there is no full security, he will have an interest in seeing to it that security is realized. Mr. Rabin further said that he recognizes the existence of a Palestinian entity, but distinguishes between it and a state. The Palestinians will have their flag and other symbols, such as a police force. They are entitled to have symbols, Rabin told the Labor Party Bureau in Tel Aviv today.
