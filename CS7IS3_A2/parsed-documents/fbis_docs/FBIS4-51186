Led by leading officers from the three People's Liberation Army [PLA] general departments, the five joint working groups organized by the three PLA general departments and the CMC General Office headed for various major military units a few days ago to check up on the work and provide guidance. This is an important step by the leading group for reforming and reorganizing all-Army production and operation to implement the policy-decision made by the CMC to shake up the Army's production and operation. A meeting on Army-wide production and operation was held in November last year. The CMC demanded that centralized and unified control be exercised over production and operation throughout the Army, that offices at all levels never go into commercial production, that fighting troops do a good job in agricultural and sideline production and non-fighting troops in running industry, and that institutions such as hospitals, warehouses, and scientific research institutes provide pay services to society while fulfilling their work quotas. For this purpose, the CMC further provided that the functions of military units be separated from those of the enterprise and that a separate system of production and operation be set up. In addition, the CMC worked out policies and rules to facilitate the reform and reorganization of production and operation throughout the Army. After the meeting, various major military units completed the tasks of mobilizing officers and men and making preparations for the campaign, and they began to put the CMC's decisions into practice early this year. The joint working groups will primarily check up on the preparation for and the process of the reform and reorganization work, will understand whether various units' programs for implementing the CMC decisions and their work plan have been brought into line with the provisions laid down by the three PLA general departments and their realities, will find out how the reorganization work has been done, including the number, assets, and receivable and payable debts of the enterprises whose stocks and assets have been reappraised or those that have closed down, suspended operation, amalgamated with others, switched to the manufacture of other products, or severed ties with local enterprises. The groups will also find out how the general departments and various major military units have exercised centralized and unified control over production and operation and how the fighting troops have sorted out and turned over their production and operation projects. Before the joint working groups set out on the journey, Fu Quanyou, head of the leading group for reforming and reorganizing all-Army production and operation and director of the General Logistics Department, gave a mobilization talk. Zhou Ziyu, Zhang Bin, Xiong Guangkai, Liang Hong, and other leaders from the three PLA general departments attended the mobilization meeting.
