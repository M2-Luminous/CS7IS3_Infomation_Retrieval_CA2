The discovery was made during a customs and control inspection in Novi Sad. Our correspondent Szilveszter Varga, reporting from Belgrade, also gives an account of the continuing fighting in Bosnia. [Begin Varga recording] [passage omitted] According to a report by Novi Sad Television yesterday, 15 Belgian-made submachine guns, more than 1,000 uniforms of the former East German Army, and other military equipment were found by Novi Sad customs officers in one of the three trucks the Budapest Ecumenical Charity sent to Kosovo. Representatives of the Hungarian aid organization -- which also has links with the Pravoslav Church -- stationed here have dissociated themselves from the affair. [end recording] MTI's Belgrade correspondent also reported, on the basis of the Novi Sad Television account, that the aid delivery containing the military equipment was sent by the Hungarian Ecumenical Charity from Budapest to the Pristina-based Mother Teresa organization and that the documentation was signed by a Balazs Kek. The Hungarian Ecumenical Charity resolutely denies and describes as provocative the Novi Sad Television report, which said that weapons and military equipment weighing 10 tons were found in their aid delivery during customs inspection. The charity also stresses that the delivery was made up of clothes, medicines, and food, and was not being sent to Pristina, the mostly Albanian-populated center of Kosovo, but to Novi Sad. Following the regular customs inspection last Saturday [4 June] the Yugoslav customs inspectors found both the documents and the delivery itself to have been in proper order because after off-loading, the trucks returned to Hungary.
