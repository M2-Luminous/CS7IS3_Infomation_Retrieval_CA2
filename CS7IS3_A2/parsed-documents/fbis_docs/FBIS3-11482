The minister visited a railway being built through a partnership agreed on by the state and Army. In peacetime, Army personnel leave their barracks and change weapons. Some 100 soldiers are building the remaining 200 km of the Ferroeste railway linking the Parana's main agricultural region with the port of Paranagua. It was up to the construction company to build it, but the state government canceled the bid and resorted to the Army when it discovered that it would be cheaper. The construction of the tunnel that is the railway's most difficult segment is an example of the savings. The construction companies raised its cost to $1.8 million. The Army built the 400 meter tunnel for $700,000, which represents a savings of approximately 800 million real cruzeiros. The government thinks that when the work ends in December, Parana State will save $40 million, almost 60 billion real cruzeiros. Lucena, who visited the railway, said the Army can cooperate on other projects: [Begin recording] I think there is a slot for us, for our people, and it trains them. [end recording]
