Mr. Kodjo has formed a government in which he has attributed eight out of the 19 ministerial posts to President Gnassingbe Eyadema's supporters; eight to "independent" candidates, and only three to members of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], his own party. The opposition CAR and UTD which formed a coalition to contest the elections and which won last February's legislative elections -- the CAR won 34 out of 78 parliamentary seats and the UTD won six -- had agreed to propose Mr. Agboyibor for the post of prime minister but to the general surprise, General Eyadema on 23 April appointed Mr. Kodjo to form a new government. Edem Kodjo, a former dignitary of Eyadema's regime and an opposition member "boycotted" by his former political "friends," has since his appointment been trying to form his government team. "Mr. Kodjo knows very well that he intends to rely on another presidential majority to govern the country, as reflected in the composition of the government," Mr. Agboyibor said. Earlier in the evening, the prime minister told AFP that the new government he has just formed is "an interim government." He further said that "if the CAR decides to join the government, there will be a cabinet reshuffle to enable it to take the portfolios due it." [passage omitted]
