FR940328-1-00056 FR940328-1-00023 Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, and as implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 402, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions that are to be conducted within the United States or on the high seas, with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its proposed or designated critical habitat (if any). Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a proposed Federal action may affect a listed species, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. No such activities are currently known with respect to the species covered by this rule. Section 8(a) of the Act authorizes the provision of limited financial assistance for the development and management of programs that the Secretary of the Interior determines to be necessary or useful for the conservation of endangered species in foreign countries. Sections 8(b) and 8(c) of the Act authorize the Secretary to encourage conservation programs for foreign endangered species, and to provide assistance for such programs, in the form of personnel and the training of personnel. Section 9 of the Act, and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered and threatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take within the United States or on the high seas, import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered wildlife. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken in violation of the Act. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered and threatened wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance propagation or survival, or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. For threatened species, there also are permits available for zoological exhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with the purposes of the Act. Public Comments Solicited The Service intends that any final rule adopted will be accurate and as effective as possible in the conservation of endangered or threatened species. Therefore, comments and suggestions concerning any aspect of this proposed rule are hereby solicited from the public, concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, private interests, and other parties. Comments particularly are sought concerning the following: (1) Biological, commercial, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to the subject species; (2) The location of any additional populations of the subject species; (3) Additional information concerning the distribution of these species; and (4) Current or planned activities in the involved areas, and their possible effect on the subject species. Final promulgation of the regulations on the subject species will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final decision that differs from this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal, must be in writing, and should be directed to the party named in the above ADDRESSES section. National Environmental Policy Act The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended.
