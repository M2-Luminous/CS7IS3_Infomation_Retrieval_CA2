A new Subpart D, consisting of §§290.200 through 290.202 is added, to read as follows: Subpart D_Sale of HUD-Held Mortgages 290.200␣Purpose and applicability of Civil Rights Requirements. 290.201␣Sale of subsidized HUD-held mortgages. 290.202␣Sale of unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages. Subpart D_Sale of HUD-Held Mortgages §290.200 Purpose and applicability of Civil Rights Requirements. (a) Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to set out HUD's policy regarding the sale of subsidized and unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages. Except as otherwise provided in §290.201(b)(ii), the Department will sell mortgages on a competitive basis. The Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying mortgage for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered mortgage from sale. However, when a qualifying mortgage is offered for sale, the procedures set out in this part will govern the sale. (b) Applicability of Civil Rights Requirements. Nothing in this subpart relieves HUD or housing that receives federal financial assistance from federal civil rights requirements, including section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11063, and related regulations and requirements. This includes housing in which less than 50% of the units are receiving housing assistance payments under either Section 23 or Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and housing in which the rent of any unit is paid by a Section 8 certificate or voucher. §290.201 Sale of subsidized HUD-held mortgages. (a) Tenant protections preserved. HUD will only sell subsidized mortgages if the sale is part of a transaction that will ensure that the project subject to the mortgage will continue to operate, at least until the maturity date of the mortgage, in a manner that will provide rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program under which the mortgage was insured prior to its assignment. HUD's policy for selling subsidized HUD-held mortgages is set out in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. (b) Current mortgages. HUD may sell current mortgages, as follows: (1) Current mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance will be sold either: (i) On a competitive basis to FHA-approved mortgagees; or (ii) On a negotiated basis, to State or local governments, or to a group of investors that includes an agency of a State or local government, if: (A) The terms of the sale include an agreement by the State or local government, or an agency of the State or local government, to: ( 1 ) Act as mortgagee or owner of a beneficial interest in the mortgage; and ( 2 ) Ensure that the project will maintain occupancy by the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program; and (B) The sales price is the best price that the Secretary can obtain from an agency of a State or local government while maintaining occupancy for the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program. (2) Current mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance will be sold if HUD can offer protections equivalent to those listed for an insured sale in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (c) Delinquent mortgages. Delinquent mortgages will be sold only if, as part of the sales transaction: (1) The mortgages are restructured; and (2) Either FHA mortgage insurance or equivalent protections are provided. §290.202 Sale of unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages. HUD's policy for selling unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages is as follows: (a) Current mortgages may be sold with or without FHA mortgage insurance. (b) Delinquent mortgages may be sold without FHA mortgage insurance. However, delinquent mortgages will not be sold if: (1) HUD believes that foreclosure is unavoidable; and (2) The project securing the mortgage is occupied by very low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance and would be likely to pay rent in excess of 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income if HUD sold the mortgage. Dated: September 16, 1994. Jeanne K. Engel, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.
