Despite rain and low temperatures in Quito, university and high school students had serious confrontations with the police, whose numbers have been insufficient to contain the demonstrators. Vice President Alberto Dahik became a target of the protests in spite of the public force deployment downtown and throughout the city. A group of students threw rocks at the vice president's vehicle and broke the windows as he approached his offices near the presidential palace. Witnesses said Vice President Dahik emerged unscathed from the shower of rocks. The police reported that the demonstrators then tried to reach the presidential palace but were turned back by tear gas. The Army began increasing security at the Ecuadoran presidential palace on Friday in the face of a wave of protests against the increase in fuel prices. More than 28 protest centers have been pinpointed in the capital. Students in Guayaquil held demonstrations during which transportation vehicles were hijacked and tires burned. The government has announced the suspension of classes on 2, 3, and 4 February throughout the nation in light of the general protest situation. Education Minister Rosalia Arteaga said: We ask the people to remain calm because violent attitudes do not solve the nation's internal problems. On the contrary, the problems get worse as they create a climate of uncertainty. Politicians responded that the Ecuadoran people have at the very least the right to protest. Student federations and centers as well as teachers associations called for a strike on Wednesday. The workers called for a 24-hour preventive national strike on Thursday to protest the new prices and to exert pressure on the government to rectify the measures. [passage omitted]
