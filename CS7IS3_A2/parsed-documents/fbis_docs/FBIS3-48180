Yi, exchanging New Year's greetings with Stephen Cardinal Kim Su- hwan at Myongdong Cathedral, said Monday [17 January] he will propose an inter-Korean summit and a tripartite meeting of Pyongyang, Washington and Seoul if he meets with North Korean President Kim Il-song. Frequent inter-Korean exchanges, including cultural exchanges and economic cooperation, will help resolve inter-Korean problems and achieve national reunification, he told the Roman Catholic primate of South Korea. "My reason for visiting North Korea is that we remain in the cold-war framework of reasoning, though we are living in the post- cold war era," Yi said. "The political approach to the reunification issue so far should now be shifted to an economic approach, and I believe the opposition party has a role to play in creating an environment for such a shift and in arranging inter-Korean talks for solution of the nuclear issue." The cardinal said visiting North Korea is not always as simple as Yi made out because North Korea may try to make use of such a visit for its own political objectives.
