In response to confusion over China's policy, Xu Shanyan, a director-general in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, also said yesterday foreign investors could not sell telecommunications equipment to China. Joint-venture manufacturing of equipment was allowed, he said. It was only the service sector they would be excluded from. One of the reasons for shutting out foreigners was China needed to co-ordinate its policies and services and to link them up into a national network. Foreign participation would cause confusion. China's telecommunications industry was still in "a primitive stage", said Mr Xu. He added the move did not conflict with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which China wanted to join. But China did want to improve its manufacturing capabilities, he said. "We would like to actively co-operate with foreign manufacturers. We are still exploring beneficial ways for foreign investment." Some foreigners are wary of China's demands. "The industry is moving so fast that we just can't move operations of our most advanced equipment to China," said one American businessman. Mr Xu said by the end of the decade China could have as many as 140 million telephone lines, compared with about 40 million now, and the waiting list for installation could be reduced to one month from the current six or more months. China is due to spend about U.S.$41 billion over the next six years to create a telecommunications network. It will include massive construction of trunk optical cables, satellite earth stations, digital microwave lines, a postal air cargo system and expanded telephone exchange capacity. In Beijing, the number of telephone lines increased from 113,000 in 1980 to 560,000 in 1990. The city, with a population of 10.5 million people has a telephone exchange capacity of 1.05 million lines with 663,000 actually installed. By the end of the year, capacity should rise to 1.54 million with installations at 970,000, according to Jia Yong, vice-director of the Beijing Telecommunications Administration.
