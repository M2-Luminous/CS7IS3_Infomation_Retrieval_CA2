FR941205-2-00062 FR941205-2-00042 Erick M. Jansson, IRA (the IRA) Located in Fayetteville, Arkansas; Proposed Exemption [Application No. D&hyph;09847] The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed sale of an overriding royalty interest in oil and gas (the Interest) by the IRA to Mr. Erick M. Jansson (Mr. Jansson), a disqualified person with respect to the IRA, for $95,000 in cash, provided: (a) the IRA pays no commissions or other expenses in connection with the sale; (b) the fair market value of the Interest is determined by a qualified independent appraiser; and (c) the IRA receives no less than the fair market value of the Interest on the date of the sale. 1 1 Pursuant to 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;2(d), the IRA is not within the jurisdiction of Title I of the Act. However, there is jurisdiction under Title II of the Act pursuant to section 4975 of the Code. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The IRA is a self-directed IRA described in section 408(a) of the Code. Arkansas Trust Management, Inc. of Fayettevillle, Arkansas, is the custodian of the IRA. As of September 6, 1994, the IRA had approximately $169,150 in total assets. 2. On April 20, 1993, the IRA purchased the Interest, which consists of an overriding royalty interest of one-quarter of one percent of 8/8ths of all oil and gas produced from Block Q/13(a), a proposed offshore oil and gas drilling operation to be located on property near the Netherlands. The IRA purchased the Interest from the Van Dyke Energy Company (VDE) for a consideration of $95,000. VDE is unrelated to Mr. Jansson and the IRA. Mr. Jansson, who had worked for over 25 years in the field of oil and gas drilling management, had determined that the Interest was a suitable investment for his IRA. 3. At the time the Interest was purchased by the IRA, the parties were unaware that the Dutch government would impose a 35% foreign income tax on the oil and gas proceeds produced by the Interest (the Foreign Tax). The parties learned of the Foreign Tax after the Interest was acquired when VDE announced it had been advised by the Dutch government that any proceeds from the asset were subject to Dutch income tax and the Foreign Tax would be withheld from the proceeds before payments to the IRA. In addition, Mr. Jansson has determined that he wishes to invest the IRA's assets in a more liquid and less speculative investment. Accordingly, he proposes to purchase the Interest from the IRA for cash at its appraised fair market value. No commissions or other expenses will be paid by the IRA in connection with the sale. 4. Mr. John R. Gorman, financial consultant for VDE, has stated that as of August 22, 1994, no development plan has been filed for Block Q/13(a), nor has there been any oil or gas production on the Block. Accordingly, Mr. Gorman has appraised the Interest as still having a fair market value of $95,000 as of August 22, 1994. 5. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria contained in section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: a) the sale is a one-time transaction for cash; b) the IRA will pay no commissions or other expenses in connection with the sale; c) the sales price has been determined by a qualified, independent appraiser; and d) Mr. Jansson is the only participant in the IRA, and he has determined that the transaction is appropriate for and in the best interest of the IRA and desires that the transaction be consummated. notice to interested persons: Because Mr. Jansson is the only participant in the IRA, it has been determined that there is no need to distribute the notice of proposed exemption to interested persons. Comments and requests for a hearing are due 30 days after publication of this notice in the Federal Register .
