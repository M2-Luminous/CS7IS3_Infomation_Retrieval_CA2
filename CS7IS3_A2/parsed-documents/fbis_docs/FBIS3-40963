Kostyantyn Hryshchenko, head of the directorate of control over armaments and disarmament of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressed this during a meeting with journalists on 18 January. He emphasized that all components necessary for the safe storage of nuclear weapons, hydrogen absorbers in particular, are manufactured in Russia and until recently were not being supplied to Ukraine. Hryshchenko noted that this led to the storage of nuclear weapons becoming increasingly unstable. The threat was gradually increasing and demanded a resolution. In the opinion of the representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after Ukraine's experience with Chernobyl it would be extremely irresponsible not to take this situation into account.
