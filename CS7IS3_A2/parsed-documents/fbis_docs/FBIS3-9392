Zdenko Vranjes reports from Mostar for Croatian Radio: [Vranjes] The leadership of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and Croat deputies are carrying out preparations for two forthcoming sessions -- important sessions indeed -- of the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna scheduled for Saturday and the historic constitutional [ustavotvoran] assembly of federal Bosnia-Herzegovina which is expected to take place in Sarajevo on Monday and Tuesday. Kresimir Zubak [president of the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna] has told Croatian Radio the following: [begin recording] [Zubak] [words indistinct] this session of the constitutional assembly scheduled for Monday 28 March. We have scheduled, prior to this, a session of the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna at which we should inform the deputies about the documents we adopted in Washington and prepared in Vienna. All deputies to the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna are also deputies to the constitutional assembly. This assembly of Herceg-Bosna is going to formulate final standpoints and instruct the deputies at the session of the constitutional assembly on Monday and Tuesday. [Vranjes] Will all the deputies from the ranks of the Croat people take part in the constitutional assembly in Sarajevo on Monday? Has this been prepared and agreed yet? [Zubak] All technical details relating to this have not been agreed yet. I believe that today or tomorrow we will agree on every technical detail. We are of the opinion that all the deputies from the ranks of the Croat people who were deputies to the former assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be present and vote. It is a known fact that a constitution may be adopted by a consensus of two peoples. [end recording] [passage omitted]
