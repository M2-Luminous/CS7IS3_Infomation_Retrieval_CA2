John Major, who leaves Britain for Russia on Monday [14 February] for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, said: "Emphatically what NATO is doing is not taking sides in the conflict." His remarks, in an interview for Russian television, came after Russia called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the crisis in Bosnia following NATO's ultimatum to Serb forces around Sarajevo to withdraw their artillery within 10 days. Mr Major said: "The objectives that the Russian government have are the same objectives that we have in the West. We would like to see the fighting stop, we would like to see a political settlement. "Emphatically what NATO is doing is not taking sides in the conflict. That is not what we are doing. What we are concerned about is to stop the fighting around Sarajevo and the needless and ceaseless deaths that occur there. That is the purpose of what we are seeking to do. But the objective I believe is one that Russia shares -- and that is to find a negotiated settlement to this conflict. "There is no other satisfactory ending." Mr Major made his remarks shortly after he held brief talks at Downing Street with Russia's ambassador to London, Boris Pankin. Earlier today, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin, in a mildly-worded statement, called for a negotiated end of the siege in the Bosnian capital. He told a briefing in Moscow that the Russian Federation proposed the convening of an immediate Security Council session to examine practical ways of demilitarising Sarajevo and introducing direct rule by the UN. His comments contrasted sharply with those earlier of Russian deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin. Interfax quoted Adamishin as denouncing outright NATO's ultimatum to Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw artillery from Sarajevo in 10 days or face possible air strikes. "Why should NATO make decisions on a (Bosnian) settlement, especially by way of ultimatums and threats to use force? This is not NATO's business. It is the job of the UN." A UN Security Council session would bring what is for Russia a highly sensitive issue under the direct auspices of a body in which it enjoys a trump card -- a powerful veto right. Karasin avoided any comments on Moscow's possible line at a Security Council meeting, should it be called.
