This is in addition to the material and moral damage involved. The party said innocent citizens killed in secure residential quarters and villages are the victims of secessionist disputes and selfish interests that govern the conduct of those who showed no seriousness and credibility toward the crisis. The party reiterated its adherence to, and support for, unity by all legitimate Constitutional means since it is more important and precious than any other objective in its struggle and existence. The party said it will spare no effort to protect unity. It strongly rejected any reasoning and conduct that harms unity. The party said now that blood has been shed, bodies have been torn apart, and children, women and old people have been terrorized, the required position should be to show concern about the suffering of the homeland and transcend narrow, conflicting whims and interests that distort the homeland and destroy the deep-rooted values and meanings that associate the Yemenis with the Constitutional institution, avoiding regional and sectarian loyalties. The statement of the Ba'th Party in Yemen, addressed today to the masses of the Yemeni people, reasserted the party's rejection of any Arab or foreign intervention under the pretext of disengaging the warring troops, stressing that this is an internal question.
