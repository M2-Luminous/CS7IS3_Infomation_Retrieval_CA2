It emerged to serve the needs of the times. If we are to prepare both the young and the old alike for their future tasks once the democratic system starts functioning full swing, we will have to prepare them for it. With that in mind, the leadership launched this social organization with the noble aims of working for the non- disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of national unity, perpetuation of sovereignty, promotion and vitalization of national pride, and emergence of a prosperous, peaceful, and modern union. These lofty aims are worthy of being upheld and transformed into reality for they concern our wellbeing and our future. The youth in any nation are gregarious, sociable, and outgoing. To nurture them, to harness their positive traits, they must be given the benefit of some form of guidance. From young, they get parental guidance and also at school. However, they must be able to join organizations with extra-curricular activities, taught trades useful to themselves and to others. In the aftermath of the chaos and anarchy of the late '80s, the social organizations could not absorb the bulk of youths enthusiastic to join. Hence the need for one that would cater to their desires. That the authorities had devised a way for them to identify themselves with a distinctive organization came as a boon and at an opportune moment. The State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], which has been making preparations for retransfer of power to the rightful people, took the necessary measure to see to the emergence of the kind of organization they very much need. Members who are 10 and above, regardless of sex, class, creed or faith, will be able to get together for a common cause -- that of protecting and serving the motherland. Both minors designated as junior members and adults designated as senior members, will be involved in nation-building tasks. All members are to swear their allegiance to the nation under the Four Oaths, observe an 11-point Code of Conduct, and live up to 14 Duties and Responsibilities, which means they will be able to prove themselves worthy of identity with the union. The mammoth rally that was held at Aung San Stadium yesterday was one of a kind, for it brought together a merry mix of students, teachers, and people from other walks of life. More rallies are coming up. They will endorse the USDA and help strengthen the nation's chances of seeing peace and progress.
