Bank chairman Sergio Siglienti issued a statement in which he underscored how Comit had "fulfilled expectations in response to the confidence shown to it by the government and IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction]." Siglienti went on to stress how the bank's ability to sell stock "was confirmed by the fact that shares sold directly by our bank amounted to some 40 percent of the entire world offer and at a price which, while very interesting for the investors as demonstrated by the success of the sale, represented for the seller, even with the discount, the most advantageous privatization operation carried out so far, even on an international level." Satisfaction for the Comit operation was also voiced today by Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who said "The privatization of Comit marks an important moment for the Italian economy. IRI, formed to manage the bank crisis of the 1930s, today exits from the banking sector. Some of the most prestigious public banks have now become banks of the public. With the sales on the market of Credit, IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property] and Comit 700 thousand new stockholders were born." Ciampi then went on to recall the skepticism, only a few months ago, over Italy's true intention of privatization and how, between May and September, the government had paved the way to make it legally possible. The path is now well defined, he concluded, and "must be followed with determination in the framework of an overall economic policy aimed at reinforcing the efficiency and competitiveness of the Italian productive system." For his part, IRI chairman Romano Prodi recalled how privatization plans are in the process of being defined for the state's interests in the steel and foods sectors, to be followed by the privatization of such leading IRI interests as the Rome airport authority, the National highway authority and, above all, the communications company STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]. In all cases, he concluded, the utmost transparency and rules of the market will be respected." In his statement on the Comit success, Prodi stressed how it "confirmed that the right direction has been taken and that this opinion is amply shared by the public. The fact that hundreds of thousands of people have shown such confidence in our operation is a comfort in view of our next operations."
