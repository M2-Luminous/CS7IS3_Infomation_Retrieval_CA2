Perez reported this at Marco A. Gelabert Airport on his return from the Antilliean island where he spent five days as guest of Governor Rosello, who was a schoolmate of his at a U.S. university. During his stay in Puerto Rico, Perez also met with commercial and industrial groups of the island and spoke with them about the advantages Panama offers to foreign investors. Perez said: "I hope we can dedicate that office soon and that it produces the effect we all expect." The president elect also said that he spoke with Puerto Rican investors about the returned areas and the military installations that the U.S. southern Command will deliver to Panama in a few months. In Perez Balladares' opinion, these installations can be used as complementary facilities and be turned into a door for the entrance and establishment of South American commerce in Panama. Perez noted: "I think that we must reproduce the effort we are making in Puerto Rico in other countries of the world to establish in Panama marketing, export, and reexport centers that use the returned areas to create jobs we need, and at the same time take advantage of our geographic position." Consulted about the reforms proposed by President Bill Clinton to restructure the Panama Canal Commission and about reforming the bank secrecy statutes to strengthen the antidrug struggle, Perez said he prefers to wait until his foreign minister-to-be gives him a well-founded report. Perez said: "I would welcome, from any country, any joint effort initiative that, without hurting our interests, serves to check drug-trafficking and money-laundering." He noted that this is what his government will aim for and this is what President Clinton has referred to. Regarding the Canal reforms, he said that Law 96-70 (the Murphy Law) requires modifications to permit the implementation of the final phase of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, "and I suppose that this is to what the reforms sent by President Clinton to the Senate refer." Finally, Perez Balladares rejected speculation about Panama moving toward the category of a Free Associated State, like Puerto Rico, noting that Panamanians have chosen to remain as a free, independent, and sovereign republic, while Puerto Ricans decided to maintain their status. In this regard he said that he respects the idiosyncracy and autonomy of all nations.
