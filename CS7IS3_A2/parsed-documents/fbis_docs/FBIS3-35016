This is especially necessary as the first year may well be the most hazardous. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which is practically bankrupt, will need to set up a civil service and to launch industrial projects in order to create jobs. Today, Alain Juppe will be able to see firsthand the huge task that lies ahead during his visit to the Gaza strip -- the first such visit by a French foreign minister. "The international aid which has been pledged must reach Gaza as soon as possible," Alain Juppe has said repeatedly. As for France, it is already taking action: A delegation from the Finance Ministry spent some time in the West Bank and the Gaza strip last week and is scheduled to go to the PLO's Tunis headquarters within the next few days. Its goal: To identify projects to be funded by a Fr60 million aid package. Use of the funds should include training of experts, technical assistance, and purchase of French equipment. Another Fr20 million [francs] will be allocated for low-interest loans to Palestinian firms. Market Marginal So Far France has also pledged to provide almost one quarter of the Fr3.6 billion the European Union has said it will grant the PLO for the next five years. In total, international aid will amount to over Fr12 billion, enough to attract French firms. Indeed, CNPF [National Council of French Employers] President Francois Perigot stated at the end of last year -- on the occasion of a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat -- that French firms did wish to be present. French firms interested in the new market include France Telecom, Bouygues, Spic-Batignolles, and Lyonnaise des Eaux. France-2 has been chosen to set up the future Palestinian television network. So far, the Palestinian market has been marginal. French exports there did not exceed Fr200 million in sectors such as home appliances, medical equipment, and textile and chemical products. Alain Juppe did not seek to minimize the hurdles that remain to be overcome. According to the French minister, the Palestinians must organize themselves in order to channel and manage the flow of aid. "The PLO is a political organization which is unfamiliar with such tasks," he explained in an interview with the Israeli daily HAARETZ. This comment referred to the reservations expressed by the World Bank, the European Union, and the United States as to the high proportion of "political" officials among the members of the Palestinian Economic Council set up by the PLO and chaired by Yasir 'Arafat himself.
