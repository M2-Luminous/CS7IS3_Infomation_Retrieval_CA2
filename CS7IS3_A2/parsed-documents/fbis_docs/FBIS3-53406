He discussed with them Lebanese developments and bilateral relations. 'Alizadeh also met with scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah. He said that discussions "focused on the need to devote more attention to Muslims in view of the serious conditions facing them throughout the world." On the U.S. Congress delegation's visit to the region and its interest in the fate of the missing Israeli solders, when Israeli jails are full of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners, he said: "Regrettably, this is one of the contradictions of the new world order, and can be termed the double standards policy pursued by the United States and international circles. While the United States devotes special interest to the fate of the missing Zionist occupation soldiers, no one talks about the fate of the hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinians living in Zionist detention centers and the al-Khiyam detention center. It is really painful and regrettable."
