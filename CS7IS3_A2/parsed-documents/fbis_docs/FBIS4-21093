A Caracas Radio Rumbos report indicated that the violent attack took place at 0600 (1000 GMT)--a time when more that 1,000 members of the military and police forces quartered at the airport "were sound asleep." According to the radio station, the airport's traffic controller, whose name remained undisclosed, arrived as the plane was taking off with the attackers on board. It was also reported that the raid by the alleged Colombian drug trafficking-guerrilla column took place at a time when members of the state security corps were in Puerto Ayacucho combing the area to rescue a Venezuelan citizen who was kidnapped 10 days ago. The plane, of which no details were released, belongs to the regional Puerto Ayacucho government.
