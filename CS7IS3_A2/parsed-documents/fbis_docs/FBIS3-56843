Is that true? [Kozyrev] What I said was that we face dangers from the former USSR territories, which is demonstrated by the bloody conflicts regrettably developing in some of these republics, where we are forced to act as intermediaries and peacekeepers. However, prospects are probably even better for solving many issues, including those connected with protection of the Russian and the Russian-speaking population as well as the development of economic, historic, cultural, and other ties. [Correspondent] In other words, the media has dramatized the danger? [Kozyrev] Well, this is shifting the emphasis somewhat, but I repeat that, indeed, not only the danger but also enormous opportunities come from those territories. This is the objective reality because we do have millions of refugees from the conflict zones, and we see these conflicts on TV every day. These conflicts destabilize the situation close to the Russian borders, and it would be strange if we did not notice it and did not talk about this danger. Another issue is that a completely artificial campaign has been launched in Latvia -- and in Latvia it is on the official level -- and in some of the media in other Baltic countries, where they deliberately distort what I say, apparently so that they can have the opportunity to make yet another appeal for help and again invite sympathy from their Western partners. In this respect the statement of the Latvian officials that they are to make an immediate appeal to Washington is very symptomatic. The hasty, inappropriate, and unbalanced reaction of the U.S. State Department representative which was not based on real facts -- and which I had an opportunity to point out to the American ambassador today -- is, of course, no less surprising. I do think that our partnership merits having the State Department spokesman get it right before criticizing Russia's foreign minister. As for the Baltic situation, the core of the matter there is this: If the Baltic states want to be civilized states, perhaps Latvia, rather than raise this artificial and absolutely unfounded screaming, should concentrate on drawing up agreements on the conditions for withdrawal...[pauses] To have it on the basis of an agreement, because an agreement basis means an equal basis, you will not join a treaty that violates your prestige, sovereignty, or interests...[pauses] to build good-neighborly relations and to guarantee geopolitical interests. Russia's special interests, Russia's special role lie in the fact that we are forced to bear a special, perhaps a larger, burden compared with our partners in the Commonwealth, in peace-making operations. It is Russian troops who are defending the common border at present. This is reflected in CIS documents. This is not our interpretation. This is a common interpretation. We cannot leave Tajikistan to fate. It is impossible for us not to participate in the mediation efforts in Nagorno-Karabakh, for example. It is impossible for us not to participate in the mediation efforts in Georgia, for example, if we are asked to. At the same time, we are not sending tanks to suppress these republics. That is, our special role means exactly that we are against extremes: either complete indifference and withdrawal, or just the opposite, an imperial dictate. It is a role that must be performed day by day, fulfilling one's responsibilities and respecting one's neighbors and their sovereignty, and strengthening the CIS. This fully applies to the Baltic states. As soon as Lithuania demonstrated its readiness to sign a package of agreements with us, the relations immediately improved. The troops have been withdrawn, and prospects for the future are excellent. The same applies to Latvia. As soon as an approach toward signing agreements prevails there, inter alia on withdrawal of troops and other matters, instead of these propaganda campaigns or recent provocative actions, Russia will be ready -- we are ready -- to continue, in spite of all these campaigns.
