However, when the negotiations "failed," the illegal importers attempted to channel them in Cyprus to people of the underworld who showed interest. According to our sources, this information was conveyed to the police, who took action, and last Saturday [12 March] they located not only the arms, as the informers had reported, but also luxury cars which had been smuggled into Cyprus, and antiquities. However, instead of finding arms packed in boxes, the police found three briefcases containing various weapons as samples, as they had been packed by the factories with the price tags on. After this, the police searched various houses hoping to locate a large quantity of arms, as the initial information indicated. According to our information, the arms could be coming from countries in the Middle East. The new arms discovered in the three briefcases are considered to be of high precision and technology. It is also noteworthy that some of them are a type used only by the U.S. Armed Forces (such as those using laser devices, and so forth). The seriousness of the case is precisely the reason the police will intensify their search today and tomorrow to establish whether there are actually more arms in addition to those found and, if so, to confiscate them before they fall into the hands of criminals.
