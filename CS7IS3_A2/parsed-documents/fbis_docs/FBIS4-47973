He told newsmen in Minna, Niger State, today that such a call was illegal and unpatriotic. Prof. Gana stated that there would be chaos if people obeyed calls by any group to stay away from work, stressing that it was a sign of indiscipline. The minister also pointed out that if the call was adhered to it would worsen the fuel scarcity as those in that sector would stay at home. Prof. Gana appealed to the group to give the government a chance to put things right.
