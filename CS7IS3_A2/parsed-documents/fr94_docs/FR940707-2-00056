FR940707-2-00056 FR940707-2-00034 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;298&hyph;000] Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Notice of Petition for Declaratory Order June 30, 1994. Take notice that on June 23, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) filed a petition for declaratory order seeking Commission approval of a settlement agreement dated February 16, 1994, and executed by TGPL, Dakota Gasification Company, and the United States Department of Energy. TGPL seeks a declaratory order from the Commission that: (1) approves the settlement and finds that its implementation is in the public interest; (2) amends Opinion No. 119 to implement the settlement pricing provisions (which action would also resolve a pending complaint-proceeding before the Commission insofar as it relates to the TGPL-Dakota arrangements); and (3) allows TGPL to recover costs incurred pursuant to the agreement under the terms of TGPL's Great Plains Adjustment Provision set forth at Section 39 of the General Terms and Conditions of TGPL's FERC Gas Tariff, as the same may be amended from time to time. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July 21, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
