FBIS4-57843 "drlat102_j_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Panama Colombian `Seriously Injured' Colombian `Seriously Injured' PA2505165194 Panama City Circuito RPC Radio in Spanish 1440 GMT 25 May 94 PA2505165194 Panama City Circuito RPC Radio Spanish BFN [Report by Jose Cortes and Luis Jimenez] [Excerpt] [Cortes] The explosion took place exactly 800 meters from the Plaza Paitilla Inn on Via Italia. This happened at approximately 0820 [1320 GMT] this morning. Information gathered by RPC Radio from PTJ [Judicial Technical Police] agents reveals that the person wounded is Colombian Aaron Schwartz. He was seriously injured. His car was parked outside the Tamaco Building... [Jimenez, interrupting] The Tamanaco Building. [Cortes] Excuse me, the Tamanaco Building, where he lives. This is where Colombian citizen Aaron Schwartz lives. He was injured and taken to Paitilla Hospital. On 13 May, Mr. Schwartz witnessed a kidnapping attempt in this same building. It seems the kidnappers constantly followed him. Last night, they managed to place a bomb in the rear of his car, a Cherokee four-wheel drive vehicle. It is a blue vehicle with brown molding on the sides and the license plate 521054. It is worth noting that he was being tailed because he had witnessed a kidnapping. The kidnappers felt he gave some information to the PTJ linking them to a kidnapping attempt in the Tamanaco Building in the Punta Paitilla area. This is the part of the information we have been able to gather in the area of Punta Paitilla. The National Police are still cordoning off the area. Another vehicle was also damaged as a result of the explosion. By the way, a black Cherokee four-wheel drive vehicle was behind the vehicle that exploded. Some shrapnel also hit nearby homes. This is what is happening. The National Police are still investigating the incident and promise to provide details later. We should also note that the driver of the black Cherokee who was driving behind the car that exploded this morning was unhurt, although the vehicle was badly damaged. The driver is a Jewish citizen. We tried to talk to him -- this man who witnessed everything -- but he refused to comment. [Jimenez] In terms of the injured, we first learned one person was injured in the explosion. Later, we were informed someone else was injured. [Cortes] This is what we have. We talked to some witnesses and one told us he was walking nearby when he heard the blast. When he turned around, he saw someone exiting the vehicle. It seems this person was seriously wounded. This is what the witness said. [passage omitted]
