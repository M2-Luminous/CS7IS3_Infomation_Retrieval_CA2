In a report issued today, ISCO said the only cloud on the horizon is that represented by industrial production suffering from "domestic demand which is still weak." The institute recalled that ISTAT, the National Statistics Institute, reported an industrial output increase of only 0.9 percent in January "as a result of differing trends in various sectors." Uncertainties in industrial activities, moreover, still weigh on the labor market as seen by joblessness which grew from 9.4 percent in January 1993 to 11.3 percent in January this year, said ISCO. On domestic demand, the institute said already in November last year, ISTAT indicated that retail sales were growing at the annual rate of 6 percent, led by mass marketing outlets for which the increase was put at 6.9 percent, by hard goods, up by 9.7 percent for home appliances and consumer electronics and by 7.9 percent for photography equipment. Sales reported by big supermarkets rose by 13.7 percent annually, noted ISCO. For inflation, ISCO said the increase for March was limited to 0.2 percent, as reported by ISTAT, and well below the figures for January and February, 0.6 and 0.4 percent, to leave the annual rate steady at 4.3 percent. Growth on the export front has been further confirmed by the heightened competitive stance of national industry and accompanied by a lower profile on the side of domestic demand, said ISCO.
