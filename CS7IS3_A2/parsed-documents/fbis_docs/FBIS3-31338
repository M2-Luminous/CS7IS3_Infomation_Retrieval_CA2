This is the amount by which at the end of January Slovakia exceeded its credit margin in the mutual trade clearing account. This statement was made on Nova Television by O. Kvacek, from the CNB Press Department. CNB press spokesman Martin Svehla, in response to a query from CTK, was unable to confirm this information. "There is still an imbalance in trade between the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The fact is that the clearing account balance with Slovakia has already exceeded 6 billion korunas and that credit has been de facto granted by the Czech Republic at this level," said Ota Kaftan, a member of the CNB Banking Council. The credit margin was first exceeded at the end of last December. The Slovak National Bank settled the $43-million deficit ahead of time on 10 January. At that time, press spokesman Svehla described this step as highly professional. He emphasized that the debt payment took place without problems, in time, and precisely in accordance with the payments agreement.
