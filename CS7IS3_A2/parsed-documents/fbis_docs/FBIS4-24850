Following three days of talks in Brussels between Chinese trade representatives and the EU, Roderick Abbott, the Union's director to the GATT, said that resumption of China's GATT membership would be a significant move, especially for its founding membership of a World Trade Organization to be set up early next year. The EU has backed measures for the completion of negotiations which could see China voted back into the trade group by the end of this year. Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese delegation, said "important progress" was made in the talks, which ended today, and that the two sides had reached understanding about most of the protocol articles for China's reinstatement. But he said there was still some differences such as easing China's foreign trade restrictions. Talks will resume in a month in a bid to solve these issues.
