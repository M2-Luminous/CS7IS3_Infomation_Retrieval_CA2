The aggression was planned and is being carried out by Serbia and Montenegro. Their fascists have so far managed to produce evidence that civil war is now at issue here, a letter sent by Bosnia-Herzegovina Defense Hamdija Hadzihasanovic to the defense ministers of NATO member-countries said. All that the international community is doing is delivering humanitarian aid, which helps us survive--until we are killed by the aggressor's shells and snipers, though. The belief that the war can be contained within the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina is wrong. We shall never give up. We are numerous enough and we are determinted to fight to the end. Death is not painful. Humiliation is painful. To us the word life implies freedom and justice, the Bosnia-Herzegovina defense minister writes in his letter. Milosevic can only be stopped by force. Europe and the world have this kind of force, Hadzihasanovic writes in his letter to the the Defense Ministers 16 NATO member-countries, demanding their help in lifting the embargo on importing arms to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
