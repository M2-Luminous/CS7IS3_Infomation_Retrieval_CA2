It is intended to promote the introduction of foreign advanced technology and to lift the whole sector of the country to a new level. The measure aims to give Shanghai, China's largest textile and economic center, an exemplary role for the whole country in the transformation of the traditional Chinese textile industry with overseas funds and technology. Located in the eastern part of Qingpu County in Shanghai, the textile industrial city will be built with funds jointly provided by China Textile Association, Huayuan Corporation and local Qingpu government. The whole construction project is planned to be completed in eight to ten years. The textile industry in the city will possess all the features of advanced development, such as increased processing capacity of synthetic fibres, expansion of the output of textile products for purposes other than clothing, and close combination of textile industry with other sectors like commerce, foreign trade and finance. Already, many transnational corporations, including Du Pont, of the United States, have signed contracts and letters of intent with the industrial city, with a total investment of 200 million U.S. dollars involving large number of high-tech textile projects. According to the general manager of the industrial city, this pillar industry of China's economy and exports has long been strained by surplus productivity, with 30 to 40 percent of its equipment lying idle, irrational production structure, low added value in exports and reduction of profits. Transformation of the sector with the help of technological innovation and introduction of foreign funds has become urgent and the establishment of the industrial city is only the first step taken by the government.
