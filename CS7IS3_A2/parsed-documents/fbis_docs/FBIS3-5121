Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work exposed the reactionary nature of all abuses of socialism and their falsity and gave scientific answers to the questions of principle arising in defending the cause of socialism and carrying it to accomplishment. The work has evoked widespread repercussions upon the political, public and press circles of the world in the last one year since its publication for the invincibility and profundity of its contents. Former journalist of the Russian paper IZVESTIYA Ivan Robodap who had read the work said in an article titled "Hard Blow": "Comrade Kim Chong-il, with a clear-cut analysis, dealt a crushing blow to the attempts to hamstring and reverse the true significance of the contents of socialism, labelling it as `totalitarian', `barracks-like' and `administrative and commanding'. He completely unmasked the slanderers and renegades of the people's cause." The revolutionary parties of the world are unanimous in saying that the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il gives perfect answers to the questions raised by the present times and serves as a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon for all the progressive political parties aspiring after the building of a new society. They adopted the work as their must book or passed decisions supporting it. A meeting of the Political Bureau of the new Communist Party of Great Britain adopted the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il as a must book of the party and distributed it within the party, while the people's front of workers, peasants and students of Peru discussed the work at its political committee and adopted a resolution supporting it. Seminars on the work were held by the group for the study of the chuche idea of Comrade Kim Il-song in Austria, the Burkina national group of the chuche idea, chuche idea study groups and organisations for friendship and solidarity in Nepal, Tanzania and other countries. The Rwandan committee for the study of the chuche idea made public a statement supporting the work and mass media of different countries including "BOLSHEVIK", the magazine of the All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, carried articles introducing the work. And figures of political, public and other circles issued statements explaining the importance and significance of the work. Director General of the International Institute of the Chuche Idea Shuhachi Inoue who is the first winner of the "International Kim Il-song Prize", said after reading the work: "Socialism collapsed in some countries. But this cannot change the trend of the time. Today, mankind sees Korean-style socialism, the tower of success of socialism which stands in bolder relief, and gains confidence in socialism and its prospect from it. Frankly speaking, socialism is immediately Korea and vice versa today." Eric Trevett, general secretary of the Central Committee of the New Communist Party of Great Britain, said that the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il is a highly important work which deals a telling blow to the imperialists, world reactionaries and revisionists and inspires the revolutionary peoples of the world with hope and courage. The work of Comrade Kim Chong-il is a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon which gives a decisive blow to the counterrevolutionary moves and dastardly sophism of the imperialists and the foes of socialism and powerfully propels the socialist movement in the present times.
