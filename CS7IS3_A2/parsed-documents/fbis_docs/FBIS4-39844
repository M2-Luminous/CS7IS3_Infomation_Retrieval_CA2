The Kazakh newspaper EKSPRESS-K reports that the council had backed the appeal of a group of its members to the Kazakh Supreme Soviet, expressing alarmed in connection with the absence of a mechanism to implement the Kazakh-Russian agreement on the main principles and terms for the use of the cosmodrome. A resolution, adopted in this connection, notes that the slowness of the governments of the two countries in implementing the achieved agreements places the population of the town in a very difficult predicament. The financing of its infrastructure was slashed. People were virtually freezing in the production premises and in their apartments last winter. The cosmodrome facilities could not be used, because this is not allowed during very cold periods. The session's resolution was forwarded to corresponding committees and commissions of the Kazakh and Russian Parliaments.
