In the worst-hit of the farming areas administered by Beijing municipality, some people have to go as far as 10 kilometers to fetch water for villagers and livestock. Local officials said that changes have been made in irrigation projects now under construction so as to concentrate more funds and manpower on those for the purpose of fighting against drought. The government also decided that residents will temporarily be moved out of a few villages where the water situation has come to the worst. Since the beginning of the year, Beijing had only 2.1 mm of rain, while the total rainfall in 1993 was only one third of that in a normal year. Due to the sustained drought, the water stored in the Guanting and Miyun reservoirs, the capital's major water sources, dropped by 560 million cubic m compared with the same period last year, the 12 medium-sized reservoirs by 45 million cubic m, while most of the small reservoirs and pools have nearly dried up. Some 100,000 ha of the city's 160,000 ha of wheat farmland is now threatened by the drought. Nearly 100,000 people and 10,000 head of livestock are facing water shortages. Some 10,000 people have to fetch water from three km away, and some even from 10 km away.
