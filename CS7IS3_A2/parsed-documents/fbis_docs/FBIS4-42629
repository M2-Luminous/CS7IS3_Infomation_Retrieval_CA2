Speaking to SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, he described the first major speech that he would deliver after taking office --the speech scheduled for the 50th anniversary of 20 July -- as a test. The federal president has been spared the test. The chancellor has decided to step in. He wants to give the speech himself and has attracted disapproval from the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] and resistance associations. SPD's Rudolf Scharping -- it is being said that he himself would have liked to have delivered a speech on the anniversary -- explained yesterday that "it is impermissible for anyone to use the anniversary for election campaign purposes." He thinks it would have been appropriate if the chairman of a party that particularly suffered under the dictatorship of the Third Reich had been invited to take part in the event. Scharping now wants to express his views on the occasion "in an appropriate manner." The Federal Chancellery did not want to comment on the criticism. That Kohl should dominate the proceedings is something that resistance associations themselves do not want. Speaking to TAGESZEITUNG, Claritta von Trotz zu Solz, the widow of resistance fighter Adam von Trotz zu Solz who was executed in 1944, said: "I am very sad that a speech delivered by a man who stands for one particular political current will fail to reflect the diversity of the resistance, especially here in Kreisau District." Peter Steinbach, the director of German Resistance Monuments, has distanced himself from plans for the commemoration to date. He does not agree with the military ritual and would have preferred to have a civilian event, but failed to get his arguments accepted. The Federal Defense Ministry has planned a march by a guards battalion and a column of soldiers. Annemarie Renger, the former Bundestag speaker and chairman of the Central Association of Resistance and Persecuted Persons Organizations, has called for the main speech to be delivered by the president. However, the chancellery of future Federal President Roman Herzog states that it is aware of no such plans.
