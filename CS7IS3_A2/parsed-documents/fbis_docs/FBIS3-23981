The first summit took place last Friday; the second is scheduled for the end of this week. Yegor Timurovich is proposing to the trade union leaders cooperation with the "strict political structure" that he is forming on the basis of Russia's Choice. The structuring of the party-trade union bloc is to have been completed by March, before the elections to the local representative organs of power. The free trade unions (the Independent Miners' Union, Federation of Air-Traffic Controller Unions, SOTSPROF [Association of Socialist Trade Unions], and others) are considered democratic and oriented toward market reforms. One of their particular features is their relatively high strike activity, despite their relatively small numbers. The miners and air-traffic controllers are striking or declaring a state of pre-strike readiness almost continuously. The news that the chief "Russia's Choicer" was formalizing an alliance with the most restless union organizations has coincided with talk about a "general political strike," which could erupt in the spring. The first to warn the head of the government of this was the newspaper IZVESTIYA. Then Mikhail Poltoranin mentioned a "general political strike." The hard-line political statement of the Independent Miners Union in connection with Gaydar's resignation was then noticed. All this could be interpreted as some Freudian slips indicating either the subconscious desires or the deliberate plans of the democrats. Can they, who have hitherto accused their "Red-brown" opponents of the instigation of social conflicts, have now been engaging in this themselves? Opinions on this score vary. Aman Tuleyev, representing in the Federation Council the region where the Russian strike movement was conceived, believes this to be the case: "Russia's Choice will now heat up the political situation in order to clear out its opponents in the government. `Choice' and other democrats have direct contacts with the Independent Miners Union. Last December the miners were visited not only by Gaydar--Sobchak, Denisenko, and others spent days and nights with them. Several mines are already `laid up' with us today--this is simply not being reported. Political demands--the resignation of the government--are airily being added to the economic demands." "Senator" Tuleyev did not discern anything good in the intentions of the Russian democrats earlier either, and for this reason it is hard to call him an "entirely trustworthy source." Dmitriy Semenov, cochairman of the SOTSPROF, for example, considers the prospect of a political strike unrealistic: "I do not believe in a general strike--the people are not yet ready for this. A strike on political grounds in support of the policy of the departed Gaydar is even less likely. Of the trade unions, only the miners and the Federation of Air-Traffic Controller Unions could agree to this. The SOTSPROF Coordinating Council could `assign to the strike' certain branches of our union, but we would most likely not do so, lest we put our own people in jeopardy. No democrat has appealed to us with hints even of the desirability of a strike. Perhaps they have appealed to the miners or air-traffic controllers." Some common denominator shows through in these largely opposite opinions, however. The radical section of Russia's Choice is now, evidently, predisposed toward risky decisions. Both in September-October of last year and at preceding "pivotal moments," the democrats were strong precisely by virtue of their radical approach and their egress from the system into a meta-system--beyond the framework of rules, beyond the "constitutional field." And from their viewpoint a strike is beneficial--the president would then be forced to take emergency steps, in the course of which the "government of Red managers" and the intractable Duma would be sidelined politically, and the actions of the radical democrats themselves would increase. But the "Russia's Choicers" are pragmatists, and while keeping in mind the strike potentialities of the independent unions, they are nonetheless assigning them a different role--not so much the organizer of upheavals as the medium of an increase in their electorate. Here their interests interface with those of the union upper stratum. According to confidential information in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's possession, the union leaders want for an alliance with "Choice" to obtain ministerial positions in a future government. This plan presupposes the early dissolution of the Duma and new parliamentary elections. The moderate scenario of a "revanche of the democrats" not specifying the need for a general rebellion is, from the viewpoint of the union bosses, preferable. Not only in that it guarantees them ministerial office, but also in that it promises their organizations an appreciable gain in political weight and respectability in a "linkage" with the future "Gaydar party."
