On the occasion of my visit to this region, I would like to talk about a number of issues, especially regarding the situation in the country in general, and the security angle in particular. My initial intervention will deal with three fundamental points, which should be addressed in order to comprehend the current situation in the country. These points are: How did the general situation in the country evolve since the halt of the electoral process? Second, how did this situation develop during the term of the HSC [Higher State Council]? Third, what are the measures that the current power in office intends to take to achieve security, order, and to create the necessary conditions to establish a genuine democracy? Regarding the first point, I believe that it will be essential to remind you, albeit briefly, of the situation that had prevailed in the country before the halt of the democratic process. Algeria went through a decade during which the affairs of the state were mismanaged and the resources of the country were squandered, a matter that resulted in a multifold crisis that reached its peak during the 1988 October demonstrations. The message that young people, who were demonstrating, tried to put across was absolutely clear. These young people expressed the desire for a change in the political leadership, which led the country to bankruptcy. Unfortunately, this message was not grasped. For the sake of clinging to power, that regime decided to establish a suspicious democracy. Also, it laid down the 1989 Constitution that defined the rules of the democratic game and it frankly prohibited the creation of a party based on religious, linguistic, or regional basis. Such measures were implemented against a party that was founded on one of these criteria. In other words, values shared by all the Algerian people were monopolized for political purposes. When the regime got entangled into its contradictions, it started gradually making concessions to the forces of darkness [reactionary forces] that had quickly laid their hands on public means [as heard] that existed in the municipal and provincial people's councils, the mosques, etc. They were getting ready to seize all the power despite the fact that they only represented a tiny minority in Algerian society. This movement, Islamic Salvation Front, [FIS] never concealed its intention to eliminate the democratic system for good the day it seized power in view of the fact that this system, in its view, is a heresy and emanates from other civilizations strange to us. In other words, it used the democratic game as a means to seize power indefinitely. Parallel to this, the security situation had experienced a continuous deterioration. Public order became threatened and the public authority trodden upon. Anarchy and confusion prevailed in all sectors. The very rapid deterioration of the political, social, and security climate led patriotic forces aware of the fatal danger facing the country to make a decision that consisted in putting a stop to the destructive tendency and declare a state of emergency. Regarding the development of the situation since the installation of the HSC, we can say the following: The HSC had endeavored since its creation to achieve two things: First, the recovery of state authority and the creation of appropriate conditions for the return to a democratic path. Regrettably, in its search to have dialogue with the various social and political forces, it came across obstacles set up by some political parties out of politicking far away from the higher interests of the country. Despite all this, all the important social forces that represented millions of citizens took part in the national dialogue march that was crowned with a platform which clearly determined the rules of transition to a true political democracy. The stretched-hand policy of all the Algerians who were attached to the constitutional system and respected the fundamental national values was interpreted as an indication of weakness by forces that have always endeavored to impose by force and terror on the Algerians a suspicious and fictitious system that can only lead to the destruction of the country. We all know what happened in the countries in which similar systems were imposed: Comprehensive regression in all fields, civil wars, flight of the elite, division, explosion, etc. In our country, these forces perpetrate on a daily basis under the cover of our noble religion, which they interpret as they like, destructive, barbaric, savage terrorist acts. How can one justify in the name of Islam the killing of innocent men and women of all ages, children, young people, and mothers, the killing of those who are in the service of the state, which is one of the major gains of the Algerian revolution that enabled Algeria to resist colonialism, the killing of veterans and the sons of the martyrs who are one of the major symbols of the recovery of national sovereignty, the assassination of foreign nationals who came to Algeria to help it in its development, the assassination of genius, intellectuals, men of science and culture, and even religious men and ulemas. How can one use Islam to justify the destruction, sabotage, and burning of establishments, and public as well economic institutions that represent a national heritage, and which belong to all Algerians? How can one use Islam to violate the sanctity of places of worship? How can one use religion to justify acts of assault and robbery against financial premises; and robbing citizens of their possessions? What is more serious than this, is to launch an attack against the honor and dignity of citizens, as whole families have become targets of vile deeds whose victims are women and girls. How can one describe such barbaric acts as relating to Islam or what is called the jihad, considering that they are acts committed by an extremist, barbaric, and ignorant gang, who have been joined by offenders; criminals, thieves, drug addicts, and a number of youngsters who belong to families known for their dishonorable behavior during the revolution of liberation? Unfortunately, there are some youngsters, among these gangs, who have been fooled by false propaganda and have agreed to deal in crime. This has caused great regret for their families and parents. These crimes, which are committed in the name of Islam, are in fact crimes against Islam itself. It is true that a large number of people, among them people close to us, have expressed their sympathy with this tendency and have expressed their support for it. They believed its promises and held high hopes that it could usher in a better future. However, the sad course of events presented them with a chance to realize that these promises were actually deceitful, as their hope for a better life was turned into a horrible nightmare. The majority of them turned against this behavior whose perpetrators managed to learn from the Khmer Rouge, who were known for the destruction of their country and the annihilation of their peoples. The majority of Algerians know what would have happened to Algeria had the election process not been stopped at the appropriate time. The leadership of this movement was also on the verge of experiencing an internal explosion under pressure from the armed groups whose hard core was hit abroad when working for the benefit of foreign causes, which would have led the country to destruction, similarly to what is happening right now in some of the regions of the Islamic world. Regarding the political side of the crisis, the head of state had defined more than once the framework within which dialogue should take place with the social and political partners who abided by the fundamental national values that had led our revolution and also the constitutional system. Today, our fundamental and priority task consists in the rapid consolidation of state authority and public order, as well as guaranteeing the citizens' security and properties. In the eyes of the state, this is not just a sacred demand, but also a fundamental popular demand. This is what made us understand that our people had become a chosen target for terrorist acts. It insists on public authority to eliminate this plague. We will take this task in charge. The means mobilized so far to combat terrorism have fallen short of the seriousness of the situation. We are also determined to further mobilize the human and material resources of the country. We are also determined to use a radical remedy to eliminate for good this plague affecting Algerian society. In addition to the enormous means that the state started mobilizing, the citizens are also called upon to take part in an effective way in this fateful battle, within the framework defined by the public authority. Our people are now aware of the danger facing their future. We have no doubts that they will wage the battle against savagery and barbarism. We are fully convinced that the Algerian people and its state will come out victorious after this test, as the people had always proven during its long history. We will be victorious because we are determined that Algeria will recover its respectable position among nations, which it should not have lost in the first place, and that it Algeria returns to the path of its cultural, economic, and social development. We have every chance of success, and we will succeed with God's help. Peace be upon you.
