Here is our comment. In the past two years, Vietnam-Thailand relations have consolidated and developed in many fields. Exchange visits by many high ranking delegations have been made. On 15 October last year, party General Secretary Do Muoi went to Thailand after a visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. On 3 February this year, President of the Thai Parliament Mr. Marut Bunnak visited Vietnam, and, most importantly, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he will make an official visit to Vietnam. During summit meetings within the two countries, mutual understanding has been strengthened, contributing to the development of bilateral relations in many fields. The Thai prime minister as well as industrial, academic, and business leaders in Thailand all expressed admiration for Vietnam political developments and social stabilization. The coming visit to Vietnam by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai comes after lifting of the American embargo. He said: Relations will be strengthened between the two countries. In economic relations, Vietnam and Thailand have concluded exchange agreements including agreements on avoidance of double taxation and investment protection. Bilateral trade relations have developed rapidly from $65 million in 1990 to $158 million in 1993, and 30 Thai investment projects capitalized at over $120 million have been licensed by Vietnam. Many Thai senior government leaders have called on Thai businessmen to increase investment and trade activities in Vietnam. At a workshop held in Bangkok on Monday by the Thai newspapers THE NATION and BANGKOK BUSINESS [KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT], Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri called for closer cooperation between his country's government and private sector to improve Thai competitiveness in Vietnam and Indochina. Meanwhile, Thai businesspeople in Vietnam urge the Thai Government to promote an intergovernmental agreement on an Indochinese fund to help Thai businessmen in their competition and speed up the development of a system of road and maritime transport linking Thailand and Vietnam in order to promote trade and tourism. The Vietnamese Ambassador Le Cong Phung told the Bangkok workshop that the U.S. lifting of the trade embargo and step by step moving towards normalisation with Vietnam would not derail Vietnam foreign policy and its external economic relations, particularly those towards countries in Southeast Asia.
