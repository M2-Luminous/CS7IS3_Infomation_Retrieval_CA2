[passage omitted] On the state of the nation, the cabinet observed that there is effective calm throughout the whole country. The cabinet however condemned the fallacious statement made by a politician to the effect that there are disturbances in the northwestern part of the country. Contrary to that politician's false allegation, the government asserts that there is no detachment of the Special Presidential Division in that part of the country or a disturbing presence of the Sudanese Army on the Sudan-Zaire border. The government deplores the fact that at the time when all Zairians are awaiting definite solutions to our problems from the Palais du Peuple, some fellow citizens in search of the sensational are taking the liberty to sow doubt in the minds of the people for unavowed reasons, and are systematically deriding our Armed Forces with outrageous statements. In the face of such culpable irresponsibility, the government wishes to remind everyone that henceforth any statement discrediting our Armed Forces will be punished with the strongest force.
