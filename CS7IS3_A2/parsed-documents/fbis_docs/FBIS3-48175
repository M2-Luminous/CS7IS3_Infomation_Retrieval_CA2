FBIS3-48175 "dreas015_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-015 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 South Korea DPRK, IAEA, U.S. Negotiations Reviewed SK2201033294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0307 GMT 22 Jan 94 SK2201033294 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Jan 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea agreed, in principle, to open its seven declared nuclear sites to full international inspections in a meeting with the United States late last year, but negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on these inspections appear not to be proceeding as smoothly as was generally expected. In these negotiations, now under way between working-level officials in Vienna, North Korea is seeking to impose unacceptable limits on IAEA inspections of the nuclear sites in the face of the IAEA's formal request for full inspections in line with IAEA standards. Among the seven sites are a radiochemical laboratory and a 5-megawatt reactor, and the IAEA wants to conduct full inspections of these facilities under its nuclear safeguards regime. But North Korea has reportedly agreed to permit inspections of the seven facilities within the limits of ensuring the continuity of nuclear safeguards only, as it has suspended its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). North Korea's reasoning is that it has no obligation to meet full NPT requirements for inspections. North Korea wants to limit IAEA inspections to replacement of films and batteries of cameras set in the seven facilities, while denying IAEA inspectors access to fuel rods of the five-megawatt reactor and substances used by the radiochemical laboratory though the IAEA judges such access necessary for a meaningful inspection. This position of North Korea was manifested in an interview by an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry right after an agreement reached between North Korea and the United States on full inspections of North Korea's seven declared nuclear sites in New York late last year. The spokesman said in the interview with Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency on Dec. 30, just a day after a working-level meeting between North Korea and the United States in New York where the agreement was reached, that the United States had agreed to suspend the "Team Spirit" military exercise with South Korea and North Korea had agreed to permit international inspections of the declared nuclear sites not in line with the nuclear safeguards treaty but in line with the need to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards. When the agreement was put into effect, he said, the two countries would hold a third round of high-level talks to discuss an end to Washington's hostile policy toward Pyongyang, including a nuclear threat, for improved Pyongyang-Washington relations and resumption of regular IAEA inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities for a complete settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Commenting on the working-level North Korea-U.S. meeting in New York on Dec. 3, the same spokesman said in a statement that North Korea had offered a plan to expand the scope of inspections to the extent of ensuring the continuity of nuclear safeguards, adding that this offer was a maximum concession. This suggests that North Korea has no plan to permit full IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities until relations with the United States are improved. It just wants to allow IAEA inspections of its declared nuclear sites within the limit of ensuring the continuity of safeguards until a third round of the high-level talks with the United States is held to discuss resumption of regular IAEA inspections and improved relations between Pyongyang and Washington for a complete solution of the nuclear issue. Despite the on-going negotiations with the IAEA, North Korea is insisting on resumption of the talks with the United States, saying direct talks with Washington are a shortcut for solution of the nuclear issue. It appears to be paying little attention to the IAEA. A commentary in the Jan. 19 issue of the Workers' (Communist) Party organ, the NODONG SINMUN, reiterated that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must solved through direct talks between North Korea and the United States, calling for immediate holding of a third round of the high-level talks with the United States. "If the two sides hold a third round of the talks to discuss a package deal with a sincere and fair attitude to the dialogue, as agreed on in the Dec. 29 meeting in New York, the (nuclear) problem will be completely solved," it said.
