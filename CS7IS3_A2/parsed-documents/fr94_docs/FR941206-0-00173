FR941206-0-00173 FR941206-0-00019 IX. Test Methods A. Method 25D Method 25D in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is the applicable test method for the determination of the volatile organic concentration of wastes. Method 25D was originally proposed as a part of this rulemaking but was subsequently promulgated in a separate rulemaking (see 56 FR 19402, April 22, 1994). Responses to comments received on the proposed Method 25D as part of this rulemaking are presented in the BID for today's final rule. Additional comments and responses relevant to the proposed Method 25D that were received as part of other EPA rulemakings are available in Air Docket Number A&hyph;90&hyph;23 located at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket Information Center, Waterside Mall, room 1500, 1st Floor, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. The sampling requirements in Method 25D have been changed since proposal. The promulgated version of Method 25D requires that samples of waste be collected from a source following specific procedures for sampling a single-phase or well-mixed waste, a multiple-phase waste, and solid materials. Each sample is suspended in an organic/aqueous matrix, then heated and purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes to separate certain organic compounds. A portion of the sample is analyzed for carbon concentration, as methane, with a flame ionization detector. The other portion of the sample is analyzed for chlorine concentration, as chloride, with an electrolytic conductivity detector. The volatile organic concentration of the waste is then computed as the sum of the measured carbon and chlorine contents. B. Method 25E Method 25E is the applicable test method for determining the organic vapor pressure of waste managed in tanks. The version of Method 25E promulgated today in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is the same as the proposed version with one addition to the sampling requirements to provide for sampling waste in a tank. Method 25E requires collection of a waste sample in a headspace sample vial and transfer of the vial to a balanced pressure headspace sampler. The headspace vapor of the sample is analyzed for carbon content by a headspace analyzer, which uses a flame ionization detector. X. Administrative Requirements A. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in these rules have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and have been assigned control number 1593.02. To aid the EPA with enforcement of the rule being promulgated today, TSDF owners and operators and hazardous waste generators subject to today's action are required to record certain information in the on-site facility operating logs or files. The recordkeeping requirements for each respondent (i.e., person subject to the rule) will vary depending on a variety of site-specific factors. These factors include: the number of tanks, surface impoundments, and containers subject to the rule in operation at the respondent's facility; the number of hazardous waste streams managed at the facility; the type of waste determination methods selected by the respondent; and the type of air emission control equipment selected by the respondent to comply with the requirements of the rule. This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 1.4 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 62.5 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. In general, a respondent is not required to submit any reports to the EPA unless certain events occur at the respondent's facility in which a hazardous waste is improperly managed in a unit not using the required air emission controls or a control device malfunction cannot be corrected by the respondent within 24 hours of being detected. Thus, the EPA expects that many respondents complying with this rule will have no reporting burden. On a nationwide average basis, the public reporting burden resulting from today's action is estimated by the EPA to be approximately 2 hours per year per respondent. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., S.W. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention Desk Officer for EPA.'' B. Executive Order 12866 Review Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.'' Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' based on the estimated annual cost of the rulemaking to the economy (i.e., the EPA's estimate of nationwide annual costs for the subpart CC standards exceeds $100 million). As such, the EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), whenever a Federal agency publishes any proposed or final rule in the Federal Register , it must prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is not necessary, however, if the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The EPA has established guidelines for determining whether an RFA is required for the EPA rulemaking. These guidelines state that, if a preliminary analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would affect 20 percent or more of ``small entities'', then an RFA is to be prepared. In addition, these guidelines are used to evaluate if a regulation will have a ``significant impact'' on small entities. A regulation is considered by the EPA to have a ``significant impact'' if any one of the following four criteria is met: (1) Annual compliance costs increase the relevant production costs for small entities by more than 5 percent; (2) The ratio of compliance costs to sales will be 10 percent higher for small entities than for large entities; (3) Capital costs of compliance will represent a significant portion of the capital available to small entities, taking into account internal cash flow plus external financing capabilities; (4) Costs of the regulation will likely result in closures of small entities. The EPA used the economic impact model developed for the RIA to estimate the effects of today's rulemaking on small entities (refer to Chapter VI of the RIA for additional details). The results of this analysis indicate that the effects of the air standards on small entities are minimal. The number of affected small entities is insubstantial, and the impacts are insignificant. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that these final rules promulgated today will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, an RFA is not required for this rulemaking.
