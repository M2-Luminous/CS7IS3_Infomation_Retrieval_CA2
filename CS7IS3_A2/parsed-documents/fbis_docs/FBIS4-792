The crash of the Rwandan presidential jet occurred as the aircraft was approaching the airport in the Rwandan capital Kigali on a flight from Tanzannia, where the two leaders had discussed efforts to end friction between the Hutu and Tutsi groups afflicting both countries. Rwandan authorities charged that the plane had been shot down, although officials here have spoken only of an "accident." While Burundi remained calm after the incident, inter-ethnic fighting erupted in Rwanda and has now left at least 20,000 people dead and caused thousands of refugees to stream into neighboring countries. The Burundi cabinet members who perished in the crash were Communications Minister Cyriaque Simbizi and Planning Minister Bernard Ciza.
