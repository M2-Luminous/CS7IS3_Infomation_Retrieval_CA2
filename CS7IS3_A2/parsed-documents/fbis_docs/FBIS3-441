Apart from that, political activity in the country seems to be focussed on the consultations convened by President Omar Bongo for today. From all indications, the preparatory meeting for the consultations was not held. The opposition says it is in favor of the consultations. It called for dialogue following the recent bloody clashes in Libreville but wants several conditions to be met before taking part in the consultations. These include the lifting of the state of alert and the holding of discussions elsewhere other than at the Presidential Palace. As Pierre-Louis Agondjo-Okawe -- the opposition second in command -- stated at a news conference this afternoon, the opposition also wants the United Nations, the OAU, the European Union, the United States, France, and Canada to mediate. Jean-Valere Mbinamanza was at the conference. [Begin Agondjo-Okawe recording] There should absolutely be international participation in order to guarantee the true implementation of what we say and decide upon. We do not want to be taken for a ride, as happened with the so-called monitoring committee that was set up after the national conference. That happened because negotiations were held among Gabonese. This time, we want a third party to guarantee that what is decided upon will be implemented. The most important thing in our view is to have transparent democracy. [end recording]
