This was reported in the local press by General Major Vladimir Shilimov, who was appointed, by edict of the president, head of the FSK [Federal Counterintelligence Service] department dealing with Ulyanovsk Oblast. Among the facilities evoking the sustained interest of the Western special services, he named the atom reactor scientific research institute in Dimitrovgrad; the Ulyanovsk engineering plant, where antiaircraft and missile complexes superior to the best foreign analogues are produced; the joint-stock company Aviastar, with its Ruslans and Tu-204's; and also the 104th airborne division, which was redeployed in Ulyanovsk last year and which is subject to NATO inspection. The Ulyanovsk security officers are also concerned about the appearance at several classified military units of Western religious preachers. The head of local counterintelligence cited interesting facts from the life of the department. For example, last year several Western firms undertook an attempt to compromise the Ruslan airplane on the international market, but these efforts were thwarted by the Ulyanovsk security officers. And the imeni Volodarskiy machine-building plant intended to deliver to Armenia a line for the production of live cartridges. This illegal deal was also averted by local counterintelligence officers.
