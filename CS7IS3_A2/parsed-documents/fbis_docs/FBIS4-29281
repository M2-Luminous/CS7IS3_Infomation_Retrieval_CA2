A U.S. Embassy official in Tokyo reportedly presented to the Japanese Government on 7 June a report stating Washington's opposition to the establishment of EAEC because it could cause a negative impact on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. This is the first time that the Clinton administration has issued a clear signal that it opposes the setting up of the EAEC. Prior to this, the administration embarked on a wait-and-see attitude. Speaking to newsmen after witnessing the signing of two agreements involving the transfer of waste water treatment technology to Thailand and Iran, the prime minister confirmed that this was Washington's official stand regarding EAEC. Regarding Japan, which has yet to articulate its stand on the EAEC, Dr. Mahathir said the government will continue to make clarifications so that the country accepts the establishment of the caucus.
