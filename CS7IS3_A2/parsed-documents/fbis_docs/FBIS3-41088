The narcotic was discovered in special compartments of a transformer stored in the packing department of a well-known freight shipping company. In making the foregoing announcement, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic added that the consignees of the drugs would soon be arrested. It is believed that this will have ramifications on the country's northern border, because the alkaloid presumably was to be sent to a construction firm with headquarters in that area. It was intended for subsequent shipment to the United States for sale and consumption. [passage omitted]
