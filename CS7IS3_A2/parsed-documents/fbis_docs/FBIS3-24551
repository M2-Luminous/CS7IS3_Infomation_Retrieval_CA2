Shortly before the election the politically most active part of the academic community--the members of the Club of Voters attached to the Russian Academy of Sciences--decided to direct attention to their ``party affiliation.'' A press conference was held in this regard at the Parliamentary Center. Thus, with whom is the KIAN [Club of Voters attached to the Russian Academy of Sciences]? The club decided to support two blocs: the one headed by Yavlinskiy, Boldyrev, and Lukin, and Russia's Choice. Lyudmila Vakhnina, cochairman of the KIAN, noted that many scientists had displayed adherence to principles, having chosen in favor of Choice, in spite of the fact that they were in the social category which had suffered greatly during the reforms. As Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the Coordinating Council of the club, explained at the press conference, this was done for the following reasons. Russia's Choice is the party of power, which needs constructive opposition. For the good of the reforms that are being implemented by it. Especially now, when in the structures of power there are forces that are trying to suppress any displays of dissidence. The alternative democratic bloc should become such opposition. The bloc of Yavlinskiy, they decided in the KIAN, will cope best of all with this task. Moreover, it had not been possible to discover in the programs of any of the associations provisions in which science was specified as a sphere of state interest. The KIAN has a plan of the reform of science, and the bloc of Yavlinskiy had integrated it into its own program. In the opinion of A. Zakharov, the mistake of the reformers was that they, having indicated the necessity of state support of world-level research, did not propose a mechanism of its selection. As a result real transformations did not occur, while the financing of all research and development was merely cut back. The Club of Voters believes that the competitive financing of priority research in case of an independent examination and the creation of the appropriate legislative base should be at the basis of the new scientific and technical policy. The support group of the bloc of Yavlinskiy from the KIAN gathered about 10,000 signatures of voters in support of the bloc, mainly at regional academic centers. Eight candidates from six regional organizations of scientists were placed on the ticket of the ``Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc'' association, while Aleksey Zakharov was nominated for the State Duma on the federal part of the ticket. We will report in subsequent issues on how successful the participation of the Club of Voters in the election was.
