Doubtless the success of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] in the election for the Lower Saxon Landtag represents a personal victory of its top candidate. Minister-President Schroeder knew how to show himself to be the more experienced candidate relative to his challenger Wulff. But can one conclude from this that the three-time winner Chancellor Kohl will prevail in the same manner over his young challenger Scharping in the Bundestag election? That would mean that the experience and routine of the top candidates decide elections. But what about the other qualities of the matadors? Furthermore: Is it really just a duel between the chancellor candidates in which the parties do not count at all? Does anyone want to assert that the SPD would have lost its mandate to govern in Lower Saxony if it had not been for Schroeder or that the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] will win the Bundestag election despite its weakness because it has Kohl? Schroeder as the Trump Card In any case, it is true in this respect that Schroeder was the best trump card of the SPD in Lower Saxony. Only he made possible what a minority of 22 percent had expected and only 37 percent had wanted: the SPD gained the absolute majority of the seats. About half the voters prefer him as minister-president, according to the latest surveys of the Election Research Group in Mannheim (it works for ZDF [German TV Two]) and the Infas Institute in Godesberg (it works for ARD [German TV One]). On the other hand, only a good fifth (according to Infas) to one-third (according to the Election Research Group) expressed themselves in favor of Wulff. Corresponding with this is the fact that the voters between the Ems and the Elbe assess Schroeder better (plus/minus 1.4 on a scale of from plus 5 to minus 5) than the SPD. But the first crack in this explanation appears when one notes that Wulff (plus 1.2) also appears better than the land-CDU in the eyes of the voters of Lower Saxony. The second crack arises in the fact that it is not Kohl (a meager minus 0.3 on the scale of the Election Research Group) who is judged better by the voters of the entire nation but Scharping (a likewise less than exciting plus 1.1). Of course personally Kohl was never brilliant in preelection polls. But whenever Kohl triumphed, he had a two-stage rocket to thank for it: the first stage that advanced him a considerable distance was the confidence in the economic competence of the Union. The second stage was the expectation that Kohl would be best able to apply this competence. The two-stage rocket still exists and in times of economic crisis it is even the best wonder weapon in elections. In Lower Saxony, however, it was not the CDU but rather the SPD that ignited this rocket. What at least a relative majority normally attributes to the CDU is now expected of the SPD by the biggest share of the voters: the key qualification of sound economic policy. The pollsters see this expectation of the economic competence of the SPD not only in Lower Saxony, but also everywhere in Germany. In Lower Saxony, then, the confidence in Schroeder and the hopes for the SPD have reinforced each other. Only rarely has an economic theme been so much in the foreground of an election campaign: almost 70 percent of those eligible to vote characterized unemployment as the biggest problem; far behind in second place (15 percent) was environmental pollution. Ten days before the election, the Allensbach Institute for Opinion Polling found out that it was above all the unemployed and their families who are more likely to believe that the SPD rather than the CDU can solve the problems in Lower Saxony (45.5 to 17.6 percent). But the population as a whole also believed the SPD to be more competent (34.5 to 18.5 percent). There is also the impression that Schroeder radiates optimism (61.1 percent believe this). That also explains why 8 percent of the SPD-voters came over from the CDU, according to a calculation by Election Research Group. Where Schroeder got personally involved to save industrial jobs, the SPD even gained votes in the election in Lower Saxony. Often the voters do not want to recognize the connection between the combatting of unemployment and economic performance, and they attribute to the SPD more ability to reduce unemployment, whereas they see the CDU as having more competence to get the economy moving. The thrust is much greater when the voters see both capabilities united in the SPD. With Kohl, the Union will hope that those eligible to vote do not really believe that. It will say to itself that the voters are only half serious about an election of the landtag, but are totally serious about a Bundestag election. As a matter of fact, there was a hint in February that the CDU was recovering: in the mood barometer of the Election Research Group, it rose by 4 percentage points to 35 percent in Germany as a whole, and the SPD fell 2 percentage points to 42 percent. But the gap is still seven points and that is a lot. It is even larger in the Allensbach survey for this newspaper: there the SPD led by 13 percent at the beginning of March, having 47 percent compared with 34 percent for the CDU. To be sure, the CDU would have done even worse in Lower Saxony if the election had been in January. Its slight recovery in all of western Germany stands against further lost votes in the east. The second advantage of the SPD is that it appears to have a secure coalition partner, whereas the CDU does not. Just as in Hamburg, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] will not be in the Lower Saxon Landtag either. It lost 1.6 points and that is devastating for a small party. And presently things do not look better for the Free Democrats in the nation as a whole. In mid-February, the Election Research Group signaled that for the first time since the last Bundestag election the FDP had fallen below 5 percent in all of Germany; also in mid-February, the Allensbach Institute for Opinion Polling registered only 4 percent for the FDP and by the end of February and beginning of March it was a paper-thin 5 percent. A comparable weakness under conflicting conditions (participating in the government in Bonn and in the opposition in Hannover) will prolong the FDP's uncertainty until the Bundestag election on 16 October. The FDP lacks a personality like Genscher. It is a matter of two things: the party and its top people. Splinter Parties in a Downward Trend The results in Lower Saxony confirm what polls are signaling for all of Germany: the splinter parties will not be in the Bundestag, although it cannot be overlooked that the Republikaner achieved 5 percent in 13 of 100 electoral districts of Lower Saxony. On 16 October, there will be only one fateful decision: will the FDP also shrink down to a splinter party? In this election year, the voters appear to be thinking about the big parties. The "party of the nonvoters," as Infas calls it, has not--contrary to what previously happened in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, and Brandenburg--grown into the strongest party. Return to normalcy? What would be normal without the FDP? With the Greens as a normal party, normalcy would shift to the left.
