Kovalenko and M. Berger, devoted to the Dutch company GMM [Global Money Management Trust]. Since Mikhail Berger focused his attention on the activity of this company, or to be more precise its office in Moscow, and also voiced a negative opinion of the Central Bank on this issue, I should like to answer this correspondent. The office of the Dutch trust company "Trust Financial Services BV" is registered in Moscow. Under Russian legislation the offices of foreign firms are not corporate bodies and do not have the right to engage in commercial (economic) activity. Thus, by taking money from citizens and corporate bodies, whether it was in rubles or hard currency, GMM twice violated Russian legislation. The first time when it embarked on commercial activity while it only had the status of an office. And the second time when it began operations involving money, which is only permitted to banks, while GMM is not a bank. By calling its operations trust operations GMM is operating in a legislative vacuum since there is no law on trust in Russia and the company is very well aware of the fact. Trust operations presuppose that the owners of temporarily free money and securities entrust their management to trust companies with a view to deriving a profit. At the same time in the absence of a law on trust in Russia we have an adequate institutional basis for conducting operations involving the financial resources of corporate bodies and the population. That includes primarily banks and investment funds and in this connection GMM's maxim to the effect that it is introducing a new type of service onto the money market and we are not accepting it is unfounded. And it is a very great pity that M. Berger, who has quite a good understanding of economics, should seem to be vindicating GMM's piratical actions when he speaks of "the incomprehensibility of Russian legislation, which allows an ambiguous interpretation of obvious things." It is true that he does not explain what obvious things and ambiguous interpretation he means. Now about the fact that in M. Berger's opinion GMM is deeply "obligated to the Central Bank, which is not reacting in any way to the invasion of a foreign company onto the Russian financial market." I ask to be forgiven for being obliged to say banal things but every public statement, particularly in the press, should be based on a knowledge of the facts. And the facts are that in late November I and administration chief Ye. Ivanov had a conversation with A. Liozner [name as transliterated], GMM's Moscow representative. He was informed of the illegal nature of the office's activity in attracting money in connection with the fact that it has no banking license and he was asked to halt this activity immediately or, if the office wanted to continue it, to start work on the creation of a bank. On 23 December GMM was sent a letter from our main administration in which the company was once more asked to dissolve the contracts concluded with Russian Federation residents and stop advertizing for funds from Russian residents. And another thing -- about advertizing. In IZVESTIYA 12 November this year [as published] in an article entitled "Panama-3" M. Berger together with V. Kornev wrote in particular of their colleagues who are advertizing illegal activity: "...we are deeply convinced that newspapers and television companies which advertize the activity of firms with no legal right to undertake this activity should share the responsibility toward people who may be misled with their aid. Our esteemed colleagues, ask for your advertizers' licenses if they want, for instance, to take citizens' investments or vouchers. If they do not have the necessary documents, refuse this source of revenue." And they also wrote: "Esteemed colleagues, advertising is something more specific than bank notes. For this reason it can smell, sometimes very badly." I absolutely agree but what about similar advertizing in IZVESTIYA? I should like to draw Mikhail Lvovich's attention to the advertisement of the "LEND" joint-stock company, slightly below and to the left of his article on GMM in the 24 December issue, in which the company promises first to take rubles from its client, then to convert them into currency, and to transfer the currency from a Swiss bank to anywhere in the world. Usually "LEND" offers an interest rate of 36 percent per annum (see IZVESTIYA 25 December, for instance) without the right to work with money. Examples of similar advertizing in IZVESTIYA could be continued but I hope the editorial office itself will discover the "harmful" advertizing and draw the necessary conclusions. And for the future we are prepared for constructive cooperation with the newspaper since we can see mutual interest in it. [Smirnov ends] From the editorial office: We are pleased that our assessments of GMM's activity in RUssia coincides with what the Central Bank of Russia thinks of it. But we want to draw attention to the fact that the outcome of similar thinking in the editorial office and the state institution can be fundamentally different. In the newspaper that outcome is a newspaper article, at the Central Bank it involves actions which accord with the situation. Obviously it is important to explain to the lawbreakers that they are breaking the law. It is good that the currency regulation administration has done this twice: first verbally and then in writing. But what next? Even before the Russian Ministry of Finances had tried to explain to GMM that the company was operating illegally. But if the lawbreaker, despite a large amount of explanatory work, continues his fruitful illegal activity, collecting money from credulous or reckless citizens, then who should take steps? Should it not be the Central Bank? Yes, we accept the rebukes over the publication of advertizing by dubious financial organizations, including LEND, of the illegality of whose actions Vladimir Smirnov kindly informs us. But under the law we are not obliged to check the authenticity of information supplied by the advertizer. To refuse such advertizing is a matter for our good will. While the Central Bank simply has to react immediately and effectively to the emergence of illegal banks and other gathers of money. But unfortunately practice shows that the Central Bank is either reluctant or unable to protect Russians from illegal "plowmen" in the russian money field. That is borne out by the experience of the successful illegal banking activity of the "Russkiy Dom Seleng," GMM, and others. Proceeding from this premise we insist that GMM and other similar companies which have already appeared and perhaps intend to develop their activity should be eternally thankful to the Central Bank for its total inability to offer any resistance to the illegal financiers.
