This is another important part in the implementation of the primary task of our legislative organization. In studying and considering the two draft laws, members of the National Assembly made impressive efforts to contribute invaluable views to the improvement of the two laws by linking them to realities. This clearly shows that our National Assembly members always adhere to the party's stand and the roles of the National Assembly. That is why they have again firmly maintained a sense of mastery and held aloft a sense of political responsibility. Compared with the old laws, the two new laws that have been amended and endorsed are more exemplary and conform to the current reality. Almost all articles in the Law on the Promotion and Management of Foreign Investment in the LPDR have been amended to conform to our party and state policy of broadening economic relations and cooperation with foreign couuntries. The amended law will serve to attract, persuade, and create confidence for friendly countries, international organizations, and foreign investors to invest in Laos; to ensure the rights and interests of investors as well as the interests and sovereignty of our country; and to create favorable conditions for foreign investors in our country. Some articles of the Labor Law have also been amended and added to. This is to plug certain loopholes, ensure and protect the legitimate rights and interests of both employees and employers, thereby encouraging them to fulfill their respective obligations, gradually making its contents more universal and accommodating to the requirements in the implementation of the party's policy of restructuring and the state's socioeconomic plan, effectively contributing to the development of human resources in our country. Our meeting studied, considered, and elected the chairman of the Supreme People's Court and the people's general prosecutor. Their election was carried out through secret ballot. This is the first time National Assembly members have exercised their voting rights through secret ballot to elect suitable persons to two important judiciary organizations. The process reaffirms the full exercise of democratic rights by National Assembly members. The meeting also studied and contributed views to the draft internal regulations of the National Assembly. This shows that we have transformed the contents of the National Assembly Law into details to suit the reality of resolving assembly work. This law serves to further consolidate and perfect the National Assembly machinery and to create favorable conditions for members to conduct their duties of representing the people and safeguarding their rights and interests. The meeting reviewed and assessed the strengths and weaknesses and drew lessons from National Assembly activities carried out since the convening of the second ordinary session. It assessed that these activities have just begun and that we must continue to endeavor to overcome numerous obstacles with a sense of revolutionary enthusiasm to fulfill all historical obligations entrusted by the people. Respected personages, the enactment, amendment, and promulgation of a law is always important. But the most important thing reflecting the effectiveness of the promulgated law is its implementation and translation into reality. To effectively implement a law, first of all, I would like to ask the government to adopt appropriate measures to facilitate its implementation. Meanwhile, National Assembly members also have the duty to train, educate, and mobilize the people of all strata to take part in the revolution. Our meeting elected the chairman of the Supreme People's Court and the people's general prosecutor. This is to further consolidate and invigorate the two judiciary organizations in implementing the Constitution and other laws. To achieve this, we must continue assisting these organizations to carry out their tasks to ensure justice in our society. To put the successful results of this meeting into practice, I call on all National Assembly members to consider again Party Chairman Khamtai Siphandon's speech at the second ordinary session of the Third National Assembly on the duties and responsibilities of the National Assembly and its members. To raise our political responsibility as representatives of the rights and interests of the multiethnic people, let us strive to overcome all obstacles and difficulties in disseminating the successful results of this meeting among the people in all regions, and mobilize them to translate the resolution adopted at this meeting into reality. At the same time, I call on all of you to begin drafting the substance of certain laws which will be deliberated in the coming ordinary session to ensure the quality of the laws enacted and amended, thereby gradually perfecting our legal system. This is the urgent central task which National Assembly members must fulfill in the immediate future. I call on all compatriots of all strata, ethnic groups, and ages to further enhance the tradition of patriotism and a sense of mastery, to unite in implementing the tasks of national defense and reconstruction, and to translate into reality the 1993-94 socioeconomic development plan and the Constitution and other laws. I call on all party, state, and mass organizations as well as administrative organizations and services at all levels to cooperate and to create favorable conditions for National Assembly members to carry out their role as people's representatives to fulfill the tasks entrusted by the party and people. On this auspicious occasion, on behalf of the National Assembly, I would like to once again thank the party chairman, all members of the Political Bureau, and advisers to the party Central Committee for sacrificing your precious time to attend this meeting. I hereby officially declare the third ordinary session of the Third National Assembly closed. Thank you.
