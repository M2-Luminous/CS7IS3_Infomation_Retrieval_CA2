The fate of Ukraine is in the fate of the Dnieper River. From times immemorial, the Dnieper has been a source of livelihood, a defender, and a savior for the people who lived in its valley. Its banks became a cradle for the Ukrainian nation and for the first human cereal-growing civilization -- the Trypillya culture. The genius of Ukraine's great son T.G. Shevchenko matured and derived inspiration on the banks of the Dnieper. The immortal bard found his last refuge there, too.... For the majority of Ukraine's population -- 35 million persons -- the Dnieper continues to be the indispensable source of drinking water; it satisfies the needs of industry and irrigated agriculture; it is also used as an economic transport line. Not to mention the Dnieper's significance for the spiritual world of the people as a source for literary and artistic creativity! Throughout its age-old history, the Slavutych [a poetic name for the Dnieper] repeatedly suffered enfeebling droughts and destructive floods. However, recent decades have become particularly ominous for the great river. The epoch of hydrological construction culminated in the creation of six water reservoirs: Kiev, Kaniv, Kremenchuk, Dniprodzerzhynsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kakhovka. The semi-flowing water reservoirs, created in the flat- country river, have lost their eternal purity and the life-giving properties of the Dnieper water. The yearly mass development of blue-green algae -- the algal bloom, the formation of slime, the swamping of huge shallow-water areas, the chemical pollution, and, as a result, the sharp deterioration of the biological quality of the water -- this is a very incomplete list of afflictions suffered by Ukraine's life-giving artery. Great changes have taken place in the qualitative composition of the ichthyofauna; valuable species of fish -- sturgeon, pike, and carp -- have disappeared or decreased in number, whereas fish of inferior value, such as clupeids, gudgeon, or rudd, have multiplied. However, the Chernobyl nuclear tornado has introduced the most dreadful poison into the Dnieper. As a result of the accident, the natural ecosystems in the Dnieper Basin have also undergone wide- scale radioactive contamination. On the first days after the catastrophe, fragments of uranium fissure were driven by the wind in various directions and over huge distances away from the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant, contaminating woods, fields, water reservoirs and becoming deposited in plant and animal organisms. Prior to the accident, the background content of radionuclides in the water of the Kiev Reservoir was as follows: strontium-90, between 0.00407 and 0.00682 becquerels per liter; cesium-137, between 0.00074 and 0.0037 becquerels per liter. The radioecological situation in the Dnieper and in its reservoirs largely took shape during the first weeks and months following the accident, when the content of radionuclides in the water reached between 0.04 and 1,332 becquerels per liter and up to 800,000 becquerels per kilogram of natural moisture content in bottom deposits. Among the main tasks during the period that has passed after the accident there was work associated with the protection of water bodies, in particular, the building of dams and traps on the path of the main flows of radionuclides and the fixation of soil in the areas of drainage. Despite the considerable expenditure and the large volume of work aimed at reducing the travel of radionuclides from the 30-kilometer zone, the escape of radionuclides to the Prypyat River, the Dnieper River, and its reservoirs could not be appreciably reduced. For example, at the end of 1993, the content of radionuclides in the Kiev Water Reservoir was as follows: in bottom sediments, 26 becquerels per kilogram strontium-90 and 815 becquerels per kilogram cesium-137; in plants, respectively, 102 and 407; in mollusks, 138 and 195; and in fishes, 13 and 211. At the present stage, the radioecological situation in the Dnieper and its reservoirs remains unstable. The content of radionuclides in the water is between 10 and 20 and in aqueous organisms 30 to 1,500 times that prior to the accident. Some carnivorous fishes in the Kiev Reservoir were found to contain cesium-137 in quantities that were one and one-half times the permissible level established in 1993 by the National Commission for Radiation Protection.
