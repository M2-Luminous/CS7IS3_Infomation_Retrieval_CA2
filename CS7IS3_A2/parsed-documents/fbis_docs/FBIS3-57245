Kozyrev said that neither the patriots, nor the fascists influence Russian foreign policy in any way. However, he apologized for the "fascist statements made in Moscow recently." The protection of ethnic Russians in the former Soviet republics has nothing to do with imperialism, he continued. He emphasized, though, that "we cannot remain indifferent to violations of ethnic Russians' rights, particularly in Latvia, from where they are being forced out." Akayev said that he did not see any imperial ambitions in Russia's foreign policy. "Without a strong and great Russia, stability in Eurasia is unthinkable," he said. Speaking about the problem of dual citizenship, he noted that it should be tackled on a bilateral basis. Kozyrev announced that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was to arrive in Bishkek shortly for comprehensive talks on economic cooperation.
