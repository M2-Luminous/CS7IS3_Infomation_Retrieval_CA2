It is costing Bonn a lot of money. From a distance, the monstrous dome towering over the village of Werthoven near Bonn looks like a space station. Anyone trying to learn the answer to the puzzle that dominates the rural idyll here quickly gets into trouble. "No photography here," say the guards to curious sightseers. "Go back, this is of no concern to you." The guards watch over one of Germany's secret institutes, the Research Institute of Applied Natural Sciences (FGAN). According to peace researcher Erich Schmidt-Ennboom, the institute in question, unusual in that it is a registered association entitled to be treated as a charity and enjoying tax privileges, is a BND front. German reconnaissance personnel, whose work is supposed to be limited solely to foreign countries according to the law, are using this institute to develop new espionage and reconnaissance methods without being disturbed. Even Bundestag deputies consider the enterprise a "quite mysterious affair," which, according to one security expert, "no one has taken a closer look at." But for members of the Budget Committee, "Effgann," as it is called by insiders, is supposedly not so mysterious. It is virtually a federal enterprise. With an annual budget of 65 million marks [DM], the mysterious institute is almost fully financed out of the federal budget. In 1994, only DM100,000 of this DM65 million came from private sources. The members of the institute are an exclusive group. For years, the exclusive circle has never exceeded ten. They include leading enterprises in the German armaments industry such as Dasa, Siemens, Dornier, Atlas Elektronik, and MAN Gutehoffnungshuete. The institute's task is the pursuance of "scientific research mainly in the fields of electronics, cybernetics, and information science," in the "interests of national defense." But in fact, FGAN is paid for by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, who lavishes out of his ministerial budget some DM41 million for operations, almost DM4 million for investments, and DM19 million for projects. "Original defense research constitutes almost 100 percent of the institute's work," says Horst Heger, executive member of the board. Appropriately enough, the institute's clientele is restricted. The recipients of the institute's work are the defense minister and the armaments industry. This work is actually performed at state expense. In any case, contributions from members do not possess any significance in the FGAN business plan. If necessary, the scientists also supply information to the Federal Chancellery and "other relevant and competent organs in the federation and in the laender," says board chairman Friedrich Wiekhorst, thereby suggesting recipients whose names are better left undisclosed, such as the secret services. Altogether, FGAN maintains six agencies whose capacity is closely linked to military and intelligence needs. For instance, the Research Institute for High Frequency Physics (FHP) is developing new radar procedures to improve "efficiency, even in the face of enemy weapons." With an antenna of 34 meters in diameter, the Wethhoven station is the "largest radar facility in Europe," claims Wiekhorst. With it, the scientists can observe the functions and operations of even military satellites high in earth's orbit. Wiekhorst: "We are not looking for stars. We just want to know what is going on up there." Wiekhorst brushes aside a question whether the intelligence service lies at the roots of all this research. "We take a look at the things up there and draw conclusions," he says. During the Cold War, the scientists, considered the best in the world, would have "cooperated to the best of their ability in preventing a surprise attack," says Wiekhorst. The Federal Government had committed them to this task. But Wiekhorst says the institute has no idea who receives the results of observations and experiments on an individual basis. The institute's Research Institute for Radio and Mathematics develops mathematical and technical procedures for computers on reconnaissance systems, something also of great interest to intelligence services. "After all, we have the right to listen to the electromagnetic waves that flow through our facility," says Wiekhorst. Wiekhorst dismisses as a "lie" the accusation that FGAN with its subsidiaries is merely one of the BND's fronts. Needless to say, the BND in Pullach does not deny "points of contact" with FGAN. A leading BND official says that there have been contacts between FGAN and the BND "for ages." There is "nothing exciting" about that. It is just a "well-worn story among the employees." The institute's eavesdropping and surveillance experts have allegedly taken part in "specialized talks between the BND and the Bundeswehr leadership" for a long time. The FHP high frequency physicists cooperate with BND Department III (Analysis) in matters concerning space flight reconnaissance and satellite observation. In addition, the institute has received occasional requests from the BND to perform a particular study. However, whether or not the confidential cooperation will continue to run so smoothly in the future hangs in the balance because the fiscal authorities are knocking on the research institute's door. The tax office at St. Augustin near Bonn doubts whether the research work is "exclusively and directly for the common welfare," something which the FGAN has been claiming for years in order to be exempt from turnover tax. Both the tax office and the Finance Ministry in Dusseldorf agree that research in defense technology "is not directly connected to the broad common good." As a result, a legal dispute has been brewing in the fiscal court in Cologne for five years. A defeat there could prove very expensive for researchers in defense and intelligence work. Their tax arrears already add up to over DM70 million. "And we cannot pay that," moans Wiekhorst.
