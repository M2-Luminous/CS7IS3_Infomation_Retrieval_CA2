Journalists were informed of this by Valentin Sergeyev, head of the Russian Federation's government press service at the end of the session, which lasted for an hour behind closed doors. He said that questions on the organization of the work of the Cabinet of Ministers in 1994 were examined at the session. Viktor Chernomyrdin, who chaired the session, said that the government would probably now meet more frequently than it did last year, and that the Presidium would meet perhaps twice a week. The prime minister is also confident that the 20 percent reduction in the apparatus of the government and the ministries will in no way affect the quality of their work; rather it will improve its effectiveness. Viktor Chernomyrdin focused particular attention in his speech at the session on relations between the government and the Federal Assembly. He stressed that "The government must learn to build its work with the Federation Council and the State Duma in a new way." "We must establish close, businesslike cooperation. There should be no confrontation, because we have common interests," he said. There was also brief discussion today of the question of holding, possibly on 17 February, an extended session of the government. It is anticipated that Boris Yeltsin will take part and that the heads of the constituents of the Federation will be invited. Viktor Chernomyrdin also drew considerable attention to the fact that a number of enterprises are lying idle. He described this situation as one of the leading questions of today, which requires a government solution. Ways and means must be sought to assist these enterprises, which must restart and bring revenue to the budget. Valentin Sergeyev said that the question of the minister of finance was not examined at today's session.
