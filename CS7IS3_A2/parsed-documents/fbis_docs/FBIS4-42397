He said that this could jeopardize Germany as a production center. In the service sector, too, jobs could be irrevocably lost as a result. Economics policymakers and trade unions should counteract this by improving production conditions in Germany. At the BDI congress Rudolf Scharping, chancellor candidate of the Social Democratic Party [SPD], called for modernization of the national economy. "We are a long way away from a true recovery," Scharping said. The increasing export demand should not lead to the "fatal impression" that "we have done our job, and now things can continue as before." BDI President Tyll Necker said that increasing international competition for the best production and financial center required basic structural change in industry and society. There were "no easy and pleasant formulas" in this respect. He appealed to all citizens to take part in the European Parliamentary elections. In this way, a free and peaceful Europe would be strengthened.
