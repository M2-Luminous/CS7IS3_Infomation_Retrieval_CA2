A mediation team, the first to include both US and Russian diplomats, was due in Sarajevo later in the day to build on efforts begun last week to bridge apparently irreconcilable differences between the Bosnian government and separatist Serbs over a country-wide cease-fire. The team was due to meet with leaders of the Moslem-led government and Bosnian Serbs before reporting back to a ministerial conference on Bosnia which diplomats in Geneva said would be held May 13 in the Swiss city. But prospects for the peace effort were undermined by Bosnian fury over a UN decision to allow seven Serb tanks pass through the exclusion zone around Sarajevo to the Mount Igman area just west of the city, where the Serbs fear a new offensive by Moslem troops, UN officials said. Two Serb tanks passed through the 20-kilometre (12.5-mile) exclusion zone on Wednesday, escorted by units of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon said. Agreement for the manoeuvre was given by UN envoy Yasushi Akashi and UNPROFOR commander Bertrand de Lapresle at a meeting with Serb leaders in Pale on Tuesday, Chaperon said. The agreement gave authorisation for seven tanks to pass through the zone, and early Wednesday two tanks arriving from Pale "were escorted from Lukavica (within the exclusion zone) and out of the zone towards Trnovo" in the Mount Igman area, he said. The other five tanks were to follow "in the next few days" at a time and date to be arranged, he said. The Bosnian government responded to the deal Thursday by demanding the dismissal of Akashi. Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said the government insisted on Akashi's departure because "UNPROFOR is making deals with the Serbs." An UNPROFOR source speaking on condition of anonymity said the arrangement over the tanks involved the UNPROFOR command based in Zagreb and by-passed officials in Sarajevo. He described the agreement as "a new victory" for the Serbs. "The go-ahead was given directly by Zagreb without consulting Sarajevo," said the source, who complained of the increasingly restrictive interpretation being given by UN officials of the exclusion zone imposed around Sarajevo in February. A third Serb T-34 tank from Pale was intercepted within the exclusion zone on Tuesday was one of the five covered under the agreement with Akashi and Lapresle, Chaperon said. It was still under UNPROFOR supervision, he said, describing its presence in the zone as part of a "special agreement at the highest level." Chaperon confirmed that the Bosnian Government was reinforcing its troop presence around Mount Ingman, a strategic height overlooking Sarajevo, but he said reports that as many as 10,000 men had been deployed there were exaggerated. Unconfirmed reports surfaced Wednesday that Akashi had cut a deal with the Serbs under which UNPROFOR would let the Serb tanks pass through the Sarajevo exclusion zone in exchange for the Serbs lifting their blockade of a convoy of British peacepeekers trying to reach the eastern town of Gorazde. The convoy, carrying 168 British troops, was allowed to proceed late Tuesday from Rogatica, where it had been held up by Serb officials since Sunday, but Chaperon said he was "not aware" of any link with the concession regarding the Serb tanks. Tension remained high in northern Bosnia in the region around Brcko, where UNPROFOR has observed a build-up of forces by both sides in the past two weeks. Serbs are believed to wish to widen the corridor in which Brcko is situated and which links Serb-held lands in eastern and western Bosnia, while government forces could seek to cut through the five-kilometre (three-mile) strip to the Croatian border. In New York early Wednesday the UN Security Council warned both sides of the "serious consequences" of any offensive action, following a proposal earlier by France to create a 10-kilometre (six-mile) exclusion zone around the Serb-held town. UN military observers have already been deployed to the area, and the Security Council ordered envoy Akashi to seek "enhanced aerial surveillance of this and other areas of tension." Bosnian Army Commander in Chief Rasim Delic was quoted on Bosnian television Monday as saying that Brcko was the "key to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
