Who is she to tell Rabin who she is and what her job is? Who is she to speak of good manners and tell him that a man is as good as his style? Had the Wild West used tongues instead of guns, Rabin could have been our own Gary Cooper or Clint Eastwood. [passage omitted] Despite the impression of army camaraderie projected by expressions such as "if pigs could fly," "I don't give a damn," or "If that is a settlement, then I am a monkey's uncle," so frequently used by Rabin, there is method to his madness, to paraphrase Shakespeare. Proof: We have never heard Rabin use offensive names for Arye Der'i, for instance. Der'i is the man who encouraged Peres to break up the unity government, and yet the term "foul maneuver" was attached to Peres. Not a bad word about Der'i -- either then or today -- although he has been giving Rabin a hard time, sending him like a "yo-yo" -- Rabin's term for other circumstances -- back and forth to 'Ovadya Yosef. You will not hear Rabin thrash out at former generals, even when they are his sworn political enemies. Yet wherever Peres is involved, Rabin shoots off his mouth indiscriminately. He invented the term "suits" for Peres' aides. "Peres is selling historic processes for the price of a newspaper headline," Rabin says about the man "who has never served in the Army." Beilin the poodle [term used by Rabin in a radio interview] is sometimes referred to as one who acts "brainlessly" and at other times as one suffering from "a loss of brains." Rabin must find it infuriating to realize that he is treading the path beaten by that group and even speaking their lingo (and referring to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] as the "occupying army" -- God in heaven!). Who are they to tell him what to do and how to speak? Rabin is a blend of suspiciousness -- everyone is after his head -- and a sense of arrogance of a man who knows everything better than everyone else. That is the reason he is sometimes the commentator and at other times, the state comptroller. He speaks of "chatterboxes" in the context of discussions on stock exchange taxation, and complains that "the finance minister is mushily pondering new national priorities." Being certain that everyone is after his head, everything is personal with him: He disqualifies the contender, rather than the bone of contention. Everything is "baloney," everything is "bull." Not only is he unable to take criticism, he is mainly unable to take alternative opinions. He has trained his ministers and aides to acquiesce to a degree unheard of even in the days of autocratic Ben-Gurion and Begin. People are afraid of his tongue. And we get goose pimples at the thought of how decisions are made in our country. As time went on, all the independent bodies and authorities got on his nerves. For Rabin, the justice minister has long since become anathema because he routinely sides with the law. Rabin coined various phrases to denigrate the legal establishment's independent status. He speak enviously about the PLO, which will be able to rule Gaza "without the High Court of Justice and Betzelem." He does not miss an opportunity to scourge the Histadrut labor federation, which he considers to be the source of all his troubles (and recently, of his mistakes as well). He compares the trade unions to Islamic terrorism and yearns for Singapore, "where there is no Histadrut and no nonsense." Rabin is particularly enraged by the independence of Knesset committees. He terms the Finance Committee "one of the sewers in which government decisions are stuck." He considers television to be a yellow media: "Do people pay their fees for this?" almost amounts to a call for civil disobedience. The overt deprecation of independent bodies, especially those aimed at setting limits and defining what is permissible and what not, has gradually resulted in a "Nixonian rule" in the Prime Minister's Office, which considers itself to be an imperial structure disconnected from all the other power structures, and whose main aim is self-preservation. What one perceives at the present time is an extremely pressured Rabin. Perhaps Rabin is beginning to suffer from the syndrome of the leader who senses he has reached a dead end. This is not the first time: Only Menahem Begin, as leader of Herut, was able to give up the entire Sinai and to demolish settlements in exchange for a breakthrough in the peace process with Egypt -- after which he exhausted himself. Only Rabin, with the security aura attached to his name, could recognize the PLO and 'Arafat and implement autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. Perhaps, however, Rabin -- like Begin at the time -- has made all the concessions he is capable of or wiling to make. Perhaps deep down inside he knows that he has exhausted his potential. This is why he is coming down on everybody like a yo-yo in the land of monkeys' uncles.
