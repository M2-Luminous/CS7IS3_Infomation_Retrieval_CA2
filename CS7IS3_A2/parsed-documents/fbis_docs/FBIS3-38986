For all but Sweden, the first major problem encountered in negotiations here Tuesday was the candidates' refusal to immediately align their heavily subsidised farm sectors with the EC common agricultural policy (CAP) because they fear prices will plummet by 50 percent, with income following suit. Only Sweden agreed to comply on this point here on Tuesday. Helsinki, Oslo and Vienna have ruled out the idea of a transition period during which they would pay compensation -- at their own expense -- to their farmers. "Never has the European Community agreed to see farm prices plunge by 50 percent from one day to the next. Even under CAP, it allowed three years to reduce subsidised beef prices by 15 percent," Norwegian Commerce Minister Grete Knudsen thundered after the meeting. Compensation should be financed by the EC budget, to which Norway and the other three candidates will become net contributors, she added. Norwegian farms are mainly small and scattered through the countryside. They suffer from difficult geographic and climactic conditions -- summer is very short. "That's why we want access to Community funds to maintain our long-term aid, which the Community has rejected," the minister said. She recalled that Norway offered an "attractive market for European exporters." EC Council President Theodore Pangalos, answered for the EC: "Of course, farmers will be hit by the drop in prices, but for the consumers it will mean cheaper food products, and a rich country like Norway can cope with that." Oslo also wants to use Community aid funds to prevent the desertification of its polar region, which has a population of four residents per square kilometer and shares a common border with Russia, Knudsen said. Helsinki used the same argument about the need to maintain security in the far north of Europe to call for part of the EC structural funds reserved in principle for areas that are backward in development. For Brussels, however, the Arctic regions do not qualify as backward areas because their gross national product per inhabitant is more than 80 percent of the Community average. Stockholm also sought generous aid for its Norbotten region near the polar circle "so as not to be left behind" in case its two neighbours got their requests satisfied, said Swedish European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel. "We are investing a lot of money in this region and we're counting on Community support to recover it," he said. Austria's problem is with its high level of support for Alpine agriculture. Vienna wants the Community to accept its definition of mountain farming as starting at 500 meters (1,625 feet) altitude, compared with the EC's current 800 meters (2,600 feet). Devoted environmental protectionists, the Austrians also want to maintain their current limits on European trucks using their roads even after joining the Community. Brussels is ready to allow a three-year transition period, until 1998, but Vienna wants to continue the limitations up until the year 2004, in a bid to reach its target of reducing pollution by 60 percent. Opposing this effort is the EC's principle of free circulation. Another inacceptable demand from Austria is the country's prohibition on non-Austrians buying holiday homes in the country on grounds this could cause real estate prices to rocket, as has been the case in the Tyrol, a favourite holiday spot for Germans. Meanwhile Norway wants to be allowed to continue hunting whales. It has asked the EC to cross whales off its list of endangered species. The ministers are due to meet again on February 21 and 22 to continue discussions. A final meeting could be held from February 25-28, diplomatic sources said. The negotiations with the four must be concluded by March 1 under an EC timetable fixed to allow membership agreements to be drawn up before European elections in June.
