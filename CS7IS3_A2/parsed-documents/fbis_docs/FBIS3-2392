To make the work more efficient, some of the examination and management fees are now collected at one go by the city immigration office without change of payment standards, instead of payment item by item. Beginning May 1 this year, freight vehicles going through land ports will receive unified examination concerning customs affairs, sanitation and animal and plant quarantine. As a result, freight vehicles entering or leaving the border only have to stop twice instead of four times as at present. By the end of the year computers will be installed at the crossing points to handle examination and payment.
