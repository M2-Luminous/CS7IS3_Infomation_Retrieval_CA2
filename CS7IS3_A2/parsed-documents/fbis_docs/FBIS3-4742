The document recalls that at the UN sub-commission on prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities held in August, 1993, Japan admitted to the war-time enslavement of "comfort women" by the Japanese Army and Government. The facts admitted by Japan belong to such paragraphs as expulsion, enslavement, inhumanity and political and racial oppression, crimes against humanity, it says, adding that prescription does not apply to the acts of the Japanese Army and they must be punished by international law. It says Japan should therefore take necessary measures for the punishment of those responsible for the above-mentioned crimes. Recalling that in 1932 Japan signed the convention on forced and compulsory labor which was adopted by the International Labor Organisation in 1930, the document notes that the present government should still be obligated for punishment under the convention. The criminal acts against "comfort women" should have been punished by the then Japanese "law", too, the document says. It stresses there cannot be any prescription with Japan's obligation under the international law. It calls attention to the fact that Japan has not yet punished the criminals who had inflicted sufferings upon the more than 200,000 "comfort women for the army". Noting that Japan still refuses to admit that the acts committed against Asian "comfort women", mostly Koreans, recrimes, the document says such an approach is a disgraceful insult and discrimination against the Asian women. The document points to some matters, urging the Japanese Government to take all measures including legislature, investigation, trial and punishment and make adequate compensations to all the "comfort women for the army" so as to fulfil its obligations under the international law regarding the punishment of those responsible for the criminal acts committed against the victimized "comfort women".
