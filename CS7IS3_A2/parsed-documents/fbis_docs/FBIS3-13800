This is the best international reward for Israeli aggressors because the victims have accepted an international resolution that will join the archives of hundreds of similar resolutions that have been left unheeded at the world body. Consequently, this resolution reflects their own position. It is not supportive of our grievances. After two weeks of U.S. procrastination, we have seen a "lame" UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution condemning the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This resolution has failed to firmly handle the main causes of the massacre; namely, the continued occupation, settlement activities, and the terrorism of settlers. This is the gist of statements made by four Palestinian officials in reaction to UNSC Resolution 904, and the shock the Clinton Administration has delivered to the Arab and Islamic nations with regard to Jerusalem. For his part, PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab said that the resolution is not commensurate with the Hebron massacre and the ensuing massacres committed by the Israeli Army. This resolution has failed to ensure the nonrecurrence of similar massacres. It has failed to provide protection for the Palestinian people. Likewise, it has evaded any talk of settlements, and the conduct of settlers, although the settlements constitute time bombs that will jeopardize the security of the Palestinian people and the entire peace process, as well, al-Najjab argued. Al-Najjab added that the U.S. conduct, which obstructed the passage of this resolution for three weeks and rendered its passage a difficult task, will be maintained. Consequently, it will undermine any positive aspects that could be found in this resolution. Given all this, one can say that the said resolution marks a qualitative leap in the United States' efforts to wriggle out of its commitment to the content of Resolution 242, the invitation to the Madrid conference, and even the letter of assurances delivered to the Palestinians, particularly since the United States has defied the world by refusing to acknowledge that Jerusalem is occupied territory. Al-Najjab went on to say: The U.S. position has torpedoed the very foundations of the peace process, because it reflects full support for the Israeli position. Besides, this U.S. position will nurture Israeli intransigence and provide Israel with greater elbow room to interpret the Declaration of Principles as it wishes. Al-Najjab believes that the resolution does not provide any justifications for the Tunis-headquartered Palestinian leadership to return to the negotiating table. Before any return to the negotiations, the Palestinian people's unanimous demands for effective international protection, evicting the settlers in Hebron, Gaza, Jericho, and other areas where there is room for friction between the Palestinians and settlers, and placing the issue of settlements at the top of the interim period talks agenda must be met, especially since these demands have enjoyed extensive support from the Arabs and the world in general. Al-Najjab added: With regard to Jerusalem, the U.S. position toward it requires urgent consultations and moves by all Arab sides that adhere to the Arab identity of Jerusalem. The Arab sides must reply to this Israeli [as published] position, and take the necessary practical measures to safeguard the Arab identity of Jerusalem, and confront the persistent Israeli scheme to consecrate its annexation to Israel. The PLO Executive Committee member said: This is the responsibility of all honorable people in the world. Unified positions can make the U.S. Administration reconsider its positions, which are hostile to Jerusalem, and which do not support a peace agreement grounded in the implementation of the relevant international legitimacy resolutions. For his part, Taysir Qub'ah, deputy speaker of the Palestine National Council [PNC], said: The effects of the U.S. pressures and dictates are clear, not only in the obstruction of the UNSC deliberations on the Hebron massacre, but also in the text, terms of reference, and contents of Resolution 904, not to mention the mechanism of voting on said resolution. [passage omitted] Qub'ah added: Now that the [U.S.] positions have been exposed, and given the current dangerous state of affairs, I demand the continued suspension of the negotiations. I also believe that the Palestinian leadership must not succumb to U.S. and Israeli blackmail. I strongly believe that we should no longer deem the United States an honest sponsor or broker, given U.S. practices, the last of which has been rewarding Israel for its massacre by granting it our Jerusalem, the holiest of all holy places, as well as our holy land, the land of prophets and messengers. This U.S. position is the height of bias toward Israel. It constitutes a flagrant retreat from the positions of successive U.S. Administrations since the occupation of the holy city, a violation of the letter of assurances, and a scuttling of the negotiating process, particularly since the sponsor of the peace talks has shown a blatant bias toward Israeli demands regarding Jerusalem. Qub'ah went on to say: This U.S. position has killed the erroneous wagers some have entertained. It has also shown flagrant deception. Hence, it requires a reconsideration of the bases, terms of reference, and mechanisms of the peace process, beginning with the Madrid conference terms of reference, and ending with the Washington and Cairo agreements, which have produced unfair, unscrupulous, and inequitable agreements--the agreements signed in Oslo and Cairo. As for Taysir Khalid, member of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, he has condemned the statements made by the U.S. delegate to the United Nations, as well as her determination to deny the Palestinian people their right to sovereignty over their territory, and to deem the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip disputed territories. He also condemned the U.S. position on several paragraphs of the said resolution, particularly those regarding Jerusalem and settlements. He denounced the U.S. Administration's determination to rule out the dispatch of international troops to the occupied territories to provide the Palestinians of the occupied territories with international protection. He added that this reflects this administration's disavowal of international legitimacy and international legitimacy resolutions, including those the previous U.S. Administrations endorsed. Khalid urged the authoritarian Tunis-headquartered Palestinian leadership to denounce this U.S. position and halt the negotiations until the U.S. Administration and the Israeli Government commit themselves to disarming settlers, dismantling settlements, ensuring true and effective international protection for the Palestinian people, and rebuilding the negotiating process on the relevant international legitimacy resolutions, including UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338, and the refugees' right to repatriation on the basis of Resolution 194, as well as the principle of trading land for peace. Khalid went on to say: This leadership must respect the free will of the Palestinian people, who are demanding a halt to the negotiations. Or else, it must tender its resignation and call for an extraordinary PNC session to elect a new Palestinian leadership that could shoulder its responsibilities toward its people, defend their rights and interests, comply with PNC resolutions, and lead the Palestinian people's struggle to regain their national rights to repatriation, self-determination, and national independence. Dr. Labin Qamhawi, a well-known intellectual, said that the U.S. handling of the draft resolution condemning the Zionist crime against Palestinian worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque reflects the true U.S. position, which, first and foremost, aims to boost the Israeli position. Previous developments have also shown the U.S. bias toward Israel. For the U.S. condemnation of any operation carried out by the strugglers or mujahidin against the occupation has always been prompt.
