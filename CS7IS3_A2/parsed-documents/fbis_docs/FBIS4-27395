In the morning, the deputies listened to Mr. Ho Te, minister of finance and chairman of draft law compilation committee, who read a report summarizing the views of deputies on the draft law on the transfer tax on land use rights. Seventeen deputies gave their opinions on this draft law. Most of their views focused on major issues such as targeted parties, the basis for tax calculation, tax rates, tax reduction and exemption, and an effective time frame of the law. Those who voiced their views held that in order to maintain fairness, the calculation of tax must be based on the source of the land. They also agreed that tax reduction and exemption must be given to state cadres and employees who have to move house as required by public service, and also for those who have completed their service in mountainous provinces and who have decided to return to their hometowns for retirement. In terms of tax rates, many deputies suggested the rate of five percent for the mountainous and coastal provinces so as to encourage investment. Others suggested that the transfer of agricultural land use right must be limited to preventing land from being used for other purposes. These limitation must be stated clearly in the regulations to avoid loss of public funds, and also to avoid negativity in the management mechanism. Others held the view that distinctions should not be made between the transfer of land use rights and a change in the way land is used. With this, the National Assembly deputies have completed their discussion of the draft law on the transfer tax on land use rights. In the afternoon, the National Assembly deputies heard Comrade Phan Ngoc Tuong, minister chairman of state organization and personnel commission, acting on behalf of the government, read a report on the amendment of the people's councils and people's committees, and the amendment draft on the law on election of people's councils. They also heard Comrade Ha Manh Tri read an investigative report on the two draft amendments on laws regarding the organization of the people's councils and election of people's councils. The deputies will hold group discussions tomorrow morning on the draft laws on organization and the election of people's councils to prepare for the plenary session at the conference hall in the afternoon.
