Although the property boom has been muffled by the government clampdown on credit, other opportunities may compensate for the loss. "Foreign investors are expected to have a foothold in certain new sectors like agriculture and banking, while bringing about larger-scale projects," said Li Yue, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the China Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment. The association is under the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), and helps advise the ministry on policy-making. Li said construction of major infrastructure projects will remain constant through the year. For instance, Li said, many giant international companies want to set up joint ventures making power equipment. "China is the world's largest market for power construction," he said. "but the quality of domestically-manufactured power equipment leaves much to be desired." Li added that metallurgy, too, will need more foreign investment as domestic consumption expands along with the economy. The automobile spare parts industry is another magnet for foreign investment, as China will raise production of automobiles this year. For example, Shanghai Volkswagen, a Sino-German joint venture which turned out 100,000 cars last year, is expected to increase production by 50,000 in 1994. "The production of raw materials and basic machinery and electronic components is lucrative, too," Li said. He cited General Electric Co (GE) and the Shell Co as big businesses poised to invest in China. GE and Shell would like to produce engineering plastics and other chemical products in China. Aside from infrastructure, Li said, agriculture and the service sector are also expected to benefit from more foreign investment. He expressed hope that the State will give more favourable treatment to foreign investors when it comes to high-risk sectors like agriculture. The State now monopolizes export of agricultural products, but Li thinks foreign investors should be permitted a role. "The current monopoly, which fails to promote the quality of agricultural and sideline products, has caused our share of the Hong Kong market to shrink," he pointed out. Li said that if an approaching national working conference on the use of foreign investment proposes new policies regarding agriculture, the prospects for more foreign capital will brighten. He did not mention when the conference will be held. Li also suggested relaxing controls on how the service sector uses foreign investment, especially in regard to finance and telecommunications. For example, foreign banks now can open branches only in the coastal regions. But Li said foreign banks should be allowed to open branches inland on a trial basis to expand investment, especially for mining. "Moreover," Li said, "China should permit foreign banks to deal in renminbi business if it wants to enhance the yuan's credibility among international financial institutions." This way, he said, the renminbi could be helped on its way to becoming a freely convertible currency. On another subject, Li said the China Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment will help address a number of major problems plaguing foreign investment ventures. Among these problems are the large number of enterprises that lose money, the slow flow of foreign capital, and growing disputes between foreign managers and Chinese employees. Because his association has many joint ventures as members, it can help foreign investors find Chinese partners, and vice versa. Li added, "We will also help certain enterprises involved in anti-dumping cases to prepare for lawsuits this year."
