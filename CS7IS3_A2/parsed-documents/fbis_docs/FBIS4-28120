Former FTC head Setsuo Umezawa told the House of Councillors Budget Committee that his contacts with then ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members were necessary for consulting about the law. But Umezawa, testifying as a witness, flatly denied any FTC deals with LDP members, saying, "it is absolutely untrue." Criticized over the ineffectiveness of the law in stopping rampant bid-rigging by construction contractors, the FTC had considered raising penalties against firms breaking the Antimonopoly Law but met with strong opposition from some LDP members who had represented the profits of contractors. In early 1992, the FTC made on-the-spot inspections of contractors allegedly involved in a bid-rigging case in Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo. But by the time it was considered unavoidable for the FTC to file the complaint, the commission announced in May 1992 it would not file any accusation with prosecutors and only ordered the 66 companies involved to stop the antimonopoly practice. Some LDP members are suspected of having pressured the FTC to drop the complaint on behalf of the group of 66 companies, including major contractor Kajima Corp. The FTC is suspected of then having chosen not to file the complaint with prosecutors because it wanted the LDP members' cooperation in revising the Antimonopoly Law according to the way it had originally planned. One of the LDP members, former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, was arrested in March this year and later indicted on a charge of accepting a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992 in exchange for helping to block the FTC's criminal allegation.
