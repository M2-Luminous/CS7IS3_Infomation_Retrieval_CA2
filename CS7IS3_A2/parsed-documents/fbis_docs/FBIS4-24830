Two DPP deputies were slightly injured during the fighting and sent to hospitals for treatment, the DPP said. Disputing the quorum standard for starting the first-reading session to consider proposed amendments to the constitution, deputies from the two parties have engaged in free-for-alls every day since last Friday, kicking, punching, and chasing each other around the conference hall in the otherwise serene Taipei suburb of Yangmingshan. The DPP has been insisting that the quorum must be two-thirds of the deputies, but the KMT has said one-third of members would be sufficient to proceed with the session. No longer than one minute after the morning session started Wednesday, DPP deputies again rushed the podium and staged a sit-in, as they have done in previous days. While KMT deputy Kuo Po-tsun, who was the day's chairman, stood on a table in an attempt to announce the commencement of proceedings, DPP members were shouting and whistling in protest. Angered by the tactics of the DPP members, several KMT deputies rushed to the podium to remove them, which resulted in several shoving, kicking, and wrestling matches. The two parties, however, later reached agreement in negotiations between their whips to appeal the quorum-standard question to a court of grand justices. The settlement enabled the National Assembly to go ahead with its afternoon session.
