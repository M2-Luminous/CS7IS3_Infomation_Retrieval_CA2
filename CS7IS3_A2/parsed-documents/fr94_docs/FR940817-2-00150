Section I_Exemption for In-Kind Transfer of CIF Assets If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section 406(a) and 406(b) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (F) of the Code, shall not apply, as of November 20, 1992, to the in-kind transfer of assets of plans for which Marshall & Ilsley Trust Company or an affiliate (collectively, M&I) serves as a fiduciary (the Client Plans), other than plans established and maintained by M&I, that are held in certain collective investment funds maintained by M&I (the CIFs), in exchange for shares of the Marshall Funds, Inc. (the Funds), an open-end investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), for which M&I acts as investment adviser, custodian, and/or shareholder servicing agent, in connection with the termination of such CIFs, provided that the following conditions and the general conditions of Section III below are met: (a) No sales commissions or other fees are paid by the Client Plans in connection with the purchase of Fund shares through the in-kind transfer of CIF assets and no redemption fees are paid in connection with the sale of such shares by the Client Plans to the Funds. (b) Each Client Plan receives shares of a Fund which have a total net asset value that is equal to the value of the Client Plan's pro rata share of the assets of the CIF on the date of the transfer, based on the current market value of the CIF's assets, as determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner at the close of the same business day, using independent sources in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b) of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1940 Act and the procedures established by the Funds for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures must require that all securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the weekend of the CIF transfers, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of M&I.
