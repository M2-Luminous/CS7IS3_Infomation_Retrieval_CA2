FR940610-1-00052 FR940610-1-00008 To obtain input from the public prior to drafting proposed regulations, the Department solicited comments on nutrition objectives for school meals through public hearings and written comments. In a Notice published in the Federal Register (58 FR 47853, September 13, 1993), the Department announced a series of four public hearings. Any person who was interested could register to speak at any of the hearings. Persons unable to testify in person were invited to submit written comments. The Notice identified the following four questions as the focus areas for comments and suggestions: I. What are the health consequences of children's current dietary patterns? II. How can the Dietary Guidelines for Americans be used to bring about measurable nutritional improvements in school meals and in children's diets? III. What are the opportunities and obstacles in meeting current nutrition recommendations in school meal programs? IV. What actions can the USDA, parents, school food service, food industry and other public and private organizations take to encourage the implementation of current nutrition recommendations in local schools? The four hearings were held in Atlanta, Georgia on October 13, 1993; in Los Angeles, California on October 27, 1993; in Flint, Michigan on November 12, 1993; and in Washington, DC on December 7, 1993. Each hearing was presided over jointly by officials from USDA and officials from USDA's Federal partners in this effort_the Department of Education (DOEd) and DHHS. The inclusion of representatives from DOEd and DHHS is an important asset in modifying the school meal programs both because of their expertise and their missions. The school meal programs must be considered in the context of the educational framework, as overseen by DOEd, and the national policies regarding health care and disease prevention under the aegis of DHHS. Therefore, USDA is very pleased that a partnership is being forged among all Federal agencies responsible for assisting the nation's schoolchildren. USDA is also pleased to be working with DOEd and DHHS to further their policy initiatives_Goals 2000: Educate America Act (DOEd) and Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives (DHHS). Of particular concern are solutions to issues such as increasing public awareness of the links between diet and health, familiarizing the public with the need to establish good eating habits in children that will be carried on through their lifetimes and finding innovative ways to incorporate the school meal as a learning experience into daily school curriculums. A variety of witnesses from the fields of medicine, nutrition and education, food service, production and processors and other food industry representatives, as well as parents, students and other consumers and the general public, testified at each of the hearings. Witnesses were asked to focus their remarks on one of the four questions stated above. A transcript of each hearing was prepared, and witnesses could, if they wished, also submit written testimony and copies of any materials used to prepare their remarks. As noted above, the Federal Register Notice also solicited written comments from anyone who could not attend one of the hearings. To be assured of consideration, comments had to be submitted on or before December 15, 1993. The written testimony and all comment letters were reviewed and analyzed by the Department prior to preparation of this proposed regulation. This portion of the preamble provides a summary of the comments. Summary of Comments Received The overwhelming majority of commenters, representing a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, called for improvements to school meals. Comments from the public, students, and parents, while expressing serious concerns and supporting change, were general in nature and provided few specific details. However, commenters from the medical, nutrition, and food advocacy communities, State and local food service professionals, and food industry representatives provided detailed information and frequently recommended specific actions. Commenter Categories A total of 363 witnesses testified at the hearings, and an additional 2,013 written comments were received by the Department. Of the 2,376 commenters: 21% were medical professionals, nutritionists or dietitians, representatives of public health, nutrition, or food organizations; 21% were from the general public; 21% were parents and students; 16% were school food service personnel, representatives of school food service organizations or representatives from State education/child nutrition agencies; 11% were teachers, school officials or representatives from school associations; 7% were food industry representatives; and 3% were representatives of other State or Federal agencies or members of Congress. The Department is very pleased that so many persons took the time to testify or to submit written comments and would like to take this opportunity to express its appreciation for their comments and suggestions. The commenters represented an extensive cross-section of perspectives and provided a great variety of opinions and recommendations. Especially gratifying were the number of students and parents who commented. These groups are, after all, the constituency that the Department considers program ``customers,'' and it is these groups the Department is seeking to serve better. Comment Breakdown The following number of commenters addressed some aspect of the four basic questions: I. 796; II. 703; III. 752; IV. 1,464. Though comments varied greatly in content, the following significant themes emerged: (1) The need to improve school meals in order to improve the health of children; (2) the need for school meals to reflect current nutrition recommendations, specifically reductions in fat and saturated fat as recommended in the Dietary Guidelines; (3) the importance of an integrated nutrition education program that involves students, parents, teachers, and school food service personnel; (4) the need to revise current commodity programs to provide schools with more nutritious foods; and (5) the need to incorporate nutritional improvements while at the same time improving the appeal of meals offered to ensure that nutritious meals are consumed.
