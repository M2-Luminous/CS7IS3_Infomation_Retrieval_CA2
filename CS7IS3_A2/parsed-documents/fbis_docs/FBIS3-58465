The GDP in western Germany fell by 1.9 percent last year, while the GDP in the new laender rose by 6.3 percent. In their fall reports, the research institutes and the Council of Experts had expected the western German economy to decline by 2 percent. However, it was only over the course of the year that analysts arrived at such pessimistic forecasts. In their 1992 fall reports, the institutes still talked of the western German economy being "in the doldrums," but said a slight improvement was expected in 1993. In the course of the year, the forecasts were revised downward, although the talk was still of the economy having experienced "a dip" and the term "recession" was avoided. At the end of 1992, the Cologne-based Institute for the German Economy still stated that a lasting "slump" was unlikely. The Munich-based Ifo Institute revised its forecast downward by 0.5 percent, but also added that the recession would "tend toward being mild." The Kiel Institute for the World Economy expected "positive signals" in 1993. The German economy currently finds itself below ground level, but is still not in the cellar. The share of the GDP produced by the new laender is continuing to grow. In 1993, 9 percent of the GDP came from the new laender, compared to 8 percent in 1992, and 6.9 percent in 1991. The GDP covers all the services provided by Germans and foreigners within the borders of the country over a period of one year. It is considered the most appropriate indicator of a country's economic performance. Gross National Expenditure, which was used previously and finally abandoned by the Federal Office of Statistics in September 1992, tends to be more suited to reflecting the incomes of the population of a country. The second reason for going over to the GDP was that it is customary for almost all the large industrial countries to express their form in the GDP. In the second quarter of 1992, the difference between the Gross National Expenditure and the GDP only amounted to 2.3 billion German marks. In addition, at that point, the two quantities were growing at the same rate -- that was the ideal moment for the statisticians to go over to the GDP.
