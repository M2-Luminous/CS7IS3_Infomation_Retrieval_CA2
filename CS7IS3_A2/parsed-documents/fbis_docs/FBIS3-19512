This is the conclusion that the Bundesbank has drawn in view of the dramatic deficits of the communes, which rose to 10.5 billion German marks [DM] in 1993. In the previous year, it was DM9.7 billion, in 1990 DM3.6 billion, and in 1989 even a surplus of DM2.2 billion was produced. The overall debts of the communes stand at DM140 billion. In spite of considerable contributions from the "German Unity Fund," the east German communes produced a deficit of DM7.5 billion in 1992. The deficit per inhabitant is three times as high as in the old laender, especially because of the required additional expenditure for infrastructure. Both a stronger rationalization of the administration and the transfer of communal tasks to private enterprises are required, the Bundesbank stressed. It is possible to achieve a balanced budget, like in the first half of the 1980's. According to the Bundesbank, the strongly differing financial situation of the towns in western Germany puts in proper perspective the impression that the rise in expenditure that occurred in the past few years is a "phenomenon that can hardly be averted" from the communes. On the average, personnel costs rose by approximately 8 percent between 1990 and 1992, which was caused by wage increases and the hiring of new personnel. The increase in expenditure for material rose approximately 9 percent, and the costs for social welfare increased by 12 percent in 1992 alone. The receipts of the communes, however, rose by only 6 percent, and the transfers from the federal and provincial budgets by 8 percent.
