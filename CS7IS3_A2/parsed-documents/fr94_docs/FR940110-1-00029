FR940110-1-00029 FR940110-1-00004 B. Costs 1. Cost Components OMB Circular A&hyph;25, in its discussion of cost determination for purposes of setting fees, provides that ``user charges will be sufficient to recover the full cost to the Federal Government *␣*␣* of providing the service *␣*␣*.'' It also provides that those costs shall include an ``appropriate share of the management and supervisory costs.'' Circular No. A&hyph;25, User Charges, Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, July 8, 1993, pp. 3&hyph;5. Direct costs are only the most readily identifiable costs of providing user services. Each service also has indirect components which, although not as easily identifiable, are nevertheless causally related to the costs of providing services. Each examinations fee has three components: direct costs, indirect costs, and a surcharge to cover the costs of the Refugees and Overseas Program. a. Direct costs. Direct costs are those costs directly related to the processing of a particular application form for a particular benefit. Direct costs include: the pay of the Adjudications officers and clerical staff working on each type of application and the costs of their associated personnel benefits; the costs of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) name and fingerprint checks; where applicable, the costs by application of naturalization ceremonies conducted by United States Courts; and the costs of INS immigration document and card production. The pay costs are calculated by multiplying average adjudications processing time by the hourly pay for the average grade levels of adjudicators and clerks. b. Indirect costs. Indirect costs reflected in the current fee structure are defined as the costs of supervisory, management, and administrative activities, related staff training, records, data processing, and files services, legal services, and space and support costs of providing immigration benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act and related statutes. Indirect costs also include costs in the management and administration portion of the INS budget, such as the costs of the personnel administration work needed to recruit and pay the officers and clerks who process customers' applications for benefits. The activities associated with these costs are no less essential to providing INS services to its customers than are the direct costs. These indirect costs are distinguished only by the somewhat greater complexity of determining the portion of such costs that are attributable to work done for fee-paying customers. In addition, indirect costs include the cost of auditing the Examinations Fee Account by the Department of Justice Inspector General. c. Surcharge. The costs to carry out the Refugees and Overseas Program are borne by the Examinations Fee Account, at the direction of Congress. See section 286(m) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1356(m). These costs are treated as a surcharge that is added to the examinations fees. 2. Cost Transfers A transfer is the shift of costs from one account to another. Transfers arise when costs from one account are identified as appropriately charged to another account. Transfers have been prompted by cost reviews such as that conducted in 1992 to refine the identification of costs attributable to user fee activities. Transfers found in the 1992 review to be necessary to meet statutory requirements are as follows: a. Legal proceedings. A review of INS workload statistics identified the equivalent of 78 additional positions and work years of legal activities that properly should be charged to Examinations Fee Account activities. These legal activities include appearances before the Immigration Court for hearings related to asylum, adjustment of status, registry, waivers of inadmissibility, and rescission; the preparation of arguments and briefs for such hearings; appearances before Federal and state courts for contested naturalization hearings; appearances in U.S. District Courts in mandamus and declaratory judgment cases; preparation of arguments, briefs, and litigation reports in such cases; and associated legal consultations and preparation of legal memoranda. Also included are resources for support staff, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney, Regional Counsel, and District Counsel positions chargeable for Examinations work. INS will propose to transfer these 78 positions, work years, and associated costs from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation to the Examinations Fee Account. Copies of this review are available upon request. b. Management and administration. Management and Administration (M&A) resources have been assigned to the Examinations Fee Account using a ``distribution-key'' concept. Distribution-key is a term borrowed from the U.S. Postal Service's cost allocation practice. With this practice, costs which cannot be directly related to a certain class or account are distributed on the basis of costs which can be directly assigned. For example, in the case of mail processing, the costs associated with supervision of mail clerks (where no direct statistical assignment mechanisms are in place) are distributed on the same basis as are the costs for the mail clerks themselves (where statistical workload measurement systems are in place). See, for example, Postal Rate Commission, Docket No. R90&hyph;1, United States Postal Service Library Reference F&hyph;1, Summary Description of USPS Cost Development by Segments and Components, fiscal year 1988, pp. 2&hyph;2 through 2&hyph;5. For this process, a full-time equivalent work year (referred to as ``work year'' or ``FTE'') was chosen as the distribution-key. Costs were allocated based upon the percentage distribution of work years between the Examinations Fee Account and all other accounts in INS. See Exhibit 1, Derivation of Management and Administration Distribution Key.
