The sources welcomed 'Arafat's planned urgent visit to Jordan next week to meet for the first time with Hamas leaders, foremost of whom are Muhammad Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah and to clear the way for a complete reconciliation between the PLO and the movement. Hamas yesterday reiterated its denial of reports that it recognizes Israel's right to exist, but stressed its readiness to conclude a truce with Israel if it agrees to withdraw from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem; remove the settlements; evacuate the settlers; and hold general elections for the Palestinian people to elect their leaders and representatives.
