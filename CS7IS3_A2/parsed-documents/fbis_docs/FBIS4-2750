Land-use rights for 15,100 ha were transferred last year alone, creating profits of 11 billion yuan. According to Yuan Zheng, director of the Land Administration Department, land use rights for 25,000 ha [hectare] were transferred during the past two years in Guangdong, generating a total profit of 20.5 billion yuan. Foreign investment absorbed through the transfer of land-use rights has made up 42.6 percent of the total amount of overseas capital utilized by the province. So far, 72 development zones have been set up in this southern province, taking up 13,000 ha. Some 18 billion yuan has been used to introduce 3,300 projects into these zones. Yuan stressed that the macro-economic control measures for real estate implemented by the central government and the provisional regulations on land value-added tax that began to take effect this year do not mean restriction of the development of the sector but its standardization to ensure that its development is steady and sound. The modern market system in Guangdong that has gradually been set up during the reform and opening-up over the last 15 years will surely further promote the rapid development of real estate, yuan added.
