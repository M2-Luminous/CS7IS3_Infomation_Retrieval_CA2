Zdenko Vranjes reports: [Vranjes] The need to strengthen the institution of the law-governed state and to suppress crime and smuggling in Herceg-Bosna was the focus of attention of the talks between the political leaders of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and civilian and military authorities of the Rama and Uskoplje municipalities and the priests of Rama monastery. It was emphasized that the passage of humanitarian and other convoys should be made more orderly. All convoys for Bosnia pass through Rama and Uskoplje. Their chaotic passage causes even greater and more dangerous disorder, robberies, and attacks by rebel groups, it was said at the talks. The implementation of the Washington agreement was discussed at the session of the Croatian Democratic Union municipal committee and the command of the Ante Starcevic Brigade from Uskoplje. More work needs to be done on the border delineation between the cantons, it was stressed. Zubak reiterated that the Croatian people have truly accepted the Washington agreement as a step toward peace. He described Alija Izetbegovic's letter [to Tudjman] yesterday as an attempt to shift to the Croatian people the blame for the lack of readiness to implement the Washington agreement. Zubak said the Croatian representatives will not allow the Croatian people to be deceived. They will not allow certain circles among the Muslim people to establish a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina by bypassing the essence of the Washington agreement. Such attempts can be detected in the demands by Muslim representatives for both the president of the federation and the prime minister to be Muslims. We will not accept this, for such demands have no basis in the constitution of the new federation, Zubak said.
