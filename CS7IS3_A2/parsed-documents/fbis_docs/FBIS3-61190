Statute on the General Principles of Administrative-Territorial Division and Organization of Local Self-Government in the City of Moscow: I. General principles of administrative-territorial division. 1. This provisional statute establishes the general principles of the administrative-territorial division of the city of Moscow as a component of the Russian Federation--a city with federal significance. 2. The system of administrative-territorial division of the city of Moscow is made up of: --an administrative okrug; --a municipal okrug. 3. The administrative okrug is an intracity administrative unit, a system of organs of authority that is built on the basis of centralized management. The procedure for managing the administrative okrug is established by a special statute approved by the mayor of Moscow. The city of Zelenograd forms a separate administrative okrug. The territory of the administrative okrug includes municipal rayons. 4. The municipal rayon is an administrative-territorial unit of the city of Moscow within whose borders the self-government of the population that lives on the given territory is conducted. Municipal rayons are organized taking into account the socioeconomic characteristics of pertinent territories, their town-planning and historical features, and the presence of residential complexes and objects of the municipal infrastructure. The boundaries and the names of the municipal rayons are established by the Moscow City Duma on a representation of the mayor of the city of Moscow. The municipal rayon is divided into microrayons (settlements) in which organs of territorial public self-government can be established. The boundaries and names of microrayons are determined by the organs of self-government of the municipal rayon. II. The principles of organization of local self-government. 5. Local self-government on the territory of the city of Moscow is conducted on the basis of this provisional statute, legislation of the Russian Federation, and the normative acts of the city of Moscow, taking into account its status as the capital of the Russian Federation. 6. The organs of local self-government in the city of Moscow are municipalities that include assemblies of representatives of the population of the municipal rayon (municipal assemblies) and the head of the local administration (head of the municipality). III. Local administration. 7. The activity of the local administration is directed by the head of the municipality, who carries out the management of the municipal economy and property, develops the estimate of incomes and expenditures, ensures its implementation, and performs other executive-administrative functions. 8. The head of the municipality is appointed in coordination with the municipal assembly by the mayor of Moscow from the number of candidates recommended by the prefect of the administrative okrug. In the event of nonconcurrence by a majority of the members of the municipal assembly in the candidacy proposed for the position of the head of the municipality, the mayor has the right to resubmit this candidacy or propose another one. Given the nonconcurrence of a majority of the members of the municipal assembly in the proposed candidacy in this case as well, within a two-week period the mayor of Moscow appoints an acting head of the municipality for a period of one year. The indicated person enjoys all of the rights and carries all of the responsibilities of the head of a municipality. The head of the municipality cannot engage in other paid activity, except for teaching, scientific, and other creative activity. 9. The head of the municipality, in the event of a systematic nonfulfillment of his duties or their gross violation, can be dismissed from the position by the mayor of Moscow, including on a representation of the prefect of the administrative okrug, or on the basis of an appeal by the municipal assembly. The indicated appeal is examined by the mayor within a two-week period. 10. The head of the municipality issues instructions on questions of his own jurisdiction established by legislation of the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow. 11. The administration of the city and the municipal assembly have a right to exercise control over the activity of the head of the municipality in a procedure stipulated by legislation of the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow. 12.

The municipal assembly can be convened at the initiative of the Moscow City Duma, the mayor of Moscow, or by no less that two-thirds of the municipal councillors, but not more than twice a year. 16. The municipal assembly has the right to exercise control functions, including control over the activity of the head of the municipality and over the procedure for using tracts of land and municipal property. 17. The municipal assembly is competent to make decisions if more than half of the municipal councillors are present at its meeting. Decisions are adopted by a majority of the municipal councillors attending the meeting and are signed by the head of the municipality, except decisions about appealing to the mayor of Moscow on the question of dismissing the head of the municipality from his position. 18. Decisions of the municipal assembly that are adopted within the scope of its jurisdiction are obligatory for implementation by all enterprises, institutions, organizations, organs of public territorial self-government, and citizens located on the pertinent territory. In the event that a decision of the municipal assembly contradicts legislation of the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow, or affects the interests of the city as a whole, it can be suspended by the mayor of Moscow or official authorized by him. 19. The municipal assembly can be dissolved by the Moscow City Duma in cases established by legislation of the Russian Federation, and also as a result of the conduct of a local referendum on confidence in the assembly. The municipal assembly can adopt a decision on early dissolution. The elections of municipal councillors must be held not later than three months from the date of the corresponding adoption by the Moscow City Duma of a decision on the dissolution of the municipal assembly, the announcement of the results of a referendum, or the adoption of a decision on self-dissolution. V. Territorial Public Self-Government. 20.
