FBIS4-13370 "drnes076_o_94005" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 SYRIA Press Dismisses `Limited' Israeli Withdrawal Press Dismisses `Limited' Israeli Withdrawal JN2004073194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0440 GMT 20 Apr 94 JN2004073194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] AL-BA'TH says that it is not new for Israel to heap accusations on Syria to tarnish its stands. AL-BA'TH says that most Israeli accusations are not worth considering or responding to. This is because to respond to some of these accusations, which are within the context of lies and deception, requires the reassertion of unequivocal facts. Such facts cannot be obliterated, irrespective of the allegations fabricated by Israel. A sample of such accusations is that whenever the national Lebanese resistance deals a painful blow to the Zionist occupation troops and their agents, Israel starts leveling accusations amounting to blatant threats against Syria. AL-BA'TH adds: Although Syria's stands on the peace process are constant, principled, and clear, the Rabin government's accusations are ready and repetitive, occurring whenever Syria makes it clear that it will not respond to Israel's terms and peace proposals which guarantee nothing but Israel's interests and ambitions. AL-BA'TH stresses that Israel's accusations against the resistance in Lebanon are part of the pressures being exercised against Lebanon in the course of the peace process. Moreover, the scope of such accusations is often expanded to include Syria by alluding to alleged Syrian pressures against Lebanon. Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Facts on the ground will remain stronger than any attempt at falsification. Lebanon's right to resist the occupation is legitimate. Lebanon needs nobody to tell it what to do in this regard or to interfere in its affairs. Lebanon is exercising a natural right. It adopts stands that maintain its rights and sovereignty, inspired by its national and pan-Arab interest. The voices that have joined Israel and begun to accuse Syria of interfering in Lebanon's affairs are not worth responding to or commenting on. Under its legitimate leadership and cohesive national unity, Lebanon will remain greater than accusations. It will not be harmed for opting for brotherly relations with Syria in the interest of the two sisterly countries. TISHRIN comments on Israeli proposals in southern Lebanon and the future of the Golan Heights. It says: These days, the Israelis are talking much about proposals and plans to activate the peace process regarding both southern Lebanon and the Golan. However, the Israelis have failed to reveal the content of their proposals, and whether they are based on full withdrawal, or, like previous Israeli proposals, are a new attempt to circumvent UN resolutions. TISHRIN stresses that Syria's position in this regard is clear and unmistakable. Syria is eager to expedite and activate the peace talks. At the same time, Syria adheres to the Madrid conference formula and the constants of a just, comprehensive peace. Syria will not relinquish one inch of the Golan, nor will it ever bargain over its undeniable right to restore it. TISHRIN contends that Syria does not need papers to activate the Syrian track. As the Israeli rulers are well aware, Syria's stands are based on right, justice, international legitimacy, and on the fact that only the full removal of the occupation from the Arab territories is the path that will lead to a successful, durable peace. As long as Israel is far from that, then it is only fair to say that the national Lebanese resistance to the Israeli schemes in southern Lebanon and confronting the Israeli policy of aggression, expansion, and repression is legitimate. This is because resistance targets the occupation and seeks to defend southern Lebanon against the aggressive Israeli control. TISHRIN stresses that any Israeli talk about partial or limited withdrawals and about proposals that do not speak of full withdrawal and terminating the occupation of southern Lebanon and the Golan are yet another rejected and denounced Israeli attempt to maintain the occupation. So are phased solutions. The allegation that what is urgent is to arrive at security arrangements is an Israeli illusion. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israel would be gravely mistaken if it believes that it will be able to follow a policy of blacking out facts. Withdrawal from the entire occupied territories needs no interpretations. It needs only a sincere desire to implement the resolutions of the international legitimacy. The road to peace starts with full withdrawal. Only such a withdrawal will lead to the achievement of peace.
