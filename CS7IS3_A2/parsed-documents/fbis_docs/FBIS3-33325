The party leaders went to the cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas and talked for 30 minutes with the EZLN members led by Subcommander Marcos to express their support for the agreements to be reached during these peace talks. PCM Secretary General Jorge Amador Amador spoke about the dialogue they held with Subcommander Marcos and the rest of the EZLN delegation: [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Did the party representatives make any specific proposal to the EZLN delegates? [Amador] I think that the most important aspect of this is the fact that these political organizations are willing -- according to its strength and convictions -- to support the agreements to be reached during the peace and reconciliation meetings. I believe all of the organizations present here emphasized their support. The EZLN representatives repeatedly demanded this support, which they need. We left open the possibility that we might hold bilateral meetings and that as the talks advance, we will be kept informed of the results, we will be consulted, and naturally we will be able to give our points of view, if requested. [Reporter] With whom did you meet? [Amador] We met with the entire delegation of the EZLN led by Subcommander Marcos. [Reporter] What was his message? [Amador] He requested that we understand and value their struggle, that we express our solidarity, and that we help them get ahead. [end recording] Also present at this meeting, among others, were: PDM President Marcelo (Gargiola); Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the Green Ecology Party; Everto Castillo and Mario Saucedo, for the PRD; and PRI party member Alfredo Rojas Diaz Duran, on a personal basis.
