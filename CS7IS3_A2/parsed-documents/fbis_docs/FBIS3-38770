Today, this excuse will not wash. Humankind knows all about Bosnia and still it does nothing. When a mortar shell lands on a crowded Sarajevo market square, the whole world can witness its impact first-hand: 68 dead and about 200 wounded, according to yesterday's body count. As [Paris Archbishop] Lustiger said, this is indeed "a crime against humanity." Politicians the world over are on the same wavelength. Using the same words, they indignantly condemn this new act of savagery. These seasoned hypocrites even sometimes let themselves shed bitters tears before they start their aimless arm-waving. They should be forgiven for they do not know what they are saying any more. See Bill Clinton; chin jutting, looking like he hopes that someone will hold his arm lest he starts thrashing about, the U.S. President has been envisaging the possibility of agreeing to NATO air strikes "once responsibilities have been assigned." In other words, he does not rule out retaliatory action. But these are tired words he has already uttered many times, as have all Western leaders, including the French. Is it any wonder that the Serb aggressor remains unimpressed? Politicians should therefore agree to a moratorium. From now on, here and everywhere else, they -- with only a few exceptions -- should keep their mouth shut when it comes to the Bosnian tragedy, which they themselves prompted before abandoning its victims to their fate. Consider the facts. First of all, when a Pandora's box of Serb, Croat, or Bosnian nationalisms opened on the ruins of the former Yugoslavia, their applause was deafening. Then, through fatalism, thoughtlessness, or demagogy, they encouraged ethnic fanaticisms of all stripes by giving birth to a Bosnia which had not been asking for such solicitude. Above all, they would not intervene before the conflict erupted, when -- in the spring of 1991 -- such a conflict had become a definite possibility and sending a simple peacekeeping force to Bosnia was still a sufficient preventive measure. Even worse than a crime, this was a sin. Therefore the only way for politicians to recover a measure of decency is to keep silent. Unless they stick to facts, like new U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who indicated yesterday that the 28,000 blue helmets currently in the former Yugoslavia "are surrounded by 200,000 war-ready fighters." Because they are not allowed to use their weapons, UN soldiers are not in a position to bring the war to a halt. In the field, the generals -- consequently punished by the United Nations -- had been saying nothing but that. One can therefore see the limits of humanitarian action: All it relieves is the conscience of its sponsors. What are we to do, then? Stop blurting out empty threats. Make examples, for the sake of history. Send an ultimatum to the belligerents, provided we are ready to use force to implement its terms. Otherwise, there will be one more casualty in Sarajevo: our honor.
