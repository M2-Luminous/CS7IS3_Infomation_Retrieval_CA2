FBIS4-5407 "dreas069_a_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Debate on Successor to Hosokawa Continues Debate on Successor to Hosokawa Continues LDP Defers Decision on Candidate OW0904111194 Tokyo KYODO in English 1025 GMT 9 Apr 94 OW0904111194 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] will defer a decision for some time on whether to field its own candidate for prime minister in a parliamentary election, LDP officials said Saturday [9 April]. The LDP, which ruled for an uninterrupted 38 years until last August, reached the accord at a meeting of top party officials. Yohei Kono, president, and Yoshiro Mori, secretary general, attended the session. Instead of naming its candidate immediately, however, the LDP will continue to monitor moves by the ruling coalition, the officials said. The seven parties in the ruling coalition are now scrambling to pick a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who, dogged by persistent allegations over his personal finances, abruptly announced his resignation Friday. The senior LDP executives also decided to respond to a coalition proposal to open debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget at the House of Representatives at an early date, the officials said. Meanwhile, the LDP's Diet Affairs Committee chairman said the party will continue efforts to shed light on suspicions over Hosokawa's finances. The inquiry resolves around allegations that Hosokawa failed to repay a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted trucking business group, as well as a new suspicion that Hosokawa unwittingly entrusted an old friend with managing his money in a way that might have involved some illegalities. During the Friday news conference at which he announced his resignation, Hosokawa described the Sagawa money as a loan he had repaid and also raised the topic of the "new suspicions" without disclosing any additional details. Sadatoshi Ozato, LDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman, told reporters, "We need to clarify and explain (Hosokawa's) scandals, including the new problem which Hosokawa himself raised." "However, the investigations into these scandals must take a rational form that would not obstruct Diet deliberations on the budget," he said. In a related development, LDP legislator Koichi Kato, who served as chief cabinet secretary in the cabinet of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the LDP, proposed throwing the LDP's weight behind a candidate to be recommended from among the ranks of other parties. "The Liberal Democratic Party should first decide not to field its candidate for premiership and then consider what moves it could take," Kato said during a nationally-televised news program on the Tokyo Broadcasting System.
