Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Plans for what will be Taiwan's largest industrial park have been finalized, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien reported Tuesday [4 January]. The park is being built in Yunlin County on Taiwan's southwest coast and is scheduled to be completed by 2016. Yang said four and a half years of work went into planning the project, including site selection, environmental evaluation, and geologic and water studies. The industrial complex will occupy a total of 11,000 hectares on reclaimed offshore land in the towns of Mailiao, Hsinhsing, and Sihu. The Mailiao section will contain 2,500 hectares, the Hsinhsing section 1,072, and the Sihu section 7,428. Formosa Plastics Group is building Taiwan's sixth naphtha cracking plant in the Mailiao section, while the Industrial Development Bureau will be responsible for the development of the Hsinhsing and Sihu sections, which will house steelworks, oil refineries, and petrochemical plants, among others. To facilitate transportation of raw materials and finished products in and out of Taiwan, two industrial ports will be built in Mailiao and Sihu. The ports will be able to handle 30 million metric tons and 90 million metric tons, respectively. Separately, Yang said the government has yet to make a final decision on whether to locate Taiwan's first-ever free trade area within the Sihu section. In a bid to attract multinational companies, Taiwan has been mulling setting up a free trade area to promote the island as a business operations center in the Asia- Pacific.
