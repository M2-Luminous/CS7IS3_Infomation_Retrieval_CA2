At this meeting provincial party Secretary Yan Haiwang stressed: It is necessary to properly handle relations between reform, development, and stability to ensure overall fulfillment of this year's reform and construction tasks. At the meeting Yan Haiwang expressed his views on implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Eighth Provincial CPC Congress, on deepening reform and expediting development, and on making a success of this year's economic work. The first is clearly understanding the situation and changing ideas to cope with development of the socialist market economy. The second is giving prominence to key points, resolving difficulties, and maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. The third is making overall progress, breaking through focal points, and speeding up establishment of the socialist market economic structure. The fourth is having a thorough idea of the situation, strengthening leadership, and ensuring the smooth carrying out of reform and construction. Yan Haiwang said: This year the state will make a major move in financial, taxation, monetary, planning, investment, and foreign trade reforms. We should unswervingly implement the reform measures promulgated by the state. Facing new tasks and a new situation in reform and construction, we should have new ideas for development, create new structures, and change our concepts. At present, we should break the old, traditional concept of a planned economy and cultivate a new concept of a market economy. We should free ourselves from the binds of planned economic operation and management methods, establish a new concept in which economic and legal means as well as the necessary administrative methods are applied to economic management, correctly handle relations between markets and plans, cultivate a mentality which dialectically integrates microeconomic invigoration and macroeconomic control and regulation, overcome the idea of inertia, and foster the idea of being bold in taking risks. Yan Haiwang pointed out: In this year's economic work, there is a need to strengthen the position of agriculture as the foundation, to bring about overall development in the rural economy, to switch our economic work to improving economic results, to increase the impetus of economic structural adjustment, to adjust the orientation of capital injection, to ensure the carrying out of key construction projects, and to improve investment results. Yan Haiwang stressed: In this year's reform, our province should make breakthroughs in these three aspects: The first is making a breakthrough in the ownership structural adjustment; the second is actively and steadily establishing a new enterprise system; and the third is conscientiously implementing all macrocontrol and regulatory policies to promote our province's reform to a new period and scale a new height in economic construction. The meeting was presided over by Acting Governor Zhang Wule. [passage omitted]
