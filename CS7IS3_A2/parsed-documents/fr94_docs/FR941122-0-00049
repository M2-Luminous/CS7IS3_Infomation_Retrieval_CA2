FR941122-0-00049 FR941122-0-00011 Tuesday November 22, 1994 Part V Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Part 72 Acid Rain Program: Permits; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 224␣/␣Tuesday, November 22, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 72 [FRL&hyph;5109&hyph;6] RIN 2060&hyph;AF55 Acid Rain Program: Permits AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101&hyph;549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act), authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11, 1993, the Agency promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules. On August 10, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing certain substitution plan issues. Based on a review of the record, the Agency concludes that the January 11, 1993 regulations concerning the eligibility of units to be designated as substitution units should be revised. Under sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act, a unit that is not listed in Table A of section 404 as being subject to Phase I of the Acid Rain Program (i.e., a non-Table A unit) and that is under the control of the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 (i.e., a Table A unit) may be designated as a substitution unit. The January 11, 1993 regulations state that the Table A unit and each non-Table A unit that the Table A unit designates as a substitution unit must have ``the same owner or operator.'' The Agency is revising the regulations in order to specify more clearly the circumstances under which the statutory ``control'' requirement for substitution plans is met. The rule revision is being issued as a direct final rule because it is consistent with the August 10, 1994 settlement and no adverse comment is expected. EFFECTIVE DATE: This direct final rule will be effective on January 3, 1995 unless significant, adverse comments are received by December 22, 1994. If significant, adverse comments are timely received on any provision of the direct final rule, that provision of the direct final rule will be withdrawn through a document in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;40, containing supporting information used to develop the proposal, copies of all comments received, and responses to comments, is available for public inspection and copying from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays, at EPA's Air Docket Section (LE&hyph;131), Waterside Mall, room 1500, 1st floor, 401 M Street, SW., Washington DC 20460. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dwight C. Alpern, Attorney-advisor, at (202) 233&hyph;9151, Acid Rain Division (6204J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, or the Acid Rain Hotline at (202) 233&hyph;9620. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: All public comment received on any provision of this direct final rule on which significant, adverse comments are timely received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the relevant portions of the rule revision that is noticed as a proposed rule in the Proposed Rules Section of this Federal Register and that is identical to this direct final rule. The contents of the preamble to the final rule are as follows: I. Control Requirement for Designating Substitution Units II. Modifications of the January 11, 1993 Regulation Concerning the Control Requirement for Substitution Units A. Control by Common Owner or Operator B. Control by Contract C. Plan Termination if Control Requirement is no Longer Met III. Administrative Requirements A. Docket B. Executive Order 12866 C. Paperwork Reduction Act D. Regulatory Flexibility Act E. Miscellaneous I. Control Requirement for Designating Substitution Units Sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act set forth the requirements for submission and approval of substitution plans, under which a unit listed on Table A of section 404 designates one or more non-Table A units as substitution units and brings them into Phase I of the Acid Rain Program. Congress established substitution plans as a compliance option to increase units' compliance flexibility and reduce their overall costs of compliance in Phase I while still achieving the emissions reductions intended by Congress under title IV. See 58 FR 60950&hyph;60951 (Nov. 18, 1993). A substitution plan allows the owner or operator of a Table A unit to reassign the unit's emissions reduction obligations to a designated non-Table A unit ``under the control of'' that owner or operator. 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). Upon approval of the reassignment, the non-Table A unit becomes subject to all requirements for Phase I units with regard to sulfur dioxide and is allocated allowances. Emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit may therefore free up allowances, which may be used by the Table A unit (or any other unit) in lieu of making emissions reductions. Section 71.41 of the January 11, 1993 regulations provided that the statutory requirement of control by the Table A unit's owner or operator over the non-Table A unit is satisfied where such units have ``the same owner or operator.'' 40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993). The regulation also provided that having the same designated representative would be treated as having the same operator and would thus meet the control requirement. Id. ; see also 58 FR 3600. On March 12, 1993, petitions for review of the January 11, 1993 regulations were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several petitioners challenged the provisions implementing the control requirement. On November 18, 1993, the Agency issued proposed revisions to the January 11, 1993 regulations, including the provisions concerning the control requirement. The Agency proposed to reverse its interpretation that having a common designated representative alone meets the statutory control requirement for substitution plans and to revise the regulations accordingly. 58 FR 60957&hyph;60958. Several commenters addressed the control requirement in their comments on the November 18, 1993 proposal. Some commenters opposed any change in the January 11, 1993 provisions concerning the control requirement. Other commenters noted that, although §72.41(b)(1)(i) requires that the substitution and Table A units have ``the same owner or operator'' (40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993)), section 404(b) of the Act requires that the substitution unit be under the control of the Table A unit owner or operator. They argued that, in implementing section 404(b) and (c), the Agency should also focus on whether there is such control. They suggested that common ownership of the units is not necessarily determinative of whether the control requirement is met. They alleged that where the units have multiple owners only one of which is in common, the control requirement may not be met, e.g., where the common owner owns only a very small percentage of the proposed substitution unit. On the other hand, where the units lack any common owner or operator, the control requirement allegedly may be met through contractual arrangements under which the owner and operator of the substitution unit commit, inter alia , to make emissions reductions and deliver allowances to the owner and operator of the Phase I unit. In a separate final rule in this Federal Register , the Agency adopted the reasoning, set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60957&hyph;60958) and in the preamble of the Acid Rain regulations on nitrogen oxides (59 FR 13554&hyph;13555 (Mar. 22, 1994)), that a designated representative is not, merely by holding that position, also an operator. In that separate final rule, the Agency revised the January 11, 1993 regulations to use the statutory language requiring control by the Table A unit owner or operator and to provide that having a common designated representative does not alone meet the control requirement for substitution units. However, the Agency did not address in that separate document comments raising issues concerning: under what circumstances the existence of one or more common owners satisfies the control requirement; and whether and, if so, under what circumstances control can be established by contract if there are no common owners or common operators. The Agency addresses below those issues and the comments on those issues. II. Modifications of the January 11, 1993 Regulation Concerning the Control Requirement for Substitution Units A. Control by Common Owner or Operator Section 404(b) of the Act allows that the ``owner or operator'' of a Table A unit to designate, as a substitution unit, a non-Table A unit ``under the control of such owner or operator.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). The Agency agrees with commenters that, like section 404(b), the regulation implementing that section should focus on whether such control exists. Because many units have multiple owners with varying percentages of ownership, there is a wide range of possible relationships between a Table A unit and a non-Table A unit, ranging, for example, from no common ownership to 100% common ownership and including all the possible variations in between. In order to avoid burdensome case-by-case determinations of whether each particular set of facts meets the control requirement and in order to provide more certainty for utilities and the public concerning what units qualify for inclusion in substitution plans, the Agency is establishing generic criteria for applying the control requirement. Further, the generic criteria are based on the potential ability of owners and operators to exercise control, not the actual exercise of such control potential. Determining what entities actually make decisions governing the operation of a unit could require the Agency to make lengthy case-by-case inquiries into the details of utility operations and involve the Agency in matters beyond its expertise. In taking this approach, the Agency maintains that section 404(b) should be interpreted to require that owners or operators of a Table A unit have the ability to exercise a significant degree of control over a non-Table A unit. The simplest case for applying this requirement is where the Table A and non-Table A units have only a single owner or where, regardless of their ownership, the units have a common operator. Under these circumstances, it seems clear that the single owner or the operator of the Table A unit has the ability to control the non-Table A unit. For units with multiple owners, the application of the control requirement becomes somewhat more complex if they do not have a common operator. If one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit own an aggregate share of 50% or more of the capacity of a non-Table A unit, no major decisions concerning the unit can be made without the concurrence of such Table A unit owners and operators. The Agency maintains, therefore, that they can control the non-Table A unit to a significant extent and meet the control requirement. Even where the aggregate ownership share of the one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit in a non-Table A unit is less than 50%, the degree of control may still be significant. Such control is evidenced by the ability of such non-Table A unit owners to determine the dispatch of their respective shares of electricity generated by the non-Table A unit. Decisions by such owners whether or not to take their shares of generation can significantly affect the overall operation of the unit. While the Agency recognizes that adopting a minimum level of ownership in the non-Table A unit for meeting the control requirement is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, the Agency maintains that, as a matter of logic, there is some level of ownership below which the owners lack significant control. Further, establishing such a minimum level of ownership discourages gaming through the acquisition of minute ownership shares simply to enable the new owner to qualify the non-Table A unit as a substitution unit. The Agency believes that an aggregate ownership interest of 10% or more, and less than 50%, of the capacity of the non-Table A unit meets the control requirement, provided that such owners have the ability to determine how their respective shares of the non-Table A unit's generation are dispatched. The Agency notes that, in some regions of the country, utilities have entered into power pool agreements under which the utilities agree to centralize in the power pool the dispatch of their units. Power pools with central economic dispatch enable member utilities to minimize operating costs through the use of the units in the pool that have the lowest generation costs. In light of the important benefits of such power pools, the Agency maintains that utilities in power pools should not be disadvantaged under section 404(b). Consequently, the determination of whether owners of a non-Table A unit have, by right of contract, the ability to dispatch their respective shares of the unit's generation should be made without regard to whether owners that had contractual dispatch authority have surrendered that authority to a power pool. In sum, the Agency is establishing generic criteria for determining whether the control requirement under section 404(b) is met. The first category that meets this requirement is where one or more owners or operators of a Table A unit have an aggregate ownership interest of 50% or more in the non-Table A unit or where the two units have a common operator. 1 The second category that meets the control requirement is where: a Table A and non-Table A unit lack a common operator; one or more owners or operators of a Table A unit have an aggregate ownership interest of 10% or more and less than 50% in the non-Table A unit; and such owners or operators have the contractual ability to determine the dispatch of their respective shares of the non-Table A unit's generation. The final regulation requires the designated representatives submitting substitution plans to state in the submission what category is applicable to the units in the plan and to provide, upon request, documentation supporting such statements. These statements, like all information included in submissions by the designated representative, are covered by the certification required under §72.21(b) concerning the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the statements. 1 In summing the ownership shares of individual Table A unit owners and operators in the capacity of a non-Table unit, a given share, and the generation associated with such share, obviously cannot be double-counted. Otherwise, the sum of the ownership shares of all persons owning a non-Table A unit could exceed 100%. B. Control by Contract The Agency agrees that, under certain circumstances, control over a substitution unit by the owners and operators of the Table A unit may be established by contract where the above-described criteria based on a common operator or the level of common ownership are not met. The contract must be a binding agreement between the owners and operators of a Table A unit and the owners and operators of the non-Table A unit that is designated as the Table A unit's substitution unit. Several commenters supported an interpretation of section 404(b) that would allow the control requirement to be met through a contract. The final regulation specifies the circumstances under which the Administator will find that control is established by contract. Several determinations have guided the Agency's development of the regulation concerning control by contract. First, the Agency believes that the regulation should set forth detailed, generic requirements for establishing control by contract. Leaving the specification of detailed requirements to case-by-case development would increase the burden both on the owners and operators interested in submitting contract-based substitution plans and on the Agency, which must review such submissions. A commenter supporting the approval of contract-based substitution plans suggested that the Agency develop generic criteria. Second, the Agency believes that the control requirement of section 404(b) of the Act should be interpreted in light of the emissions reduction goals of title IV. The Agency maintains that a determination of whether control is established by contract should focus on whether the owners and operators of the Table A unit have the ability, under the contract, to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit and thereby to affect the overall operation of the unit. It is not necessary in this context for the Table A unit's owners and operators to have contractual authority over all facets of the non-Table A unit's day-to-day operations. Third, if the control requirement is to be met by simply showing that Table A unit owners and operators have the ability, by contract, to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit, the Agency maintains that the contract must require emissions reductions that are significant, new reductions that would not otherwise have been implemented by the non-Table A unit. It is difficult to see how control could be demonstrated if a contract with a Table A unit merely required a non-Table A unit to ``make'' reductions that the non-Table A unit had already implemented, was already in the process of implementing, or would have implemented even in the absence of the contract. Further, because a unit might be able to realize relatively minor reductions while making little change in its operations, the scale of the reductions required by contract should be significant in order to demonstrate control of the non-Table A unit by owners and operators that otherwise lack any operational responsibilities for that unit. A commenter suggested that the contract between the Table A and non-Table A units should specify a percentage emissions rate reduction that the non-Table A unit is required to achieve. To ensure that the contract requires significant, new reductions by the non-Table A unit, the final regulation requires that the contract establish a maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate for the unit. The maximum emissions rate must be less than or equal to 70% of the lesser of the following emissions rates for the non-Table A unit: the 1985 actual SO 2 emissions rate; the 1985 allowable SO 2 emissions rate; the greater of the 1989 or 1990 actual SO2 emissions rate; the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation, as of November 15, 1990, applicable in Phase I; and the lesser of the average actual SO 2 emissions rate or the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation for the four-quarter period immediately preceding the submission of the contract-based substitution plan. 2 The latter set of emissions rates (i.e., the current actual and allowable rates) are included to ensure that the required reduction in the unit's emissions rate is at least 30% of the emissions rate achieved, or required to be achieved, by the non-Table A unit around the time of the submission of the substitution plan. The other emissions rates (i.e., those for 1985, 1989, 1990, and Phase I) are used to ensure that the current actual or allowable rate does not represent a spike in the emissions rate achieved by or required for the unit since 1985. 3 A commenter supported using all of these emissions rates to set a maximum emissions rate for the non-Table A unit. 2 Some units are subject to a non-unit-specific emissions limit (e.g., a utility-wide emissions tonnage or rate limit). The final regulation provides that if such a unit is designated as a substitution unit in a contract-based substitution plan, the Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis how to apply the non-unit-specific limit in setting the maximum annual SO 2 emissions rate. If a non-unit-specific Federal limit was in effect and applicable to the unit in 1985, that limit is already reflected in the 1985 allowable SO 2 emissions rate (in the National Allowance Data Base), which will be treated as representing the non-unit- specific Federal limit. 3 For the reasons set forth in a separate final rule in this Federal Register , these other emissions rates are also used to allocate allowances for any substitution unit and to ensure that allowances are not allocated for emissions reductions that would have been made without a substitution plan. The Agency maintains that a 30% reduction in the emissions rate that the non-Table A unit would otherwise achieve represents a significant reduction. A commenter supporting approval of contract-based substitution plans asserted that it has identified about 30 Phase II units that lack a common owner or operator with a Table A unit and for which such plans would be economically feasible. The commenter stated that this group of units could reduce their current emissions rates by 50 to 70% and indicated that a 30% reduction might be an acceptable requirement for approval of this type of substitution plan. As a further means of ensuring that the non-Table A unit's reductions are new, the final regulation requires that the contract-based substitution plan include a description of the actions that will be undertaken so that the non-Table A unit will comply with the maximum emissions rate. Such actions may include, for example, the addition or modification of a scrubber or fuel switching. The owners and operators of the Table A and non-Table A units must show that the described actions will not be implemented in Phase I unless the non-Table A unit is approved as a substitution unit. The description of the actions that will be taken must be sufficiently detailed so that the Agency can determine whether the showing has been made. Information relevant to the showing includes, inter alia , whether contracts implementing these actions were entered into before submission of the substitution plan. Under the regulation, the owners and operators must implement the described actions but may seek to amend the substitution plan to change the required actions. In general, the Agency maintains that it is difficult to make determinations, particularly in a large number of cases, of whether owners and operators will take certain future actions in the absence of a substitution plan. However, the Agency must make a determination of this type in reviewing the actions described in each contract-based substitution plan in order to make sure that the non-Table A unit is really obligated to make new reductions. This will be a one-time determination made when the plan is approved (or disapproved) unless the designated representative subsequently seeks to modify the description of actions in the plan. Further, the Agency does not expect a large number of contract-based substitution plans to be submitted. As noted above, commenters have identified only about 30 units for which such a plan would be economic. Fourth, it is important to ensure that the contract imposes an effective emissions reduction requirement_i.e., a requirement that is likely to be enforced by Table A unit owners and operators claiming control of the non-Table A unit. Consequently, the contract should include a meaningful remedy in the event that the required emissions reductions are not achieved. The concept of requiring a meaningful remedy in the event of default was supported by a commenter. If the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender allowances to the Administrator to the extent that the non-Table A unit fails to make the required emissions reductions, then the Table A owners and operators will bear responsibility for the reductions that they claim to control and will have the incentive to take actions to ensure achievement of the reductions. This puts the Table A owners and operators in a position similar to that of owners and operators that control a unit directly by owning or operating the unit. If, instead of such allowance surrender by the Table A unit, the non-Table A unit had to give allowances to the Table A unit (or to the Agency), then the Table A unit owners and operators would bear no responsibility for the non-Table A unit that they claim to control. Further, without elaborate limitations on the transfer of allowances between the Table A and non-Table A units, there would be no way of preventing the units from arranging a future return to the non-Table A unit of any allowances surrendered by the non-Table A unit to the Table A unit. Under the final regulation, if the non-Table A unit fails to comply with the maximum emissions rate during the year, the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender a number of allowances equal to the non-Table A unit's baseline multiplied by the difference between the actual emissions rate for the year and the maximum emissions rate. This approach segregates out the effect of utilization changes and leaves such changes to be handled under the reduced utilization and allowance surrender provisions (e.g., §§72.43, 72.91, and 72.92) applicable to all Phase I units. The surrendered allowances must have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances allocated to the non-Table A unit for the year, and the surrender must be made on or before the allowance transfer deadline. In order to encourage early reductions at non-Table A units and innovative approaches to achieving such reductions, the surrender and deduction of allowances will be the only remedy under the Act for failure to meet the maximum emissions rate. Of course, the deduction of allowances for failure to achieve the maximum emissions rate may result in a unit having insufficient allowances to cover its annual emissions, and the full panoply of remedies for excess emissions will then apply. Finally, in order to facilitate the Table A unit owners' and operators' exercise of control and the Agency's review and enforcement, where necessary, of the substitution plan, the units involved should have a common designated representative. A commenter supported the need for a common designated representative for this type of substitution plan. 4 The final regulation provides that the requirement to have a common designated representative is not met by simply having a common alternate designated representative. This is because, as explained in the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposed rule, an alternate designated representative does not carry the same level of responsibilities as, and thus is not equivalent to, a designated representative. 58 FR 60958. 4 The commenter also suggested that the non-Table A owners and operators be required to submit quarterly and annual reports to the Table A unit owners and operators and to indemnify such owners and operators for any violations at the non-Table A unit. These requirements are not in the final rule because the Agency believes that these matters are not central to the issue of control and are better left to the owners and operators of the two units. C. Plan Termination if Control Requirement is no Longer met The January 11, 1993 regulations provide that where, as a result of ownership or other changes, the units in a substitution plan no longer meet the common owner or operator requirement in those regulations, the substitution plan must be terminated. The final regulation adopted here takes a similar approach. If there are changes that result in the control requirement no longer being met, the designated representative must terminate the plan, whether the plan is based on common owners or operators or on a contract. The Administrator may, on his or her own motion, terminate the plan under such circumstances. The only exception to this requirement is for substitution plans approved, and included in final permits issued, under the January 11, 1993 regulations and the Partial Settlement in Environmental Defense Fund v. Carol M. Browner , No. 93&hyph;1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (signed May 4, 1994). So long as the Table A and non-Table A units under each plan continue to meet the common owner, operator, or designated representative requirement in the January 11, 1993 regulations, such plans will not be terminated for the first year (and, in some cases, for the second year) for which the substitution unit received a total number of allowances equal to the number provided in those regulations. This exception is consistent with both the May 4, 1993 settlement and the Second Partial Settlement in Environmental Defense Fund v. Carol M. Browner , No. 93&hyph;1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (signed August 10, 1994). The Agency maintains that both settlements reasonably resolve the substitution plan issues raised in the litigation, including the issues relating to the control requirement. III. Administrative Requirements A. Docket The docket is the organized and complete file of all the information considered by EPA in the development of this rulemaking. Along with the preamble of the direct final rule, the contents of the docket_except for interagency review materials_will constitute the record in case of judicial review. See 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(A). B. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), the Administrator must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because the rule seems to raise novel legal or policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Any changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record. Any written comments from OMB to EPA and any written EPA response to those comments are included in the docket. The docket is available for public inspection at the EPA's Air Docket Section, which is listed in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. , and have been assigned control number 2060&hyph;0258. This collection of information has an estimated burden averaging 17.5 to 28 hours per response for about 43 responses. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. An Information Collection Request document and estimates of the public reporting burden were prepared in connection with the January 11, 1993 regulations. 56 FR 63098; 58 FR 3650. The regulation modifications contained in this document will not significantly change the reporting burden that was previously estimated. Send comments regarding this burden analysis or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW., (Mail Code 2136), Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , requires each Federal agency to consider potential impacts of its regulations on small business ``entities.'' Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), an agency issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis. Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Administrator certified that those regulations, including the provisions revised by today's final rule, would not have a significant impact. 58 FR 3649. The final rule revisions adopted today are not significant enough to change the economic impact addressed in the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, which were certified as not having a significant impact. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that the revised rule will not have a significant, adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities. E. Miscellaneous In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this rule was preceded by consultation with any appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 72 Environmental protection, Acid rain, Air pollution control, Electric utilities, Permits, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur dioxide. Dated: November 14, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, chapter I of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 72_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 72 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7601 and 7651 et seq. 2. Section 72.41 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(5) and (e)(3)(iv) and adding paragraphs (c)(6), (c)(7), and (e)(1)(iii) to read as follows: §72.41 Phase I substitution plans. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (5) A demonstration that the substitution plan meets the requirement that each unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is under the control of the owner or operator of each unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section that designates the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as a substitution unit. The demonstration shall be one of the following: (i) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage ownership interest of 50 percent or more in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the units have a common operator, a statement identifying such owners or operators and their aggregate percentage ownership interest in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or identifying the units' common operator. The designated representative shall submit supporting documentation upon request by the Administrator. (ii) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage ownership interest of at least 10 percent and less than 50 percent in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the units do not have a common operator, a statement identifying such owners or operators and their aggregate percentage ownership interest in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this seciton and stating that each such owner or operator has the contractual right to direct the dispatch of the electricity that, because of its ownership interest, it has the right to receive from the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The fact that the electricity that such owner or operator has the right to receive is centrally dispatched through a power pool will not be the basis for determining that the owner or operator does not have the contractual right to direct the dispatch of such electricity. The designated representative shall submit supporting documentation upon request by the Administrator. (iii) A copy of an agreement that is binding on the owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provides each of the following elements, and is supported by documentation meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section: (A) The owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must not allow the unit to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of a maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate (in lbs/mmBtu), specified in the agreement, for each year during the period that the substitution plan is in effect. (B) The maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate for the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed 70 percent of the lesser of: the unit's 1985 actual SO 2 emissions rate; the unit's 1985 allowable SO 2 emissions rate; the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 actual SO 2 emissions rate; the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation, as of November 15, 1990, applicable to the unit in Phase I; or the lesser of the average actual SO 2 emissions rate or the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation for the unit for four consecutive quarters that immediately precede the 30-day period ending on the date the substitution plan is submitted to the Administrator. If the unit is covered by a non-unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation in the four consecutive quarters or, as of November 15, 1990, in Phase I, the Administrator will determine, on a case-by-case basis, how to apply the non-unit-specific emissions limitation for purposes of determining whether the maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate meets the requirement of the prior sentence. If a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation is not different from a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation that was effective and applicable to the unit in 1985, the Administrator will apply the non-unit-specific SO 2 emissions limitation by using the 1985 allowable SO 2 emissions rate. (C) For each year that the actual SO 2 emissions rate of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section exceeds the maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate, the designated representative of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must surrender allowances for deduction from the Allowance Tracking System account of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The designated representative shall surrender allowances authorizing emissions equal to the baseline of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section multiplied by the difference between the actual SO 2 emissions rate of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate and divided by 2000 lbs/ton. The surrender shall be made by the allowance transfer deadline of the year of the exceedance, and the surrendered allowances shall have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances allocated to the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for that year. The designated representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted. In the absence of such identification, allowances will be deducted on a first-in, first-out basis under §73.35(c)(2) of this chapter. (D) The unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall designate a common designated representative during the period that the substitution plan is in effect. Having a common alternate designated representative shall not satisfy the requirement in the prior sentence. (E) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, the actual SO 2 emissions rate for any year and the average actual SO 2 emissions rate for any period shall be determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. (6) A demonstration under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section shall include the following supporting documentation: (i) The calculation of the average actual SO 2 emissions rate and the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO 2 emissions limitation for the unit for the four consecutive quarters that immediately preceded the 30-day period ending on the date the substitution plan is submitted to the Administrator. To the extent that the four consecutive quarters include a quarter prior to January 1, 1995, the SO 2 emissions rate for the quarter shall be determined applying the methodology for calculating SO 2 emissions set forth in appendix C of this part. This methodology shall be applied using data submitted for the quarter to the Secretary of Energy on United States Department of Energy Form 767 or, if such data has not been submitted for the quarter, using the data prepared for such submission for the quarter. (ii) A description of the actions that will be taken in order for the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to comply with the maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. (iii) A description of any contract for implementing the actions described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section that was executed before the date on which the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section is executed. The designated representative shall state the execution date of each such contract and state whether the contract is expressly contingent on the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. (iv) A showing that the actions described under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section will not be implemented during Phase I unless the unit is approved as a substitution unit. (7) The special provisions in paragraph (e) of this section. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (iii) Where an approved substitution plan includes a demonstration under paragraphs (c)(5)(iii) and (c)(6) of this section. (A) The owners and operators of the substitution unit covered by the demonstration shall implement the actions described under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, as adjusted by the Administrator in approving the plan or in revising the permit. The designated representative may submit proposed permit revisions changing the description of the actions to be taken in order for the substitution unit to achieve the maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate under the approved plan and shall include in any such submission a showing that the actions in the changed description will not be implemented during Phase I unless the unit remains a substitution unit. The permit revision will be treated as an administrative amendment, except where the Administrator determines that the change in the description alters the fundamental nature of the actions to be taken and that public notice and comment will contribute to the decision-making process, in which case the permit revision will be treated as a permit modification or, at the option of the designated representative, a fast-track modification. (B) The designated representative of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall surrender allowances, and the Administrator will deduct allowances, in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(C) of this section. The surrender and deduction of allowances as required under the prior sentence shall be the only remedy under the Act for a failure to meet the maximum annual average SO 2 emissions rate, provided that, if such deduction of allowance results in excess emissions, the remedies for excess emissions shall be fully applicable. * * * * * (3) *␣*␣* (iv)(A) If there is a change in the ownership interest of the owners or operators of any unit under a substitution plan approved as meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section or a change in such owners' or operators' right to direct dispatch of electricity from a substitution unit under such a plan and the demonstration under paragraph (c)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section cannot be made, then the designated representatives of the units governed by this plan shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of the calendar year during which the change is made. (B) Where a substitution plan is approved as meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, if there is a change in the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section and a demonstration that the agreement, as changed, meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) cannot be made, then the designated representative of the units governed by the plan shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of the calendar year during which the change is made. Where a substitution plan is approved as meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, if the requirements of the first sentence of paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) of this section are not met during a calendar year, then the designated representative of the units governed by the plan shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of such calendar year. (C) If the plan is not terminated in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section, the Administrator, on his or her own motion, will terminate the plan and deduct the allowances required to be surrendered under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. (D) Where a substitution unit and the Phase I unit designating the substitution unit in an approved substitution plan have a common owner, operator, or designated representative during a year, the plan shall not be terminated under paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) of this section with regard to the substitution unit if the year is as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this section and the unit received from the Administrator for the year, under the Partial Settlement in Environmental Defense Fund v. Carol M. Browner , No. 93&hyph;1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (signed May 4, 1993), a total number of allowances equal to the unit's baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit's 1985 actual SO 2 emissions rate or 1985 allowable SO 2 emissions rate. ( 1 ) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)( 2 ) of this section, paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this section shall apply to the first year in Phase I for which the unit is and remains an active substitution unit. ( 2 ) If the unit has a Group 1 boiler under part 76 of this chapter and is and remains an active substitution unit during 1995, paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this section shall apply to 1995 and to the second year in Phase I for which the unit is and remains an active substitution unit. ( 3 ) If there is a change in the owners, operators, or designated representative of the substitution unit or the Phase I unit during a year under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this section and, with the change, the units do not have a common owner, operator, or designated representative, then the designated representatives for such units shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of the calendar year during which the change is made. If the plan is not terminated in accordance with the prior sentence, the Administrator, on his or her own motion, will terminate the plan and deduct the allowances required to be surrendered under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
