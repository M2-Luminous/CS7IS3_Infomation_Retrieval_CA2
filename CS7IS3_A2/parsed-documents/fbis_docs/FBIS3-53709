Gulab Din Hekmatyar, has said that he is ready to accept Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto as a mediator to settle his dispute with President Prof. Borhanoddin Rabbani. However, he made it clear that Rabbani would have to resign as the president of Afghanistan. Hekmatyar who is also chief of the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] Afghanistan, expressed his willingness to respond in positive terms to Islamabad's reported initiative for the settlement of his dispute with President Rabbani, during an interview with THE FRONTIER POST, at his stronghold Charasyab (four miles) in Kabul on Wednesday [12 Jan]. To a question about the war situation in Kabul, Hakmatyar said that his men had inflicted heavy losses on the Rabbani forces. "War will continue till President Rabbani accepts our four demands", he declared. Hekmatyar is demanding the resignation of President Rabbani, with the offer that he would also reciprocate. The second demand pertains to the establishment of an interim government in Kabul which, he said should replace the government of President Rabbani. "The proposed interim government should be acceptable to all the Afghan parties", Hekmatyar explained. The interim government, he demanded, should raise a national army within six months and all the Afghan parties should surrender their arms and ammunition to the ministry of defence. "The interim government should hold general elections as soon as the national army is raised", is the fourth demand of Hekmatyar to end the ongoing war in Kabul and other parts of the country. Hekmatyar further said that he would not seek any office in the proposed interim government. "I am not interested in the prime minister's office nor do I want to be the president", Hekmatyar added. "I will not accept anything, but elections. He rejected the allegations that he was responsible for the on-going war and said that president Rabbani was responsible for it who, he said, was trying to have a one-party system in Afghanistan. "It is not only the Hezb-e Eslami fighting against president Rabbani's Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society] and his former defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's Shoora-e Nazar." The Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party] of Ayatollah Mazari and Junbish-e Milli of Gen. Rashid Dostam are also the two major parties fighting against Rabbani and Mas'ud. Hekmatyar said adding "The Hezb-e Wahdat and Junbish-e Milli had been a part of Rabbani's set-up till last month. Replying to a question about the allegations by President Rabbani that communists were helping Hekmatyar in the war, the Afghan premier said that by saying so Rabbani had weakened his own case. "It is a known fact that Gen. Rashid Dostam whom Rabbani was now calling as a communist had been one of his close associates in government for 20 months. "Rabbani himself declared that Gen. Dostam and other communists were part of the Islamic army." Rabbani visited Gen. Dostam five times during his 20-month rule. "It is also a known fact that a top communist general Momin who was killed in war was fighting from Rabbani's side. Hekmatyar said that Rabbani could not mislead the people of Afghanistan merely with such propaganda as everyone in and around Afghanistan was aware that all the top communists of Afghanistan such as Babtak Karmal, Gen Nabi Azeemi, Mahm'ud Bityali, Gen Baba Jan, Farid Mazdak and Kavyani were masterminding the policies of Rabbani's government. Giving datails of his differences with president Rabbani which ultimately led to the current bloody war in Afghanistan, the Afghan prime minister said that Rabbani was suppossed to hold general elections in six months after becoming the president of the country under the Islamabad accord. "I had to accept the office of the prime minister under the Islamabad accord despite my reservations but Rabbani did not honour the accord even for a single day. He did not hand over the prime minister's secretariat to me and the secretariat building continued to remain under the control of Jami'at-e Eslami fighters. President Rabbani rejected all the decisions taken by my cabinet without any reason. The cabinet decision that Afghan currency will no longer be printed in Moscow was not implemented by president Rabbani for the reason that Moscow was keen on helping him with this currency. All such Afghan currency was printed without any reserves as Rabbani joined Moscow to destroy the Afghan economy. Rabbani failed to restore peace in Afghanistan during his 20 month rule in Kabul as was expected by him. "Kabul suffered 25 big fights during his rule", Hekmatyar said. He added: "On our requests Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia asked Rabbani to let the Islamabad accord be implemented but he did not listen to anyone. He refused to listen to all of those who wanted the return of peace to Afghanistan." Hekmatyar also said that president Rabbani during his 20 month rule continuously instigated one party against the other. He formally asked Gen Rashid Dostam to attack Hezb-e Eslami but he refused. "Rabbani depended on Gen Dostam to perpetuate his illegal rule but he refused to be a party with him any more when he realised that Rabbani was trying to have one party rule in Afghanistan. "Rabbani praised Gen. Dostam so long as he was with him but as soon as he refused to be a tool in his hands he declared him as a communist. Rabbani is on record as having said on several occasions that Gen Dostam played a key role in the removal of communist president Gen Najibollah," he said. Hakmatyar added: "It was Rabbani who failed to keep his allies. Hezb-e Wahdat, Junbish-e Milli [the National Movement] and Afghan National Liberation Front [ANLF] of Prof. Sibghatollah Mojaddedi with him as he did not fulfill the promises he made with them." He said that Hezb-e Eslami was the first to realise that Rabbani and Mas'ud were playing in the hands of the communists. Hekmatyar said this while giving details of the formation of a combined force with Hezb-e Wahdat, Junbish-e Milli and ANLF. Hezb joined us when its leadership realised that Rabbani was responsible for instigating Hazara tribe against the Pukhtoons, Uzbeks against the Pukhtoons, and Shlee against Sunnis. "Similar were the feelings of Gen Dostam when he also decided to be with us against Rabbani and Prof. Sigbhatollah Mojaddrdi agreed with all of us". Hekmatyar said that the current conflict would prove as the final round of war in Kabul against those who were not willing to honour the rule of people.
