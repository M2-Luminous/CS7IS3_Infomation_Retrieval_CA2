FR941122-0-00089 FR941122-0-00013 Issue 20: Wolf management should remain with the Service until delisting. The States or federal agencies like Animal Damage Control should not be involved in wolf recovery. Service Response: The rule clarifies that while the States and tribes are encouraged to lead implementation of the experimental rule, the Service will monitor and is ultimately responsible for the recovery of the species. Should progress toward wolf recovery not be evident (two years of no growth would trigger other conservation measures), the Service will cooperate with the states and tribes to assure steps are taken to resume progress toward recovery. The states and tribes already have highly trained professional wildlife management programs in place and their expertise, authorities, knowledge, and organizations can greatly enhance recovery of the species. Animal Damage Control is a professional federal wildlife management agency that has the responsibility, like all federal agencies, to use their authorities to enhance the recovery of listed species. Animal Damage Control has been a valuable and necessary component of wolf recovery activities in Montana and Minnesota. Issue 21: There should be a mortality limit that triggers more restrictive management or reintroduced wolves that are killed should be quickly replaced. Service Response: The measure of success in the wolf recovery program is not the level of wolf population mortality but growth of the wolf population. Wolf populations can withstand varying levels of mortality and individual wolf mortality is very difficult to measure accurately. Language was added to the final rule that clarifies the need to modify the State and tribal plans, which must be in compliance with the rule, if wolf population growth is not evident. Wolf population growth is easier to accurately monitor and is the criteria that is used to implement other provisions in the rule (e.g. when lethal control may be used, when a population is established, when reintroductions stop, and when wolf populations are recovered). A ``put and take'' strategy does not address the problem of a wolf population failing to maintain growth and is an expensive process to conduct. It is more productive to identify the factors preventing wolf population growth and correct them before simply continually adding more wolves that may die from the same causes. A population that required constant reintroductions to compensate for excessive mortality rates could not be delisted. Issue 22: The experimental population boundaries are not scientifically based and should be modified. Service Response: The Service determined the boundaries of the experimental populations based upon the distribution of the wolf population in Montana. The experimental population boundaries do not include any portion of any known area used by breeding wolves in Montana. It was also determined that any wolf population inside the experimental boundaries would most likely be the result of reintroduced wolves and any breeding groups of wolves outside the experimental boundaries would likely be the result of natural dispersal of wolves from northwestern Montana or Canadian populations. The definition of a wolf population underwent scientific peer review (Service 1994a, Appendix 8). The rationale and location of the experimental population boundaries were also reviewed, and no better consensus of a way to define the geographic range of a wolf population was brought to the Service's attention. Issue 23: Wolves should be reintroduced for more than 3 years. Service Response: Once a wolf population is established in an experimental area there is no need to conduct further reintroductions and to do so would not be cost effective. The soonest the ``wolf population'' criteria could be met is in three years. At that time about 45 wolves would have been reintroduced to each area. The recovery process and assurance of substantial genetic diversity, pack formation, and birth of about 10&hyph;20 pups should have occurred following the reintroduction of 45 animals. This would eliminate the need for additional reintroductions and would allow manpower and funds to be used on monitoring population growth and dispersal.
