In it, the author engaged in a remarkable discourse on the fundamental differences of opinion between our most senior representatives on the relationship between the citizen and the state. This article maintains that the president, as an advocate of a "consistent civic society," is calling for the establishment of higher territorial units and non-profit-making organizations, while Vaclav Klaus is an unequivocal advocate of a strong state or strong-arm government and manifests his distaste for curbing the power of this state in favor of the aforementioned institutions. Mr. Vencalek sees a disharmony here between the president's "liberal view of the world" and the prime minister's unidimensionally social democratic way of thinking, which is, however, an apparently intrinsically neoconservative phenomenon inasmuch as Reagan and Thatcher considered public-legal institutions to be parasites on democracy and limited their authority in favor of the state. On the basis of these hypotheses, Mr. Vencalek "exposes" neoconservatism as the ideological fellow-traveler of social democracy (except for marginal differences in the taxation or privatization spheres!!) and contrasts it with "liberalism," which does not trust the state. The aforementioned views reflect the author's confusion about the fundamental ideological approaches to the arrangement of society. Only in this way can he place conservative thinking alongside social democracy. The essence of the conservative way of thinking consists of its emphasis on a clear definition of ownership rights with regard to property and on freedom of choice for all social entities. In this context, the state is also seen as the guarantor of stable and equal rules for everyone. The role of the state as the "visible hand" of a formless general rule should be minimal, but the role of the state as the guarantor and maker of rules is crucial and, from this point of view, the requirement for a strong state with clearly defined authority, and jurisdiction for the individual government levels is absolutely consistent with the requirement for a minimal role for the state in the microeconomic sphere. The social democratic view of the state runs counter to this. The critical views that, in the discussion on the establishment of higher territorial units, warn of the consequences of ill-considered decisions in favor of the government's ability to guarantee stability and uniformity of conditions for implementing ownership rights and the freedom of choice for all entities should also be understood in this context. It is essential to adopt a similar view of non-profit-making organizations. To the conservative admirer of the clear and natural order of things, a non-profit-making or public-legal organization is an ambiguous entity that makes it difficult to clearly divide property into private and public property--that is, guaranteed by the generally recognized and supervisory representative of the public, the state. If non-profit-making organizations are perceived as private entities, which, however, enjoy certain, mainly tax, advantages over other profit-making private organizations, the only argument a critic can cite here is the violation of the universal nature of the rules of competition and the possibility that these advantages may be abused. It is worse if non-profit-making organizations are viewed as a kind of third form of ownership, a form that contradicts both private and state ownership. This aspect is gaining in importance, first and foremost, in our situation, where decisions are being made on the fate of the huge amount of property amassed by the former regime. The illusion is being fostered among the public that this is a more noble form of ownership that does not pursue a profit motive and is not abused a priori by a dubious state authority. The impression is being created that the state property originally transferred into this form will somehow serve "all of us" due to the noble intentions of its "public-legal" administrators, that it will be given preferential treatment against other entities, and that we, citizens, will decide on its use by means of some unspecified arrangement for self-organization. In practice, this means abandoning the requirement for a clear definition of ownership rights and of the responsibility of the owner associated with them. This approach to non-profit making organizations, which is very vigorous in the ongoing debates on the appropriate legislation, expresses a priori the mistrust of Mr. Vencalek's "liberals" of private ownership and profit-making motives, which is the driving force behind each market economy. It expresses the attempt to establish, by a "public-legal" form, capitalism with a human face, which preserves at least something of the unfavorable aspects of the irresponsible past. It is necessary to understand "liberalism" perceived like this more in the U.S. sense, as an ideological trend very close to European social democracy. They are both equally distant from consistent and conservative thinking. However, I must give Mr. Vencalek his due in one thing. The issue discussed by him, albeit poorly interpreted, is a sign that our conditions are obviously reaching maturity. It is comforting that the differences between the conservative and "liberal" or social democratic concepts of society are obvious in our policy.
