They have to develop machines with fewer technical extra features and for a lower price. HANDELSBLATT talked with Prof Tilo Pfeifer, business managing director of Werkzeugmaschinenlabor [Machine Tool Labor] (WZL) in Aachen about the technical consequences. The machine tool industry is still essential to machine and plant building, because every type of production is based on use of machine tools. Germany was always leader in this field and, according to Pfeifer, "has actually not more than to a marginal degree relinquished its position to its chief competitor Japan." The medium-size machine tool manufacturers were particularly hard hit by the decreasing demand for capital goods. They had specialized in machine tools high-tech fabrication processes, the first ones factories struck from their purchase lists for reasons of the high cost. The crisis in machine tool manufacturing is not a problem faced by this industry particularly but rather a major a consequence of overproduction in all sectors of industry "affecting any enterprise when the demand decreases and competition on the market becomes ever keener," says Pfeifer. Machines Too Expensive in Times of Cash Shortage While competing with the Japanese, the machine tool manufacturers have in the past let themselves be pushed too hard into the specialty niche and left the mass market to the Japanese. However, also the Japanese had to realize now that in an economic crisis it is not any more the volume they can count upon to ensure cost-effective production. These machine tool manufacturing enterprises, like all others, now need more flexibility in order to more quickly respond to market fluctuations. In order to find a way out of the crisis, it is especially the German machine tool manufacturers who must learn to orient their products to customers' needs. "This is a very important prerequisite for as soon as possible regaining a foothold on the market," says Pfeifer. Most enterprises do not understand that this is also a significant aspect of quality management, a strategy much talked about but implemented by only a few enterprises. "Furthermore, our abilities and creativity have pushed us too far in targeting many branches of industry and made us build into the machine tools features which, while nice and attractive, are of no use to the customer," says Pfeifer in a mood of self-criticism. Now, when money for investments is scarce, the customer wants only what can be cost effectively utilized. The machine tool must be as robust as possible and allow for future additions. Integrated Fabricating Operations Not Flexible Enough During the second half of the 1980's German manufacturers had more heavily emphasized integrating the operations, with the machine tool a component of a computer-controlled system. At that time they were convinced that such systems, which a computer can fully automate through all stages from planning to production, will perform better and respond faster to demand fluctuation. "However, this was an illusion," Pfeifer deduces from what he now knows. The trend is now back to autonomous units. In this way individual production stages acquire more independence. "This does not, however, mean a return to manual labor," explains Pfeifer. Rather, this should eventually make possible relatively quick on-site modification of part programs without prior involvement of lengthy planning procedures. The organization of these autonomous units will then be controlled not from a higher-echelon center but by a self-regulating mechanism. In connection with this one is considering chaos organization and cooperating fractals. Various catch phrases have already been coined, essentially referring to similar concepts of autonomous production units. One of the key development regarded by Pfeifer as a future-oriented one is, therefore, an autonomous production cell: a machine tool which makes efficiently performed functions in the production process available to the human operator. In this way the attendant who programs the machine tool should have available an integrated computer technology which requires only that the configuration of machine tool components necessary for machining blank parts be entered. "The whole task of assigning operations to cutters and planning the procedure is automatically performed by processors and controls in the background behind the machine tool." A production cell is moreover equipped to perform a broad range of monitoring functions: first of all ascertaining that all necessary functions are properly included, then inspecting and monitoring the tools, and finally monitoring the machining process. Many new measuring operations are integrated into machine tool for this purpose. The third level of functions to be added concerns the machining itself. The aim is to meet the demand that a machine tool can be set up so that both turning and milling can be done at the same time rather than only classical turning at time, this having already been proved to be feasible in several cases. As the next interesting feature will be considered combination of turning, milling, and drilling in a single setup. Says Pfeifer: "I think this will be a further evolving process which will indicate how many classical machining operations can be rationally combined." More Functions Integrated in One Machine Tool Beyond that efforts will be made to integrate new technologies such as, for instance, laser machining into the machine tool. "This idea is not entirely new idea," Pfeifer admits, "but still in an early development stage." In this way it will become possible to process parts made of hard materials by first heating them with a laser beam and then machining them while they are hot. Development of future machine tools could lead to a more far-reaching than before collaboration with the user industries, says Pfeifer: "Colleges could take over the development work for future machine designs, work which at this time individual medium-size enterprises can financially not afford to do." The advantage would be that those enterprises could then integrate the innovations into their own products on a step-by-step basis without impairing their competitiveness.
