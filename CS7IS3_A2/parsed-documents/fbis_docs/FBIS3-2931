Now, it won't do without reform and development, and reform and development cannot be accomplished without a stable environment. In light of the current situation, the party Central Committee has put forward the 20-character principle -- the principle of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. This is the stress of the work of the whole party and the whole country. The whole party and the people of all nationalities across the country should uphold the principle. At present, we are having a good opportunity of deepening reform and accelerating development. In order to achieve development, we must carry out reform and open up. We must reform the old structure and establish a new structure of socialist market economy. Only in this way can we accelerate development. All the reform measures promulgated this year are designed to lay a foundation for establishing socialist market economic structure. If these measures are not implemented well, we will be unable to establish the socialist market economic structure. For this reason, we must not fail in their implementation. We must promptly deal with new circumstances and problems which might crop up during the course of reform and development. [passage indistinct] Li Guixian said: After the prices are decontrolled, we must not treat the price increase problem lightly. Effective measures must be adopted to curb price increases and stabilize the market.

We must also solve the problem of teachers' back pay. We must oppose waste and extravagance, reduce unnecessary spendings, and guarantee [words indistinct].
