In statements to Cuban television, the member of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] Politburo commented on the delays in the production plans of several provinces. Lage proceeded to cite the excessive humidity caused by heavy rains and the problems experienced in preparing the harvest as being the main reasons for the delay. In expressing his confidence that they will be able to grind the quantity of sugar forecasted, Lage stressed that there is no indication of exhaustion among the sector's leaders and workers despite having been at work for more than 100 days. During the past year, Cuba was only able to produce 4.2 million tons of sugar, an amount considerably lower than the 7 million tons the country was able to produce in previous years. The sugar harvest will be rescheduled, a situation that had been forecasted by experts, as a result of the beginning of spring, a fall in productivity, and an increase in manufacturing and equipment breakdowns after more than three months of continuous activity at the agro-industrial installations. Previously, Lage had indicated the economic need to grind the sugar as efficiently as possible and manufacture the entire sugar committed, without neglecting to plant and clean the thousands of hectares of land in preparation for next year's harvest.
