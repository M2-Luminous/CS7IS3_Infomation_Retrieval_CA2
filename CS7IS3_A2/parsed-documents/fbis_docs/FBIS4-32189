Arsenic] [Text] "We would be immediately in favor of having the Serbs in Croatia given as many rights as the Albanians have in Kosovo," Tudjman says, stating that Milosevic made a statement along those lines in the Greek KATIMERINI. Zagreb, 28 May--Just before Croatian Statehood Day (30 May, when the Assembly was constituted in 1990 after the first postwar multiparty elections), Croatian President Franjo Tudjman spoke with the chief editors of the Croatian media, and long extracts from this were published in today's newspapers. On that occasion Tudjman mostly repeated his already well-known ideas about events in the last three years--about "the Yugocommunist army's offensive to overthrow the Croatian authorities, and not just to conquer Croatian areas as a whole"--but some of his statements in connection with solving the Serbian question in Croatia are interesting, in view of the topicality of the subject. Stating that "a trip to Belgrade by our foreign minister had been agreed upon, but our condition for that was that it could take place when the route to Belgrade was normalized, i.e., through Okucani and by telephone," Tudjman, among other things, said the following: "The world does not accept that the Serbs in Croatia have the right to self-determination, which they and their politicians and intellectuals are citing. The Serbs are a minority in Croatia, we have guaranteed them all the rights of an ethnic community, and we are even willing to give them territorial self-government in districts, the two districts where they had a majority even before the war, cultural autonomy within Croatia as a whole...." Saying that "They (the Serbs) are still spreading all sorts of deceptions about the emergence of the NDH [Independent State of Croatia]," Tudjman said that Croatia was willing "for the exercise of those rights to be under the supervision of the international community." "In discussions of the Serbian question in Croatia, people are still bringing up the NDH, with those awful figures that at least 600,000 to 700,000 Serbs were killed in Jasenovac alone. But the total number of people who died in all of Yugoslavia during World War II was not that high," Tudjman also claimed, commenting that "back in the 1950's, i.e., in Belgrade, I rebelled against those lies." He claimed that "600,000 people did not die in all of Yugoslavia during World War II, counting all the partisan, chetnik, ustashe, Home Guard losses, with all the Jasenovac, Bleiburg losses, and so forth," but that instead "The war losses were 597,000." "Back when I wrote `Wilderness' ["Wilderness of Historical Reality"], I did not have that fact. Go to the public, and give them those facts in all the newspapers, in order to destroy that rumor and deception, because that is the basis for the alleged justification for the Serbian demands, fear, deception, and so forth," Tudjman commented, and so it turns out that what the ustashe did to the Serbs is not any sort of reason for fear, even though it is a fact that their goal and intention was the biological extermination of the Serbian people from the territory of the Quisling NDH. In connection with possible trips to try to solve the Serbian question in Croatia, Tudjman continued by saying this: "In contrast to the Martic-Mikelic tension and irrational behavior, there is a statement by Milosevic in the Athens KATIMERINI, where he said regarding a solution that the problem of the Serbs in Croatia should be solved in the same way as the problem of the Albanians in Kosovo. That is the most positive thing that has been publicly stated to date. Of course we would be immediately in favor of having the Serbs in Croatia given as many rights as the Albanians have in Kosovo."
