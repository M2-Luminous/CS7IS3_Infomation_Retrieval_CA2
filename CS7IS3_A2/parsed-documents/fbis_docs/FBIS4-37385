He described the Kuwaiti naval base in Ras al-Qulaya'h as "one of the most advanced in the world." Bathurst told a news conference that the aim of his current visit to Kuwait is to continue developing strong ties between the two countries in the defense field, especially in the naval sphere. Bathurst, who is visiting Kuwait as part of a Gulf tour which will include the Sultanate of Oman and the United Arab Emirates, stressed Britain's strong commitment to continue protecting Arab Gulf security in the future and to continue its military presence as long as the situation requires it. This morning Bathurst met Defense Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud al-Sabah and Major General 'Ali al-Mu'men [name as received], General Chief of Staff.

He stated that the talks also dealt with joint exercises. The British-Kuwaiti exercises, he said, will take place in September. "We have to take every opportunity to carry out joint exercises. I hope that joint exercises with Arab Gulf Cooperation Council states and coalition forces will take place in the future," the British naval commander said. "There was an emphasis on training members of the Kuwaiti naval forces in the United Kingdom. I welcome the presence of members of the Kuwaiti Navy at technical courses, from the highest to the lowest levels." Bathurst clarified that the talks gave him the opportunity to express the United Kingdom's support for Security Council resolutions on sanctions against the Iraqi regime. "The Iraqi Navy still has some capabilities, particularly missiles, which still pose a threat, but the situation will remain under control as long as we are cautious and maintain our presence in the region," Bathurst said. "The United Kingdom will continue to raise the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners at the Security Council." He said the talks also dealt with the conflict in Yemen and stressed Britain's support for Security Council Resolution 924, calling for an immediate cease-fire and the sending of international observers. Bathurst is expected to leave Kuwait for Britain tomorrow morning, ending his Gulf tour. [passage omitted]
