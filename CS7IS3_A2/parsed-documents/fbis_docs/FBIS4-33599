Although in his address to the OAS foreign ministers, who are holding an extraordinary meeting to discuss the Haitian problem, Aristide said the Constitution did not allow him to request a military occupation. During a news conference afterward, he suggested the idea of armed action against the military coupists. "We are talking about a minuscule group of military coupists who are deeply involved in the narcotics business," the overthrown Haitian president said, also referring to an agreement to fight drug trafficking which he had signed with the United States in 1991, when he was still the president of Haiti. Before this, Aristide had stressed in his address to the OAS foreign ministers that he believed that "military action could be carried out to free the nation from the bandits who have taken it hostage and reestablish democracy in Haiti." "Quick and decisive action must therefore be taken to oust the military leaders within the framework of the Governor's Island (New York) agreements," the president said, adding that "the international community knows how to proceed." This agreement, which was signed by coupist General Raoul Cedras in July 1993 at the behest of the United Nations and the OAS, indicated that a military unit should be sent to Haiti to help with the transition, and that power be returned to him. The unit that was sent, however, which consisted of U.S. and Canadian troops, was not able to disembark, as when it arrived off the coast of Haiti in October 1993 it encountered the opposition of the Haitian coupist forces. During his news conference, Aristide stated that the "rapid and decisive action" to which he had referred would have as its goal "the liberation of the (Haitian) Army from its high command, and at the same time giving the nation, as a whole, its freedom," but always without directly asking for international military intervention in his country. Aristide stressed that the current period, when Haiti's borders are completely closed to international trade in accordance with the total embargo that the Security Council implemented in May, must be taken advantage of, because "if there is no action the embargo will create a very detrimental process." According to Aristide, the coupist military leadership annually obtains $1.2 billion from drug trafficking, and during the 7 months that he governed in 1991 before becoming the victim of the military coup, he had signed an agreement to fight drug trafficking with then U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle. The constitutional president of Haiti, who has been living in exile, indicated that the fight against narcotics in his country had been strengthened through this agreement, and that it was decisive in the reasons for the coup. The contents of his news conference differs with the spirit of optimism and hope contained in his address to the OAS foreign ministers participating in the "ad hoc" meeting. Aristide also asked for the immediate deployment of the technical cooperation mission that was established in the Governor's Island agreements. In his address, the deposed president proposed a program, to be implemented after recovering the presidency, that would allow his country "to go from a state of misery to a state of poverty with dignity." Concluding his address with another show of optimism regarding a quick solution to his country's crisis, Aristide even invited the OAS foreign ministers to hold next year's OAS General Assembly in Haiti.
