Certain politicians' voices quiver with irritation and even a sense of grievance at Moscow's "unilateral" actions which have led to a breakthrough in the 22-month-old impasse of the Bosnian crisis. They are less keen to talk about the impotence and fruitlessness of their own, admittedly, "multilateral" efforts to achieve the same overall aims by purely strong-arm methods. Be that as it may, it should be acknowledged tht Russia's increasingly active involvement in resolving the Yugoslav crisis and Moscow's increasingly constructive role in this process are objectively prompting our Western partners to consider, search for, and make unorthodox moves. Paris, London, and Washington are reluctant to award the laurels of arbiter of the Balkan's fate to Russia "without a fight." But Russia is not seeking to determine the development of events in the expanses of former Yugoslavia single-handedly. Russia has for a long time now been persistently urging the Security Council and the major European powers to find a coordinated, mutually acceptable way of solving the Bosnian conflict. From this standpoint, the accord reached in Moscow between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on lifting the siege of the airport in Tuzla and its use for the delivery of humanitarian consignments to the Muslim population under the supervision of Russian observers is an excellent example of actual constructive moves. If the Serbs regard the Russians as historical allies and partners and are ready to cooperate, if you will, more closely and openly with us, thank God for that. If the Muslims and Croats of Bosnia are able to achieve peace on the basis of the agreement signed at the same time in Washington on creating a federation with the support of the Americans or others that is a very fine thing. It is important that the great powers do not succumb to the temptation of exploiting the situation in Bosnia solely as a stage for demonstrating their place in world politics and showing "who's master in the house" rather than actually trying to resolve the Bosnians' future. For example, the U.S. Administration and its top officials -- for the time being at any rate -- are successfully resisting the conservatives' accusations that they are making concessions to Russia. President Clinton considers -- and with justification -- that it is not so important who makes how many initiatives, what counts is not the arithmetic of propaganda but the effectiveness of the efforts of all the sides involved in settling the crisis. Some Western politicians and commentators in the mass media are discussing whether Russia will damage its relations with the West to save its Serbian ally? The question is improperly formulated, and any kind of answer to it will therefore be innacurate too. Here you clearly see an approach characteristic of the Cold War era, when the superpowers divided the world up into spheres of influence and a whole policy, or even whole countries could be categorized as either "ours" or "bad." No, the world is not like that today. And there should be no reversion to the old standards. We should therefore regard as a good policy not necessarily "ours" but the policy that leads objectively to general well-being and victory over common misfortunes. Incidentally, Russia has exhibited such an approach over the incident involving the planes downed in the Sarajevo region. It has not been clarified to date whose planes they were, where they took off from, or who piloted them. But our country firmly supports the UN-approved stance on the unacceptability of any side employing aircraft for combat purposes in the skies above Bosnia. (The aircraft downed by the Americans, no wreckage of which has yet been seen (!), are claimed to be Yugoslav-made G-2 Galeb or G-4 Supergaleb light jet trainers. The former Yugolav People's Army was equipped with them and they can be used as ground-attack aircraft. The fact that the first real successes of the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and its contingent in former Yugoslavia and the parallel moves of Moscow and Washington have also necessarily showed up the worth of people in the Bosnian leadership and what their true aims are is another matter. Thus Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, for example, has stated that the opening of the airport at Tuzla is "an insult to the United Nations," as it will be carried out by Russians. That is to say, what is important to Ganic, is it not, is not a positive result but the actual process of the struggle for it? He does not want to see Russian soldiers wearing Blue Berets in his republic, as they, Ganic said in a BBC interview, will bring "Russia's internal problems" to Bosnia.
