He is the main suspect in the murder of Perfecto Gutierrez, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), which occurred in Managua last night. According to police, the suspect, also known by the nickname "Gasparin," is approximately 16 years old and has a criminal record. Up to now, neither the government nor the main political parties in the country, including the Sandinists, have condemned the murder of Gutierrez, who was 36 years old, married, and had three children. The politician, who was also an alternate PSD deputy -- one of the seven parties in the National Opposition Union -- was hit by two bullets and killed when, while accompanied by a young woman, he was parking his vehicle near a school in the center of Managua. Nicaraguan Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar told reporters "the crime is being investigated," and advanced the theory that "everything seems to indicate" it was a common crime. "It seems the reason for the crime was theft," Deputy Minister Cesar stated. Cesar also belongs to the PSD, where Gutierrez was the secretary general. At noon today, the National Assembly paid posthumous homage to the alternate legislator who was murdered last night, and demanded that authorities solve the case. Adolfo Jarquin Ortel, PSD president and deputy, stated: "We have not dismissed the possibility that Gutierrez was murdered for political reasons." Jarquin and Gutierrez assumed the PSD presidency and secretary general's positions, respectively, after a PSD disciplinary court suspended Guillermo Potoy and Alfredo Cesar, respectively, from those posts. Adolfo Jarquin heads the social democrat sector that favors constitutional reforms in the parliament. Potoy and Cesar head the faction that demands a constituent assembly. These differences in the PSD caused a schism between Nicaraguan social democrats. Leaflets have even appeared in Managua and other Nicaraguan cities recently wherein alleged "recontras" (rearmed former contras) accuse Jarquin's sector of being traitors.
