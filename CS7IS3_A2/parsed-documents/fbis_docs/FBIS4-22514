Nerves of Energy Sector Workers Like Taut Wires"] [Text] "Close to critical" is what the president of the RAO [Russian Joint-Stock Company] YeES Rossii, Anatoliy Dyakov, called the condition of the Russian energy sector last Saturday when speaking at a conference of directors of regional energy systems and representatives of industrial enterprises. Also attending the conference were officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation. The nonpayments crisis, which by 19 March 1993 had exceeded 4.5 trillion rubles [R], the decline in the volumes of repair and construction work because of the lack of financing, which is unprecedented in the history of the branch, the catastrophic reduction of fuel reserves, and the chronic interruptions in their deliveries because of those same nonpayments have led to a situation where, as the RAO president stated, "Unless extreme measures are taken within five months at most, a cataclysmic destruction of Russia's electric energy sector will begin." These and other problems touched upon during the course of the conference are not new--the press and television have devoted enough attention to them recently. There have been serious attempts to figure out the real state of affairs and, unfortunately, there has also been a desire on the part of certain politicians and journalists to present energy sector workers in the eyes of the republic as being almost to blame for the crisis that has gripped the country's economy. And in this context the conference in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy had an extraordinary task. Perhaps it could be considered to be the first serious attempt on the part of professionals of diverse but interconnected branches of our economy to find not the "extreme" but a way out of a difficult situation. "Of course the energy sector is profitable, as is the entire fuel and energy complex of which it is a part," stated Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik. "After all, 62 percent of the revenue side of the state budget is provided by the fuel and energy complex. The crisis of the energy sector is a result of the overall decline of production. But there are a number of circumstances that exacerbate the situation that has developed." Among the main ones the minister mentioned the problem of nonpayments and the absence of a strict approach on the part of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economics toward industrial consumers of electric energy who violate financial discipline, the poorly developed system of rates, the tax policy, which so far does nothing to encourage production, and the imperfect legislative base regulating processes in the branch. "We are working hard on these problems," said Deputy Finance Minister of Russia Aleksandr Samusef in his speech. "In order to solve the nonpayments problem it is extremely necessary even in the near future to work out a mechanism whereby the enterprises will receive money for the products they release. To do this we must expand their rights and capabilities of collecting debts." As we know, during the years of perestroyka and the "post-perestroyka period" there was no shortage of attempts to "cure" the Russian economy through the implementation of various "programs," "concepts," and "models." The electric energy sector got its share as well. The press, and particularly RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, has already written about the fact that the Ministry of Finance distributed to the local regions a document which originated from within it (as a draft edict from the president of Russia), according to which it was planned to redistribute a block of shares of the recently created joint-stock company YeES Rossii. In essence they were planning an illegal revision of a joint-stock company that had already been created, directly in violation the edicts of the president of the Russian Federation Nos. 923 and 1334 on the creation of joint-stock companies, which would lead to fragmentation of the country's unique consolidated energy complex into small regional systems. "Why does everything have to be divided up?" asked General Director of the Dalenergo Joint-Stock Company Yuriy Basharov in his speech. "We do not need fragments today, let us complete the work on the mechanism we have been creating for two years." One can question the acceptability of various viewpoints--of the Ministry of Finance or of the energy sector workers--but one cannot but agree with the reply of the Minister Yuriy Shafranik regarding the proposals of the Ministry of Finance: "When the position of the Ministry of Finance is clear to itself but incomprehensible to thousands of practical specialists--this is dangerous, and it is worth thinking about. The effectiveness of the energy sector comes not from the creation of joint-stock companies but from other mechanisms. "During the long years of existence and continuous operation of the branch, all of us, including energy sector workers themselves, have failed to think about such categories as energy-intensiveness of industrial production or the proportion of electric energy in the price of the final product; problems of economizing on energy basically amounted to sanctimonious appeals: `When you are through working--turn off your knife switch' or `When leaving, turn off the lights.' "Why, for example, do we use 400 kilowatt-hours of electric energy to produce a tonne of ammonia while in the West this takes 30-80? "Why is the proportion of electric energy in the price of a tonne of aluminum only 15 percent here, but the branch is blamed for the sharp increase in prices of metal and, ultimately, for the loss of the positions of Russian producers of aluminum in the world market?" "Energy sector workers are prepared to work and carry out their task under the condition that their primary immediate problems are solved," emphasized Anatoliy Dyakov, president of the RAO YeES Rossii, in his final statement. "This is necessary for Russia. The internal reserves of the energy sector are exhausted. Today we must, not in words but in deeds, document and carry out priority development of the electric energy sector."
