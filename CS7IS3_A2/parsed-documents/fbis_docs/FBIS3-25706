Wade and Savane, secretary general of the Senegalese Democratic Party, PDS, and the African Party for Democracy and Socialism, PADS, respectively, were arrested on 18 February, 48 hours after the riots, and were remanded in custody. Wade's lawyer and an official of PADS have both confirmed the charges. The two opposition leaders' period in custody had been extended twice, on 20 and 22 February. Sixty-five other people were brought before the investigating judge, to prefer charges against them all, judicial sources said.
