FR940628-1-00029 FR940628-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes, that would have required a test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if the throttle lever bypasses the idle stop into the shut-off position, and modification of the throttle quadrant or replacement of the throttle quadrant with a modified unit. That proposal was prompted by reports of unintentional engine shutdown on certain of these airplanes. This action revises the proposed rule by requiring a different test and eventual replacement of the throttle quadrant. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the airplane is taxiing or in flight. DATES: Comments must be received by August 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
