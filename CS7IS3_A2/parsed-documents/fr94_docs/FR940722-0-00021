Section 611.400 is revised to read as follows: ยง611.400 Compensation of bank board members. (a) Farm Credit System banks are authorized to pay fair and reasonable compensation to directors for services performed in an official capacity at a rate not to exceed the level established in section 4.21 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, unless the FCA determines that such a level adversely affects the safety and soundness of the institution. (b) The bank director compensation level established in section 4.21 of the Act shall be adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the following manner: Current year's maximum compensation = Prior year's maximum compensation adjusted by the prior year's annual average percent change in the CPI for all urban consumers. Adjustments will be made to the bank director statutory compensation limit beginning from October 28, 1992 (the date of enactment of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992). Additionally, each year the FCA will distribute a bookletter to all FCS banks that communicates the CPI adjusted bank director statutory compensation limit. (c) A waiver of the compensation limitation prescribed by section 4.21 of the Act may be granted under exceptional circumstances as approved on a case-by-case basis by the FCA. However, the FCA shall not grant a waiver that allows a bank to pay any director in excess of 30 percent more than the statutory maximum compensation as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. A waiver approval shall precede any payments by the bank to its director(s) that exceed the maximum limitation determined in paragraph (b) of this section. A bank seeking a waiver shall provide the FCA Chairman with a written request that: (1) Describes and explains the exceptional circumstance(s) that the bank believes necessitates a waiver of section 4.21 of the Act; (2) States the amount and the terms and conditions (if any) of the proposed compensation level for each director that would exceed the statutory maximum determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; and (3) Justifies the compensation level of each director that would exceed the statutory limitation based on the extraordinary time and service devoted to bank business. The FCA shall respond to written requests within 60 days of receipt of the preceding information and the receipt of any other additional information requested by the FCA. (d) Each bank board shall adopt a written policy regarding compensation of bank directors. The policy shall address, at a minimum, the following areas: (1) The activities or functions for which attendance is necessary and appropriate and may be compensated, except that a Farm Credit System bank shall not compensate any director for rendering services on behalf of any other Farm Credit System institution or a cooperative of which the director is a member, or for performing other assignments of a non-official nature;
