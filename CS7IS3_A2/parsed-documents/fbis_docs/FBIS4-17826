According to him, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has not explained, as yet, the reasons behind his unexpected disappearance from Sevastopol and refusal to put his signature under the mutually acceptable and coordinated -- by the expert commissions of both countries -- document on the division of the sea-going force of the Black Sea Fleet. "Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, offered compromise variants to solve the issues under consideration, however, the Russian side exercised the tactics of the `elder brother,' applying various methods of pressure, including diplomatic ones. It seems that the problem cannot be solved without the participation of a third party, if they raise the question in this manner and insist that the naval forces of Ukraine must be based outside Crimea, although it would be unadvisable to resort to the variant that occurred during the solution of the nuclear arms issue," pointed out the high-ranking representative. In his opinion, no matter what conditions they set in Moscow, the reality is such that both the naval forces of Ukraine and the Russian Navy must be stationed in Sevastopol. What is more, both the naval base in Donuzlav and the Sevastopol base could be granted to Russia on lease. The rest of the bases on the peninsula, including those in Kerch and Feodosiya, are the property of Ukraine, and the Russian ships can stay there by agreement only. The representative of the Ukrainian president's administration also believes that Black Sea Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin is, undoubtedly, the initiator of the anti-Ukrainian actions at the Black Sea Fleet. The statement on the results of the Black Sea Fleet negotiations, which he signed jointly with Yuriy Meshkov and Viktor Semenov, the chairman of the Sevastopol City Council, is an evidence "of the desire to openly manifest the revanchist, great power stand of the Russian Federation." As an UNIAN correspondent learned from the circles close to the Russian military department, after the negotiations in Sevastopol Defense Minister Pavel Grachev issued an instruction to revise the cadre of the Russian Army, removing officers of Ukrainian descent from high posts.
