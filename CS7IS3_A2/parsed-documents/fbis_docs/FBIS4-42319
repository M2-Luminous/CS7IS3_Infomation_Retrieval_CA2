Where are you departing to just now? [Vollmer] What might be more interesting is that from where I have just departed to enter politics again -- it was from a far distance. I am currently working in the science college in Berlin with 30 scientists and artists who help each other think -- a bit of monastery and a bit of magic mountain. [Wischmeyer] And from there you go into the morasses of everyday politics. What is your objective on your return to the Bundestag? [Vollmer] I am not coming back as a greenhorn, but as someone who has enough experience with green policies and sufficient experience in opposition politics. What would be attractive is the Greens getting the chance to create something. [Wischmeyer] Are they capable of doing that? [Vollmer] If things fail it will certainly not be because of the Greens. [Wischmeyer] Abolition of the Bundeswehr, leaving NATO -- will the Mannheim resolutions not stand in the way of this? [Vollmer] We have indicated very clearly that the Mannheim resolutions are very general ideas, but not a specific government program. [Wischmeyer] How do you see the Social Democratic Party's [SPD] behavior after the presidential elections? [Vollmer] I would advise the SPD to get to its feet as quickly as possible and realize that there are only six months left to win the Bundestag elections. I think there has been a strategic miscalculation within the SPD. If you think you can push through your own presidential candidate six months before the decisive battle, then this is not very realistic. They should have tried to reach a consensus. The SPD should let things rest now and start a reform debate quickly. Scharping may be right in saying that you have to pick up voters from the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. But the question is where do you want to take them. If you want to leave them where they are and what they are, this is not picking them up, but this way everything will stay the same. This is what the atmosphere in the country is like at the moment. [Wischmeyer] Should not an important office in the state be given to a politician from eastern Germany? [Vollmer] I find it a bit strange that this demand comes from those who have presented western candidates for the Federal Constitutional Court and the presidency. Next time round, action will count, and not good intentions. [Wischmeyer] Scharping is rebuking the FDP [Free Democratic Party] for not yielding to the Social Democrats. That is not a good sign for dealing with smaller parties. What do you find so attractive in this partner of your dreams? [Vollmer] Only that he is our real opportunity for turning green, ecological, democratic policies into government policy. But I would rather have a different election campaign. One that mobilizes society to effect a change in politics. [Wischmeyer] A coalition between SPD, FDP, and Alliance 90/Greens is out of the question? [Vollmer] No, anything is still possible. [Wischmeyer] The SPD candidate for chancellor likes giving your party the cold shoulder. He seems to expect the Greens to come into his boat themselves. Coalition by all means? Where are the limits? [Vollmer] We will not take part in a government project that does not include a clear start to an ecological economic policy, and we cannot participate in a program that does not adopt principles of a liberal, foreigner-friendly domestic policy. For me, this includes a law on immigration. And then there must be a revaluation of work. [Wischmeyer] Scharping's election program does not even mention basic ecological reconstruction. Is there another SPD beside him that is giving you hope? [Vollmer] I have always expected, and I still do, Oskar Lafontaine wanting more radical changes in economic policy and also in social policies by the year 2000. There have been two election campaign models in the SPD. One of them was the Lafontaine campaign, which got very close to the Greens' issues. Scharping is now trying the opposite method. We will see how far this gets him. I for my part will do an election campaign event together with Oskar Lafontaine that will be entitled "Reform Perspectives for the New Republic." [Wischmeyer] Does this mean the Scharping strategy is not in line with the SPD's potential? [Vollmer] I would advise Scharping to form a sort of political twin with Lafontaine. I think that twosomes of the same sex have proved successful in politics, such as Clinton and Gore, Gorbachev and Yakovlev. You have to cover different positions. But you must also want to achieve the common things and must not use the other partner as an ornament. This is a good advice for everyone, including the Greens, even for Helmut Kohl, except that there is no more twin for him. [Wischmeyer] What do you expect from the SPD? [Vollmer] We must not introduce ecology via fiscal and financial issues alone, which is a point where people are particularly reluctant. There is more at stake. We need a second phase of railroad and public transport reforms. We could really be world leaders in ecological technologies. In social policy we must redistribute private wealth to take the burden off public poverty. And there is another debate: Half of our population will soon be over 50. What could a policy look like that would not have to ask people's children to pay up to five times as much as they did? Thinking about this also has to do with the dignity of old people. [Wischmeyer] But there is not even agreement on very simple issues: the price of gasoline, speed limit.... [Vollmer] If the SPD expects us to rethink our Mannheim resolutions, we can expect them to rethink their position with regard to the speed limit. [Wischmeyer] You think that the SPD cannot be that crazy.... [Vollmer] ...that this would be a stumbling block for them. There must be a bit of reason, they are all over 50 themselves. [Wischmeyer] And gasoline prices? An immediate rise of 50 pfennig, and another 30 pfennig per year, that would make 5 marks by the year 2000. Is this still valid? [Vollmer] I will not indicate any prices beyond the year 2000, because this would be idiotic. But the 50 pfennig and the speed limit belong to the basics of transportation policy. This goes without saying. But this will only be possible if people realize that a change in politics is necessary. If the ecological question, the rise in the ratio of old people, the difficult situation worldwide after the end of the Cold War, are taken seriously. If we discuss these issues, we will get to agree whether we will charge 50 pfennig more for gasoline. What annoys me is that in a year such as this, election campaigns are about 50 pfennig peanuts issues. [Wischmeyer] Unemployment will be an important topic in the election campaign. The Greens have not had much to say on this. [Vollmer] I do not agree. I think you have to start by thoroughly thinking about revolutionizing the term of work. We must have a debate on basic salaries. Pension systems are getting insecure, the age structure creates problems of its own, and even economic growth will not lead to everyone getting a full job of the old type. It is, therefore, high time to say there must be a basic salary for all, which shall give people more freedom to organize their jobs according to their needs; reduction of working hours for all, in order to distribute the existing jobs more evenly. This is a concept where all elements fit into each other. [Wischmeyer] A necessary element is more flexible working hours. Your party considers this the work of the devil. [Vollmer] Elements that do not automatically fit together can be made to fit. I would like to see old taboos originating from Social Democratic and trade union backgrounds being given up. This will have to happen, if we want to reintegrate the unemployed and do not want to drive women out of gainful employment again. [Wischmeyer] On your 50th birthday, Lafontaine wrote that he would prefer to see you holding a political office. What is the political office that Antje Vollmer would like to hold, if there was one for her? [Vollmer] It is not within my power to choose. Politicians' lives are much more a game of roulette today than they used to be, especially for women. [Wischmeyer] [Alliance 90/Greens politician Joschka] Fischer would be content with the role of backbencher, Vollmer would only sit in the third row.... Why are you so modest? [Vollmer] Fischer will certainly not remain a backbencher, and I will not ban my own revolutionary ideas either. But I have become a lot more realistic where my very own perspectives are concerned. For a start, I just want to be part of the game again, everything else remains to be seen.
