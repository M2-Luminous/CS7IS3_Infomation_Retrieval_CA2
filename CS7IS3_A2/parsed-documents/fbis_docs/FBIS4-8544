All successive prime ministers, from Mazowiecki to Suchocka, believed that the head of the Council of Ministers Office [URM] should not be involved in any way or degree in the shaping of any personnel policies in the state. However, thus far none of the government teams has made an effort to make any radical moves. During the election campaign, parties belonging to the present government coalition had very little to say about their proposed personnel policy. However, it was possible to predict their appetites when, immediately after the announcement of the election results, the winners let slip a resounding, triumphant cry: "It's our turn now!" And that was heard not only among the so-called grass roots, but also in the ranks of experienced politicians. For example, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz soon demanded that immediate changes be made in the Polish National Bank [NBP] and the Supreme Chamber of Control. Although the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] leader Aleksander Kwasniewski tried to tone down such utterances and persuade people that the alliance wanted to form a government of experts and did not intend to make profound personnel purges, even though it did mean to put an end to the Solidarity tradition of a "buddies' republic," he did not give the impression that he himself was convinced by his arguments. At that time, the peasants kept quiet, but, as soon as the coalition negotiations gave them the prime minister's chair, they began to implement the principle "it's our turn now" quickly and consistently. The prime minister's first office appointments turned out to be quite significant. He gave Ewa Wachowicz, a student from a farming background and a former Miss Polonia, the post of prime minister's press assistant. During her very first press conference, Miss Wachowicz disclosed with a charming smile that she could say "I love you" in several European languages. Furthermore, the prime minister appointed the Polish People's Republic's [PRL] blue-eyed boy Ireneusz Sekula to the office of head of the Customs and Excise Office, while the post of voivoda of Olsztyn went to Janusz Lorenz, who was introduced there as "currently director of a meat-processing plant and author of a scientific dissertation on the quality of Polish export ham." Needless to say, Lorenz is a member of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Already during his Sejm preliminary hearing, the URM boss Michal Strak (Prime Minister Pawlak's most trusted colleague and former cabinet director at President Wojciech Jaruzelski's Chancellery Office) asserted that pre-1989 activists would prove to be better stewards to the country than their predecessors, and that the coalition parties would refrain from demanding voivodas' posts for their own members in only 10 voivodships. All announcements made by Strak are extremely important. At one time, personnel decisions were made by the Central Committee, while, after 1989, the role of URM head increased so much (he handles the civil service attached to the prime minister, the government, and all of the state administration) that, after the president and the prime minister, he is practically the third-most-important figure in the state. The Office of the Council of Ministers employs 600 people directly and 900 in so-called ancillary enterprises. During the 17 months of the so-called system transformation, Tadeusz Mazowiecki dismissed 293 URM employees and appointed 304. On leaving office, Strak's predecessor, Jan Maria Rokita, had prepared a complete draft program of a transformation of the URM structure and organization. The present incumbent has no intention of implementing Rokita's program or even reforming it according to his own concepts. "On assuming office, our new civil servants do not need to memorize room numbers or acquaint themselves with the telephone system. These are people who know very well how to move around the URM." New appointments to the URM include one secretary of state, six under secretaries, and five directors general. The posts of secretary of state and secretary of the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers [KERM] went to Andrzej Zor, a 54-year-old philologist, formerly (1978-82) departmental director at a ministry, later in other high-ranking URM posts, then Polish Republic ambassador to Malaysia. He has had no party allegiance since the dissolution of the Polish United Workers Party [PZPR]. The posts of under secretary of state were offered to Kazimierz Korona, a graduate of the Main School of Planning and Statistics [SGPiS], an activist of the agricultural circles movement, a member of the supreme administration of the United Peasant Party [ZSL], an URM official since 1984, a ZSL and Polish Peasant Party [PSL] adviser to deputy prime ministers, and deputy director at the State Treasury Agricultural Property Agency since 1992; and Stanislaw Dobrzanski, a graduate of the Maria Curie-Sklodowska University [UMC], former deputy director of the National Library in Warsaw, subsequently director of the Sugar Refineries Industrial Bank's East Poland Division, and a member of the PSL. The posts of URM under secretary of state and secretary of the Council of Ministers' Sociopolitical Committee went to Grzegorz Rydlewski, a graduate and member of the Institute of Political Sciences and a high-ranking official of the Office for Religious Denominations during the 1980's, since 1990 a member of the Public Initiatives Foundation, and a PZPR member until 1990. He is directly responsible to Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz. Another under secretary of state is Jan Zagajewski, a former employee of the Spolem [food retail] cooperative and later an official at the City Office in Pruszkow. He was URM director general during Pawlak's 33 days [first term of office as prime minister in 1992], and has returned to URM now. Two more appointees to the office of secretary of state are prime minister Pawlak's advisers Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz and Franciszek Mleczko. The former has no party affiliation and is a professor of economic sciences; the latter, also a nonparty member (but a PZPR member until the party's dissolution), is a sociologist, formerly a lecturer at the Main School of Rural Economy [SGGW] and the Academy of Social Sciences attached to the PZPR Central Committee [KC]. He was deputy director at the Ministry of Culture and the Arts in the years 1974-78. He collaborated with Michal Strak and was author of election forecasts and analyses for the PSL. The post of URM director general was offered to Andrzej Piwowarczyk, former teacher and later a high-ranking official at the Voivodship Office in Siedlce, who, tragically, died recently in a car accident. Another URM returnee is Jan Guz, a graduate of Leningrad University, an employee of the PZPR Central Committee Planning and Analysis Department and a long-serving adviser to former prime ministers in the 1970's and the 1980's; and Marian Wegorowski, also a long-serving and high-ranking URM official, a PZPR member from 1951 until the party's dissolution, currently of no party affiliation. He now runs the URM personnel movements department. The post of head of the Public Administration Office was won by Marek Ungier, political scientist and activist in the Union of Socialist Polish Youth [ZSMP], and then (from 1974 to 1990) in the PZPR. He was later a partner in a light-clothing business, a member of the Supervisory Board of the ATU Insurance Society, an activist in the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], and an adviser to the SdRP chairman. The following have returned to active politics (not only as high-ranking officials but also as advisers to the prime minister and the URM boss): Wladyslaw Szymanski, former member of the Council of State and ZSL and PSL expert; Marek Ksiazek, deputy chairman of the Cepelia [Central Office of Folk and Artistic Crafts] cooperative; Tadeusz Materka, retired leader (active since 1952) of the peasant movement, former voivoda of Piotrkow and Rzeszow, former deputy chairman of the Samopomoc Chlopska [Peasant Self-Help] cooperative, and former deputy chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control. He held the office of domestic trade vice minister during and after the martial law period. Finally, Jan Bisztyga, former PZPR Central Committee press spokesman and author of the party's new information policy advising "throwing open the doors to party committees" following the 12th PZPR Congress, previously under secretary of state at the Foreign Ministry and ambassador to Greece. Until his retirement (in 1992), he was active as an adviser to Wojciech Jaruzelski. There have also been many changes among high- and middle-ranking officials at all ministries. By the end of January, new appointments were made for six secretaries, 37 under secretaries, and eight directors general at 16 ministries and two central administration offices. Here, as at URM, the new appointees are drawn mainly from the "pool" of former PRL officials returning to their previous--or higher--ministerial offices. At the Construction Ministry, the post of secretary was given to Tomasz Lodeczka, until recently chairman of a housing construction cooperative in Bielsko-Biala (SdRP member), and that of secretary to Wojciech Rzepka, who has been associated with that sector since 1978. AT the Ministry of Ownership Transformations, appointments to the post of under secretary went to Jozef Kowalczyk, a journalist writing for CHLOPSKA DROGA [Peasant Way] and ZIELONY SZTANDAR [Green Banner] and head of the ZSL Supreme Committee Press Office, and Andrzej Zebrowski, a lawyer at the Main School of Commerce and chairman of the Profit company. At the Ministry of National Education [MEN], the posts of under secretary of state were given to the following: Tadeusz Pilch, philosopher and PSL member; Danuta Grabowska, the ministry's schools superintendent in Radom, formerly a PZPR (later SdRP) Sejm deputy; and Kazimierz Dera, director of the MEN Personnel Department from the imposition of martial law until 1990. Appointments to the post of under secretary of state at the Ministry of Culture and Arts [MKiS] were given to Waclaw Janas, who was MKiS vice minister in the years 1983-90, and Zdzislaw Podkanski, longstanding Rural Youth Union [ZMW] and ZSL activist in voivodship structures. Two new under secretaries of state at the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy began their careers at posts with the State Agricultural Farms [PGR]. They are Jerzy Pilarczyk and Ryszard Smolarek. Pilarczyk, who belongs to the SdRP, later represented the PGR Association at the Agency for Agricultural Marketing [ARR] Council; Smolarek, who for many years represented the ZSL in the Sejm, managed his own farm after leaving the PGR. Jacek Buchacz, a new appointee at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, was active on the board of the Dairy Cooperatives Association and in the Juventur [student travel agency] until 1986, and then held the post of secretary at the Polish Embassy in Morocco until 1990. New vice ministers at the Justice Ministry are Grzegorz Ciecierski (PSL), formerly an official at the Finance Ministry, and Bohdan Zdziennicki (no party affiliation now), a member of the Bench at the Supreme Administrative Court [NSA] since 1981. Jerzy Szreter is back at the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, where he has been employed since 1978. As secretary of state, he took part in the Roundtable Talks; still earlier, he worked at the PZPR Central Committee Economic Management Department. Another returnee is Leslaw Nawacki, who was employed at the Labor Ministry until the end of 1991. Following the successive dismissals of Stefan Kawalec, Marek Borowski, and, recently, even Witold Modzelewski, the Finance Ministry suffers from an unstable personnel situation. In practice, it is currently headed by Henryk Chmielak, director of the Planning Commission 1987-89, later under secretary of state at the Central Planning Administration, and, still later, deputy chairman of the [Government] Committee for Radio and Television Affairs. He describes himself as "an expert with no party affiliation." Henryk Jasik is new under secretary of state at the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW]. A chemist by profession, Jasik was employed at the scientific and technical directorate of the intelligence service between 1970 and 1990; later, he held the post of director at Department I--that is, the Intelligence Service--and also worked for the State Protection Office [UOP]. The MSW gains Jerzy Kozminski (transferred from URM) and Stanislaw Szymanski (from a succession of diplomatic posts). CUP gains Jozef Zegar, professor of economics at the Main School of Planning and Statistics, formerly chief editor of WIES WSPOLCZESNA [Contemporary Rural Community], deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers Planning Commission (1986), and a PSL activist. The new head of the Office for Veterans Affairs is Adam Dobronski, historian of the peasant movement. He owes his appointment to the support his nomination received from veteran soldiers of the People's Army [AL] and the Peasant Battalions [BCh]. A proposal offering the post of chairman of the General Savings Bank-National Bank [PKO-BP] Supervisory Board was extended to Marian Krzak, currently chairman of the Union of Polish Banks [ZBP], former finance minister (1980-82) and PKO-BP chairman (appointed 1988), dismissed by Prime Minister Bielecki in 1991. Zbigniew Sobotka, PZPR Central Committee member since 1986 and Politburo member since 1988, is to represent the government coalition interests in the president's office. In addition, a wholesale exchange of heads of the government's local administration structures was carried out until quite recently on a nationwide scale. "We have reached a situation where the personal composition of the voivodas' corps is almost settled. We are a stable and cohesive team," Michal Strak said during a recent meeting with voivodas. Of the total of 49 voivodas, 27 were dismissed from their posts. Strak also added the following remark: "The transfer of power was effected in a pleasant atmosphere, and I was even posing for photographs with the former Lodz voivoda," who is a Christian National Union [ZChN] member. Asked about the new voivodas' party membership profiles, Strak admitted that the PSL took advantage of the changes to a much greater extent than the SSLD. During the aforementioned meeting, voivodas were asked to evaluate a proposed parliamentary bill on the Council of Ministers, which provides for the automatic dismissal of voivodas following each successive change of government unless the new prime minister chooses to extend their "contracts." In Strak's opinion, such contracts will serve to stabilize the administration system and, at the same time, highlight the principle that a voivoda represents the current government in his administrative area. We note that a pattern of civil servants returning to office according to a specific political key applies not only at URM. Notably, the Ministry of Culture and the Arts--or, more specifically, its head, Minister Dejmek--is eager to spend 20 billion zlotys to sponsor publication of a new periodical devoted to cultural affairs and edited by Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz. The periodical is likely to be a weekly, with a print run of 50,000. As yet, its future chief editor has no blueprint for the periodical's program or the composition of his editorial team. But he has the money: the taxpayers' money.
