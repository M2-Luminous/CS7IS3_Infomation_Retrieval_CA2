The wave of anti-European sentiment which the fervent supporters of the European Union [EU] feared until recently has not emerged. However, judging by the survey carried out by LIBERATION and CSA and which we are publishing today, the French do not show any enthusiasm for continuing with European integration as it has been conceived so far. The harsh criticism expressed during the debate on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in September 1992 is coupled today with the more or less clear aspiration for a different Europe. Has European integration gone too far, or not far enough? This question causes some discomfort. Half of those surveyed refused to let themselves be pigeonholed in one of the two traditional categories of "European" or "anti-European": 39 percent seemed to feel that European integration has gone far enough, while 12 percent had no feelings on the matter. Another statistic shows that an absolute majority of those surveyed (56 percent) had questions about the need to move forward with European integration. This is a major reservation, in view of the fact that it looks like European integration will be deepening. Three Sectors Out of Nine Deemed Positive The number of those who are biased in favor of Europe in principle has dropped somewhat. At this point, only one-third of the French want to go "further" into the European adventure. This Europeanism remains both elitist and leftist. (Footnote 1) ("Pro-Europeans" are defined as those surveyed who said they wanted to vote on the basis of European issues and who feel that European integration has not gone far enough. The "anti-Europeans" are defined as those who will vote on the basis of European issues, but who think that European integration has gone too far.) Those who most feel that Europe has not gone far enough are senior executives and professionals (40 percent), industrial and commercial employers (39 percent), as well as leftist sympathizers (40 percent). On the other hand, farmers (38 percent) and National Front sympathizers (38 percent) are proportionally the most numerous who feel that European integration has gone too far. The results of a more detailed assessment of the EU, based on its performance in various sectors, were rather lukewarm. It was deemed positive in just three sectors out of nine: research, the environment, and currency. In two other areas (defense and education), the negative opinions almost balanced out the positive opinions. In the four remaining sectors, which are very important in terms of public opinion (consumption, social protection, employment, and agriculture), the majority sentiment is that the EU "is not heading in the right direction." Significantly, it is in the more abstract areas that Europe gets high marks. The relative harshness expressed by those surveyed regarding education is a rather new development. The number of university graduates who felt that the EU's educational policy was going in the right direction equalled that of those who thought it was heading in the wrong direction (36 percent). European employment policy was criticized in particular by young people aged 25 to 34 years (72 percent), as well as by workers (73 percent). It should also be noted that 68 percent of farmers think that European agriculture has gone astray. The French would welcome a Europe that moved away from the guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty in order to give priority to reviving the economy instead of fighting inflation. Two-thirds of those surveyed (67 percent) say that it would now be desirable "to renegotiate the Maastricht Treaty" (19 percent do not think it desirable to renegotiate, while 14 percent have no opinion). This opinion, defended at the time of the referendum by certain supporters of a "no" vote, is supported by a broad majority in all the social categories and among all political leanings. Those who voted "yes" on Maastricht Treaty say that they support (59 percent) a renegotiation of the treaty. It is true that the defenders of Maastricht are currently referring to the fact that it is being "overtaken." Faced with worrying massive unemployment, the French would like Europe to stop giving the priority to fighting inflation. The theme of a revival of European consumption is a popular one, especially among employers (63 percent), mid-level professions (66 percent), and workers (62 percent). Senior executives are more hesitant about a recovery that is likely to see a reemergence of inflationary tendencies.. The poll as clearly reflects a desire to see the EU better protect employment by backing the idea of Community protectionism. Almost three-fourths of those surveyed (72 percent) would like to see the EU protect its borders "from products coming from countries that have a low level of social protection." This proposal is applauded by all the French, regardless of their socioeconomic status or their political views. The idea of enlarging the EU beyond the four countries which are just about to be included (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Austria) is much more controversial. The majority of leftist voters (64 percent) or Greens is seduced by the idea, whereas only a minority of rightist voters is (45 percent). The conservative electorate is therefore not in favor of a large Europe that would welcome the less-developed countries of East Europe. All in all, the common denominator in the various replies is a certain rejection of the status quo. The French don't seem particularly attached to maintaining a Europe as defined by the Maastricht Treaty, which is resolutely free-trade oriented and ardently monetarist. Semi-European Election The French attitude toward Europe, however, is not their only criteria for 12 June -- far from it. As usual, the "European" elections will only partly relect their title. Less than half of those surveyed said that their vote would be based on "European policy issues." Indeed, there will be more people voting with a view to domestic politics than the 41 percent who admitted that this is what they intend to do. Torn between Bernard Tapie [leftist "Radical Energy" list] and Bernard-Henri Levy ["Sarajevo" list], the current campaign is having major difficulties dealing with current European issues. The positions of various electoral lists on strictly European issues are largely unknown. Very few voters distinguish between the positions on national policy and on European policy, as can be confirmed by the various lists. Moreover, on 12 June, a not insignificant minority will seek to express its discontent rather than express its approval of a political orientation: One-fourth of those surveyed stated that they would primarily like to show their "opposition to the other lists." The various lists are involved in the European debate to much different degrees. In view of the positions expressed by his supporters, Michel Rocard's [Socalist "European Solidarity" list] list easily wins the prize for the most pro-European list. The proportion of voters who say they are "close" to Rocard is 48 percent among the "pro-Europeans," whereas they would give Dominique Baudis [majority's "Union" list] only 41 percent of the vote. True, Rocard attracts the intellectual and well-off Left, the very Left that is the most sensitive to the issue of Europe: 43 percent are "close" to him among university graduates and 47 percent among senior executives and professionals. Jean-Pierre Chevenement ["Alternative Policy" list] and Bernard Tapie are both linked to the crisis on the Left, which they each express in their own way. This positioning is perhaps not alien to the modest score given to the Socialist list by opinion polls. The leading anti-European list is headed by Philippe de Villiers ["The Other Europe" list]. This deputy from the Vendee brilliantly incarnates the Right's "no" as expressed by nonsalaried workers and the elderly. The proportion of those who say they are "close" to him is 36 percent among the "anti-Europeans." His potential voters are easily those who are most hostile to the EU. Dominique Baudis' list is buoyed along by an image of unanimity. The sociological profile of his supporters is quite clearly centered on "people of the Right" (with the same index of proximity to the UDF [French Democratic Union] and the RPR [Rally for the Republic], but his position on Europe is notably ambiguous. The proportion who feel they are close to Baudis is virtually the same among the former supporters of a "no" vote (44 percent) and of a "yes" vote (46 percent) on Maastricht. On most European issues, the ratings given by Baudis' voters are very close to those of the electorate as a whole. Hence, 19 percent of the voters for the UDF-RPR list think that European integration has gone "too far," 30 percent "not far enough," and 38 percent "neither one nor the other." Baudis is comfortably planted at the center of French hesitation about Europe. The lists of Bernard Tapie and Jean-Pierre Chevenement look like two different reflections of the same crisis of representation on the Left. Their audiences are not deeply divided on the issue of Europe. Tapie's voters are no more intimately federalist than those of Chevenement are hostile to the EU: 33 percent of "anti-Europeans" say they are "close" to Tapie, whereas 32 percent of "pro-Europeans" say they are "close" to Chevenement. The voters for these two lists can be characterized by their attraction to the idea of Europe, which is coupled with a harsh criticism of Community policies. Together with the ecologists, they are distinguished by the highest proportion of voters who vote, above all, against the other lists. Lastly, the lists of the PCF [French Communist Party] and FN [National Front] are essentially focused on domestic politics. Their voters are those who, by a vast majority, will make their decisions on the basis of national interests. Their electoral potential is highly limited: 10 percent of the electorate in both cases. The lists of Francis Wurtz and Jean-Marie Le Pen have an isolated but loyal electorate. Their criticism of Europe is merely the logical extension of their respective radicalism.
