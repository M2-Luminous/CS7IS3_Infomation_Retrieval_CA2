FR940817-1-00013 FR940817-1-00004 III. General Request for Comments Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on the rule and form changes that are the subject of this Release, to suggest additional changes, or to submit comments on other matters that might have an effect on the proposals contained in this Release, are requested to do so. Comment is specifically requested regarding the prevalence and significant terms of brokerage/service arrangements, the expenses paid through the arrangements, and the effect of the arrangements on fund expenses and commissions. IV. Cost/Benefit Analysis The rule and form changes proposed today are intended to improve the reporting of investment company expenses and improve the ability of investors to compare investment company expenses and performance. While the rule and form changes may increase the costs to funds of preparing financial statements and fund registration materials, the Commission believes that any such cost increases would, at most, be minimal. A fund that has brokerage/service arrangements would be required to add two captions and a footnote to its statement of operations and replace the net expense figures currently disclosed in its fee table and financial highlights table with total expense figures. These figures will normally be readily determinable by the fund. Funds should also be able to readily estimate expenses paid with brokerage commissions for purposes of yield calculations. In short, the Commission believes that the costs of the amendments proposed today would be substantially outweighed by the benefits to investors of receiving more accurate and useful financial information about funds. V. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding the proposed amendments. The analysis notes that the rule and form proposals contained in this Release are intended to provide for the comparability of fund expenses reflected in fund disclosure documents and advertisements. Other aggregate cost-benefit information reflected in the ``Cost/Benefit Analysis'' section of this release also is reflected in the analysis. A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained by contacting Eric C. Freed, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 10&hyph;6, Washington, DC 20549. VI.
