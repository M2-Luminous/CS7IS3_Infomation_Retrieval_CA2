Elected last November, Mr. Leghari, 54, is an old militant from Benazir Bhutto's Pakistani People's Party [PPP]. He was PPP secretary from 1978 to 1983 during the dark days of persecution by the Zia dictatorship. This experience enabled this affable man to send President Mitterrand greetings from the Pakistani prime minister, whose charm was much appreciated by Mr. Mitterrand during his 1990 trip to Islamabad. According to Mr. Leghari, the two men talked about the "nuclear issue." By all appearances, the Pakistani leader sought to verify Paris' lack of flexibility in its position on supplying a nuclear power plant that had been promised in the past, before France shied away after signing the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]. The issue of "nonproliferation" has been in play for a long time, since Islamabad, which is strongly perceived as the capital of a country which is capable of making "the bomb," or which has even been credited with already possessing a dozen of them, is being subjected to pressure to sign the NPT, especially by the Americans. Mr. Leghari repeated that Pakistan has long been prepared to sign if India, the brother and enemy against whom three wars have been fought in the past, does the same. "We are prepared to undergo inspections provided that both sides are subject to them," he repeated. The problem is that New Delhi, which exploded an atomic device in 1974 and which is apparently ready to install missiles with nuclear capability pointed at Pakistan, has rejected all suggestions which could muzzle its security needs, on the grounds that such needs are also reflected vis-a-vis China, against which it fought a war in 1962.
