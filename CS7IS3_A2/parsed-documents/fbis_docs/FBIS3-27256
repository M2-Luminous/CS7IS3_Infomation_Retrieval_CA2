The move is considered helpful in introducing labourers into the city, the largest industrial base in the country, and beneficial to having this work done in an organized and ordered way and to the easing to a certain extent of the "labour wave" imposed upon the municipality. The city has recently set up an office in charge of administration over such labourers employed by entities and units in the city. The markets designed for such labourers will be open to all places in the country and allow various places to export labourers to the city where the introduction of such workers will be subject to market competition. Those units needing such labourers, except in particular circumstances, will have to have approval from labour departments at the city's district or county level prior to recruiting such workers in designated markets of this kind, and a contract will be required to be signed between the employer and employee, becoming effective only after it is testified to and sealed by the market authorities.
