FR941019-2-00024 FR941019-2-00020 A discussion of responses to significant comments on issues in the draft general guidelines appears below. Significant changes as a result of comments received on the sector-specific documents are discussed below by sector document. 1. Gases Covered The legislation does not define ``greenhouse gases.'' The draft guidelines covered emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, as well as many of the halogenated substances. The final guidelines add two halogenated substances, halon 1211 and halon 2402, to the list of gases and substances covered. In addition, DOE announces the delayed addition of three greenhouse gases, nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide, to the reporting program starting with the third reporting cycle of the program which is expected in 1997. a. Additional Gases to be Covered_Conventional Pollutants Comments on the gases and substances covered by the draft guidelines supported expansion of the program to a more comprehensive list of greenhouse gases, especially some conventional, or ``criteria,'' pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act for which emissions data is collected by EPA and State agencies under various air quality programs. These gases are nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. Although these gases are not direct greenhouse gases, they contribute to the formation of carbon dioxide and/or tropospheric ozone. The international scientific community has been unable to quantify the differential radiative activity of these gases, and thus has not provided an index of the climate change effects of these gases relative to carbon dioxide. Because emissions data reported under the program will be reported in units of weight, and not reduced by any common index of comparative radiative effects, it is unnecessary to exclude gases from the program solely on the basis that a quantification of comparative effects is not available. DOE agrees that a more comprehensive 1605(b) reporting program should cover these indirect gases, and has expanded the gases covered by the voluntary reporting program to include nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. However, for the reasons discussed below, DOE is delaying the programmatic acceptance of voluntarily reported data on emissions and emissions reductions of these gases for a period of two years. Thus, reports of data related to these gases will first be accepted by EIA during the third reporting cycle of the program, i.e. with reports filed in 1997. These reports may include the results of activities beginning January 1, 1991, as well as historic emissions data on these gases for the period 1987 to 1990.
