At the EU summit on Corfu on Saturday [25 June], in the controversy over nominating a new EU Commission president, British Prime Minister John Major defied all other EU partners and vetoed the designation of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has been particularly committed to the nomination of Dehaene, is now forced to settle the dispute on the succession to current President Jacques Delors at a special summit in Brussels on 15 July. "As far as the chances of success are concerned, I cannot say anything right now," Kohl said at the conclusion of the Corfu summit. He would have much rather announced a decision "than having this problem now dumped in front of our front door." [passage omitted]
