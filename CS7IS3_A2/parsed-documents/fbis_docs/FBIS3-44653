Reviewing our work over the past year, we can see in retrospect that with the encouragement of the Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the spirit of the 14th party congress, and the "Resolution" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the whole party and the people of all nationalities of the country have attained heartening accomplishments in deepening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating the pace of development. At present, our country is enjoying a sound situation featuring economic growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress. A retrospective of our work over the past year will give us encouragement to work harder and strive for greater achievements in the coming year. To this end, this newspaper herwith opens a special column "'93 Yearender," in the hope that it can become a window showing the rapid changes that have taken place on the Divine Land in the past year. At the end of the year, latest figures released by the State Statistics Bureau showed that since the beginning of this year, the state's fixed-asset investment in the communications and transportation industry exceeded 80 billion yuan for the first time, making up 17 percentage points of the total investment by state- owned units. Construction of China's basic communications facilities has begun to enter a historical phase of large-scale development. China's extensive communications framework is taking shape gradually -- a comprehensive transportation network system based on the well-coordinated operation of railroads, high-grade highways, major coastal ports, inland river routes, and key airports. Railroad: Winning the Very First Victory in a Decisive Three-Year Battle In December, the construction of the 1,000-li Beijing-Kowloon Railroad was in full swing: Tracks were being laid and a bridge erected to the north of the Huang He; infrastructure [xian xia 4848 0007] projects were going full steam ahead; to the south of the Chang Jiang, construction was being unfolded in a comprehensive way. The first year of the construction of the Beijing-Kowloon Railroad, which is a "key project of all key projects" launched by the Ministry of Railways during the Eighth Five-Year Plan, has entailed more than 2 billion yuan of investment and has won its very first victory. This is the first year of a decisive three-year battle launched by the Ministry of Railways. The curtain of the railroad construction was drawn open at a time when the rail car utilization rate of major bottleneck sections had gone down to 40 percent and the potential-tapping renovation had yielded no result. A total of 11 key projects started construction at the same time in almost all provinces, autonomous regions,and municipalities. At the end of the year, the construction of a number of key projects scheduled to for completion at the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, had reached a high tide, including the Beijing-Kowloon Railroad, the Lanzhou- Xinjiang Multitrack Railroad, the Baoji-Zhongwei Railroad, the Houma-Yueshan Railroad, the Zhejiang-Ganzhou Multitrack Railroad, the electrification renovation of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railroad, as well as the renovation projects concerning the Hengyang North, Zhuzhou North, and Guangzhou North Railroad Stations. After these projects are completed and put into operation, China's transportation capacity will increase by 200 million tonnes. Next year is a crucial one for the "decisive three-year battle" of railroad construction. By the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, China's operational railroad mileage will total 60,000 km, the rates of multitrack and electrification will reach 30 and 23 percent respectively, the handling capacity of railroads will increase considerably, and the present tight transportation situation will be alleviated. Water, Land, and Air: Each Enjoying Major Breakthroughs A new chapter also has been opened with the construction of highways -- another of China's major means of land transportation. A modern highway network has taken shape which focuses on highways for the exclusive use of vehicles and aims to achieve the goal of "two verticals and two laterals" across the country. Construction of three high-grade highways between Beijing and Shanghai, Beijing and Shenyang, and Chongqing and Beihai, has been accelerated, while technical renovation is being carried out of the "two verticals and two laterals" -- the national trunk lines between Tongjiang and Sanya, Beijing and Zhuhai, Shanghai and Chengdu, and Lianyungang and Horgos -- with the aim of upgrading these trunk lines at an early date. Within two years, China will have an additional 90,000 km of highways, and an additional 30,000 km of second-grade highways. As a result, China's highway situation will be improved considerably, transportation capacity will be enhanced immensely, and the average driving speed on national trunk lines can exceed 50 km per hour, thus giving full play to the advantages of highway transportation: speed, convenience, and flexibility. This year, departments in charge of water transportation have given priority to solving problems caused by lack of unloading capacity at ports, and have designed and built a large number of modern ports with deep-water berths. By 1995, the coal loading capacity of coastal ports will reach about 120 million tonnes. After the completion of coal ports in Dalian, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as well as power station ports in Waigoqiao, Shenzhen, and Zhanjiang, the coal unloading capacity of these places also will reach 130 million tonnes, thus obtaining a basic balance between loading and unloading capacities. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan, a total of more than 100 deep-water berths are being built up in coastal ports, with newly added handling capacity of 140 million tonnes. China's civil aviation industry, which is enjoying a 30 percent increase in transportation volume each year, has placed its focus on the construction of airport support facilities this year. Airports are being built in (or moved to) Wuhan, Guiyang, Shijiazhuang, Guilin, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Sanya; while a number of key airports have been expanded and renovated, including those in Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Lhasa, Harbin, Urmuqi, and Lanzhou. By the end of this century, the total number of China's civil airports will reach 146; the total volume of circular flow of civil aviation transportation will reach 12.2 billion tonne/km; and the passenger transport volume will reach 100 billion, thus basically meeting the needs of economic development and exchanges with foreign countries. Next Year: Foreign Investment Will Be Utilized in More Fields Li Duanshen, director of the Transportation Department of the State Planning Commission, said during an interview the other day: "This year, China has made unprecedented investment in the construction of basic transportation facilities, and has attained in many fields a rapid progress not seen for many years. China's tight communications and transportation situation is expected to be eased by the end of this century. During the last seven years of the 1990's, the state will start nearly 400 large- and medium-scale communications and transportation projects, entailing investment of more than 700 billion yuan. However, we are still faced with the problem of insufficient funds." In order to attract more funds, the state will adopt in the coming several years a series of effective measures to allow foreign investors to participate in the construction of communications projects. With a view to enhancing the efficiency of investment, while encouraging Sino-foreign joint ventures or solely foreign- owned companies to build up highways and ports, and encouraging joint ventures to build up railroads and civil airports (excluding the aviation management system), the state will allow investors to engage in comprehensive compensation trade within a preset scope in districts along railroad lines and high-grade highways, and in port areas. The year 1993 is one in which China's communications construction is striving to extricate itself from a low ebb and to make major breakthroughs. Under the guidance of the state's macroeconomic policies to check the "bottleneck" restrictions and with the backing of huge funds designated by the state, the country now is gradually improving the conditions of national trunk lines, including thoroughfares for coal transportation centering on energy bases in the "three Xi's [Shanxi, Shaaxi, and western Mongolia]"; passenger transport thoroughfares centering around large and medium-sized cities; and trunk transportation lines among all major economic regions and with foreign counties. In addition, the country also is striving to coordinate the operation of water, land, and air transportation. At present, the framework of China's comprehensive communications network -- which consists of trunk lines, feeder lines, ports, and station hubs -- has taken initial shape.
