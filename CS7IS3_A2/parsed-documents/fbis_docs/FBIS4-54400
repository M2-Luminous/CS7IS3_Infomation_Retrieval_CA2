He signed on Monday [25 April] a bilateral trade and economic cooperation accord and an agreement on cooperation in culture, science and education. Papazyan also held talks on Monday with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev and National Assembly Deputy Chairman Yordan Shkolagerski. Earlier today he was received by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev to whom he delivered a message from Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. We agreed to keep working on building the legal framework of bilateral relations and drafting accords on the avoidance of double taxation and reciprocal investment protection; experts should soon negotiate the signing of a Bulgarian-Armenian Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov told the press today. It is not so important where the treaty will be signed, here or in Yerevan, the important thing is that there is a willingness to do that as soon as possible, the chief Armenian diplomat said. Daskalov and Papazyan agreed on more frequent contacts between the two foreign ministries, other ministries and non-governmental organizations to boost business, trade and cultural relations between Bulgaria and Armenia. The two ministers shared information about their countries' positions on the conflicts in the Balkans and the Transcaucasian region. Papazyan said he was pleased with his first visit here. He described his talks with President Zhelev this morning as friendly and useful. In answer to a question he said he did not think the Armenian community in Bulgaria faced any problems and voiced a hope it would have a role in the promotion of Bulgarian-Armenian relations. Papazyan held special meetings in Sofia and Plovdiv (southern Bulgaria) with representatives of the Armenian community. "There are no problems as to national identity", said the Armenian foreign minister. About 20,000 Armenians live in Bulgaria. We've been sparing no effort to reach a political settlement, but peace will come when both sides agree, Papazyan said in response to a question on Nagorno-Karabakh. He voiced an expectation that Armenian-Turkish relations would improve and Armenia and Turkey would soon establish diplomatic relations and promote trade and economic cooperation. I believe this would benefit both Turkey and Armenia, he said answering a question.
