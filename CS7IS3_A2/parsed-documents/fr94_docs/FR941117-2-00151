ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed project in central Missouri. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Donald Neumann, Program Review Engineer, Federal Highway Administration, P.O. Box 1787, Jefferson City, MO 65102, Telephone Number 314&hyph;636&hyph;7104; or Mr. Bob Sfreddo, Design Engineer, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, P.O. Box 270, Jefferson City, Missouri 65102, Telephone Number 314&hyph;751&hyph;2876. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to upgrade U.S. Route 50 to a dual-lane facility starting 0.7 mile west of Routes D and T in Cole county and continuing to a point west of the cityof Sedalia in Pettis county. The EIS will also include U.S. Route 65 through the city of Sedalia. A location study will run concurrently with the preparation of the EIS and will provide definitive alternatives for evaluation by the EIS. The proposed action will accomplish several goals (1) improve safety and capacity for through traffic on U.S. Route 50, (2) to study the need for a dual-lane bypass around the cities of Sedalia, Syracuse, Tipton, California, and St. Martins and (3) promote economic development for the counties involved in the cities mentioned above. 1. The proposed project begins at 0.7 mile west of Routes D and T in Cole county and continues to a point west of the city of Sedalia in Pettis county. The project is approximately 70.0 miles in length. The proposed facility will provide a four-lane, limited-access roadway with at-grade intersections or interchanges at major arterial crossroads. 2. Alternatives under consideration include ``build'' alternatives north and/or south of the existing route that could be either parallel or on relocation. Other alternatives include transportation management options as well as a ``no build'' alternative. 3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping process was initiated with federal, state, and local agencies at a scoping meeting on October 11, 1994. Further public meetings and hearings will be held. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action is addressed and all significant issues are identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments and questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or to the MHTD at the addresses provided above. Issued on: November 3, 1994. Donald L. Neumann, Program Engineer, Jefferson City, Missouri. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28442 Filed 11&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M
