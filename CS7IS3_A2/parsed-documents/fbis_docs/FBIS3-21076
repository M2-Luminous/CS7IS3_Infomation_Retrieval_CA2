Schreiber] [Text] Innovative Polymers Enhance Competitiveness of Many Industrial Branches Japan and the U.S.A. are increasing their strategic investments. "Long diffusion times in material development prevents speedy practical application." Technologies of 21st Century High-Tech polymers and fiber- reinforced plastics can significantly contribute to continued competitiveness of the German industry. For this reason the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) in Bonn encourages further development in this field and has included high-performance polymers as a key technology in its R.& D. strategy for the 21st century. The German plastics manufacturers are, however, more skeptical about it. Innovative materials such as high-performance polymers or fiber-reinforced ones offer a favorable market outlook not for the manufacturer only. In addition they also influence the competitiveness of important groups of users, in some cases considerably. The Federal Ministry of Research and Technology has an interest in technologies needed for making and appropriately processing these materials, and even special interest because of their major significance for future developments. In the "Technology at the Beginning of the 21st Century" study made by the BMFT, progress-oriented use of specialty polymers is regarded as one of the key technologies on which the health of the national economy will depend. Accordingly, the people in Bonn have supported materials research since 1985 with almost 2 billion DM so far, of this amount 21.2% for new polymers and 19% for composites. "There is no doubt that this has substantially contributed to Germany's ability to maintain parity in materials research with leaders in this field, namely the U.S.A. and Japan. The German enterprises which had very actively participated in this program are today, unlike in 1985, among the enterprises engaged in most intense worldwide patent activity covering many areas. The problem is, however, that a German competence in materials and treatment technologies can today be found only in "islands of experts", while a consolidation of the acquired know-how into a comprehensive network is still lacking. Evidently various German enterprises assess the market opportunities and possibilities for high-performance polymers and composite materials differently than do the people in Bonn. Following the motto "save whatever there is to save" based on the then prevailing economic trends, many enterprises have either withdrawn from this business altogether or are about to cut back their activities in this field. While at Bayer the emphasis is entirely on further development of engineering thermoplastics which can be sold in large quantities, Leverkusen has discontinued making a number of high-performance materials such as liquid-crystal polymers (LCP) and composites. Contrary to original expectations, they claim that the volume of these specialty materials sold has by far not reached the anticipated level. The managers at Hoechst do, however, regard at least liquid-crystal polymers as a still very interesting group of materials with a future. Otherwise the Frankfurt people would certainly not expand their production capacity in the U,S.A., even though Peter Gleisberg in the Department of Engineering Plastics knows that for the time being such a high-performance material will remain a "niche product" only. Meanwhile the BASF (Baden Aniline and Soda Works) in Ludwigshafen seeks its opportunities with high-temperature thermoplastics. Because according to Doctor Eckard Koch, plastics expert in the Application Engineering Department for Thermoplastics at the BASF, the increasing demand for these materials by the electrical and electronic industry as well as by the automotive industry will ensure their above average growth rate in the next few years. As to fiber-reinforced plastics, on the other hand, Leverkusen just as Bayer discontinued making them. While consumption of engineering thermoplastics in West Europe, Japan, and the U.S.A. increased on the average by about 290,000 tons annually (by 110,000 tons in West Europe alone) during the 1989-92 period, as reported by Bayer reports, the demand for specialty polymers increased only from 28,000 tons to 37,000 tons over the 1982-91 period. This was too little to justify the high cost of their development and production. "Because of high costs", maintains Dr. Manfred Schneider, "wherever European enterprises lose or do not to recapture their leading position in technology they are doomed to permanent failure. We must nevertheless remain innovative over the entire range of our activities." "With specialty products alone the German industry, the European industry as well, will not be able to hold its position on the market" adds the chairman of the Bayer Corporation's board of directors. This means, among others, let us not spread ourselves too thin. In engineering thermoplastics Bayer sees a greater potential than in specialty polymers. As to composite materials, the predictions made in the beginning of the nineteen eighties proved often to be also far too optimistic. The euphoria based on those predictions induced quite a flood of investment. This flood was soon followed by a more sober approach. Many mistakes had been made in production capacity and market volume planning. After fiber-reinforced plastics were particularly hard hit by both the recession and the end of the cold war (the latter resulting in drastic cutbacks in the military budget and thus in applications for these materials), many companies pulled the emergency brake: they sold their business enterprises in this field. The reaction of the German-American Multi Dupont Ltd to these events was exactly the opposite. About one year ago this company first opened its European development center for composite materials in Bad Homburg. With an investment of over 30 million DM, this company quite obviously bucked the prevailing market trend. For top management of the Multi Dupont Ltd agrees with the BMFT that, despite all the problems involved, high-performance materials and fiber-reinforced plastics offer important industries some strategic marketing advantages. This can be seen in Japan and in the U.S.A. as well. According to the MITI, the R.& D. efforts of Japanese enterprises in these areas will intensify and more than a constant rate in the coming years. They do, moreover, emphasize particularly effective efficiency-raising measures and collaboration strategies internationally as well as nationally. However, only institutes and enterprises already in strong position technologically will be accepted as partners. In terms of R.& D. efforts made to develop new materials, the U.S.A. by far surpasses Germany for years already. By developing new materials, the American industry expects to strengthen its competitiveness on the international market. In both countries emphasis is on the system concept and on intensification of nationwide materials research in a surrounding of dynamic domestic user industries. Compared with that, in Germany the innovation process is still too much focused on basic research and manufacture concludes the "Evaluation of the Materials Research Program" study made by the BMFT. According to that study, materials research in this country continues nonetheless on a high internationally recognized level. It is however necessary not only to keep it at this level but also to intensify it in selected strategically important areas of application for high-performance materials. New high-voltage ignition cables can be installed in motor vehicles as well as in oil or gas burners operating at temperatures from -40�C to 200�C. Owing to layer of insulation made from fluorocarbon plastics "teflon" and "tefzel", these cables are 60% thinner the conventional ones. Water-resistant sliding bearings made of "iglidur" have been developed for duty in very humid air. This composite material, usable at temperatures up to 230�C, consists of a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic and solid-lubricant inclusions.
