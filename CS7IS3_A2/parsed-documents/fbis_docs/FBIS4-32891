He said decisions such as this one are normal within the party. According to Alfaro Ucero, time will decide which path the party should take. As expected, Alfaro supporters and Perez supporters gauged their strength within the CEN, and, judging from the outcome, it is obvious that the Alfaro supporters had a majority of votes. According to Claudio Fermin, the rank and file do not support this decision.
