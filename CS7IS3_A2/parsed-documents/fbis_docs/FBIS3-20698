Paparella: "INA Is Building in Vladivostok"] [Text] Zagreb--At a ceremony held on Monday [31 January] in the offices of the INA enterprise, Franjo Greguric, general director of the company, signed a $130-million agreement with Nikolaj M. Shubenichev, general director of the Far Eastern Petroleum Company of Vladivostok, on the construction of berths for tankers at Kamchatka and facilities at the oil pipeline terminal for loading oil into the tankers. The "turnkey" agreement calls for the construction of an ecologically acceptable terminal with a total annual loading capacity of 4.2 million metric tons of oil derivatives with an accompanying reservoir area of 300,000 cubic meters over a period of 30 months. INA is responsible for the organization and the oversight of the work, and Montmontaza of Zagreb, tasked with carrying out projects in which over 500 workers will participate, is the most important of numerous Croatian subcontractors. The signing of the contract was a great success because of strong international competition. INA won the contract on the basis of the good quality of the projects it has carried out in Russia to date.
