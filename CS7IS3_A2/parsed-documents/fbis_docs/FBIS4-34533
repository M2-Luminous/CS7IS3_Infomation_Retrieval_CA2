It has been a long, hard campaign. At times, it even went as far as personal attacks, but we have no hard feelings. It is time for generosity and to stand tall. It is time for our spirits to be calm so we can conduct our administration without discrimination. I also thank Mr. Ernesto Samper. Mr. Samper has been a champion of democracy and a generous friend. In offering me the opportunity to be his running mate on the presidential ticket, he has allowed me to continue to serve Colombia. I admire his devotion to social justice. It is a genuine devotion; not improvised. I see in Samper the great leader of social justice in Colombia. [cheers] It was on this specific issue -- serving the poor people of Colombia, men and women of flesh and blood -- that we found our greatest affinity in this victorious ticket. I also thank Jaquin for her dedication and assistance I would like to reaffirm what I said during the campaign: I am a man of the countryside. I am not ashamed to be a man of the provinces, and I will continue to be one. I want to make the vice presidency the home of the Colombian countryside. What Colombia needs is a vice presidency that will reinforce national unity by recognizing the diversity of its regions and by realizing the potential, the drive, and the creativity of the Colombian provinces. [cheers] Our victory, the victory of Ernesto Samper, is also a victory of the Liberal spirit and of tolerance over fanaticism. It is a victory for self-evaluation and pluralism. That is what has risen victorious today, my friends. We do not want fanaticism, sectarianism, or discrimination in the modern Colombia we have envisioned. There will be no room for discrimination on the grounds of sex, color, race, creed, or religious belief in the Samper administration. [cheers]. As vice president, I also hope to contribute to the development of our constitution and the statutory law governing the administration of justice. In so doing, we will advance the fight against crime, drug trafficking, and drugs in favor of true democratic justice for all Colombians. [cheers] The new legal instrument for requesting the protection of our constitutional rights is the most revolutionary means to truly protect our fundamental rights. I believe in reinforcing the resources available in the municipalities and departments. This will allow them to fulfill their responsibilities, particularly toward social justice. As its name suggests, this is a social justice directed at the men and women of the masses; the men and women of flesh and blood; the men and women of Colombia who have no privileges. We want justice in education and health. We believe the first priority for this new government is social investment, the search for the vindication of the poor people of Colombia. My dear friends, we are behind the poor people of Colombia, not the powerful. [crowd cheers] President Cesar Gaviria must be recognized for the development of the Constitution. President Gaviria, by promoting constitutional changes, transformed Colombia's philosophy. In my opinion, what we are looking at now is a more modern Colombia with a greater willingness to achieve victory and to come out ahead. We want a more optimistic Colombia. As Ernesto Samper has said, I hope to contribute from the vice presidency by representing Colombia internationally. We are going to fight for human rights, against drug trafficking, and for the protection of natural resources and the environment of Colombia and the world. Ernesto Samper asked me to help renew the Liberal Party. I will never give up trying to accomplish that goal. As president of the Liberal Party's Renewal Commission, I hope to conclude our mission before 6 August. As of today, I wish to convene a Liberal Party convention. We need a more democratic, active, and institutional party with a greater committment to the fight against corruption. [crowd shouts: Long live the Liberal Party!] I want to tell you that it is a pleasure to have the support of millions and millions of Colombians. I am especially grateful because I am not a professional politician. I do not think I am a man who has turned politics into a profession. I come from another field, but my victory today not only commits me to Colombia but also teaches me something I heard from Luis Carlos Galan, who said if one does not do politics, others will do it for you. With Samper we will try to do good politics for all Colombians without discrimination, my dear friends. [crowd cheers] I conclude by thanking Rosalba and my sons. I want to say that without their help and understanding, my dreams of working for a more egalitarian society would not have been possible. Thank you, thank you my dear friends, and a big hug for Colombians. Thank you very much.
