This is because Luanda is doing all it can to hide its involvement in the crime. Thousands of citizens of the Bakongo tribe were killed in Luanda on that day. Thousands of others were assaulted and had their property looted, while the government and the press under its control watched silently in complicity. A report on the massacre was published yesterday by the government-dominated Parliament chaired by Franca van Dunem, and the Luanda government washed its hands, saying it was an isolated incident. Milton Kilandamoko, an Angolan politician, reacted to the masquerade. [Begin recording] [Kilandamoko] We think that is not true. First of all, I must say this parliamentary report was made a long time ago. It has not been published until now because the ruling party wanted to make certain alterations. Our confidence in Parliament consequently has been erased. I do not believe in the report. The Bakongo people do not believe it at all. [Unidentified reporter] You continue to believe that the bloody Friday violence last January had ethnic causes? [Kilandamoko] Absolutely, absolutely. There is no doubt about that. The armed elements involved in the violence even said why they were doing it. The government cannot, therefore, try to deceive people. It is clearly responsible for the violence. The police elements who carried out the massacre are government administration elements. This being the case, the government is responsible and it is its duty to respond. Only these elements would be brought before a court, while the government washes its hands. That is not justice. It has referred the case to Parliament and the Parliament tried to spare the government. [Reporter] This means, therefore, that the parliamentary report is not correct and the Bakongo people will continue to demand justice. [Kilandamoko] Absolutely. This report is a pure lie. We do not agree with it. I, personally, as a Bakongo, do not agree with it, and the Bakongo people think in the same way. [Reporter] What are you going to do now? [Kilandamoko] Well, first of all, we think the government must be brought before judicial institutions. Here in Angola, it is not customary for the government to be called to answer. A person can be killed by the police, an armed civilian can be killed by the government, the person will be buried and the case will end there. We think that our country is developing and the government must know that it is its duty to care for the life of the people. Parliament's failure to give priority to this case means that the same kind of justice that was applied during a one-party system continues to be applied in the country today. [end recording]
