Television Appearance Balladur's appearance on the "Heure de Verite" [Hour of Truth] television program gave rise to a variety of reactions on the Left and the Right, notes "N.G." in the 16 February Paris daily LIBERATION. "Most vehement" of all was Robert Hue's, the newly appointed leader of the Communist Party (PC), who called Balladur's performance "revolting" and "particularly shocking" and cynical toward the thousands who suffer from his policies. Hue was seconded by Socialist Party (PS) luminary Henri EmmanuelIi, who said that "in light of the social regression using the fight against unemployment as a pretext, workers must mobilize before it is too late." Other socialists chose to stress what they perceive to be Balladur's presidential ambitions. Laurent Fabius scored the prime minister's "energy in not saying he wishes to be a presidential candidate." Jean-Paul Huchon, the "lieutenant" of PS leader Michel Rocard, accused Balladur of "passivity." "What is not acceptable is to give the impression one is resigned to the unacceptable, because French society is living a major social breakdown," he said. Former Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement affirmed that Balladur is only following "what his predecessors condemned." On the Right, National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen claimed that Balladur's talk was "profoundly soporific." He likened it to a situation in which Balladur "is not sure you will not die, but he promises you that everything will still be all right." Within the parliamentary majority, reactions were varied. Philippe Vasseur, secretary general of the Republican Party, noted that Balladur was "the same as always, pragmatic and clear," a reaction "N.G." terms "neither a compliment nor a criticism." Similarly, UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin noted that while Balladur's "clarifications" were "useful," the "best criteria are results." RPR deputy secretary general Jean-Louis Debre said in a communique that while the Gaullist movement "reiterates its full support for the government's recovery policy," the RPR will be a "force for proposals within the governmental majority, as the prime minister himself has wished." Balladur's interview was greeted with "skepticism" by trade union organizations, "N.G." continues. The French Democratic Confederation of Labor (CFDT) denounced the government's "crying insufficiencies" in the fight against unemployment, noting that "financial orthodoxy and lower labor costs remain the prime minister's alpha and omega." According to Marc Blondel, secretary general of the Workers' Force (FO), Balladur's policy "offers little hope for an effective reduction of unemployment." Finally, Louis Viannet, secretary general of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), scored Balladur for trumpeting the end of the recession in France. Balladur V. Chirac "Chirac-ians are regaining hope and delighting in the decreased popularity of Edouard Balladur," notes Eric Dupin in the 12-13 February LIBERATION. This means that the presidential chances of Jacques Chirac are not "as desperate as it seems," he continues. The RPR leader's determination to run regardless of Balladur's intentions could deprive the prime minister of a "major trump card," for Balladur would no longer be considered a guarantor against divisions in the Right--such as the "duel" between Chirac and UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing--if his ambition "created a fatal explosion in the RPR." Even an internal primary on the Right between Chirac and Balladur would be "risky" for the latter, Dupin contends, for the test would be, not to gather a majority of the French, but how to convince the conservative camp. Be that as it may, Dupin continues, the "moderate and pragmatic" Balladur possesses rather significant trump cards to resist Chirac's pressure, the principal being his position at the electorate's ideological center of gravity. By contrast, Chirac's image is "much more vague," for he cannot decide whether he should speak for a hard Right that accuses the pirme minister of "excessive prudence," or for a social Right that denounces his "economic conformism." It is obvious that Chirac is betting more on future Balladur errors than on the efficiency of a policy he is still seeking, Dupin concludes. Balladur's Popularity Despite his recent drop in the polls, Balladur's popularity remains high, Jacques Julliard writes in the 10-16 February Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. It is the "quasi-mechanical" result of the conjunction of four specific political circumstances, he contends. 1. The victory of the Right last March, which became even more significant because the opposition, still "licking its wounds," is incapable of "returning blow for blow." While PS leader Michel Rocard is rebuilding his party with "astonishing mastery," he has not defined his position toward Balladur, "alternating an extremely soft discourse with sometimes excessive imprecations." 2. The end of an internecine crisis. Balladur has freed the Right and the Center of the anxiety of losing the presidential elections despite their majority because of the Giscard-Chirac rivalry. According to Julliard, Balladur is liked more because "he is not them" than for himself. It should be noted that it is not in the prime minister's interest to have Giscard disappear from the scene too early, he adds, for Balladur would lose his position of arbiter, thus dividing his own party. 3. The alibi of powerlessness. The French no longer expect much from politicians on unemployment, the subject that interests them most, Julliard contends. They do not think Balladur is more efficient than others. Instead, they are resigned to his presence as "more presentable" and "least affected by the scandals of previous years." Polls do not measure his popularity, but his "persistent nonimpopularity," Julliard affirms. 4. The prime minister's early presidentialization. The French have understood that a sitting president, affected by his party's defeat last March and no longer a candidate, has lost his essential powers. As a result, the prime minister is now seen as a "veritable president" or a "viceroy," and is hence "credited with the success of power and exonerated of its failures." From the above, it is clear that Balladur's popularity depends neither on his qualities nor on his personal defects. Therefore, today's favorable circumstances may well turn to his detriment tomorrow, Julliard concludes. Balladur's Popularity Loss The root cause of Balladur's recent difficulties, for which he is already paying in the polls, is that he did not take sufficiently into account the contradictions in the French people's state of mind, "J.P." contends in the 15 February LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS. In fact, he continues, while the French do not like their governments to create upheavals, they do expect them to produce rapid and consequent results. The prime minister has not efficiently responded to the concerns and impatience of the French, "J.P." writes. It is possible that Balladur would be no more successful even if he adopted a more activist course. However, those within the majority who contest him could express their differences by criticizing the prime minister's method and not the man himself, thus "saving face," "J.P." counsels. In addition, Balladur's simple reforms have provided Chirac with a strong argument, he continues. The RPR leader can explain--and has not failed to do so--that real change will only occur after next year's presidential elections, since Mitterrand's presence mandates that only "reforms" be carried out at this time. Thus the very "modesty" of the term plays against him, "J.P." contends.
