In his words, Chernomyrdin has managed to persuade the President and form a cabinet of his own choice, an indication of a gradual shift of federal authority to the Prime Minister. For his part, RC public relations officer Kirill Ignatiyev said the party would ensure political support to its five ministers in the cabinet carrying out RC goals. These are Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Science and Education Minister Boris Saltykov, Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov and Environment Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan. Saltykov in turn has said he will remain in the cabinet as long as he can implement reforms within his area of responsibility. Yushenkov hopes the Russian President is well aware of how fatal it will be to wind up reforms and will be able to muster up enough strength to take appropriate decisions. He said that under the constitution, Yeltsin can name a Prime Minister but not individual ministers. The RC is ready to bring a non-confidence motion against the government if it adopts unacceptable resolutions including one on the budget, Yushenkov said.
