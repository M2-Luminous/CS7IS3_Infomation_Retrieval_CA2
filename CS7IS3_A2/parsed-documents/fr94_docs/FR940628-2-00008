FR940628-2-00008 FR940628-2-00003 April 25, 1994. Richard E. Sanderson, Director, Office of Federal Activities, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW (A&hyph;104), Washington, DC 20460. Re: JFKIA Gull Hazard Reduction Program EIS Process Dear Mr. Sanderson: This amends my letter of April 19, 1994 in the above-referenced matter for the purpose of seeking a specific waiver period. The facts and circumstances as described in my previous letter have not changed. In fairness to the public, however, a fixed date by which a decision is to be made should be provided. Accordingly, a 16-day waiver of the 30-day period prescribed in 40 CFR §1506.10(b)_allowing a decision to be made on May 20, 1994_is hereby requested. We still anticipate that the notice of availability of the final environmental impact statement will be published in the May 6th issue of the Federal Register . If you have questions concerning this amendment or if additional information is needed, please contact me directly. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Carl Bausch, Deputy Director, Environmental Analysis and Documentation. April 29, 1994. Carl Bausch, Deputy Director, Environmental Analysis and Documentation, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Building, Room 842, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782. Dear Mr. Bausch: I have received and reviewed your request dated April 19, 1994 and the amendment dated April 25, 1994, asking for a 16-day waiver of the review period for the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) Gull Hazard Reduction Program, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Queens County, New York. The request has been carefully reviewed pursuant to Section 1506.10(d) of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. Based on my review of the request, I find reasons of compelling national policy have been substantiated. Therefore a 16-day waiver has been approved for the above mentioned FEIS. As required by §1506.10(d), CEQ will be notified of your request and my subsequent approval. You will be provided with a copy of the notice once it appears in the Federal Register . Should you have any questions, please contact me or have a member of your staff contact Marilyn Henderson of my office at (202) 260&hyph;5075. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Richard E. Sanderson, Director, Office of Federal Activities. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15634 Filed 6&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;34&hyph;M
