(f) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no request for a refund or credit will be approved unless the request is received at MMS at the address provided below within 2 years of the date that MMS received the excess payment. (1) The request for refund or credit must be received at the following address: (i) By mail: Minerals Management Service, Section 10 Refund Requests, P.O. Box 173702, Denver, CO 80217&hyph;3702. (ii) By express delivery or courier: Minerals Management Service, Section 10 Refund Requests, Building 85, Denver Federal Center, Room A&hyph;212, Denver, CO 80225. (2) If the last day of the 2-year period from the date MMS received the excess payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday, holiday or any other day that MMS is not open for business at the address specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then the last day of the 2-year period will be the next regular business day.

No person is entitled to interest on any excess payment made in connection with a lease that is refunded or recouped pursuant to this subpart. §230.455 Authorization of refund or credit and subsequent audit. MMS may grant a refund or authorize a credit based upon satisfactory evidence that the payment for which a refund or credit is requested was made, and upon a determination that the payment was excess. An approved request for refund or credit may be subject to later review or audit by MMS. If, based upon later review or audit, MMS determines that the refund or credit should not have been granted or authorized, the person who requested the refund or credit must repay the amount refunded or recouped plus interest determined pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 CFR 218.150 from the date the refund was made or the recoupment taken until the date it is repaid. §230.456 Offsets of overpayments and underpayments on the same lease (or unit) by the same person. If a person makes an overpayment on any OCS lease or unit in a prior month, it may offset that overpayment against an underpayment that same person made in any prior month on that same lease or unit for the same or a different product without submitting a request for refund or credit. This offset is permitted only if the underpayment was not created as a result of a credit adjustment to recoup the amount of the overpayment or was not otherwise created intentionally to provide an underpayment against which to offset the overpayment. This offset also is subject to any limitations imposed by other applicable law or regulations. §230.457 Offsets among different persons who reported and paid royalties on a lease for the same prior sales month.

(b) In the event of a reallocation of production as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the respective persons who reported and paid royalty may reconcile any resulting differences in royalty payment obligations between themselves without submitting revised royalty reports or requests for refund or credit to MMS under this subpart, except that:
