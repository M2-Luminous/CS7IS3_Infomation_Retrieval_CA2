He also said that had not initiated the peacekeeping operation for the sake of some lofty but empty idea. "Tranquility and peace in this region is tantamount to stability in the Caucasus and the south of Russia, although, of course, we are anxious about the Russian guys, who are in the zone of the Abkhazian-Georgian conflict now," he said. Pastukhov announced that "the Russian forces which constitute the nucleus of the CIS peacekeeping operation, have been deployed on the basic positions." "They are equipping posts and beginning to perform their functions," he said. He said that the local population had given a warm welcome to the Russian units. "After the arrival of the peacekeeping forces, the population's moods changed for the better. There is more hope now that combat operations will not be resumed," he said. Pastukhov believes that the dramatic problems of the refugees are in the forefront now. "On the one hand, the return of the refugees must not be spontaneous and unorganized. But on the other, their comeback must not be delayed any longer," he said. He refused to name the exact number of refugees. He said, however, that according to Georgia, more than 250,000 people had left Abkhazia. "I visited the Gali Region recently. It is empty. The burnt and ruined houses amid the flourishing nature of Kolchis make a shocking sight," said Pastukhov.
