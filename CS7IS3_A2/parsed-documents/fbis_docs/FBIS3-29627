They will hold another meeting of the council early next week. At today's meeting, the LDP asserted that the public raising of funds for political parties be limited to one-third the amount of funds the political parties raised publicly a year earlier and requirements for political parties raising the funds publicly be stringently laid down. The ruling parties, however, opposed the LDP's proposal, citing the disparities of revenues among political parties and the impossibility of newly formed political parties to raise the funds. The LDP proposed at the meting of the Consultative Council that both the ruling and opposition parties decide on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies without entrusting all matters to the Constituency Demarcation Deliberation Council mandated to decide on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies for the House of Representative and both ruling and opposition parties decide on a bill on the demarcation of the single-seat constituencies. In response, the ruling parties agreed in principle to the LDP's proposal and the ruling and opposition parties will hold another meeting of the council to discuss ways to draft the bill. The ruling and opposition parties also agreed to set up subcommittees in the council and start full-fledged discussions early next week.
