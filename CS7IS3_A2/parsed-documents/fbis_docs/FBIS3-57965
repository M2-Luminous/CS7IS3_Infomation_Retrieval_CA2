Today he met with delegates for the Socialists (PSI), the Christian Democrats (DC), the Liberals (PLI), the Social Democrats (PSDI), the European Federalists, the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the Northern League and the Republicans (PRI). The forces which have upheld the government so far (the DC, PSI, the PSDI and the PLI) have not ruled out the possibility of Ciampi continuing with full powers until general elections are held, possibly in conjunction with European elections in June. The PDS, however, considers the political life of this government over and insists that the parliament must be renewed as quickly as possible. PDS secretary Achille Occhetto told reporters at the end of his meeting with Ciampi that "in our view, starting with January 12, any time is good for the president of the republic to dissolve the two houses." The essential thing is to hold elections so as to give life to a new parliament from which a new government can emerge, Occhetto said. Flanked by PDS caucus leaders Massimo D'Alemo and Giuseppe Chiarante, Occhetto told the press that during the approval of the financial bill, the government had effectively carried out the function for which it was created, that is, as institutional guarantor, and also absolved this task with the approval of an electoral reform which reflects the spirit of the referendum, he said. For the PDS, it is wrong to open a debate on the government when the impelling job ahead must be that of enabling the citizenry as quicky as possible to choose a new parliament elected under the new rules. League floorleader Roberto Maroni also urged speedy elections, no later than 10 April, and the sooner the better. The League did not preclude the Ciampi Administration staying on until the vote as long as it did not prove to be an "electoral executive" remote-controlled by any particular clutch of political forces but rather, but instead served to technically manage certain economic problems. The League will decide its stance on the no-confidence motion after hearing Ciampi's address to the parliament. For the Republicans the filing of no-confidence motions was unacceptable because the government had adequately handled the tasks before it. The PRI takes the view that the no confidence ploy was devised as a way to prolong the life of the legislature when the approval of the new electoral law urges the renewing of parliament as soon as possible. In fact, the focus of today's meetings was chiefly on the date for the coming general elections and the nature of the government handling the period leading up to the vote. Almost all the groups voiced appreciation for the job done by Ciampi.
