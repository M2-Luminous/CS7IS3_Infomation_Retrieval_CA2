FBIS3-43586 "drafr006_a_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 January 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Congo National Assembly Adopts Structural Adjustment Plan AB0801093494 Paris AFP in French 1353 GMT 6 Jan 94 AB0801093494 Paris AFP Language: French Article Type:BFN [Text] Brazzaville, 6 Jan (AFP) -- The Congolese Government has adopted a social and economic recovery program which provides for 20 to 35 percent reduction in salaries of the country's 80,000 civil servants, a parliamentary source said here today. This reduction, which is aimed at bringing down the annual wage bill from 134 to 84 billion CFA francs, will not affect low income earners and will be negotiated by the government and civil service unions, the same source added. The government will encourage early voluntary retirement and the redeployment of part of the civil service force, through "backup measures" that will be implemented with the help of the French Development Agency [CFD], the World Bank, and the European Union. The plan provides for about 15 billion CFA francs savings through the reduction of public expenditure, notably in the sectors of water consumption, electricity, and telephone; the reduction of diplomatic staff; and the adoption of a new system of teaching scholarship awards. The government hopes to improve fiscal and customs revenue so as to limit the share of oil revenue which accounts for 70 percent of budget resources. According to official estimates, the package of measures are expected to bring in "additional 27 billion CFA francs" each year. The plan also provides for the "restructuring of the status and the mode of management" of major public and semi-public enterprises. The state company in charge of the marketing of hydrocarbons -- Hydro-Congo -- will lose its distribution monopoly and the Transcongo Communication Agency will be broken up into three autonomous units. Regarding the debt which hit the figure of 1.600 billion CFA in 1993, the plan provides for a "300 billion CFA francs bridge-credit," over ten years, with two years grace period and an interest rate not exceeding 5 percent. This credit will be used to make an early payment of the 135 billion CFA secured debt and to clear 50 billion CFA francs multilateral arrears, of which 35 billion CFA are owed to the CFD. The rest of the credit will be put into a Reserve, Stabilization, and Economic Diversification Fund. The granting of this credit presupposes prior agreement with the IMF. This will enable the country's debt to benefit from a special treatment from the Paris and London clubs.
