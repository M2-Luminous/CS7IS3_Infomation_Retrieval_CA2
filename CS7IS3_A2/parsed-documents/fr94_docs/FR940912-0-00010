ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts interim regulations that amend FCA regulations relating to collateral evaluation requirements for Farm Credit System (FCS or System) institutions engaged in lending or leasing. The FCA Board also requests comments on these regulations. The amendments respond to issues raised by regulatory revisions recently adopted by the other Federal financial institutions' regulatory agencies (Federal regulatory agencies), 1 comments received in response to the FCA's published request for ``regulatory burden'' comments (58 FR 34003, June 23, 1993), and amendments made to regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Regulation B) interpreting the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). 2 1 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Federal Reserve Board (FRB), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). 2 The FRB published final regulations on December 16, 1993 (58 FR 65657) implementing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. 1691&hyph;1691f, as amended by the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2236. DATES: The regulations shall become effective October 31, 1994, or upon the expiration of 30 days after publication during which either or both Houses of Congress are in session, whichever is later. Written comments must be submitted on or before October 10, 1994. Notice of the effective date will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in writing, in triplicate, to Patricia W. DiMuzio, Associate Director, Regulation Development, Office of Examination, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;5090.

General The FCA Board adopted final collateral evaluation regulations on November 12, 1992. The regulations were published in the Federal Register on November 20, 1992 (57 FR 54683), and became effective March 1, 1993. The regulations addressed the System's collateral evaluation practices and procedures, including the need for: (1) Consistent methodology; (2) independence and controls; and (3) consistent educational and qualification requirements. The regulations set basic requirements for real property appraisals, including the use of State licensed and/or certified appraisers, functional independence, and compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP). The real property appraisal requirements adopted were similar to the requirements of the other Federal regulatory agencies. The objective of the present amendments is to provide additional flexibility in appraisal and independence requirements, without jeopardizing the overall integrity or enforceability of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations. By providing additional flexibility in the use of State-sanctioned appraisers and relief from the more stringent real estate appraisal requirements, the FCA addresses regulatory burden concerns. The amendments are being adopted as interim regulations with a delayed effective date and request for comments in order to provide interested parties an opportunity to comment on the regulations. However, the FCA believes adopting the regulations in final is required to provide System institutions with the necessary guidance to address revisions to their collateral evaluation requirements and necessary staffing needs. The regulatory revisions also establish requirements that are similar to the requirements recently adopted by the Federal regulatory agencies. The FCA adopted, on May 5, 1994, a ``no action'' position relative to the System institutions' compliance with certain real estate appraisal requirements in response to the then-pending regulatory revisions by the Federal regulatory agencies. The FCA's ``no action'' position was intended to serve as a temporary means of eliminating any competitive disadvantage suffered by System institutions. However, the ``no action'' position provides more flexibility than the FCA would consider a prudent long-term regulatory position. Therefore, these regulatory revisions are intended to eliminate any competitive disadvantage for the System institutions and establish the necessary guidance and parameters for the System's collateral evaluation practices and procedures.
