During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin inspected in great detail internal and external environments of each and every higher learning institution, inquired about conditions in student dormitories and canteens, befriended and solicited views from students, and showed great concern for teaching, learning, and scientific research activities, teachers' contingent building, as well as ideological realities, livelihood, academic and research work of staff and teachers. After being told that many locally based higher learning institutions are confronted with difficulties in scientific research and publication of literary works due to a short supply of water, electricity, and operational funds, Secretary Wang Maolin repeatedly asked the provincial education commission, provincial party committee's college education work committee, and some other provincial departments concerned to take prompt action to resolve those problems as soon as possible. During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin time and again stressed: Now the majority of the province's college students are in their twenties and are thereby the unquestionable successors in the next century. Within a short space of 10 to 20 years, these students will become either party and government leaders at all levels across the country or technological backbones in the forefront of production. Therefore, higher learning institutions should at once be places where students are trained academically and where students are taught how to conduct themselves. Only by so doing will they be able to train a new generation of people capable of undertaking sacred missions entrusted by history. During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin highly praised Central South University of Technology for having successfully built a national-level laboratory and a powder metallurgy research institute, praised Hunan Teachers' University for having built a competent contingent of teachers and trained a large number of highly qualified personnel, praised Hunan Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine for having successfully developed a traditional Chinese medical diagnoses course, praised Changsha Institute of Communications for having cultivated a fine campus style and a fine academic style, and commended Hunan Light Industry School for having successfully created and experimented with a series of new teaching methods. Secretary Wang Maolin also spelled out some specific new work requirements for the aforementioned five higher learning institutions.
