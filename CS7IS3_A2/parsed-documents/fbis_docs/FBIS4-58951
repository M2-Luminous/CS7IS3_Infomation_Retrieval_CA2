FBIS4-58951 "drnes090_j_94006" FBIS-NES-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Ministry Official Interviewed on Military Situation Ministry Official Interviewed on Military Situation JN0905123294 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 9 May 94 p 29 JN0905123294 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN [Report by Amjad Mu'alla] [Text] A senior Yemeni official has accused foreign quarters of interfering in Yemeni affairs in an attempt to strike at Yemeni unity and kindle the fires of sedition by supplying the warring factions with weapons and encouraging fighting. He appealed to the political forces in Aden and the Governorate of Lahij, stronghold of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], to move in order to decisively settle matters in favor of the Armed Forces. He stressed that the current fighting is an internal affair and there is no room for foreign mediation. Reached by telephone in Sanaa, Mazhar al-Taqiy, undersecretary of the Yemeni Information Ministry, told AL-DUSTUR that large quantities of weapons were seized at sea and airports. He added that the Yemeni authorities confiscated military communications equipment, bugging devices, and certain missile batteries aboard a Boeing 707 about one month ago. Everything was purchased from a British company and the plane belonged to an Ugandan airline company. He said large quantities of light weapons were found and confiscated from the Yemeni Socialist Party headquarters in Sanaa in the last few days. Al-Taqiy questioned the YSP motives behind the possession of these quantities of weapons and said no state can allow a local party to import weapons for itself or form its own army and militias. He said that importing weapons in such quantities clearly indicates that foreign quarters do not want to see unity or democracy in Yemen as these act like an earthquake to foreign forces. Regarding the latest developments in Yemen, al-Taqiy said the Armed Forces are on their way to end what he termed a rebellion led by an adventurous group in the YSP leadership. He added that the Armed Forces, which represent the constitutional legitimacy and belong to the various governorates in the Republic, are 15 km from the city of Aden and will enter and take control of it. Mazhar al-Taqiy added that yesterday a large number of the forces that had been stationed in the southeastern Sunaywah [name as transliterated]. Governorate joined the Yemeni Army, bringing their equipment and weapons. Al-Taqiy said Yemen still rejects mediation to stop the fighting, citing the statements of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to the House of Representatives on 7 May, deeming the situation in Yemen an internal affair. The Yemeni Information Ministry under secretary cited President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's assertion that unity will not be abandoned, whatever the cost, and that the rebellious leadership in the YSP should surrender to the legitimate authority. He said: We expect the unionists in the YSP and other Aden residents to take control of the situation, arrest the rebels and hand them over to the legitimate authority. Answering a question as to whether there have been attempts by some Arab parties to mediate, al-Taqiy said: "Mediation between whom? What is happening now is that a group that has defied constitutional legitimacy has ignited a war in several regions in Yemen. We ask any side that wants to mediate if it would accept mediation if one of its parties were to ignite an internal war." He added: We think that this is purely an internal affair and that the rebels should respect constitutional legitimacy and the state institutions established in accordance with the elections on 27 April 1993. They should submit to legitimacy, and then everything will return to the way it was before. While observing the developments in fraternal Yemen, AL-DUSTUR has also tried to contact Yemeni officials in Aden. However, they could not be reached because telephone links with Aden have been cut.
