It was reported earlier today that two NATO F-16 fighters shot down four alleged Bosnian Serb aircraft over Banja Luka in Bosnia. A statement issued by Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry about the action carried out by NATO said the UN resolutions enforcing a no-fly zone, numbers 781 and 816, were part of the efforts made by the international community to find a peaceful settlement to the Bosnia crisis. It appealed for a strict compliance of these resolutions and hoped that the incident will not jeopardize the on-going peace process for an end to the military conflict in Bosnia.
