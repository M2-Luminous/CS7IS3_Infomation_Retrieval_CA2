The government forces expelled the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] soldiers from the outskirts of the city to a radius of about 70 km. During the follow up operations, 400 Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] soldiers were killed and others fled in disarray. Our correspondent reports from the area: The UNITA rebels are dispersed, that is why they stopped shelling the city with long range weapons. The Angolan Armed Forces, National Police, and civilian defense are successfully conducting the follow up operations with the aim of widening the defense cordon for a radius of action over 30 km of the city so that the population may search for food in secure conditions.
