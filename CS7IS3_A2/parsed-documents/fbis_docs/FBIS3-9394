[Filkus] We need to swiftly stabilize the macrosphere. We have to abandon the idea that there is a third way toward the market. We have slowed down privatization in Slovakia by our speculations about a third way. Because we have already taken steps associated with a restrictive macroeconomic policy of a budgetary and monetary character, we cannot fall back. We have to continue to liberalize prices and to maintain our currency's internal convertibility. It is also necessary to speed up and depoliticize privatization, mainly because it was used as a means of concentrating political power. We have to prepare the second wave of coupon privatization by fall, at the latest. The economic microsphere appears to be the most risky area. The enterprises are surviving on their equity and not from the fact that they are efficient. The necessary changes are again associated with speeding up privatization. We will try to establish and develop the, to date, small capital market. That is, we should improve the microsphere by means of the capital market. Of course, there are also matter-of-fact problems that can be resolved by restructuring, but not the kind that would be undertaken by the center. The microsphere must also be supported, to a substantial degree, by the influx of foreign capital. [Slavik] Was the recently introduced import surcharge really necessary? [Filkus] This is a normal instrument of a market economy. It is intended to protect the domestic market. The market left open, however, should be filled by domestic products. Other systemic measures also have to be put into effect for this, though. If they are not put into effect, the consumer would pay more and more for goods, regardless of the surcharge. [Slavik] There are rumors about state property being looted by the previous government. Is this true? [Filkus] Many privatization projects were approved with unusual speed during the past three government sessions. [Slavik] According to some deputies, they were on the verge of legality. Is the successor government going to investigate them? [Filkus] Yes. Such a proposal has already been made in parliament. Before we address the citizens, we have to take inventory and tell them under what conditions we are taking over the economy. [Slavik] Could the split within the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] continue? [Filkus] Everything suggests that the process of dissolution is continuing. It was recently announced that the leadership of the HZDS Deputies' Club is again being changed. [Slavik] Do you think Vladimir Meciar will win again in the early elections? [Filkus] No. I am convinced of this. [Slavik] What do you think of the reactions by the police following the assault on certain journalists by demonstrators? [Filkus] I condemn them. If this was intended as a test of the police officers and their commanders, it was a complete failure.
