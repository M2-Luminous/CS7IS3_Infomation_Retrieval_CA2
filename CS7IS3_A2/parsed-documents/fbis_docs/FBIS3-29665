He said: The government expected that North Korea would suggest that we hold a dialogue first. However, as North Korea demanded through a news conference held by its Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday, that our side propose first that South and North Korea hold a contact for the exchange of special envoys, the government has decided to make such a proposal first. Accordingly, the government will hold a meeting of offices concerned to decide on a date for the South-North working-level contact. It is now considering a method for holding a working-level contact with North Korea next week. According to the government, in the forthcoming U.S.-North Korean working-level contact in New York, the United States will state, in particular, when to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks and will announce the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, meeting North Korea's demands without a snag. North Korea is also expected to give an available date for the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team's entrance to North Korea. The government anticipated: There is no big problem for the IAEA inspection team to enter North Korea next week. Accordingly, South-North working-level contacts will begin sometime next week without problem according to our proposal because the South-North dialogue must begin upon the inspection team's entrance to North Korea. South and North Korea held three working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys last year, and have held no more contacts since then because of North Korea's refusal.
