Things came to the boiling point during the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] and it looks like the first hot sparks will be thrown off during the constitutional revision. Then, after April, when the list of candidates will be virtually finalized, we might see some tall flames. The charge by Luiz Salomao (PDT, Rio de Janeiro) that an agreement was worked out between the PT delegation and [former President] Sarney's contingent in the Congress to keep [Sarney's daughter] Roseana, on the one hand, and Miguel Arraes, on the other, out of the hands of the CPI exposed a dispute for space on the Left that, until then, had been taking shape behind the scenes. The PT reacted immediately. One of the party leaders--someone with real influence within the delegation--added to the official denials an argument to demolish the theory behind the agreement when he said: "If we were to make any arrangement with the PFL [Liberal Front Party], it would not be with the Sarney group; we would deal directly with Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes, the party's leader in the Chamber, who has authority over the party's representatives on the CPI. He would be our authorized interlocutor." That is true, although no one from the PT or any other party that helped to erect the obvious cordon around Roseana and Arraes has offered a convincing explanation for the successive, and successful, ploys that kept both of them far away from the hearing room. In the case of Arraes, we must not forget that the PDT also has some stake in the matter, since Brizola has not yet lost hope of seeing the former Pernambuco's name on his slate as his vice presidential running mate. Given Lula's standing in the polls, however, even the most loyal brizolistas now acknowledge the difficulties with this plan. In an attempt to discredit Salomao--who is being accused in private conversations of trying to counter the effects of some unsuccessful actions in the CPI (the testimony by Joao Alves's former chauffeur, for example)--the PT is thinking about naming representatives from the party to serve on the CPI that would investigate the CUT [Sole Workers Center]. Once the appointments are made, the party would simply let matters take their course. Probably the effort would not get anywhere, since if a CPI were set up to investigate the CUT, there would be no way to prevent CPI's on election campaigns and on contractors, a development not in the interest of the other parties. That would ruin everyone's election campaigns. PT-Sarney agreement aside, the fact is that Lula's and Brizola's parties are once again getting ready to tussle with each other because of the presidential succession. For the time being, the line of attack is almost totally occupied by the PDT. Old resentments are popping up again. For example, Deputy Vivaldo Barbosa (PDT-RJ) backs the theory, which he argues vehemently, that "the PT is handing over the constitutional revision" in exchange for a 60-day postponement of the CPI on CUT. Vivaldo says the petistas "have bowed in the face of the wind gusts of liberalism." He cites as example past votes on which Lula's party, as the brizolistas see it, preferred to ally with the enemy. These include: the laws on patents, information technology, ports, and the role of foreign capital in privatizations. And now the PDT is convinced that the PT will ultimately participate in the revision which, according to the same rationale, will make changes in the Constitution similar to those proposed by then-President Fernando Collor in the "super-amendment" that never got through the Congress. The real danger the brizolistas run with this approach is that they might end up attracting more voters to the PT. And it is precisely among the middle class where Lula has the most difficulty. But that is a problem of PDT strategy, where what counts most is precisely that--pushing the PT toward the Right so as not to have to share the banners of the Left with it. Of course Brizola is not stupid; he would not pretend to isolate himself by these means in some infantile leftist philosophy. In fact, he has already embarked on a schedule of political consultations and conversations in a fertile field for harvesting dissidents--the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. The pedetistas are falling all over themselves to praise the "nationalist" faction of the PMDB, comprised of such men as Tarcisio Delgado from Minas Gerais, the PMDB leader in the Chamber, and Rondonia Senator Amir Lando, who was the rapporteur on the CPI that investigated PC Farias. They are also, albeit somewhat timidly, casting sidelong glances in the direction of Pedro Simon (Rio Grande do Sul). But so far, the support group the PDT believes it can count on is comprised of the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], General Antonio Carlos de Andrada Serpa, Celso Brandt, Aureliano Chaves, and Barbosa Lima Sobrinho. In terms of votes, this cannot be called very encouraging.
