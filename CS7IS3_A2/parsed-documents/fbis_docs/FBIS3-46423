According to the rules, China should resume its GATT status before the package of GATT agreements go into effect, thus becoming a member country of the world trade organization. Gu said this while answering a question at a press conference held by the information office of the State Council. China, which was originally one of the signatories of GATT and withdrew from it for various reasons, formally applied in 1986 to restore its original status. Gu said that after seven years of negotiations, the Chinese delegation has clearly explained China's economic and trade system to the member countries of GATT, which have got an overall knowledge of it. During the period, great reform has been carried out in China's economic and trade system. As a result, the system is very close to the principles of GATT now, Gu said. Thus, he said, it is high time to discuss concretely the text of the protocol for the resumption of China's status in GATT. Most of the signing member countries hoped that the negotiations would achieve rapid progress, Gu said, adding that some countries have begun or declared they will begin negotiations with China on tariff problems. One of the difficulties facing the work is that some major signing parties' high demands exceed China's economic ability, Gu said. Gu expressed his hope that the major signing countries will actually support China's effort. On the timetable, Gu said that China of course would like to return to GATT at an early date, and that the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which wound up on December 15 last year, objectively provided a timetable for China's resumption of its status in GATT.
