However, in an attempt to manipulate and, particularly, to stage massacres, the Muslim side has done something that, despite repeated attempts, has not occurred up until now. Massacres have been staged in Sarajevo on two consecutive days; today we were able to see this clearly from the photographs available to us and yesterday it was possible to deduce from the information available that our side had not opened fire. Why do I say that this is the most dramatic event? Because it took place on two consecutive days, because the first [massacre in Dobrinja] took place during the negotiations at the airport that aimed at furthering mutual trust. Moreover, this entire scandalous Bosnia-Herzegovina war chronicle happened five days before the Geneva conference scheduled for 10 February. I think, hope, and believe that Europe will find the strength to learn its lesson from such manipulation, and that it will finally accuse, or at least condemn, the side guilty of continuing the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
