As Teymuraz Ramishvili, chief of the Foreign Ministry's International Humanitarian Cooperation and Human Rights Administration and an author of the program, told IZVESTIYA, this is a program designed for a period of years. The program consists of three sections envisaging political, economic, and cultural measures. The section on the creation of the institution of dual citizenship stands out in particular. This is the main theme at bilateral talks on the rights of Russian-speaking minorities in the former republics. The point on the creation of a special radio station, a TV channel, and a press organ which would unite the whole Russian community abroad is noteworthy. The program envisages help in preserving the old and opening new Russian universities, institutes, and high schools, and in funding Russian schools and theaters. In the event of ethnic conflicts or any acute aggravation of the situation in any particular region it is proposed to elaborate a mechanism for the emergency evacuation of Russians and the provision of assistance to refugees and migrants in extreme circumstances. A special role in the protection of Russians will be played by Russia's economic ties with the various states of the CIS. It is planned to impose rigorous restrictions on the export of Russian raw materials and energy sources to countries where the rights of ethnic Russians are violated. One point speaks about the establishment of a continuous, technically equipped state and customs border with those states. In the allocation by Russia of upcoming credits to states of the former USSR it will be specially stipulated that a certain proportion of the resources in question (20-30 percent) must be used for the development of Russian education, language, and other needs of the Russian diaspora. Teymuraz Ramishvili acknowledges that the program will work only if budget financing is found for it. According to preliminary estimates it will cost around 3 trillion rubles. Assistance from the private sector is a matter for the future, although that sector could be given an interest in the project through the generally accepted practice of a tax concession in exchange for philanthropic activity. The authors of the plan hope that, despite the enormous financial difficulties, the program will be adopted as early as the second quarter of this year.
