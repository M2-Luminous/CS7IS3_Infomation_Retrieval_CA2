The impostors of "the Kurdish struggle"--traitorous groups--have never raised this question, nor has it been raised by the nations that pretend to be concerned about the Kurds and seek to protect them by falsehood and slander. As for the traitorous groups, their foremost concern has been how to serve America, serve Iran, or serve any big or neighboring country--indeed, how to achieve for the Zionist entity its goals in the region. As a result, what price does each of the parties pay? It is not in the form of rights for the Kurds, but in the form of money that accumulates on gambling tables and personal pleasures. They have completely ignored in their talk and in their cooperation with these parties the goal of the role that they have termed "a struggle"--that is to say, its relation to the rights of the Kurds. This is because the traitorous groups have perceived before others and more than others that national rights for the Kurds are utterly anathema to the customary practice of their masters. As for the international parties, they want the Kurdish issue to become an instrument to dissipate some of Iraq's thrust, drain Iraq's resources, distract Iraq from its pan-Arab role, and divert Iraq from building itself up; then they would push Iraq into surrender to what the West wants and to the goals that Zionism wants in the area. When the Soviet Union split up, each nationality, however insignificant, obtained a state or ministate as an acknowledged right or rights, while this was kept from the Kurds as an exception. No one in the new international order or in the remains of the Soviet Union uttered a word about the rights of the Kurds--bear in mind that Zionism, the United States, and the West generally were in the position of being able to dictate conditions to the new governments that the collapse left behind. Since the eternal Mother of Battles, America, the entire West, and the Zionists have wanted northern Iraq to remain isolated from the body of the country. Their airplanes still fly over this section, units of their armies still pollute it, and the men and women of their intelligence agencies are still plotting a role for one person and charting the course of someone else. They extend the hand of generosity to leading traitors and block the flow of aid to other Kurdish citizens. Their audacity has gone as far as to accuse Iraq of blockading the Kurds, while they blockade Iraq as a whole. Amid this penetration and intervention unsanctioned by international law and unjustified by custom or law, everyone has ignored the question of what the Kurds' rights are and what their condition is. In fact, talking even in a whisper or in lies about these rights raises the resentment of one party and the anger of another, and thus is a cause of discord. Iraq alone and its leader Saddam Husayn in particular have raised the question about the rights of the Kurds. The question was not raised to deal with a difficult situation through which the revolution was passing. It was not raised in the context of the violent confrontation with the West. It did not come about in order to avoid a sudden danger or to seek desired but threatened security. The subject of Kurdish rights was raised on the basis of an ideology that regards people as equals--an ideology whose root is in the Noble Koran and whose branches nourish themselves on the facts of the age. The rights of the Kurds came from the position of the state's power and ability--politically, economically, and militarily--above all else. The Kurds are Iraqi citizens first, and therefore they have the rights and duties of every citizen. The rights of the Kurds begin with their being recognized as a minority with a special character on the one hand and incorporated into the formation of Iraqi society on the other hand. The Kurds consequently have the right to use their language--indeed, to be educated in it alongside Arabic. They have the right to adhere to their own customs and to develop their culture. Iraq, under the leadership and guidance of Saddam Husayn, added that the Kurds should participate in governing Iraq as a whole and that they should act as rulers in local affairs in the context of the unity of Iraq and without prejudicing the rights of the Iraqi people as a whole or of its central government in guiding affairs so as to benefit everyone and prevent harm to all. Thus, Kurds have become members of the central government, the central parliament, and central institutions--just as they have come to have their local authorities. Indeed, the Iraqi state has not neglected the right of the Kurds to disagree among themselves in opinion and ideology in a multiparty system to which all doors have been opened. In the forefront of these parties were those who are now seeking the sympathy of Iraq's enemies and inciting these enemies against their own country. What, other than what we have mentioned, are national rights? Furthermore, is it not Iraq, which is accused of blockading the Kurds, that has spent billions to develop life in the Kurdish regions, while the neighboring countries that the traitors serve want to keep the Kurdish people locked in the age of pastoralism? Today, after the years of fighting in the Mother of Battles, the Kurdish citizen realizes that under the leadership of Saddam Husayn a free and dignified life for himself and his national rights exist for the first time in history. Certain it is that this truth will someday be transformed into affectionate action that will amaze the world when, after all the noise of propaganda, it is seen that Iraq's Kurds want no alternative to their dignity and will accept no one but Saddam Husayn as leader.
