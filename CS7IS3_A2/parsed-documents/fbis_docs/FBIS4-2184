The coastal cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou concluded hundreds of agreements on economic co-operation with the mountainous prefectures of Ningde, Longyan, Sanming and Nanping last year, with the former providing capital, technology and information to the latter. The Sanming city alone signed 154 contract on economic co-operation with the coastal cities of Putian, Quanzhou and Xiamen, involving a total investment of 400 million yuan. The contracts cover the building materials, forestry and chemical industries, according to Guan Qing, chairman of the provincial economic cooperation office. The economy in the coastal areas of the province is growing faster than the mountainous thanks to the policy of opening to the outside world. The provincial move is believed to be part of the nation-wide bid to narrow the gap between those comparatively developed and underdeveloped areas.
