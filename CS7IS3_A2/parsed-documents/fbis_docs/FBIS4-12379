What are the causes and results of this embargo and how are you facing the hardship, such as prices and inflation soaring madly? [Ramadan] The unjust embargo imposed on Iraq on 6 August 1991 is entering its fourth year, making it the first in the entire world. Any embargo launched against any country in the last half of this century for any reason does not compare with the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq in the name of international legitimacy under the hegemony of the United States. The embargo is being enforced under stark and direct American threats to the nations of the world. No one cared about the humanitarian aspect (medicine and food) of this unjust embargo, which is not covered by the Security Council resolutions. The way the embargo was implemented and followed up on reflected the intentions of those who imposed it, foremost of which was the United States. It has become clear that the implementation of the embargo has nothing to do with the reason they gave; that is, Kuwait. The objective of the blockade, obviously, is to stop Iraq's progress, which represents the beginning of the Arab nation's progress. Had Iraq's position proceeded only from its own interests, the country would not have been dealt with so brutally. They know full well that Iraq's development will benefit the Arab nation, no matter how far they go in promoting borders and regionalism. The embargo will erode and be smashed through the capabilities of society, and it will be lifted completely when the enemies realize that it is impossible to achieve their objectives. In our confrontation, we rely above all on our own capabilities. From the first day of the aggression and the embargo, and despite their claims that it would be lifted when the fighting ended or the reason was removed, we did not trust the party who made the decision because it was made for conspiratorial purposes and that party planned to maintain it. We did not await a decision ending the embargo from the same party that imposed it. Yes, today, we are making intensive efforts to build our capabilities and to face the basic dilemmas. The main planner of the embargo wanted to deprive our citizens of fuel, electricity, and water. These are three basic things that would exhaust the resistance of any country in a few months. But in only a few weeks, our capabilities managed to restore fuel, electricity, and water. I do not think that there is a country in our region (and I do not say the world, so that I will not be accused of exaggeration) where the situation of water, electricity, and fuel in terms of price, competence, and power, matches that of Iraq, although those facilities were deliberately attacked by the colonialist alliance. We began and continued to reconstruct everything that was destroyed, not only the projects dealing with water, electricity, and fuel. We can say today that the building of the economic structure is better in Iraq than in any other country in the region. If we compare situations in the region's states with that of besieged Iraq, we will find that Iraq's is much better. Now that we have overcome many problems and dilemmas, our main burden remains food and medicine, which raised inflation greatly. This is frequently natural. We cannot say why inflation in Iraq today is high; we do not know the reason. We cannot say if the reason is a faulty economic structure or the wrong economic development policy. Inflation in Iraq is going up as it is in other Arab countries that are neither in a state of war nor under an unjust blockade; countries that, moreover, claim good relations with the entire world and friendship with the world capitalist countries and the countries that protect and run international funds that provide loans, grants, and aid. Nevertheless, those countries face higher inflation rate than Iraq. We managed to provide better living conditions for the Iraqis. Our current crisis has a time limit that is mainly linked to the promotion of the agricultural sector and the provision of most basic foodstuffs, which play a major role in inflation. At the same time, we have in mind a host of measures and are now implementing them gradually, to prolong the steadfastness of the Iraqis against the American international conspiracy. We trust that the harmful effects of the economic blockade on many countries will start to appear--if they have not already appeared. These countries include Turkey, Russia, France, and many other countries that began to speak about the impact of the blockade on them and about their financial losses as a result of implementing the embargo against Iraq. They are demanding that this embargo be reconsidered. Of course, had the Iraqis not held out and continued building and construction, the impact of the blockade on the entire foreign scene would not have been felt. Stopping the economy and development in Iraq is an extremely serious issue that will negatively affect many countries, not only Iraq. We will overcome the blockade, and by doing so, we will not be merely passing a crisis but embarking on new breakthroughs and progress. [Muhammad] We have seen and sensed many major achievements in the area of construction, but perhaps the most important one is the progress in agricultural development. Why this turn toward agriculture? What kind of facilities have you offered to citizens? Are you facing any obstacles in this field? [Ramadan] As you know, ancient Iraq was called the land of fertility, not only the land of Mesopotamia. This means Iraq is distinguished from many countries. No single inch of Iraq is unfit for agriculture, and as they say, no single inch underground does not contain oil. Iraq is very rich in arable land but there are some problems. Some agricultural areas are highly salty and need reclamation, others need irrigation projects, others need facilities to get water through, and others need unconventional irrigation techniques. But in principle, all Iraqi lands, including the desert area on the Iraqi-Jordanian border, are suitable for agriculture and for the growing of grains in particular. I do not say that the February 1968 revolution was not concerned with the agricultural sector, but practically the revolution did not turn all attention to that sector because of the availability of other resources, especially oil, and the ease with which many foodstuffs could be imported. We admit that we did not push our agricultural sector as strongly as it should have been. One of the most important results of the blockade and of the Mother of all Battles, therefore, was giving top priority to agriculture within the reconstruction process. This is why you now find three major dams being constructed at the same time with Iraqi resources. Despite the blockade, there are a number of large- scale reclamation projects. I tell you that at the best times, when Iraq used to receive billions in revenue, you could not find three dams under construction at the same time. Because there is extensive land reclamation, there are great facilities in the ownership of land. We put no restriction on the ownership of land. Previously, we said that the owner must be a peasant and from the region where the land is located. Now we give land and provide several facilities to any Iraqi citizen, peasant or not, as soon as he shows readiness to work in agriculture. We bear in mind that if the profits of the agricultural sector are not good, people will not be interested. As you know, 90 percent of the effort in the commercial sector is parasitic and nonproductive. Yet, many countries provide facilities for commerce, and you find many people getting into it and lines of brokers appearing. In agricultural and industrial sectors, on the other hand, you find hindrances and obstacles. Therefore, we offered many facilities in buying lands, seeds, machinery, and fertilizers. People were encouraged and responsive, and today we have made major strides in this area. In the next two years, when a number of dams and reclamation projects currently under implementation are completed, Iraq will see a radical and decisive development in the area of agriculture. We will not be satisfied with planting in only the land around the two rivers; we will plant in desert lands, beginning with the oases on the road between al-Anbar and Jordan. We insist on this policy even after the lifting of the unjust blockade; we must achieve self-sufficiency in food, and the agricultural sector must join that of minerals in the field of exports. [Muhammad] Intense and complicated talks have been going on for seven months between Iraq and the UN special committee headed by Rolf Ekeus to look into the economic blockade. These talks seem to be facing numerous difficulties that threaten them with failure. What are the United Nations' real conditions for lifting the blockade on Iraq and what are the difficulties facing Rolf Ekeus' committee? What is your assessment of the UN plan to export Iraqi oil? [Ramadan] Frankly, if the malicious and conspiratorial intentions of the United States, in particular, come to an end, you would find no problem between Iraq and the UN committee. The situation is obvious, and we have complied with the Security Council resolutions although we were disgusted by them. Thus, the blockade and problems should have ended long ago but the Americans' malicious intentions, provoked by Zionism, prevented this from happening. The United States places impediments and obstacles to the committee's work to foil its tasks. We do not look forward to the lifting of the blockade through the resumption of Iraqi oil exports according to the UN-proposed plan, which is another form of blockade against Iraq that causes psychological harm to the citizens. Yes, we want the blockade to be lifted and oil exports to be resumed but only in a manner that does not harm our independence and national sovereignty. We want Iraq to sell and buy without intervention by any power in its affairs. As for the current plan to resume oil exports according to their own way, it is rejected because it constitutes a flagrant intervention in our affairs and sovereignty. [Muhammad] U.S. aircraft have penetrated Iraqi airspace numerous times. What is the truth and aims of these violations? Will the Iraqi response in the future be confined to forwarding memoranda of denunciation to the United Nations and the Security Council as is the case now? [Ramadan] We will examine the situation in the proper time and have a response to them, God willing. These violations provide new evidence and indications for those far and near to know what America exactly wants and whether it sponsors peace or terrorism. We say facts indicate that the United States, which claims to be fighting terrorism, sponsors it everywhere. We assert that the U.S. aircrafts' violation of Iraqi airspace is a violation of Iraq's sovereignty and independence. I wonder, isn't a state that violates the sovereignty of another state a leader and advocate of terrorism? Where is international legitimacy, the Security Council, and the United Nations and why do we not hear their voices? [Muhammad] The situation in northern Iraq is extremely ambiguous. What exactly is happening there and what is your assessment of the situation now after the establishment of a Kurdish government there? [Ramadan] We cannot say that there is a Kurdish state or government in the north. The Iraqi Administration, troops, organizations, and institutions have withdrawn from the north of our own free will. We were certain that the United States and the allies wanted to exhaust Iraq's power and capability for steadfastness, construction, and development by keeping us busy in a war with their agents in the north. They wanted to exhaust our power, so we avoided the trap they set for us. Now the real identity of the Israeli and U.S. agents in the north has become clear to our people there. The presence of these Kurdish agents in the north today depends on the presence of U.S. troops in Turkey, whose mandate there has been renewed for another six months. It is now obvious that the presence of the U.S. troops, better known as the "Hammer," is to protect the Kurdish agents in the north. The day the U.S. troops leave, the ordinary Kurds will kick these agents out of the Iraqi land for good. Let me assure you that what is happening now in the north is not a permanent situation but part of the series of schemes against Iraq. [Muhammad] The foreign media continue to report problems in southern Iraq and in the marshes. What exactly is the situation there? [Ramadan] The situation in the south and the marshes is completely safe. Not only is it normal, it is better than good. I invite you to visit the south to see for yourself. (N.B.) [newspaper-supplied editorial note] I embarked on a journalistic fact-finding mission in southern Iraq for two days, during which I was convinced that things there are normal and calm. [Muhammad] The human rights organizations, especially Amnesty International and the Arab Organization for Human Rights, say that there are executions, arrests, and violations of human rights in Iraq, particularly against the merchants, that the Iraqi leadership is behind. They also note that Iraq is yet to see any radical improvement in the field of public freedom, political pluralism, and real press freedom. What is your comment on this? [Ramadan] These organizations are either agents, implementing suspicious schemes, or ignorant about the facts and the situation in Iraq. Iraq has entered a war with all the conspiratorial countries in the world, and the war is continuing. Up to now, Iraq has not introduced any emergency measures, although it is facing an aggression and an unjust embargo. However, if there are false tears, concern, and fear for the merchants, let me stress to you that we will detain and pass the people's sentence against any merchant who tampers with or hoards the people's food. In the law of God and humanity, he who strips the people of their food must be beheaded. I wonder: What merchants do the human rights groups mean? Shall we give freedom to merchants who tamper with the people's fate and means of livelihood? What do the Arab governments do to merchants who tamper with their peoples' means of sustenance? The Arab governments, which are part of this aggression and the embargo, as well as the unjust merchants are now shedding false tears over the execution of the corrupt merchants. We grant honest merchants major facilities to work honestly, but we pursue whoever tries to starve the people. This is our policy. If this policy runs counter to so-called democracy, then we reject this democracy because we have a responsibility to the people. As for political pluralism, we have issued a law on it and anyone who wants to form a party can come forward. But we want parties that think about what to do for Iraq under its current circumstances; parties that struggle, bear full responsibility, and offer something new, not engage in one-upmanship for power. We issued a law on pluralism before the blockade but no party has come forward; this is due to Iraq's current circumstances. Once the blockade is over, Iraq will witness actual and real implementation of the pluralism law, but now we are in a state of war. [Muhammad] Currently, there is talk that Arab popular movements and organizations are retreating from solidarity with Iraq. What is your comment on this and what is currently required of the Arab popular movements and organizations in the context of their solidarity with Iraq? [Ramadan] The popular movement in the Arab arena is growing enormously today. As for the situation at the official level, it is wavering, at the best of times, and conspiratorial at other times. The official Arab stand is conspiratorial and undoubtedly casts its shadow on the popular situation. Had the official stand toward Iraq not been so, the popular stand would have been different from what it is now and would have demonstrated great and true solidarity with us. We are not mistaken about the Arab citizen's beliefs and convictions toward us, but the official policies hamper his solidarity with us. Hence, we should not accuse the popular political organizations and parties of something that is not their fault and ignore the official stand and its pressure and effects on these organizations and parties. [Muhammad] Our Arab region is experiencing serious and crucial developments--foremost of which is the settlement to liquidate the Palestinian cause--that cause Iraq's crisis not to be placed on the agenda of Arab efforts and moves. How do you assess this situation and the Gaza-Jericho accord? [Ramadan] We have a principled and historical view of the Palestinian issue linked with the tenet of the Socialist Ba'th Party that leads the government and people in Iraq. Iraq's stand is obvious and public; that is to say we will not give an inch of the Palestinian territories. However, Iraq is currently experiencing a historical situation that forces it not to be vociferous about the issue; but this will not change our stand a bit. Giving dialogues and meetings for the capitulatory settlement precedence over Iraq's cause or the blockade is something natural because the "ramshackle" collection of Arab states described as conspiring and wavering are making use of the current phase of the Palestinian cause. I wonder what the Arab countries have done on the blockade on Iraq? We will never forget that the first forum to beat the war drums and declare war on Iraq was the Cairo conference. This conference gave a legitimate cover to the UN Security Council resolutions. We will also not forget that your party was the first that issued a statement denouncing the Cairo conference before the Egyptian and Arab public. It is not strange to see that there is great interest in carrying out the capitulatory political settlement, exploiting for this purpose the current poor Arab circumstances, particularly Iraq's circumstances. If Iraq's circumstances were different, the Arab situation would be very different too. Is it not very strange to find some Arab countries speaking of abolishing the Arab economic boycott of Israel but not saying anything about abolishing the unjust blockade against Iraq? Indeed these countries are demanding that this blockade be tightened. This illustrates the extent of the current deterioration, complacency, and conspiracy in official Arab circles. [Muhammad] What is your opinion of the stance adopted by the Palestinian leadership--the PLO--on the Gaza-Jericho agreement? [Ramadan] I do not believe that there is such a thing as a Palestinian leadership today; not after all that has happened. There is a stance adopted by some individuals who will bear the responsibility for what they are doing. If we think of the PLO as the Palestinian leadership, then we must remember that more than half of the PLO's members are not around anymore. Some have resigned, some have adopted completely different positions. It is clear that the decisions that are being made now are not decisions agreed on during PLO meetings but those made solely by the PLO chairman and some other members who do not represent that organization. We assure everyone that the Gaza-Jericho agreement blocks all the ways to liberate Palestinian land in the future. This agreement contradicts the goals of the Palestinian cause. We find no future promise in all the agreements on Gaza and Jericho. We see in these agreements an end of the Palestinian cause as far as the enemies and the complacent ones who have tired of the struggle are concerned. The Palestinian people, however, will never forget their land and sovereignty. [Muhammad] What are the latest developments on the Iraqi- Iranian scene? Why have the public and covert negotiations between the two countries failed? [Ramadan] We have two unresolved issues with Iran: the POW issue, on which nothing new has happened, and the Iraqi planes in Iran. Intermediaries are trying to work out the second issue but nothing concrete has happened. Unless these two issues are settled, we can have no normal relations with Iran. [Muhammad] Are there any new developments regarding the ties with Egypt? [Ramadan] After we established interest sections here and in Egypt to handle the affairs of our and their citizens, nothing new happened. We welcome Egyptian nationals here and protect their interests and rights.
