FBIS4-59490 "drnes094dd_94016" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Abu-Sharif: Evacuate All Settlers From Territories Abu-Sharif: Evacuate All Settlers From Territories LD1405212894 Algiers ENTV Television Network in Arabic 1900 GMT 14 May 94 LD1405212894 Algiers ENTV Television Network Arabic BFN [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat; place not given; by unidentified studio announcer, in Algiers -- live] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Announcer] We welcome Mr. Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to Yasir 'Arafat . The first question that comes to mind is perhaps how the Palestinian Authority is going to deal with the parties that still oppose the Gaza-Jericho agreement and endeavor to make it fail? [Abu-Sharif] We consider opposition as a healthy manifestation, and opposition has the right to express its opinion as it likes, politically and through the media, but violence is rejected in our political life. We will welcome opinions no matter how different they may be, but we will confront violence. We are convinced that all the opposition, including the HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement] movement, will be committed to our democratic traditions that prohibit the use of violence as a means of resolving differences of views. [Announcer] Some opposition sides consider that this agreement is turning into a simple administration, or something like a self-administration of the population. [Abu-Sharif] The fact is that this is a first step. No one, neither Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, nor the Palestinian leadership have claimed that this is the solution. Not at all. This is the first step on a long road towards our own independent state with holy Jerusalem as capital. [Announcer] As a first step you have agreed to the withdrawal of the Israeli Army, but there remain the settlers naturally, and we know that the al-Khalil [Hebron] massacre was perpetrated by an Israeli settler. [Abu-Sharif] It is natural that we should consider the settlers as part of the occupation machine, and all land on which an Israeli settler is residing is a Palestinian land confiscated in contravention to the international laws, the UN charter and the UN convention. For this reason, we will seek, through negotiations, to secure an agenda for the evacuation of the settlers from our Palestinian land, and no doubt the settlers are the ones who know better about their situation now following the withdrawal of the occupation forces. [passage omitted]. [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, we know that there has always been talk about the liberation of all Palestine. Now, can Palestine be reduced to just Gaza and Jericho? [Abu-Sharif] It can't be, naturally. As far as we are concerned, our aim of setting up an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital means setting up the state on all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. This is a literal application of Resolution 242. Furthermore, I would like to clarify beyond any doubt that the Palestinians will not sign a peace treaty with the Israelis so long as is not comprehensive, that is so long as it does not include Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab lands occupied in 1967, and south Lebanon which was occupied in 1978. [Announcer] And what is the place of Jerusalem to a Palestinian state? [Abu-Sharif] Holy Jerusalem is a capital for an independent Palestine, and we will accept nothing short of an Arab Jerusalem, and there will be no peace without an Arab Jerusalem over which an Arab flag will flutter. [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, what do you expect from Algeria in the struggle for the construction of Palestine now? [Abu-Sharif] Algeria has always been a bastion protecting Palestinians whether right or wrong, and we expect the Algerian people that have always supported us in our military battles and in the struggle to back the Palestinian people now to build its own independent state. [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, thank you for being present at the 2000 bulletin. [Abu-Sharif] Thanks to Algeria, and thank you.
