FR940106-0-00127 FR940106-0-00022 After examining State practices, as affected by the OTCA amendments, the Department has concluded that, as a general rule, the agent State should continue to be responsible for procuring and paying for TAA approved training and related costs, including subsistence and transportation, as appropriate. In addition, the agent State shall assist the liable State in fulfilling its responsibilities for making determinations of entitlement to all TAA program benefits. These changes are reflected in revised §617.26. Another significant change in §617.26 is in making the liable State responsible for all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals pertaining to any worker's eligibility for or entitlement to any TAA program benefit under Part 617. This includes determinations relating to training approval, disapproval, waivers and revocation of waivers for training, and training related costs including subsistence and transportation. This requirement will preclude due process objections which could be raised if workers were required to appeal some issues under the agent State law and other issues under the liable State law. Responsibility for selection and approval of training no longer resides in the agent State, as is provided in the present rule. However, a liable State and an agent State may jointly agree to modify this rule with respect to their TAA administrative functions, but any such change must comply with the legal requirement that all determinations will be under the authority of the liable State, and all appeals by individuals will be under the law of the liable State. Further, prior approval for any such modification must be obtained under §617.54. (See also §§617.33 and 617.44, below.) Additionally, in those situations where two or more States share a common labor market area and workers commute across State lines for work, those States may wish to develop cooperative arrangements, consistent with revised §617.26, and approved under §617.54, to provide TAA ser-vices to adversely affected workers in the area. The definition of ``liable State'' at §617.3(aa) is also revised to conform with changes in §§617.16, 617.26, 617.33 and 617.44, and a definition is added for ``agent State''. (The term ``applicable State,'' which is defined and used in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90, is not used in this final rule. It was decided that the terms ``liable State'' and ``agent State,'' and the definition of ``applicable State law'' in §617.16 were adequate to cover the rules associated with interstate responsibilities without adding a further definition of ``applicable State.'') As revised in this final rule, §617.26 comprehensively addresses the roles and responsibilities of liable States and agent States in interstate cases, clarifies the legal and appellate relationships among the States, and assures due process for workers and conformance with section 239(d) of the Act. With this revision, and other changes in the rules, there is consistency among the regulations in addressing State responsibilities: §617.16 covers applicable State law; §617.20 addresses State responsibilities for the delivery of reemployment services, in general; §617.33 addresses findings required before final payment of a job search allowance is made by the liable State; §617.44 addresses findings required before final payment of a relocation allowance is made by the liable State; and §§617.50 and 617.51 speak to determinations of entitlement, and appeals and hearings under the applicable State law, respectively. A conforming change is made in §617.50(a) by striking the clause ``, or the State agency as provided in §617.26(d),''. M. Revision of §617.33 Section 617.33 prescribes the findings required before final payment of a job search allowance is made to an eligible worker by the liable State. It describes the responsibilities of liable and agent States in regard to those findings. This section is revised to delineate more clearly the responsibilities of liable and agent States for determinations (and appeal rights) regarding job search allowances. N. Revision of §617.44 Section 617.44 prescribes the findings required before final payment of a relocation allowance is made to an eligible worker by the liable State. It describes the responsibilities of liable and agent States in regard to those findings. This section is revised to delineate more clearly the responsibilities of liable and agent States for determinations (and appeal rights) regarding relocation allowances.
