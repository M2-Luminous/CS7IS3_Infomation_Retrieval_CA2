Upon notification, the Administrator will deduct from the person's balance of Article 5 allowances the amount equal to the class I controlled substance exported. (b) A person must submit a notice to the Administrator of exports to Article 5 countries (except transhipments, exports resulting in transformation or destruction, or used controlled substances) at the end of the quarter that includes the following: (1) The identities and addresses of the exporter and the recipient of the exports; (2) The exporter's Employee Identification Number; (3) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the exporter and for the recipient; (4) The quantity and the type of controlled substances exported, its source and date purchased; (5) The date on which, and the port from which, the controlled substances were exported from the United States or its territories; (6) The country to which the controlled substances were exported; (7) A copy of the bill of lading and invoice indicating the net quantity shipped and documenting the sale of the controlled substances to the purchaser; (8) The commodity code of the controlled substance exported; and (9) A copy of the contract covering the sale of the controlled substances to the recipient that contains provisions forbidding the reexport of the controlled substance in bulk form and subjecting the recipient or any transferee of the recipient to liquidated damages equal to the resale price of the controlled substances if they are reexported in bulk form. ยง82.12 Transfers. (a) Inter-company transfers. (1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except for Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for Group VI, any person (``transferor'') may transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any amount of the transferor's consumption allowances or production allowances or Article 5 allowances, as follows: (i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer claim setting forth the following: (A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the transferee; (B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the transferor and the transferee; (C) The type of allowances or authorizations being transferred, including the names of the controlled substances for which allowances are to be transferred; (D) The group of controlled substances to which the allowances or authorizations being transferred pertains; (E) The amount of allowances or authorizations being transferred; (F) The control period(s) for which the allowances or authorizations are being transferred; (G) The amount of unexpended allowances of the type and for the control period being transferred that the transferor holds under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA; and (H) The amount of the one percent offset applied to the unweighted amount traded that will be deducted from the transferor's allowance balance (except for trades from transformers and destroyers to producers or importers for the purpose of allowance reimbursement). (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers and any production, allowable imports and exports of controlled substances reported by the transferor, indicate that the transferor possesses, as of the date the transfer claim is processed, unexpended allowances sufficient to cover the transfer claim (i.e., the amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transferors of production or consumption allowances, one percent of that amount). Within three working days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the Administrator will take action to notify the transferor and transferee as follows: (A) If EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not object to the transfer and will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transfers of production or consumption allowances, one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor and the transferee may proceed with the transfer. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer. (B) If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, or that the transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer. Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, either party may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day. (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to a transfer claim within the three working days specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the transferor and transferee may proceed with the transfer. EPA will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transfers of production or consumption allowances, one percent of that amount. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer. (2) Effective January 1, 1995, any person (``transferor'') may transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any amount of the transferor's Article 5 allowances. The transfer proceeds as follows: (i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer claim setting forth the following: (A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the transferee; (B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the transferor and the transferee; (C) The type of allowances being transferred, including the controlled substances for which allowances are to be transferred; (D) The group of controlled substances to which the allowances being transferred pertains;
