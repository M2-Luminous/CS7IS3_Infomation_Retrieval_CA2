Josef Schwarz, Austrian trade delegate to Budapest, told DIE PRESSE in Vienna that investments there have reached 11.5 billion schillings. Austrian companies have been particularly active as far as the privatization of Hungarian enterprises is concerned. The State Privatization Agency has so far sold 328 major public enterprises for 176.3 billion forints (the equivalent of about 21 billion schillings) to foreigners, of which Austrian investors have bought 96 enterprises for 43.8 billion forints (5.3 billion schillings) -- that is to say about 25 percent. The managing president of the Hungarian Joint Venture Association, Ivan Toldy-Osz, told DIE PRESSE in Sopron that some 18,000 joint ventures and 100 percent subsidiaries by foreign companies have been registered in Hungary.
