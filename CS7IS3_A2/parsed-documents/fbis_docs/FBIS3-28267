Even though the finale is approaching, real progress has yet to be seen in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, which will top the summit's agenda. However, the government is steadily making progress in its strategy to build up the prime minister's image. According to a government authority, THE WASHINGTON POST's Far East bureau chief is considered the likely candidate to whom Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to grant an exclusive interview since the government has judged that "in comparison to the chief of the Tokyo branch of THE NEW YORK TIMES -- THE WASHINGTON POSTS's rival newspaper -- who tends to be critical of Japan in his commentaries, THE WASHINGTON POSTS's Far East bureau chief has a more favorable view of Japan; the fact that he has taught at the Kumamoto University also conjures up a feeling of intimacy." In the United States, public criticism of Japan mounted in the advent of the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II. Michio Watanabe, who was then foreign minister, granted an interview to a THE WASHINGTON POST reporter. Apparently, some quarters of the Foreign Ministry said that this interview helped calm the situation. The government also plans to take the opportunity for Hosokawa to address the American people via the U.S. radio network prior to the summit. In Washington, there are plans for the prime minister to lecture on Japanese policies at Georgetown University and for him to appear on local television, too. Koichiro Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, who will stand in the forefront as chairman of the Japanese negotiating party in the framework trade talks, is scheduled to grant an exclusive interview to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL's Tokyo branch chief. As for news organs which will not be granted exclusive interviews, it is expected that they will be attended to separately by Yukio Sato, chief of the Foreign Ministry's North American Affairs Bureau, and Kazuo Ogura, chief of the ministry's Economics Affairs Bureau. By being selective with reporters, the government's strategy to deal with U.S. mass media is said to be primarily aimed at "providing appropriate information so that accurate commentaries can be drawn from them." Although Prime Minister Hosokawa spoke with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the phone on 31 January, their conversation ended in "rhetorical" exchange, according to officials close to the prime minister. On the surface, preparations for Hosokawa's U.S. visit continues with rough sailing, but, underneath, the government continues working shrewdly on its plans geared toward the U.S. mass media.
