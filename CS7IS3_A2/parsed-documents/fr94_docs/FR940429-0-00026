FR940429-0-00026 FR940429-0-00009 C. Family Impact. The General Counsel of HUD, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, The Family, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will have some significant impact on the maintenance and general well-being of families. The revised CHSP can be expected to provide supportive services which can prevent or postpone unnecessary or premature institutionalization, and reduce unnecessary stress and financial burdens on participants' families by allowing them to remain in their apartments. Because the impact on family concerns is wholly beneficial, no further review under the executive order is considered necessary. D. Federalism Impact. The General Counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as the Designated Official for the Department of Housing and Urban Development under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611_Federalism, has determined that the rule does not involve the preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation and does not have Federalism implications.
