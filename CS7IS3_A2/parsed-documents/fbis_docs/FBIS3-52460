But he must have realised by now that for the Israelis to agree to such an eventuality, and for the world community to bless it, the PLO leader needs to play his cards right, wait for a while and give priority to building Palestinian institutions that would be mature and healthy enough to deliver such a state. In undertaking this major task, Mr. 'Arafat cannot afford to alienate everybody he knows. There are a few toes around, anyway, that he can step on. On the other hand, he has every reason to cultivate the support of especially those who are most ready and willing to help him achieve full rights. Jordan is on top of the list of those countries which not only back the PLO-Israel agreement, but whose national security also depends on the success of the accord. True, Jordan is not yet ready to discuss a confederation with Chairman 'Arafat, simply because such a link can take place only between sovereign states, but there is no question that the Kingdom is fully committed to helping our Palestinian brethren in their quest for realising their legitimate rights, including self-determination and statehood. Jordan, however, has its own interests, which, incidentally or otherwise, in no way clash with Palestinian aspirations fo independence. Furthermore, what the leadership of this country has been asking of the PLO leader is no more than what Mr. 'Arafat himself has been demanding of other Arabs, namely coordination and cooperation on vital issues. It was the Palestinians who insisted right from the beginning of the Madrid talks in the fall of 1991 on full coordination among the Arab parties to the peace process: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians. As a result of its secret agreement with Israel the PLO managed to alienate Syria and, by extension, Lebanon. Jordan, as the PLO is fully aware, has not taken such a position. To the contrary, it has forgiven Mr. 'Arafat for reaching a separate deal with Israel, and His Majesty the King went as far as congratulating the PLO leader on his courage in reaching the Oslo accords. But while Mr. 'Arafat might understandably be occupied with everything under the sun, he must remember that the mind of the Jordanian leadership is set on guarding the real interests of an Arab state, whose wellbeing is of vital interest to the cause of Palestine. Whatever agreement the Palestinians reach or fail to reach with the Israelis is going to have its consequences on Jordan. Therefore, coordination among the two parties is not a luxury, it is a necessity. The Palestinian leadership certainly realises that it has a stake in a strong Jordan both during the transitional period and afterwards. And that is why the arrival here this week of a delegation to start real coordination should be such a welcome change.
