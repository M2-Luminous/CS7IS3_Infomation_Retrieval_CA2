The revisions and additions read as follows: §1.382&hyph;2T Definition of ownership change under section 382, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (temporary). (a) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (i) Testing dates prior to November 5, 1992. *␣*␣* (B) *␣*␣* See paragraph (m)(4)(vii) of this section for special rules regarding the effective date of the provisions of this paragraph (a)(2)(i). * * * * * (f) *␣*␣* (18) *␣*␣* (iii) Treating interests not constituting stock as stock. *␣*␣* See §1.382&hyph;4(d)(12) for rules that apply with respect to options and this paragraph (f)(18)(iii). * * * * * (h) *␣*␣* (4) *␣*␣* (xiii) Effective date. See paragraph (m)(4)(vi) of this section for special rules regarding the effective date of the provisions of this paragraph (h)(4). * * * * * (m) *␣*␣* (4) *␣*␣* (vi) Rules provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section. The rules provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section do not apply on any testing date on or after November 5, 1992. The rule provided in paragraph (h)(4)(viii) of this section applies to the lapse or forfeiture of any option treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section. If an option is treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, and the option is actually exercised on a day that is within 120 days after the date on which the option is treated as exercised, the rule provided in paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(B) of this section applies (even if the actual exercise of the option occurs on a date on which the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section would not otherwise apply). Thus, in such a case, the loss corporation may elect to treat paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (vi)(A) of this section as not applying to the option and take into account only the acquisition of loss corporation stock resulting from the actual exercise of the option. (vii) Rules provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The rules provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section apply to determine whether dates prior to November 5, 1992, are testing dates. For rules regarding the determination of whether dates on or after November 5, 1992, are testing dates, see §1.382&hyph;2(a)(4). * * * * * Par. 5. Section 1.382&hyph;4 is revised to read as follows: §1.382&hyph;4 Constructive ownership of stock. (a) In general. [Reserved] (b) Attribution from corporations, partnerships, estates and trusts. [Reserved] (c) Attribution to corporations, partnerships, estates and trusts. [Reserved] (d) Treatment of options as exercised _(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an option is not treated as exercised under section 382(l)(3)(A). (2) Options treated as exercised _(i) Issuance or transfer. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs, an option is treated as exercised on the date of its issuance or transfer if, on that date, the option satisfies_ (A) The ownership test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, (B) The control test of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or (C) The income test of paragraph (d)(5) of this section. (ii) Subsequent testing dates. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, an option that is treated as exercised on the date of its issuance or transfer is treated as exercised on any subsequent testing date (as defined in §1.382&hyph;2(a)(4)) for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs. (3) The ownership test. An option satisfies the ownership test if a principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option (alone or in combination with other arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the loss corporation by providing the holder of the option, prior to its exercise or transfer, with a substantial portion of the attributes of ownership of the underlying stock.
