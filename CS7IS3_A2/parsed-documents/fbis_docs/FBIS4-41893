This was the conclusion of Ramazan Abdulatipov, who recently visited the northern Caucasus. The deputy chairman of the Federation Council regards the main success of his mission as the agreement signed in Beslan by the presidents of Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia on the procedure for returning refugees and settling them in four villages of Prigorodnyy rayon. It was there, two years ago, that the Ossetian-Ingush conflict broke out, which resulted in the death of over 300 people and in about 800 people becoming refugees. In practice, Ruslan Aushev and Akhsarbek Galazov guaranteed the safe return of the civilian population to Prigorodnyy rayon and their living as close communities in the villages of Chermen, Dachnoye, Dongaron, and Kurtat. Abdulatipov said that the main problem now is the lack of funds to build houses to replace those burned down. For example, the republic has only received 800 million of the 90 billion roubles of capital investment planned for Ingushetia. In order to extricate the rayon from the condition it has been in since the war, there needs, at least, to be a clear policy on the Caucasus which, unfortunately, is lacking at the moment. [Abdulatipov] Policy itself, including and particularly policy on the Caucasus, must be able to be assessed and implemented stage by stage. Otherwise, we could go on for a hundred years talking about this.
