Next, Zhejiang will, in accordance with the requirements set by the party Central Committee and the State Council, open wider to the outside world, deepen the reform, and optimize the economic structure, raise the quality of economic growth to ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of its economy. The news center of the "two sessions" held a news conference this morning and invited Zhejiang Governor Wan Xueyuan, Ningbo City Mayor Xu Yunhong, Hangzhou City Mayor Wang Yongming, and Wenzhou City Mayor Chen Wenxian to meet with Chinese and foreign reporters. In response to a reporter's question on what Zhejiang has done or will do in the area of building and cultivating a socialist market system, Wang Xueyuan replied, saying: Zhejiang started the reform of the market structure early, and it has developed its own characteristics in the process of developing a market economic structure. First, Zhejiang has been known as a "large market province" because of its early effort to cultivate markets. There are now over 4,300 markets of various types in the province, 107 of which can handle over 100 million yuan each. Markets for capital, labor, technology, real estate, and other basic means of products are being developed rapidly. At present, the role and scope of the market mechanism have expanded considerably in the operation of Zhejiang's economy. A profound change has taken place in the government's functions and methods of organizing the economy, and mandatory plans under the jurisdiction of the province have all been abolished. Wan Xueyuan said: The development of markets has promoted Zhejiang's economic development. This year, Zhejiang will strive to improve all types of services and accelerate the establishment of markets for the basic means of production, especially financial, technological, and labor markets. At the same time, in close conjunction with the state's major reform measures, the province will improve macroeconomic regulation and control, deepen enterprise reform, and step up the building of a system of social security. Through a few years of efforts, we will strive to initially build a modern enterprise system, a distribution system, a social security system, and a macroeconomic control system meeting the requirements of a market economy, thereby forming an open and integrated market system. In response to a question on whether the tax reform of this year will affect the town and village enterprises, Wan Xueyuan said: Zhejiang's town and village enterprises have developed rapidly in the past few years. Their output value has accounted for 60 percent of the province's total industrial output value. In the process of deepening the reform, town and village enterprises are faced with many challenges -- challenges from state-owned enterprises whose strength has been enhanced through the transformation of operating mechanisms and challenges from the private sector. With the introduction of the new tax system, the abolition of preferential policies on tax reductions and exemptions followed. This, in fact, has increased the tax burden on some town and village enterprises. But this should be viewed from another angle -- town and village enterprises have formed a flexible mechanism whereby they are responsible for their own decisions regarding management, for their own profits and losses, and for their own development and reform. Improvements and pressures, as well as the pressure of market competition, brought about by reform will prod the processing industries into readjusting the investment structure, the production setup, and the product mix. Therefore, we can say there are both difficulties and opportunities, but opportunities and hopes outstrip difficulties. Hangzhou Mayor Wang Yongming, Ningbo Mayor Xu Yunhong, and Wenzhou Mayor Chen Wenxian also answered reporters' questions.
