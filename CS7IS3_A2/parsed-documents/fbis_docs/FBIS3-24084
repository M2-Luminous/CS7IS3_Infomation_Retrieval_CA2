As we were told in the press center of the FCS's city administration, the detained are suspected of committing a premeditated murder and, according to the city procuracy data, of other crimes as well. Criminal proceedings have been initiated, and the necessary investigation conducted. It appears that the detained will be formally charged in the nearest future. P.S. The Great Russia electoral coalition is waiting to see how events develop. This was announced by the bloc's coordinator, Leonid Isakov. He hopes that it has all been a mistake and that Nikolay Bondarik will soon be free to go. At the same time, the bloc coordinator pointed out that Mr. Bondarik's arrest affects first and foremost the Russian Party rather than the Great Russia bloc. He also expressed hope that accusations against Bondarik are not related to Great Russia's political positions. In the opinion of representatives of the city electoral commission, the fact of detention and initiation of criminal proceedings cannot serve as grounds for barring Bondarik from going on the ballot for a deputy seat in the City Assembly.
