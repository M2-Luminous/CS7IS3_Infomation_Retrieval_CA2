The nine-member group is composed of eight deputies from the former HSDMS and one deputy (Jiri Drapela) who joined the group after leaving the group of the Liberal Social Union (LSU). The change in the group's name followed the transformation of the HSDMS into the CMSS in January 1994. The party electoral program remains valid, but the group will try to work out a detailed strategy in some points, including unemployment and housing policy, which the group's members want to view as national problems, one of the group's deputies, Rudolf Opatril, told CTK. There are 12 groups in the 200-seat Czech Parliament: The groups of the government coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), and the opposition groups of the Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC), the CMSS, the Self-Governing Democracy Movement-Society for Moravia and Silesia (HSD-SMS), the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), the Left Bloc (LB), and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM). Deputy Josef Jezek, who left the ODS in January, is the single deputy in the house, who is not a member of any party. Immediately after the last elections in June 1992, there were nine groups in the parliament. Most changes have affected the groups of non-government parties.
