It looks like the two countries will formally sign an agreement on aid in the dismantling of nuclear weapons during President Yeltsin's visit to Japan on 11 October, and a committee geared toward implementing the aid plan will be started in Tokyo. Furthermore, cooperation in surveying the problem of radioactive waste dumping into the ocean and other such support will continue to steadily expand to Russia. While proceeding with territorial negotiations, it is essential that the Japanese government, which takes the route of "expanded equilibrium" as the basis of its dealings with Russia, makes an expression of aid to Russia and implements that without any problems. Given that Japan has no experience in the area of nuclear abolition aid, there is increasing concern about the success or failure of such an effort. The agreement for aid in abolishing nuclear weapons that President Yeltsin will sign when he comes to Japan is a part of the voluntary aid to Russia that the government announced at the G7 meeting in Tokyo last April. On this occasion, Japan is declaring that it will provide about $100 million in gratuitous funding to four former-Soviet nations that posses nuclear weapons--Russia, Ukraine, Byelarus, and Kazakhstan--and is negotiating separate agreements with the four countries. Russia will be the first to receive this bilateral aid. Japan's aid to Russia in the dismantling of nuclear weapons comes later than other countries such as the U.S. and France, which are already proceeding with bilaterally based assistance. The prospect is for the aid plan to be implemented within the year under a committee jointly created by Japan and Russia. The main areas in which Japan will provide aid are the construction of storage facilities for storing and managing plutonium and other nuclear substances resulting from the dismantling of nuclear weapons, the elimination of radioactive pollution around nuclear facilities, and assistance in medical treatment for radiation injuries. Japan will also send experts to Russia for technical guidance and will provide needed equipment such as radioactivity detectors. Japan's policy is not to participate in the actual dismantling of nuclear weapons because that would contradict the "triple nonnuclear principle." Although the areas of assistance are limited, the government's standpoint, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) source, is that "there is the way to make the most of Japan's unique character, because Japan is second to none when it comes to technology and research on the safe management and peaceful utilization of nuclear substances." A nonnuclear country, Japan's promotion of other countries' peaceful use of nuclear materials "is significant in that it appeals to a position of contributing to the world's peace and nuclear nonproliferation." Furthermore, Japan's technical and financial assistance in the construction of nuclear storage facilities will also contribute greatly toward halting Russia's dumping of radioactive waste into the sea. Japan fears the marine pollution and the effects on marine life due to the former Soviet Union's and Russia's dumping of radioactive waste into the sea. Although Japan wants an immediate stop put to the dumping of liquid waste, Russia cannot comply with the request because of its lack of preparedness, such as poorly equipped storage facilities. Because of that, too, the need to speed up the aid is indicated. Given such a background, both the Japanese and Russian governments agree that the aid plan should be implemented soon. At first, the two governments were expecting that the agreement would be signed in June. That slipped more than three months because of the confrontation between the Russian government and parliament. The fact is that negotiations between the two countries were stifled because the Russian parliament showed disaproval in response to Japan's request to include in the agreement the removal of tariffs on aid goods. Nevertheless, an MFA source says that "the prospects for signing the agreement look much better" because of Yelstin's bold action in dissolving the parliament on 21 September. But, even if the agreement is signed, there is still a long road to implementation. "First, we ascertain what sort of support can Japan provide that will not overlap with the other countries already aiding Russia, and what sort of support does Russia want. Everything will go from there," says an MFA source. There are high hurdles to overcome before an outline of the implementation is created, people are selected to carry it out, and goods are sent. Another thing that causes great concern is the situation within Russia. The aid is largely premised on the progress of Yeltsin's political and economic reforms, but, with the recent bloody incident, the aid's good cause was damaged, and some expect the brakes will be applied to the implementation of the aid. An MFA spokesman says that he "would like to move into implementing" the $100 million in voluntary aid that was decided in a supplementary budget last June "in some form or another, within the fiscal year." However, apparently that will be affected by the political trends within Russia.
