The speaker described the "absence of factionalism and party divisions in the chamber" as one of the reasons for the deputies' rapid and efficient work. "We don't care where the proposal comes from, as long as it is practical," he explained. Vladimir Shumeyko announced that the president's message to the Federal Assembly will be examined at the next plenary session, which opens on 15 March. But the deputies have already discussed certain problems that directly relate to or develop the appeal. Boris Yeltsin said that the time has come for the government and legislators to determine the priorities in the state, the chamber head pointed out. He regards the fight against crime as one of these priorities. The deputies adopted a decree on measures to strengthen the fight against crime in the Russian Federation. Having said that the strengthening of law and order is one of the main means of strengthening the Russian state, that is precisely what the president's message is called, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed. The deputies agreed that the establishment of order in the country is more important at the moment even than economic reform. They based their thinking on the fact that this "comprehensive and all-embracing problem starts with the question of power." The parliamentarian believes that it is necessary above all to create a strong vertical power system, from top to bottom, so that adopted decisions can be monitored and everyone can be compelled to implement them. The state is obliged to ensure the implementation of the imperative constitutional demand -- protection of human rights, above all the right to life, Vladimir Shumeyko believes. According to him, the fight against crime also involves question of economic reform. In the transitional period, when the old has been destroyed but the new has not yet been created, one must be very careful to ensure that certain legal norms do not become the object of expansion of criminal activity. The problem of borders comes into this category, the speaker said. It is the Federation Council's job to tackle it. Undetermined borders enable every Tom, Dick, and Harry to enter the territory of the Russian Federation, carrying all manner of things -- weapons, drugs. The question of introducing a state of emergency is also the upper chamber's prerogative, its head pointed out. A great many weapons have accumulated in trouble spots, which also leads to an increase in crime. Vladimir Shumeyko does not rule out the possibility that as a result of parliamentary hearings on measures to strengthen the fight against crime the chamber will suggest to the president that he introduce states of emergency in some areas of Russia in order to be able to seize the weapons that have accumulated there. Concerning the chamber's forms of work, Vladimir Shumeyko noted that its work should be strengthened via the committees. Following the repairs to the Federation Council building the committees now have conditions for more vigorous and successful activity, he believes. In the two weeks that remain before the next session committees are instructed, in particular, to examine and discuss the plan for drafting laws. The committees will do this in accordance with the president's message, which is on the agenda for discussion at the fourth plenary session of the Federation Council. Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that parliamentarians must not only express their views on the message, but also weave its provisions into their work plans. He stressed that Boris Yeltsin's message "can be regarded as the first program we have had since 1991 for the development of a great state." The laws designed to develop and strengthen this program "must be of that standard," the Federation Council chairman concluded.
