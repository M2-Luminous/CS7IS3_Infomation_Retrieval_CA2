FR940419-0-00042 FR940419-0-00017 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 20, 22, 24, 80, 90, 99 [GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252; FCC 94&hyph;31] Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act Regarding Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule making proceeding adopts rules to implement sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act), as amended by section 6000(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). The new rules adopted: interpret the elements that define the terms ``commercial mobile radio service (CMRS)'' and ``private mobile radio service (PMRS);'' based on these definitions, determine the regulatory status of existing mobile services and of personal communications services (PCS); address the degree to which those services that will be classified as CMRS will be subject to regulation under Title II of the Act; and address the other issues, including interconnection rights and preemption of state regulatory authority over mobile service providers. The Commission's action furthers the congressional objectives of ensuring that similar services are subject to consistent regulatory classification and that appropriate levels of regulation be established for CMRS providers. The Commission's action establishes a symmetrical regulatory structure that will promote competition in the mobile services marketplace and will serve the interests of consumers while also benefiting the national economy. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 18, 1994.
