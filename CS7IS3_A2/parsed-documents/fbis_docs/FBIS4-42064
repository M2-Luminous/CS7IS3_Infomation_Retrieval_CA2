That should help to overcome the bureaucratic obstacles within the Union. Rexrodt wants to use a team of independent experts, composed of scientists, businessmen, and lawyers, to examine these issues. They should check EU provisions to establish whether companies and consumers are being burdened with unnecessary costs. The minister did, however, say that the subject was "dynamite in Europe" and would be rejected by Jacques Delors, the EU president. Rexrodt talked about the main tasks that he envisaged when Germany takes over the EU presidency on 1 July. Those tasks included overcoming unemployment and strengthening competition. An unemployment figure of over 17 million in Europe sounds an alarm bell in Europe, said Rexrodt in Bonn. Fortunately, economic recovery had started in many EU member states. This positive development has to be secured and developed. The European Council action program for growth, competitiveness, and employment can provide a basis for this. It seemed to be particularly important to Rexrodt to oversee the implementation of this plan. It would be sensible for the European states to report to the Council of Minister on successes and failures. In individual laender -- while considering the specific situation in each of them -- the issue is one of consolidating public budgets, developing labor market policy instruments, and reducing bureaucracy. Next year, the European Commission is to expand the number of its members from the current 17 to 21. Rexrodt also said it is important to liberalize the European electricity and gas markets: When that happens, competitive distortions between member states will have to be eliminated. In the case of energy production, companies should experience a healthy degree of competition. In this respect, an EU guideline is necessary, one that would increase the possibilities for transferring gas and electricity through foreign networks and would result in the disappearance of the current demarcation agreements. There are substantial differences on this issue within Germany. Thus, municipal authorities want to retain their rights to issue exclusive permits for the supply of energy. The Environment Ministry feels that it has been disregarded by the Economics Ministry, because Rexrodt's ministry has not accorded sufficient attention to environmental considerations and because coordination between the ministries does not function. Further, Rexrodt thinks it is necessary to create clear-cut prospects for Central and East European states. In this respect, Germany has a particular duty. Thus, the negotiations on the free trade agreements with the Baltic states should be concluded during the German presidency. The Commission could then shortly present the draft of a mandate for the conclusion of an agreement with those states. As far as the applications for membership submitted by Poland and Hungary are concerned, membership negotiations are conceivable only when the situation in those countries would permit that. In the meantime, the European Union will have to develop its policy of opening up markets by dismantling tariffs and other restrictions. Rexrodt does not consider the ideas that he has outlined to be "a list of wishes," but sees there being good prospects of real progress in the areas in question.
