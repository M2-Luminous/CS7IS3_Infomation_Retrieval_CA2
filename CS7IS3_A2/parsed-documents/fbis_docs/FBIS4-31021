FBIS4-31021 "dreeu106__a94033" FBIS-EEU-94-106-A Daily Report 31 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia SNS: Gyula Horn's Statements `Inadmissible' SNS: Gyula Horn's Statements `Inadmissible' AU0106110594 Prague CTK in English 1635 GMT 31 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0106110594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 31 (CTK) -- The Slovak National Party (SNS) said today the statements by Gyula Horn, leader of the Hungarian Socialists who won the parliamentary elections, about chances to settle Slovak-Hungarian relations and to conclude a basic interstate treaty were inadmissible. The statement said that Horn's statement that Hungary would seek the renovation of friendly relations with Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia in exchange for guarantees for the rights of the three million ethnic Hungarians living there were dangerous for Slovakia and can be considered intervention in its internal affairs. Now in the opposition, the SNS was a coalition partner of Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) until mid-March when the coalition government was dismissed. The SNS has 9 out of a total of 150 seats in parliament. "It is unacceptable for Slovakia that Hungarian politicians demand administrative autonomy for their ethnic minority," the statement stressed in reaction to Horn's words that he was going to satisfy Bratislava's demand for the confirmation of the existing border only at the cost of "autonomous rights" for minorities. Slovakia has been pushing for the confirmation of the border which was determined after World War One and which has been doubted recently by certain forces in Hungary. Some 560,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, mainly in the south, constituting about 11 per cent of its population. The SNS pointed to the status of ethnic minorities in Hungary which "cannot have their own political party and representation in the parliament." Two ethnic Hungarians's political entities are represented in the Slovak Parliament: the Egyutteles movement (9 parliamentary seats) and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH, 5 seats). The statement said that Hungarian-Slovak relations which have been tense over ethnic minorities would probably become even "more stormy" following the victory of Horn's Socialists in Hungary.
