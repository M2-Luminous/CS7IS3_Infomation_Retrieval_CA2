The president also decided to change the provisional measure into a bill. This decision has aggravated the impasse caused by the strike, which has particularly impaired the amendment of the 1994 budget bill and the investigation of corruption charges in various public bodies. Another consequence of the impasse is that without the budget, newly designated Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero will be unable to create the new currency, the real. During a tense meeting with representatives of the public servants on 30 March, Franco said he recognized the employees' right to strike, but he warned that if the strike continues the government will adopt the "appropriate measures" to design the budget. In retaliation, unions will not hold meetings to decide on the government proposal until 6 or 7 April, thus delaying an eventual return to work even more. Squandering Finance and control analysts and budget technicians, all of them high-ranking officials, earned salaries ranging from $460 to $827 in February. With the new increase, the largest salary will stand at $1,600 this year and $2,300 in 1995. In an attempt to convince Franco of the importance of restructuring the Internal Control Secretariat -- a process also known as Cisetao -- the civil servants delivered a dossier charging that the government squandered $47.4 billion over the past six years because of lack of controls and misuse of public funds. Cardoso's position during the meeting, at which Canhim recalled that 13 other public servant categories are striving for improved salaries, showed that he, Cardoso, backed down on the position he had upheld so far. The provisional measure was drawn up by members of his team who estimated that increasing salaries for those civil servants will cost the Treasury approximately $50 million in 1994. In justifying the provisional measure's text, Cardoso himself admitted that Cisetao is an important supplemental measure for the economic plan since it will again give the government the possibility of controlling public spending and fighting corruption.
