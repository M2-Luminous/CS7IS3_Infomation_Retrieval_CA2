Rich refugees and local "businessmen" drown their shady profiteer dealings in whiskey. The watchman at a parking lot in downtown Belgrade, a refugee from Gorazde, loudly interprets the Serb right to the city that was once 70 percent Muslim, complains that he was not permitted to sing Serb songs there (Tito forbade it) and that he sacrificed great wealth for that. Now he is annoyed at the people of Serbia, who are only looking out for their own. He says that he lived only for a Greater Serbia, but now people look at his wife and children askance when they pick up their refugee packet. The people of Serbia do not know what true Serbhood is. At that, a master electrician rushes out of the lobby. "You are still crying for Tito. How is it that I sang Serb songs and because of that slaved to make an honest living? And you could have but did not want to. And I assume that you earned your wealth honestly, with your own two hands? There are bombs falling on your city while you pontificate to me. What kind of people are these?" the man from Sumadija says, throwing up his hands. "They prefer Greater Serbia and Belgrade to their own Bosnia and their own neighbors." The tense atmosphere on the street, on a day when bombs were falling on Gorazde, is simply a reflection of the cold war being waged by newcomers and old-timers, two afflicted and divided worlds. People from the war zones have brought to ethnically indifferent Belgrade the dream of a Greater Serbia and of ethnic purity, while to the people of Belgrade their Serbhood seems a bit clumsy and silly. The fabric of wartime Belgrade is being eaten away by different dialects, customs, economic expectations, patriotism, and cash-based patriotism. In the Hands of New "Owners" The old Belgrade is no more. The new, xenophobic one throws a Molotov cocktail at the Committee for Refugees, beats up street cleaners who do not have Serb surnames. Instead of bohemians, there are "skinheads," newly formed bullies, cruising around the city. In the morning, this sort of warning appears on the door of a building: "Do not tempt your fate. They can beat you up because they find you at home, they can rape your wife, mistreat your children--if you do not lock your front door." Belgrade at night is irresistibly reminiscent of Casablanca, a big waiting room where very rich refugees and local "businessmen" drown their shady profiteer dealings in whiskey. The new owners of the city, arriving from the battlefield, have little in common with Bogart. Belgradians who managed to survive the communist invasion in 1945 and the decades of influx from rural areas bristle at this "new class" that is feeding the animosity toward all newcomers. Luxury cars (with registration from the war zone), Rolex watches, mistresses in white fox coats--these are status symbols of the "foreign element" in the heart of Belgrade. Special shops, chains of coffee shops, bought-out boutiques, money spent mercilessly--this is the smell of the new Belgrade. At the nighttime bar "Princ," four "businessmen" run up a bill of 800 German marks [DM] in one night. A tip of only DM200 for the waiter. The "Hyatt" or "Plavi Jahac" are cult locations. Nightclubs are split into those where drinking is "fear-based" and where patrons buy on informal "credit" payable every month. At "Promocija," a waiter who tries to collect a bill gets a pistol held to his head, and the bill is not paid. The outline of a pistol inside a jacket serves as a sign to the waiter at "Princ" that he should not approach that table. Young policemen drink free of charge, which is how the owners pay for their protection. Everyday patrons drink on credit and pay at the end of the month. The war has given the city a Colombian air. According to lawyer Rajko Danilovic, an old Belgradian, it all began back before the war, when hand-picked criminals were doing the political police's dirty liquidator work abroad. When the war began, they offered their services to the regime and pillaged the battlefields under the guise of patriotism. Now they are seriously counting on recognition and a "reward for service." "Some of them continue to lay waste to the war zone, while others are involved in the trade in arms or fuel, together with the `white collars' and wealthy refugees. With the state's consent, a new establishment is being born with foreign exchange and contacts with commercial banks. The dominant role in this symbiosis is played by newcomers who are `coping'; without them, there is no `business' in Bosnia. Thus, they are a sort of lobby, dazzling their fellow citizens with symbols of success. Belgradians are not easily impressed." Citizens and City-Haters "Plavi Jahac" brings together "young Bosnia." The same guests come every day, each spending DM100 daily. The people here are Karadzic's children, snipers from Sarajevo, smugglers of alcohol and cigarettes, but also cosmopolitan Bosnian youth. Natasa Markovic, a journalist and the owner of "Plavi Jahac," longs for the old Belgrade and refuses to believe that the "occupation" will last. ``Belgradians have closed themselves off in their apartments and in privacy, while nationalistic madmen and city-haters roam the heart of the city. This is most of all a war of civilization. I am frightened of the city-haters. I was sitting in `Plavi Jahac' with one of the well-known TV editors from Pale when I was `promised' that in a few years Sarajevo would be an `ecological city'--a cornfield. Now I know for sure--that is the dream of the city-haters. I know that they would do the same thing to Belgrade if they could. I am torn when I look at the young people in the bar, with their roots severed, but I also get mad when they say that they have `given everything for the Serb cause' and that they are our `liberators.' Zora Cavic-Ilic, a translator and member of a diplomatic family from precommunist Belgrade, comments with agitation: ``No one is happy. Only those who are naive, like children. Those who caused this war should have foreseen the animosity. We, the old Belgradians, live closed off, attentively following what is happening from a distance. That is also how we reacted to the Germans and to the Partisan `liberators.' We maintained our integrity. We have learned to survive and, like dolphins, to pass our experience on to our children through our genes. But the squalor enters every pore. It is in the air, our language is contaminated by it, there is horrible cursing, and people talk as if they are shouting from two hills. TV offers mediocrity and vulgarity as the universally applicable style, impudently imposing ignorance and vulgarity. And things could get worse. "But," he warns, "a certain obstinacy has been awakened in me, an obstinacy to preserve myself like a rare animal. I will not accept a city of dirty cars, dirty shoes, and greasy hair." Walking on the same street with the old Belgradians is Rosa E., a 50-year-old refugee from Sarajevo. A prominent high school teacher, she lives in an attic with her son, cleans other people's apartments, and when people scowl at her on the bus because of her different dialect she closes her eyes and the past returns: world travel, a weekend place on Korcula, two luxurious apartments in Sarajevo, crystal, and furs. Everything has been lost for good. She says that she will nevertheless return to Grbavica, to a vacated Muslim apartment. Here she has no roots. An 80-year-old woman from Sarajevo, a former editor of PROSVETA who barely survived the first wartime winter in Bosnia, understands and loves Belgrade, and talks about Karadzic and Mladic as war criminals, as the biggest enemies of the Serb nation. At the other refugee extreme, a 20-year-old disabled veteran from Brcko, with one leg missing, is embittered toward the opposition, Vuk Draskovic, and the peace movement. And also toward the Serbians, the degenerates of the Serb tribe. Enthusiastically he says: "After the war in Bosnia is over, we will come here; someone must teach you what Serbhood and Orthodoxy are." "I had thought that the invasion of Belgrade was over, but we are experiencing it all anew," summarizes Rajko Danilovic. "The ones in 1945 acted like victors, with a right to city life, our property, and pretty Belgrade women. The new ones do not resemble the old ones, because they are experiencing defeat instead of victory. They bear the stamp of guilt." What will tomorrow bring? According to one poll conducted in Belgrade, 70 percent of those questioned feel that the coming year will be better, because it cannot be any worse. Predrag Simic, director of the Institute for International Policy and Economics, said this to THE NEW YORK TIMES: "Serbs in Serbia no longer regard Bosnian Serbs as victims. How can you sympathize with people like General Mladic and others? They are people who should be pitied. We increasingly regard them as people who are dragging us into misfortune. Antiwar sentiment has gained a great deal of strength here." However, pessimists expect only more misfortune once the war is over and accounts are settled. In their opinion, some disoriented people will return, but also arriving in the "waiting room" will be new people from impoverished Knin or "liberated" Zvornik. It is believed that Belgrade will never rid itself of criminals and profiteers. In the future, they will become influential and respected citizens of Belgrade, industrialists or politicians with clear positions in the establishment. They will decide the fate of the meek citizens who do not have pagers and revolvers.
