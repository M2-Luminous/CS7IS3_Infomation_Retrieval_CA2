The ratification of the agreement, which was concluded in 1988, cannot be approved "because of the continuing human rights violations" in Iran and because of the fact that the death threat against author Salman Rushdie has not been retracted. Because of Germany's federal system, the ratification of cultural agreements requires the approval of the laender. At the conference, the latest arrangements between the Foreign Ministry and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'izi during his visit at the end of February in Bonn were also criticized. During this visit, it was agreed, among other things, to establish an institute to promote the German language in Tehran and to resume the work of the German Archaeological Institute. The laender learned about these agreements only from the media, it was stated. "In view of the acts of cultural barbarism in Iran, which are supported by the Iranian Government," official cultural relations between the FRG and Iran are, in the view of the culture ministers, "also undesirable below the level of a cultural agreement," Bremen's Culture Senator Helga Truepel (Greens) said.
