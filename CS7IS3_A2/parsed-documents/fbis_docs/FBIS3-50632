We begin our journey to Ocosingo. Some EZLN [Zapatista Army of National Liberation] roadblocks have been erected several kms from the 31st Military Zone garrison in Rio Nuevo, Chiapas. A number of the rebels are very young, even children. It is not enough to see, however. The question we ask this captain, naturally unidentified, deals with his remark that he thinks the Armed Forces are bourgeoisie. His answer is ideological. He says Mexico should have a socialist system. We will have to ask him why, considering that this system has not worked in other countries. But the EZLN refuses to talk with the government or a mediator. Moving over to the following roadblocks, we observe the rebels and their activities more closely. At mess time they have stale biscuits dipped in coffee, as well as hardened tortillas. We also observe some rebels in formation and others in a combat crouch. This is the situation. Las Margaritas municipality has been peacefully vacated by the rebels. In Ocosingo, the give and take continues. According to the latest reports, the self-styled EZLN is about to overpowered. The rebels have sustained 27 casualties. But they continue to hold Altamirano. Huitzlan fared better. Guerrillas started to leave beginning at 1400 local time. Clashes took place in Rancho Nuevo in the afternoon. On Monday, LA JORNADA newsman Ismael Romero was shot three times in the left shoulder while on his way to Las Margaritas and Ocosingo.
