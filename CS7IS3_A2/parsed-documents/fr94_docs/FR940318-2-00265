FR940318-2-00265 FR940318-2-00132 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 93&hyph;83; Notice 2] Thomas Built Buses, Inc.; Disposition of Petition For Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance Thomas Built Buses, Inc. (Thomas) of High Point, North Carolina determined that some of its buses failed to comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 571.131, ``School Bus Pedestrian Safety Devices,'' Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 131, and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Thomas also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. Notice of receipt of the petition was published on November 15, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 60240). Paragraph S5.5 of FMVSS No. 131 requires that: [T]he stop signal arm shall be automatically extended. *␣*␣* at a minimum whenever the red signal lamps *␣*␣* are activated; except that a device may be installed that prevents the automatic extension of a stop signal arm *␣*␣*. While the device is activated, a continuous or intermittent signal audible to the driver shall sound. Between September 2, 1992, and July 30, 1993, Thomas produced 305 Type A, B, C, and D school buses which were not equipped with a continuous or intermittent signal audible to the driver when the device is activated that prevents the automatic extension of a stop signal. Thus, these school buses do not comply with the standard. Thomas supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: Delivery of the noncomplying vehicles has been limited to one state, Virginia. That state has had a stop arm requirement since the early 1980's and has required an interrupt switch, wired to the stop arm and crossing gate, since approximately 1986. Drivers use that switch only when the vehicle is loading or unloading passengers in the school yard so that buses can be positioned close together without damaging the crossing gate (emphasis original). Bus drivers in Virginia have been accustomed to activating the interrupt switch without an audible signal since the signal was not required prior to the September 2, 1992 (sic) effective date of FMVSS 131. However, Thomas stated in its Defect and Noncompliance Report that: All vehicles will be repaired through customer notification by the Thomas distributor in Virginia. Repair parts will be supplied at no charge. The repair will consist of installing a chime, adding a wire to the existing wire harness, and connecting the wire to the chime. No comments were received on the petition. NHTSA contacted Thomas for a clarification of this statement, and received a letter from Thomas that stated that a repair kit had been provided to all owners of the affected buses. This was accomplished through its dealer, Sonny Merryman, Inc. (Merryman), in Rustburg, Va. The letter that Merryman sent owners offered to reimburse owners who performed their own repair. Because the effect of an inconsequentiality determination is to excuse notification and remedy of noncompliance, and because the acts of Thomas amounted to notification and remedy as contemplated by statute, NHTSA has determined that the petition has been mooted by the actions of the petitioner, and no further action is required with respect to it. Authority: 15 U.S.C. 1417; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8. Issued on March 14, 1994. Barry Felrice, Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
