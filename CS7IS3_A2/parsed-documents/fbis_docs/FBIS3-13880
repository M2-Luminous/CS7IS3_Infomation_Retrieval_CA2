FBIS3-13880 "drnes055dd_94010" FBIS-NES-94-055 Document Type:Daily Report 20 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs Territories' Personalities React to UN Resolution TA2103165094 Jerusalem AL-QUDS in Arabic 20 Mar 94 pp 5, 19 TA2103165094 Jerusalem AL-QUDS Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [By AL-QUDS correspondents] [Excerpt] The occupied territories -- UN Security Council Resolution 904, which condemned the massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, has elicited a wave of reaction in the occupied territories. At a news conference yesterday in Jerusalem, Faysal al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, said: The resolution is in the right direction although it came late. It is also insufficient. He added: During this period we were not endeavoring for resolutions or promises. What we need are measures on the ground not resolutions on paper, which might or might not be implemented. To date, we have not seen any measures will convince us to resume the talks. Al-Husayni said: We view with extreme gravity the U.S. abstention on Jerusalem. He hoped that this had been caused by reasons of procedure rather than substance, that the U.S. stance on the issue of Jerusalem will remain firm, and that a suitable opportunity will arise for the United States to modify its position. In answer to a question about Palestinian terms for resuming the talks after the Security Council resolution, al-Husayni stressed that implementation of measures on the ground leading to the protection of the Palestinian people; measures against the settlements, especially those situated in the midst of the Palestinian populations such as in Hebron; and other measures relating to the future of settlements will help to speed up the resumption of talks. Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, member of the Palestinian delegation, said that if the Security Council resolution is implemented, it will definitely open the way to the resumption of talks. Reacting to the resolution, Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi said that it does not meet the requirements of the Palestinian position. The insistence of the United States in excluding East Jerusalem from the resolution's text and its reservation in interpreting "the occupied territories," under the pretext that this concerns an issue of sovereignty, are unacceptable excuses that do not conform with an objective viewpoint and logic and harm the peace process. 'Abd-al- Shafi added: I do not believe that this resolution will advance the peace process, rather the contrary, it will place obstacles to that process. About his opinion on returning to the negotiating table, 'Abd-al-Shafi said: In fact, I have to repeat my constant statement, namely, that the peace process will not succeed nor will it achieve the necessary credibility unless settlement activity in all the occupied territories, including Jerusalem, is halted. Dr Zakariya al-Agha said that this resolution is weak and has no value. It is weaker than previous resolutions and lacks any mechanism for imlementing any of its clauses. The regrettable thing is that the United States expressed reservations on the most important clause, namely, not considering Jerusalem part of the occupied Palestinian territories. Al-Agha added: This is a very grave sign indicating that the United States supports the Israeli viewpoint, which regards Jerusalem as part of Israeli territory. In the future, the Palestinian leadership should take this grave and important matter into account. Al-Agha added: During all this time the United States delayed the passage of this resolution and linked it to the PLO's agreement to resume the talks. This indicates and exposes the U.S. blackmail. Al-Agha stressed his rejection of this resolution, and said: I am not the only one who rejects this resolution. I believe that all our people reject it also. We, in the occupied territories, ask the Palestinian leadership in Tunis to study the new situation well, because new things have become obvious following the Hebron massacre. The PLO and the Palestinian people have put forward conditions and legitimate demands for returning to the negotiating table, especially real protection, not just an international presence as stipulated by the resolution. Al-Agha emphasized that the issue of settlement activity and settlements must be placed at the top of the agenda of the negotiating process. He said that any delay in this matter will be perilous.
