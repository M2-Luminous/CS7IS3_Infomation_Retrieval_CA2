Estimates of the dead or the endless streams of refugees are so immense that they exceed human comprehension. Increasingly better informed sources talk of half a million dead and a couple million refugees, horrifying figures which are rising every day because the violence is not stopping and every day brings a new tale of terror. Considering this, the UN Security Council resolution approved Tuesday [17 May] must be met with a cheer. The resolution announced an increased UN effort to ease the pain in Rwanda as well as an international arms embargo against Rwanda. The United Nations wants to increase its troops in Rwanda from the current 400 to 5,500 military personnel in the long term. However, there can be no talk of cheering. The resolution is unduly late and there is no evidence that it will be implemented quickly and smoothly. Meanwhile, the unrest continues, taking new victims every day. The fact that the resolution comes so late has everything to do with the broad dissension within the United Nations and with the cumbersome structure of the organization. The dissension has ensured that the resolution is just the umpteenth nonbinding statement which the United Nations and other international institutions seem to have a patent on. The resolution illustrates the desperation with which the international community views the carnage in Rwanda. The troops which the United Nations wants to send to Rwanda will have little impact on the belligerents because, once again, their mandate will be very limited. The Belgian Blue Helmets found out what kind of situations such a limited mandate can lead to in the first few hours of the violence. The 10 paratroopers killed remain a bloody accusation against so much UN laxness. The diplomats in New York have obviously not yet learned this lesson. The implementation of the resolution has also proved to be desperate. It is not only unclear which country will make the required troops available for UNAMIR-II [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] (the reservations shown by a number of countries speak volumes), but there is nobody who can say with any accuracy when the troops will be on the ground there and where they will be deployed. Nor is it clear who will pay the bill. In addition, there is the quite clear warning from the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which announced that it would treat the UN Blue Helmets as the enemy if they do not stick strictly to their humanitarian mandate. That does not bode well. The RPF attitude raises ever more questions. The military successes which the RPF has had on the ground have made its leaders so drunk with victory that the question arises as to whether the RPF is still negotiating in good faith on the basis of or in the spirit of the peace agreement reached last year in Arusha with the then government in Kigali. Belgian diplomacy still believes in the Arusha agreement, or at least in "the spirit of Arusha." That is apparent in the answers given by Foreign Minister Willy Claes yesterday [18 May] in the Senate in reply to questions put to him. How this "spirit" is supposed to be interpreted in the light of the latest developments is no longer clear. For this reason, it is wise to send Ambassador Johan Swinnen [ambassador in Rwanda] to the countries neighboring Rwanda in order to assess the new situation. However, just as important is to bring on board other countries which in the past played a major role in Rwanda, especially France, which is charting a bizarre course of its own.
