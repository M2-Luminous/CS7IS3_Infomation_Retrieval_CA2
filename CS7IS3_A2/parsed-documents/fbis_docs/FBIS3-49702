He expressed such an opinion after the Visegrad Group summit attended by President Bill Clinton on Wednesday. Olechowski said that the "Partnership for Peace" had a significant influence on European security and stressed that only democratic countries could take part in this process. The "Partnership for Peace" initiative consolidates the possibilities of preserving and restoring peace at the time of crisis and also gives Poland an access to NATO technologies and information, as well as to Western early warning systems. The foreign minister also recalled that Poland signed treaties with all the neighbouring countries apart from Lithuania but he stressed that negotiations on the Polish-Lithuanian treaty were under way and are expected to be concluded at the end of January.
