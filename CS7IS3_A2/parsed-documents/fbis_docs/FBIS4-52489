Security Council [SC], Foreign Ministry officials said. Serreqi told Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa that it is "natural" for Japan to become a permanent member considering its importance in the international community, the officials said. In a 40-minute meeting followed by dinner, Kakizawa urged Albania not to deal "emotionally" on problems involving Albanians living in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and Kosovo in neighboring Serbia, the officials said. Serreqi replied that Albania seeks to solve the problems through talks and does not approve of changing borders by force. Kakizawa pledged to extend a loan of up to 2.16 billion yen for a project aimed at increasing agricultural production and processed products and to realize macroeconomic stabilization, officials said. The 30-year-loan, with a 10-year grace period, has an annual interest rate of 1 percent, they said. Kakizawa also told Serreqi that Japan plans to dispatch macroeconomic experts in June or July to advise on policies and to send a mission to Albania this summer to study economic cooperation. Kakizawa told Serreqi that Japan will offer economic assistance on condition that Albania maintain friendly relations with its neighboring nations such as Macedonia, Serbia and Greece they said. Serreqi, 55, will conclude his five-day visit in Japan on Saturday.
