In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ortega noted actions carried out by Nicaraguans in 1993 in support of their Cuban brothers, stressing the importance of these actions in light of existing poverty in that Central American country. Amid poverty that affects 70 percent of the population, with more than six of 10 citizens unemployed and suffering the effects of the neoliberal policy of the Violeta Barrios government for the past three years, our people generously showed their solidarity, Ortega said. He added that people from the humblest neighborhoods and towns, patients who received free medical treatment in Cuba, professionals and technicians trained in that contry, and relatives of others now in Cuba on scholarship participated in the campaigns to collect milk and food for the children and people of that heroic Caribbean nation. In addition, he said, thousands who have never been to Cuba but who completely identify with the people of Jose Marti also participated. As an organization, the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) actively participated in these efforts, guiding its militants and followers to strengthen the solidarity committees in all departments and permanently condemning the blockade on Cuba at all international forums. Ortega added that in its relations with the Nicaraguan Government, the FSLN obtained from President Barrios official support for transferring the collected food and has always insisted on the need to maintain normal diplomatic relations with Havana, despite pressures. During the past three years, he stressed, there have been campaigns to have Nicaragua break relations with Cuba and withdraw its embassy in that country. In countering those campaigns, the FSLN has maintained a permanent struggle with the government -- although in silence, understandably -- to prevent our country from participating in the isolation of the island. In Central America, Ortega stressed, the FSLN carried out actions in 1993 to counter U.S. pressures to have the Cuban issue included in presidential summit agendas. Ortega said that after the signing of the Salvadoran peace agreements Washington should contribute to detente in Latin America by lifting the blockade of the Cuban revolution, which is the desire of most nations as expressed during the past two UN General Assemblies.
