In your opinion, who is behind the attacks. [Kitti] Initial investigations suggest that those who were behind the 1992 bomb explosion in Hat Yai might have been involved in the recent incidents. Judging from their tactics, it is likely that they are from the same group, possibly allies of the Pulo (Patani United Liberation Organization). I've discussed the matter with Police chief Prathin (Santipraphop) and a working group was jointly formed (by the military and police) to investigate. [Amonrat] Is it true, then, that the Fourth Army Region has not coordinated with the Police Department well. [Kitti] It isn't a matter of good or bad coordination. Bomb explosions concern public security and that's the direct responsibility of the police. The military's role is simply to support the police. [Amonrat] Does that mean that it was the police's fault in failing to solve the cases. [Kitti] Police have failed to complete investigations into various cases. The military has proposed that they improve their intelligence network. [Amonrat] What has disrupted police investigations. [Kitti] Perhaps they have so much work to do that it's hard for them to concentrate on particular cases. Often, they fail to follow up those cases, especially when the public stops paying attention. So we'd like to propose that police form special investigation teams to follow up on the cases, no matter how long they take to complete. [Amonrat] A few days ago, you put the blame on police and provincial governors for failing to perform their duties satisfactorily to curb violence. [Kitti] I didn't mean that they don't perform satisfactorily. What I meant was their roles and duties are not clear enough. Whenever any violence takes place, we've got to know who -- the military or police -- should oversee the investigation. In the South, the military has played a supporting role. If the Internal Peacekeeping Act had not been abolished, the military would be authorized to take some action. [Amonrat] Many people say that the military is trying to evade responsibility. [Kitti] That is not true. I've been assigned by the prime minister to coordinate police and I still do it. [Amonrat] Do you think the recent violence occurred because those who have lost power want to disturb the public. [Kitti] Yes, it's a public disturbance, but not by those who have lost power. It is the direct responsibility of the Interior Ministry and the Police Department to avert such incidents. We in the military are ready to provide full assistance if they ask for it. We have to comply with the law; we don't have authority as they do. [Amonrat] Do you want to see the re-enactment of the Internal Peacekeeping Act. [Kitti] No, not at all. The Criminal Code is enough at present. The important thing is that the authorities should work more efficiently. The military is ready to coordinate. [Amonrat] It seems that the Fourth Army Region would be blamed in the end if those behind the bomb attacks in the South were not arrested. [Kitti] That's right. The military has been seen as so powerful in the past that it could form governments. However during the May crisis, the military could hardly find a place to live. If you were in my position as an army region commander, you would be upset. [Amonrat] What is the military's policy to help police oversee public security. [Kitti] We've got a clear-cut policy to coordinate with police. We are assigned to maintain security in the South. In the past three years, before the schools were torched last August, we were quite successful in overseeing peace and order. The situation got out of control because the Fourth Army Region commander doesn't have enough authority to handle the problems. After the prime minister empowered the military to coordinate, we were able to work satisfactorily, up to a certain level, before the occurrence of the recent bomb attacks. [Amonrat] Are you upset about the various violent incidents in the South. [Kitti] Certainly. All people concerned should seriously try to solve the problem. If that is the case, we would finally be able to maintain public security.
