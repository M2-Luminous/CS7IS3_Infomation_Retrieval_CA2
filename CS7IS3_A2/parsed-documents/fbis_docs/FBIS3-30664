A representative office will not be opened in Skopje for the time being, but Macedonia will be diplomatically served by the Czech Republic from Belgrade, Zieleniec said. He said the Czech Republic was recognising the state with its present borders, and as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the title it uses for UN membership. The changes which had taken place concerning the international recognition of Macedonia at the end of last year and the beginning of 1994 were also a favourable sign for relations between Greece and Macedonia, Zieleniec added. Macedonia declared its independence in November 1991, but for two years broad international recognition of the state was prevented by Greece. Greece objected to the name of Macedonia because it saw its use as amounting to a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of the same name. Last April, Macedonia was accepted into the UN with the compromise name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. On Wednesday [2 February] the Czech Government approved the recognition of Macedonia, which has been recognised by 20 countries so far.
