[Serrano] In terms of ideology, the PPLM stands for social democracy, based on religious communities. [Alberto] What kind of state does the PPLM favor? [Serrano] The PPLM is aware of a series of state theories in existence, such as a centralized presidential system, semi- presidential system, and anarchical and utopian systems [anarquico utopico]. The PPLM favors the introduction of a centalized presidential system in the country, based on federalism, where regional governments are free to make certain decisions connected with their regions. [Alberto] Of the various state theories, which one do you think is the best for Mozambique? [Serrano] The PPLM believes that the centralized presidential system is the best for the country, in that it provides for the existence of a constitutional high court which can impute the Head of State. With this kind of state, we can avoid cases of generalized corruption in a country like ours where civil servants abuse power. The PPLM also stands for a strong parliament. This is actually the tendency in democratic countries. There is a need to separate legislative, judicial, and executive powers to avoid abuse of power. There should be an executive power made up of the prime minister who responds for the government and the President of the Republic who in general responds for political issues (state and government issues). The other power which involves the people in general, is the Parliament, with legislative powers. Then, there is the Judicial power represented by the High Court.... [Alberto] With the consolidation of peace, do you think it is possible to gradually eliminate centralized economy in favor of a decentralized economy? [Serrano] The way I see things at the moment, I do not think it is easy. I say this for one specific reason: During 16 years of war, Mozambique lived under a centralized system of economy. It is not from one day to the next that we are going to end this system. To resolve the problems facing the Mozambican economy, the PPLM proposes: One, to inform donors and other economic partners that we need money because we do not have yet. When they are ready to assist us or cooperate with us in any undertaking, we shall make use of our export commodities, such as prawns, and so on.... [Alberto] What kind of economic and social system does the PPLM advocate? [Serrano] The PPLM advocates a free market economy, with economic democratization and freedom, as well as the establishment of a "joint venture" [preceding word in English] system in certain fields, with most developed countries. This means that the Cooperation Ministry would sign bilateral agreements with any state. What is more, businessmen would be free to make undertakings with their foreign partners to advance the country's economy. This is not happening presently because of the Government's selfishness or mismanagement. [Alberto] What would be your government's priorities if you would win the forthcoming free and democratic elections? [Serrano] Among dozens of sectorial programs that the PPLM possesses, I would first give priority to education and health, in order to create conditions for our people's welfare. In brief, I would concern myself with assisting our people who are experiencing absolute misery. [Alberto] But how would the PPLM realize this objective under the present conditions in the country? [Serrano] Although the PPLM is aware that our country may break away from the International Monetary Fund in future, there is an urgent need to create conditions in order to renegotiate the agreement with this interanational institution, since this is the only way Mozambique can resolve its basic needs. The PPLM would also encourage people to return to rural areas to engage in subsistence agriculture. I say subsistence agriculture because Mozambique has no funds.... [Alberto] Apart from the projects you have mentioned, what other priorities does the PPLM have? [Serrano] As I said earlier, among dozens of programs that the PPLM has, we give priority to education and health. All the same, there are other economic and social projects which are also important. In the economic field, the PPLM is determined to develop agriculture to make it the foundation for economic development. The PPLM also intends to revitalize primary, secondary, and tertiary activities, such as industry, construction, transportation, wildlife and forests. In the social field, the PPLM intends to establish a fiscal policy that would rationalize and lessen the fiscal burden on the less privileged people. In the field of labor, it wants to guarantee employment and in the field of justice, it wants to guarantee human rights, providing legal assistence to all citizens. [Alberto] At present, politicians are arguing over what system to implant in the country after elections. Some want federalism, others a unitary state. What should be followed? [Serrano] As far as the PPLM is concerned, both federalism and a centralized presidential system (unitary state) are acceptable. Let us see, federalism is defined as a political organization where government activities are carried out both by regional governments and the government of the Republic of the country which is responsible for the maintenance of national unity. Regional governments have the power and freedom to make local decisions, for example with regard to the exploration of resources. Many leaders think federalism signifies the destruction of national unity. That is not true. [Alberto] There are many parties in the national political arena. Does the PPLM hope to ally itself to other parties to form a coalition? [Serrano] For the immediate future, the answer to your question is negative. So far, the unarmed opposition parties and even the ruling party have not yet come up with distinct philosophies. I will not ally myself to a person or party whose program I do not know well. The PPLM feels it is premature to speak about this issue. [Alberto] Elections will be held in nine months' time. Has the PPLM already drawn up its campaign program? [Serrano] Good question. The PPLM has a political mechanism [preceding word in English] capable of carrying out a positive electoral campaign, which will even surprise certain politicians. [Alberto] Apart from the funds made available by the government, what other financial assistance does your party count on for the electoral campaign and other programs? [Serrano] As far as the PPLM is concerned, the funds promised by the national community are secondary, because they may not materialize. The PPLM counts on European, U.S., and Asian partners for its finances. [Alberto] What do you think of the confinement process until the present date? [Serrano] Well, I think your question is excellent, in that you are making it at the right time. Before I answer it, I would like to say the following, however: Apparently, it seems as if everything is progressing smoothly. If we deeply examine the process, we shall realize, however, that there is still a lot of work to be done by the signatories of the General Peace Accord, and the United Nations, particulary Mr. Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN secretary general in Mozambique. [Alberto] The way the peace process is moving, do you think it would be possible to hold the first multiparty elections this October? [Serrano] In my view, if the issue of funds for the unarmed political parties is resolved in time, they would be able to contribute to the holding of elections in October without the shedding of blood. [Alberto] Do you think it is easy or difficult to be the leader of a political party in a society like ours which is in transition to democracy? [Serrano] My answer to your question is that in Africa we do not have political leaders but only public power leaders, which are two different things. Answering your question directly, I will begin by saying that it is difficult to be a political leader because it requires talent, drive, gift, and other qualities.
