Part of the needed mandatory immunization vaccines arrived yesterday, provided by the European Union. According to the Ministry of Health, the amounts received will be sufficient to meet requirements for the balance of the year for diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, administered to children over eight, who were not vaccinated so far for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, it is expected that part of this aid will meet the need for tuberculin tests for the last quarter of the year, used for children in the first and eighth grades, who received the BCG vaccine. The test will establish whether they will have to be revaccinated. The vaccines are to be distributed in the next few days among the medical centers, based on their requests. As to the other vaccines in short supply, for mumps, smallpox, and whooping cough, the Ministry of Health expects their arrival by the end of the month.
