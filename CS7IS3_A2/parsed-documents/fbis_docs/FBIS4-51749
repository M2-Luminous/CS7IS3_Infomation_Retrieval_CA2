In working-level defense talks at the Pentagon, Japan pledged to "fulfill its responsibilities within the constraints of the constitution" should the United Nations take measures such as economic sanctions to enforce its demand for full inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities. Concerning the North Korean nuclear issue, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority government plans to stick to the policies of the coalition under former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese defense officials told their U.S. counterparts. Pentagon officials expressed concern over the standoff between Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has been demanding unhampered access to nuclear sites, including a radiochemistry laboratory, believed to be part of a covert weapon program. They also pointed to the "extremely important" role of China, North Korea's traditional ally, in efforts to find a peaceful solution to the controversy. Washington again raised its request for Japanese participation in its Theater Missile Defense (TMD) scheme, a scaled-down version of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), but the Japanese delegation remained noncommittal. They did, however, promise to "study" the proposal, including its "cost-effectiveness." The U.S. officials also urged the quick conclusion of an agreement that would facilitate swapping material such as fuel and services between the U.S. forces stationed in Japan and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF). Such an agreement would also benefit the SDF in future United Nations-led peacekeeping operations, the U.S. officials said, according to the Japanese officials.
