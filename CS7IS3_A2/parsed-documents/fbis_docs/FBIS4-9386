Moreover, UN forces have not taken up the positions specified by the ultimatum. Groups of chetniks were sighted yesterday and this morning in areas that are only 1 km away from the town. Chetnik provocations overnight were registered in the area of Orahovice and (?Ostanica), while a tank and infantry attack at Brdarici is currently in progress. Life in the city is extremely hard because the small area of the town now holds over 40,000 citizens and refugees who were forced to leave their homes in the surrounding villages. Lack of water could cause large-scale epidemics. That is why we are appealing to the UN Protection Force and health organizations to undertake urgent measures to protect the population of Gorazde from infectious diseases. As we were filing this report, we were informed that a UN High Commissioner for Refugees convoy, carrying food and medicine, had entered the town.
