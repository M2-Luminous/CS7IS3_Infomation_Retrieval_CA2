FR941107-2-00034 FR941107-2-00009 [A&hyph;570&hyph;828] Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicomanganese From the People's Republic of China AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Kullman or Michelle Frederick, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW; Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;1279 or (202) 482&hyph;0186, respectively. FINAL DETERMINATION: We determine that imports of silicomanganese from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margin is shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the preliminary determination (59 FR 31199, June 17, 1994) the following events have occurred: On June 28, 1994, counsel withdrew its representation for the two responding firms in this investigation; and on July 28, 1994, at the request of two non-responding firms with significant silicomanganese exports, the final determination was postponed (59 FR 40008, August 5, 1994). No further comments were submitted. Scope of the Investigation The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight not less than four percent iron, more than 30 percent manganese, more than eight percent silicon and not more than three percent phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also currently be classifiable under HTSUS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is June 1 through November 30, 1993.
