FR940214-0-00034 FR940214-0-00004 (C) The CPA or LPA audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the borrower and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract he/she considers necessary to express an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13. The CPA or LPA shall also perform the additional agreed upon procedures specified by FmHA (available in any FmHA office), performed in accordance with Attestation Standards, for the applicant and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract. (D) Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion concerning whether the construction costs, as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13, present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as prescribed in FmHA regulations. (E) In some cases, cost certification will be obtained by FmHA through direct contract with the CPA or LPA. The borrower and his/her CPA or LPA will cooperate fully with the contract CPA or LPA by providing all documentation necessary to conduct the certification. FmHA reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to FmHA. If not satisfactory to FmHA, the borrower will be responsible for providing additional information. (F) There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project. (G) Forms FmHA 1944&hyph;30, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate'' and FmHA 1944&hyph;31, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,'' provide written notification to the borrower that willful and intentional falsification of cost certification documents will result in debarment of all violators in accordance with the provisions of FmHA Instruction 1940&hyph;M (available in any FmHA office). These forms require the disclosure of all identities of interest associated with project construction, certify the entity's ability to provide the contracted service, and cite the penalties for failure to disclose or falsify such certification. Each applicant/borrower will be required to complete and sign the forms (available in any FmHA office). (H) Subcontracting development work. ( 1 ) Contractors will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction. ``Actual construction'' means ``work'' as defined in American Institute of Architects (AIA) documents: ``*␣*␣* labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.'' Under this definition, contractors who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when: ( i ) More than 50 percent of the contract sum in the construction contract is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or ( ii ) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers and/or equipment lessors. ( 2 ) Note : If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they are considered as one subcontractor. ( 3 ) How to apply rule: ( i ) The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of the largest subcontract by the contract sum of the construction contract results in more than 50 percent. ( ii ) The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the contract sum of the construction contract results in 75 percent or more. (I) Qualified contracting entities. Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to contract. Form FmHA 1944&hyph;31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities. The form provides notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein. Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of FmHA Instruction 1940&hyph;M (available in any FmHA office). * * * * * (vii) *␣*␣* (B) *␣*␣*
