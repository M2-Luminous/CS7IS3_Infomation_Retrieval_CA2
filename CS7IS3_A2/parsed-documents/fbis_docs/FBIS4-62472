The document, prepared at a meeting in the Lohusalu seaside resort near Tallinn last weekend, deals with the developing of the social security and social protection systems, health care and labor market organization. The problems of the three countries in this field are very much the same and are mainly connected with shortage of funds, Estonian Social Affairs Minister Marju Lauristin said. All three countries are aiming toward creation of a social security framework that would be suitable for a poor country and cover the entire population, she added. Also the health care structures of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are facing common problems in their transition to a so-called family doctors' general practitioner system to form the basic level in their health care structures. The third most topical issue is coordination of decisions concerning the labor market and protection of the labor market, the minister told reporters. While introducing changes in these three areas the Baltics are keeping in view their possible joining with the European Union and are proceeding from the standards now valid in Europe. The meeting also set up five different commissions -- on social security issues, on social protection, on issues of the work force market, on employment, and on health care. The three countries are to draw up a common social development project to be presented to European and worldwide forums. This was also the first time for the social and related affairs ministers from the three Baltic countries to meet at a common table.
