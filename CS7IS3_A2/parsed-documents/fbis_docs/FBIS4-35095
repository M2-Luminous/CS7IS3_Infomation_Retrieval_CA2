"Everything is fine, but nobody can leave," the woman told AFP in a telephone conversation. The woman identified herself as an embassy official, but she refused to reveal her identity, and she appeared to be nervous. The embassy was occupied "peacefully" on Tuesday morning by a group of Nicaraguan recontras who were not armed, the woman said. She did not specify how many people are being held inside the diplomatic mission. Nobody answers the telephone in the embassy, and there has not been any information on what is happening inside. The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has not made a statement on the incident. Police sources had reported earlier that the recontras had entered the embassy to request political asylum and not to necessarily occupy the embassy. The police sources noted, however, that they were unaware of other demands by the recontras. In a simultaneous action, another group of former contras occupied the offices of the International Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS, which is located in Managua.
