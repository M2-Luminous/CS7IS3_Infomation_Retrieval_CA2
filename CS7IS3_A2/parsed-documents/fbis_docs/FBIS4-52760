FBIS4-52760 "dreas093_a_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Ouster of Diet Steering Committee Head Proposed Ouster of Diet Steering Committee Head Proposed OW1305055294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0537 GMT 13 May 94 OW1305055294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a resolution Friday [13 May] demanding the dismissal of the chairman of the House of Representatives Steering Committee, the crucial committee that handles Diet affairs. The Steering Committee's executive members immediately held a meeting and decided to hold a vote-taking plenary session of the lower house next Tuesday on the resolution, political sources said. The dismissal of Keiwa Okuda, the committee chairman and a member of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, is virtually certain because the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is expected to vote for the resolution, the sources said. The SDP is the second largest opposition party. It also appears certain that Okuda's successor will be picked from the LDP, they said. The LDP and the SDP have a combined majority in the 511-member lower house. "The base on which the current cabinet stands has definitely altered, the proportion of power of ruling and opposition parties is reversed. There are no longer any grounds to select (the chairman) from the ruling parties," the resolution said. In response, Hata criticized the LDP, saying Okuda has been giving consideration to the opposition camp. "It (the resolution) is nothing but tyranny by force of number," he said. Since Hata was forced to inaugurate his administration on a minority base last month after the SDP left the coalition, the LDP, which was ousted from its decades-long dominance last August, has demanded comprehensive changes in the chairmanships of the lower chamber's 20 standing committees. The chairmanship of the Diet Steering Committee, which handles a no-confidence resolution against the cabinet if it is submitted, is a key post for the LDP as a step toward managing Diet affairs. Political sources speculated that the LDP will put forth a no- confidence resolution against the Hata cabinet possibly in June, after the Diet passes the state budget for fiscal 1994, which started on April 1. At a meeting of the Steering Committee's executive members in the morning, the LDP demanded that ruling parties surrender the chairmanships of other lower house committees to the opposition camp, political sources said. The chairman posts demanded by the opposition are those for the lower house Cabinet Committee, the Commerce and Industry Committee and the Transport Committee, all of which were vacated when the previous chairmen became ministers in the Hata administration, the sources said. The ruling and opposition camps agreed to discuss the other posts next Tuesday, they said.
