A large number of leaders and organ cadres have been visiting localities, inspecting actual situations, and performing concrete tasks. They have found a new way of performing economic tasks in an effort to properly develop the militia and reserve forces. The General Staff and General Political Departments recently conveyed their experiences to all military units. To enable Shaanxi's militia and reserve forces to play their full roles as a new force in facilitating the material and spiritual civilization drive, the Shaanxi Military District party committee has been organizing and conducting the campaigns since 1991. It has been investigating 1,000 companies annually and has checked all of Shaanxi's grass-roots companies once. More than 400 leading cadres at army, divisional, and regimental levels and a large number of organ cadres have visited various townships, towns, rural areas, plants, and mines to conduct investigations and studies. They have thoroughly understood the situation of 3,337 grass-roots companies, and have rendered responsive assistance to their various construction endeavors. While eating, staying, working, and training with officers and men of various grass-roots units, leading cadres at various levels and organ cadres have understood many conditions that could not have been learned if they remained in their offices. They have also resolved many problems that had been obstructing grass-roots units' progress for a long time. Shangluo Prefecture, situated in the Qinbashan hilly areas, produces abundant special local products. However, the masses had been poor for a long time because they had a poor concept of commodity economy and thick forests and deep ravines had hampered the smooth distribution of goods. Some 130 cadres from Shangluo Military Subdistrict and various county and city people's armed police departments have visited the rural areas, and have held over 30 training classes on commodity trade in separate localities. Moreover, through various channels, they have also raised and established special funds and have organized a large contingent of long-distance transporting and marketing personnel consisting some 50,000 militiamen. They have transported lots of mountain products and special local products to large and medium cities, including Xian, Baoyi, and Xianyang. Their annual sales have amounted to over 100 million yuan and the militiamen's annual per capita income has reached more than 1,700 yuan. While changing their operating mechanisms, some large and medium enterprises and military industry enterprises in Xian city have encountered problems. To resolve the problems, some 30 leading cadres from the Xian Military Subdistrict and from its people's armed police departments have led task forces to conduct studies and ideological and political work on young militiamen of more than 120 large and medium enterprises. They have provided technical training to young militiamen who were temporarily laid off, and encouraged them to engage in tertiary industries. In addition, they have established more than 600 comfort-extending militia units, and have raised over 70,000 yuan to help impoverished families. Consequently, they have resolved the problems, thereby creating conditions for enterprises to deepen reform. The investigative and studying process has also been a process of summarizing and accumulating experiences. By conducting the "investigation of 1,000 companies" in the past three years, the Shaanxi Military District has formulated a set of new concepts and methods, and has accumulated new experiences in various aspects, including ways to organize the militia and reserve forces to join in the material and spiritual civilization drive, to facilitate tasks on comprehensively rectifying social order, to perform rescuing and relief-supplying work, to participate in key construction projects with a regularized system, and to support military training with productive labor. According to statistics, in the past three years, the militia has participated in over 500 key construction projects, and has established more than 3,200 economic entities that support military training with productive labor. The militia's role as a "front army" in economic construction has become more and more prominent. The large number of investigative and studying activities have changed the workstyle of leading cadres at various levels and organs in Shaanxi Military District. A situation has emerged whereby people, labor, and funds have been moving toward grass-roots units. Shaanxi Military District commander Wang Zhicheng has visited all the people's armed police departments in 107 Shaanxi counties and cities, and has conducted investigation and studies in more than 900 militia companies. He has gone deep into the Qinbashan area, has slept on common beds with militia companies and militiamen who are guarding railway tracks there, and has drunk water from the same wells as they. He has conveyed instructions and provided assistance and guidance to various militia companies. To help impoverished areas develop endeavors that would support military training with productive labor, Zhao Lianchen, political commissar of the Shaanxi Military District, has visited over 50 of Shaanxi's poorest counties in more than two months. He has mulled and sought methods and measures with grass-roots cadres, and has proposed, after carrying out studies, four suggestions with guidelines. The suggestions have been approved by the provincial authorities. When commenting on their feelings about going deep into grass-roots units, many cadres said: Our work style has become more realistic, obstacles have been cleared, and our relations with the masses have become closer. We have eventually eliminated the old concept that people's armed police work was not important.
