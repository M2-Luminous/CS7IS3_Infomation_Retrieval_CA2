This official said: North Korea has replied to our side's proposal as quickly as in two days in the form of a telephone message in the name of the prime minister--in the same manner as we did--without any revision to our proposal. I think that this confirms, first, the sincerity of the North Korean side which put forth the proposal for the summit talks. The official said: The fact that the reply message is very businesslike--without any harangue or hidden meaning--makes us have a hopeful expectation for the success of the talks. Another government official concerned said: The only procedure left before the preliminary talks is for the South and North to exchange lists of delegates and entourage members. Regarding the selection of the delegates to the preliminary talks, the official said: The two sides will fine-tune procedures behind closed doors at Panmunjom. I think our side's delegation will consist of Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for national unification affairs, as the head delegate; and Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security at Chongwadae [presidential offices]; as a delegate, and others.
