The raids took place the day before yesterday and resulted in eight killed (most of them women and children) and 12 wounded. The Tajik refugees have come under fire from two sides: the Communist government [of Tajikistan] and the Russian forces that support it, from one side, and the formerly Communist General Dostam's militias, which are considered to be carrying out Moscow's plans to eliminate the radicals in the Tajik opposition, from the other. This aggression comes at a time when talks are going on in Tehran between the Communist Tajik Government and the Islamic opposition to reach a cease-fire between the two sides. Informed Tajik sources connected with [the talks] told AL-HAYAH that the raid was part of plans that have been carried out for some time to force hundreds of thousands of Tajik emigrants to leave the Afghan areas adjacent to the borders of their country, in view of the fact that the emigrants are a source of recruitment for the opposition, besides their being a political cover for it. The same sources affirmed that the recent raids have not been the first of their kind. Dostam's fighters had previously raided the emigrant camps several times, killing more than 40 Tajiks and wounding 100 others in two of the raids. They indicated that the militias also use other means to terrorize the refugees, among them poisoning the drinking water in their camps, which has caused the death of more than 90 people.
