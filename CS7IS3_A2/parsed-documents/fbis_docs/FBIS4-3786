They called for efforts to thoroughly study and implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference and, proceeding from Tianjin's reality in agriculture and rural work, further unify thinking, enhance understanding, conscientiously strengthen party leadership over agriculture and rural work, and strive to fulfill the basic tasks of agriculture and rural work. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, and Zhang Lichang, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and mayor of Tianjin, gave important speeches. Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, attended. Li Shenglin, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and executive vice mayor of Tianjin, presided over the conference. Nie Bichu, chairman of the municipal people's congress standing committee; and Liu Jinfeng, chairman of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; attended. Also attending were municipal leading comrades Yang Zhihua, Liu Fengyan, Fang Fengyou, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, Zheng Zhiying, Lu Xuezheng, Pan Yiqing, Zhang Haosheng, Zhuang Gonghui, Li Changxing, and Huang Yanzhi. Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: Tianjin has attached importance to and scored notable achievements in agriculture and rural work for many years. Central leading comrades have affirmed on many occasions its bumper grain harvests for 10 years in a row and, in particular, its good job in carrying out the "vegetable basket" project. The good development trend in rural economy, the increase in peasants' income every year, and the stable rural situation have constituted an important contribution to Tianjin's economic development. However, we should also note that the economic development rate, the level and economic efficiency of agricultural productive forces, and the increase in peasants' income are not high enough. By conscientiously studying and implementing the guidelines of the central rural work conference, we should enhance our understanding of the importance to strengthen agriculture and rural work in the new situation. The current priorities are as follows: First, we should enhance the understanding of the position of agriculture as the foundation. Although Tianjin is a large industrial and commercial city developing the suburban-type rural economy, it should firmly embrace the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation. The rural economy is an important growing point of the economy of the entire municipality and an important force to realize sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. The healthy development of agriculture and rural economy is the foundation not only for the national economy but also for reform, development, and stability. Second, we should enhance the understanding of the importance of successful production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. In the new situation in establishing the socialist market economy system, we should understand the extremely important production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops from a strategic and political perspective and, proceeding from reality, strive to improve the self-sufficiency rate of grain and gain the initiative in the overall planning for the economic work of the entire municipality. Third, we should further enhance the understanding of the importance of a successful "vegetable basket" project. In Tianjin's suburban- type agriculture, the key link is the production and supplies for the "vegetable basket." We should pay close attention to it under all circumstances and make it still better. Fourth, we should further enhance the understanding of the importance to restructure agriculture on the premise that the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is stabilized. The production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is the prerequisite for restructuring agriculture and restructuring rural production. We should pay particular attention to comprehensive agricultural development and transformation of low- and medium-yielding farmland, through which to improve the basic conditions for agricultural production, so that there will be more room for agricultural production. Fifth, we should further enhance the understanding of the importance to rely on agricultural development to increase peasants' income. By improving the production level of farming and livestock breeding and operating on as large a scale as possible, we should raise the output rate of land and fund input and continuously increase peasants' income. [passage omitted] Gao Dezhan emphasized: The major policies, targets, tasks, and policy measures for Tianjin's agriculture and rural work have been clarified. The key to the next step of work is to further strengthen party leadership over agriculture and rural work, pay close attention to implementation, and, through fruitful work, achieve real results in meeting the requirements of the central authorities and the municipal party committee for greatly strengthening agriculture and rural work. We should make sure that our understanding and work are in place; the system of responsibility for work targets is conscientiously carried out; leadership force is further replenished; functions are transformed and work styles improved; and all trades and professions render great support to agriculture. Zhang Lichang spoke on specific opinions on current agricultural production and relevant issues. He pointed out: Stabilizing and developing grain and cotton production is a major issue concerning urban and rural economic development and social stability. The current serious drought has resulted in reduction of the areas sown to grain and cotton, and the prices of the means of agricultural production have increased. All districts, counties, and relevant departments should conscientiously study this issue and exert great efforts to make this year's grain and cotton production successful. We should adopt every possible means to stabilize the areas sown to grain and cotton. We should strive to increase the areas sown to grain, raise the multiple crop index, and plant the areas that can be planted in spring. We should make great efforts to increase per- unit yields, continue the grain increase demonstration project and the dissemination of the 500,000-mu paddy rice high-yielding cultivation technology this year, and achieve success in the cultivation and supplied of fine seeds. We should institute the system whereby district and county heads are responsible for management of targets. All districts and counties should assign grain and cotton production tasks to townships, villages, and households and hold the responsibility for them. On the premise that their total grain supply and demand are kept basically in balance, they should develop and utilize land resources to develop good-quality, high-yield, and high-efficient cash crops and ensure rural self-sufficiency in grain supplies. All-out efforts should be made to combat drought to ensure wheat fields and spring sowing. All cadres of agricultural departments should overcome difficulties, concentrate efforts on this work, and make it successful. All trades and professions in Tianjin should actively support the antidrought work to ensure wheat production and support spring farming. We should deepen the reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system and establish the grain reserve system and risk fund. In addition to the portion to be consumed by peasants themselves, some of the grain produced in Tianjin should be supplied to its urban areas. Departments concerned should purchase this part of grain on a priority basis in line with state's regulations and policies, and they are not allowed to increase or lower the purchasing price at will. Grain departments should coordinate well with major grain producing areas, sign contracts with them, and ensure fulfillment of the contracts. They should play the major role in the supplies of grain. In line with state requirements and the actual demand of Tianjin, grain departments, in addition to ensuring normal grain supplies, should stabilize grain stock while ensuring a certain amount of circulating grain. Meanwhile, they should increase the reserve of edible oil to a proper extent through various channels. [passage omitted]
