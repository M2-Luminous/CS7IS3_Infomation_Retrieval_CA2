FR940826-0-00086 FR940826-0-00017 (c) PFC Blend Alpha._PFC Blend Alpha, which contains HFC&hyph;23 and R&hyph;116, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 in retrofitted and new industrial process refrigeration. Both components of this blend exhibit extremely high GWPs and long lifetimes. HFC&hyph;23 has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime of 280 years, and R&hyph;116, perfluoroethane, has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime of 10,000 years. EPA believes this blend could significantly contribute to global warming if allowed to escape refrigeration systems. In addition, the long lifetimes of R&hyph;116 and HFC&hyph;23 mean any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. While the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of this blend, or leak repair for systems using it, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle this blend during equipment servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. This blend is nonflammable and does not deplete ozone.

(c) HCFC Blend Gamma._HCFC Blend Gamma, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and HCFC&hyph;124, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12, R&hyph;500, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted refrigerated transport. Because HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and HCFC&hyph;124 contribute to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. HCFC&hyph;142b has one of the highest ODPs among the HCFCs, while HCFC&hyph;124 has one of the lowest. The GWPs of HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b are somewhat high. Although HCFC&hyph;142b is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. (d) HCFC Blend Epsilon._HCFC Blend Epsilon, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HFC&hyph;143a, and HFC&hyph;125, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12, R&hyph;500, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted refrigerated transport.
