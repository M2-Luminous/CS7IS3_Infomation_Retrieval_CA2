"Hong Kong's economy will not be affected by politics." These are the assurances given by Chinese officials to Hong Kong people on different occasions. When China and Britain suspended talks on Hong Kong's constitutional reform, however, Hong Kong's stock and real estate market remained brisk, presenting bright prospects. However, the author heard something quite different in Beijing: "The central authorities have made a rightist mistake on the policy toward Hong Kong." "We cannot barter away our principles." "We should resolutely take over Hong Kong." In the face of overbearing criticism from the top CPC levels, Jiang Zemin had to make some "clarifications." While meeting with and feting veteran Army officials and cadres in Beijing in early February, Jiang Zemin explained the policies of the CPC Central Committee and answered their questions. For a long time, these veteran army officials and cadres had had misgivings about certain matters. Taking the rare opportunity of their meeting with the party general secretary, they sharply raised a wide range of questions, including Army building, hegemonism, current social reality, understanding of Marxism, and Hong Kong's transition. Of these, the Hong Kong question was full of gunpowder. One person asked Jiang Zemin: "Did the CPC Central Committee commit a mistake of rightism in dealing with Britain over the question of Hong Kong? Did economic interests override state sovereignty and dignity?" "Never Before Has the Policy Toward the British Hong Kong Government Been So Identical as Today"] In the face of the question that regarded "left" as "right," Jiang Zemin replied: "This criticism is not correct. We are fully prepared, as we had estimated the political and economic challenges deliberately made by Britain during Hong Kong's transition period. I hope the comrades present will rest assured. The CPC Central Committee will never make any compromise on questions of principle!" Another person asked: "Is it true that the central departments do not have a unified policy in dealing with the Hong Kong question?" Jiang Zemin raised his tone in the reply: "We can guarantee you that the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] share identical views on the Hong Kong question." He especially quoted Deng Xiaoping's latest instruction: "Since the founding of the PRC, the policies of the CPC Central Committee regarding the British Hong Kong Government and the U.S. hegemonists' interference in China's internal affairs have never been so identical as today." The Problem Can Be Resolved Easily When the British Side Has Further "Gone Off the Rails" Regarding the question of Hong Kong's early recovery, Jiang Zemin also conducted "ideological work." Of course, he stood by some comrades who criticized Britain, saying: "As Britain has violated and undermined the Sino-British Joint Declaration; openly negated the agreements reached between the two governments; incited hostile forces in Hong Kong to launch anti-Chinese Government activities; and brazenly interfered in the Basic Law, which is purely an internal Chinese affair; comrades within the party, the Army, people's organizations, and basic levels have urged the central government to adopt resolute measures to recover Hong Kong at an early date. We have legal grounds for such a move, as well as the political environment, economic strength, and the backing of the 1.2 billion Chinese people." Jiang then gave an account of the central committee's policy: "However, a decision can be made only after judging the development and changes of events. We are fully prepared against the turbulence during the transition period and at the initial period of the establishment of the Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government. It is definite that the British colonialists will create trouble politically, economically, and socially. We should let the British colonialists fully perform at the stage. Only when they have fully exposed themselves and have gone off the rails will it be easier to resolve the problem." Jiang Zemin reiterated his position to the veteran Army officials and cadres: The Chinese Government and the Chinese people will never forget the base action of British perfidy; we will never forget British plunder, slaughter, and aggression against China during the Opium War; we will never forget the British support and participation in China's civil war; and we will never forget the British participation in the economic sanctions imposed against New China for over 30 years. I can assure you that after 1 July 1997, we will never allow the remnants of the British colonialists to remain, we will not allow the British colonialists to enjoy privileges, and we will never allow foreign forces to meddle in Hong Kong's affairs. The British authorities were informed long ago of our position and principled stand. Li Peng Backs With Clear-Cut Stand the Leftist Line Pursued by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch Moreover, Premier Li Peng took the opportunity of his participation in the inaguration of the Daya Bay nuclear power station to brief relevant departments. In Shenzhen on the afternoon of 5 February, Li Peng listened to an account of Hong Kong given by Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch. Present on the occasion were Zou Jiahua, Ding Guangeng, Xie Fei, Lu Ping, and Lie Minqiu. News of the meeting was blacked out. While meeting with reporters, Zhou Nan refused to disclose that he had discussed the question of Hong Kong with Li Peng. He simply told the reporters to ask Li Peng. It has been reported that Li Peng gave a five-point instruction at the meeting: First, the central authorities have highly appraised the work of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, which have implemented the central policies in a comprehensive manner; Second, the rule of the British colonialists will end on 30 June 1997; if any drastic changes take place during this period, the central government will take over Hong Kong earlier in light of the established principle and policies. This is China's national policy; Third, the central government is capable of maintaining Hong Kong's economic prosperity following the establishment of the SAR Government on 1 July 1997 so that Hong Kong can continue to serve as an international financial, industrial and commercial, and transportation center; Fourth, regarding the political, economic, and social troubles created by the British colonialists during the transition period in an attempt to sow the seeds of turmoil and confusion for the future, it is necessary to continue to heighten vigilance, expose the plot, and adopt countermeasures to protect the interests of the vast number of Hong Kong compatriots; and Fifth, under the principles and policies of the central government, it is necessary to continue to unite all Hong Kong figures who love the country and Hong Kong, and who are willing to take part in Hong Kong's construction, including foreign figures in Hong Kong who support the Basic Law and who are willing to contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity. In his speech, Li Peng straightforwardly expressed his support for the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, which was aimed at the criticism made by certain figures with foresight that the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch was taking an increasingly "leftist" line. This gives people much food for thought: Is it tantamount to bureaucrats' shielding one another or has the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch simply followed the line of Li Peng? Assuming the Posture of "Political Examination" of Hong Kong Civil Servants Zou Jiahua also delivered a speech. He made the following two main points: First, how should we deal with the British unilateral constitutional reform? Second, can the department-level civil servants take the through train? Zhou continued: "Without the blessing of the Chinese side, we will not recognize or undertake any responsibility for the political system, economic matters, and things introduced unilaterally by the British side which transcend 1 July 1997. All Hong Kong civil servants now in office may continue their service after 1997 and the conditions may be more preferential. However, there definitely will be changes in the department-level chiefs. The Chinese Government and the Chinese people will never recognize or accept the continued occupation of senior posts by British agents after 30 June 1997. The three-tier council elections introduced by Britain can last only until 30 June 1997.... How can the Chinese Government accept and inherit the elections introduced by the British colonialists after the change of sovereignty and administration?" Following the breakdown of Sino-British talks, there are indications that Beijing is taking the highly efficient contingent of civil servants of the Hong Kong Government as the target of attack. Now they have openly assumed the posture of "political examination," and even have intimidated some senior-level civil servants, which is bound to exert an adverse influence. No wonder a conscientious senior-level cadre in Beijing said indignantly: "In this way, they are undermining the basic framework of the Hong Kong Government. How can the concept of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong be realized in a state of anxiety?"
