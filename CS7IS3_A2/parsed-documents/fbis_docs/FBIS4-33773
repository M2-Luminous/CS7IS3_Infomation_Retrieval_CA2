During the evening of 7 June, the delegates of the 34 countries attending the meeting approved the "Convention of Belem do Para," an international juridical instrument "to prevent, punish, and eradicate" all types of physical, sexual, or psychological violence against the continent's female population. The approval of the document was considered a great victory for a group of ambassadors who had worked for several months to overcome the resistance of some countries, Brazil among them, which were against the consideration of and debate on the subject in Belem. In the end, despite sarcastic statements by some delegates, and even after some typically macho kinds of jokes, the convention was unanimously approved. The United States, Brazil, Mexico, Jamaica, and Canada, the countries that opposed debating the document during the plenary session this week, have some objections to the convention's text. Those countries preferred to reconsider the text and to submit it in advance to the United Nations World Conference on Women, due to be held next year in Beijing. Yet Ambassador Zelmira Regazzoli, president of the International Women's Commission (CIM), insisted on and succeeded in including the topic on the agenda of the Belem meeting. The convention has five chapters. Article 1 of Chapter I states that violence against women is "any action that causes death, harm, or physical, sexual, or psychological suffering to women, either in the private or public sectors." Chapter II can be summarized as saying that all women have the right to live free of violence; that women must be recognized to have the right to enjoy, exercise, and receive the protection of all the human rights and liberties upheld by all regional and international human rights instruments; and that women can freely and fully exercise their civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. Still excited about the approval of the document, Venezuelan Ambassador Ana Lucina Garcia Maldonado, who is also a federal deputy and the author of bills defending women in her country, yesterday told O ESTADO: "This is a really momentous event. We are 250 million women in the Americas, and at the end of the 20th century we still cannot say that we enjoy the rights that are recognized as belonging to all human beings. We still have to submit ourselves to all kinds of violence and remain practically silent, because no one protects us. Not much is said about this, but it is known that at least 150 million women in our continent suffer from one type of violence or the other. A major step has undoubtedly been made, and I myself am particularly very happy." Ana Lucina, who suggested naming the Convention after Belem do Para, added that all OAS countries will now have to ratify the document in order to enforce it. Disappearance A draft convention dealing with the forcible disappearance of people was also submitted to the OAS plenary session yesterday. The document was approved on 7 June by a working commission that addressed juridical and political topics. Everything seemed to indicate that it would also be approved by all OAS countries. The convention defines forcible disappearance as the action -- by agents of the state -- of stripping someone of his freedom. Amnesty International, which was represented at the meeting, is working to make the countries of the Americas classify abduction as a crime.
