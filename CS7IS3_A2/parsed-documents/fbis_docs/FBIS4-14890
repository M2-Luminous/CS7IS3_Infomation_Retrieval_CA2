He said that only the UN and the CSCE had such a mandate. The granting of this mandate to any individual country is a gross violation of international norms and peacekeeping principles, said Luik. "Russia has the right to participate in peacekeeping operations within the framework of the UN and does not need any additional mandate," he stated. He also pointed out that Estonia was against giving individual countries a "carte blanche" and would insist on the observance of this principle.
