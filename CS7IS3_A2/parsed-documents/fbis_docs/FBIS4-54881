FBIS4-54881 "dreeu088_i_94014" FBIS-EEU-94-088 Daily Report 8 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA _O_Muslim-Croat Federation Presidential Election _O_Muslim-Croat Federation Presidential Election 94P20720A 94P20720A CSO [Editorial Report] While world attention has been focused on developments around the UN-proclaimed safe area of Gorazde, Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat political leaders have been engaged in negotiations to fill leadership positions in their newly established federation. The deadline for electing the federation's government is drawing near: According to the federation's constitution, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly is supposed to reach a decision by 30 April at the latest. Following three meetings of high-ranking representatives of the Bosnian Muslim and Croat sides, the Presidential Council of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna blamed the Bosnian Muslims for a failure to reach a political agreement on the nationality of the federation's future president, vice president, and prime minister, accusing the Muslims of an "absolute lack of interest and readiness" to discuss these issues, Zagreb Radio reported on 26 April. Describing a 23 April "working meeting" between Bosnian Croat and Muslim delegations in Sarajevo, the Belgrade news agency TANJUG stated the same day that the two sides had failed to reach an agreement on the future federation president. Citing a Croatian Radio report, TANJUG said that each side had given "legal and political" justifications for its candidate. Although the Croat side wanted a Croat as the first president of the federation, it was prepared to yield to the Muslims on the condition that Haris Silajdzic were nominated instead of the proposed Muslim leader, Alija Izetbegovic. Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was proposed as candidate for federation president by "deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly" and by the regional, executive, and main committees of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] on 8 April, which cited "moral and political reasons that are clear to all members and supporters of our party," according to Sarajevo Radio on 12 April. The Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian deputies' club in the Assembly have put forward as their presidential candidate Kresimir Zubak, chairman of the Presidency of the Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna. In an interview published in the 2-4 April issue of the Zagreb daily VECERNJI LIST, Zubak said that "we have not only a political, but also a constitutional right" to elect a Croat to the post of president because, according to the constitution, the president cannot be elected from the same people twice in succession, and "over the past several years this function has been performed by a member of the Muslim people, namely Alija Izetbegovic." The Croatian National Council [HNV] of Bosnia-Herzegovina has nominated Dr. Ivo Komsic as its presidential candidate. According to a statement published in the 15 April issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK, Dr. Komsic has met every criterion for "election to this most responsible post" and has proven his determination, ability, and readiness "to implement the spirit and the letter of the new constitution" with his "overall work and personal contribution" in preparing the Washington agreement and later the constitution. An article in the 5 April issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA observes that Bosnian reporters accredited to Zagreb see Kresimir Zubak as Croatian President Tudjman's choice for president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, adding that at the same time "the government in Zagreb does not oppose Haris Silajdzic in some leadership position." The BORBA article also mentions other presidential candidates whose names are circulating in Sarajevo, such as Komsic, Vlado Pandzic, and Stjepan Kljuic, noting that their political views on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina are supposed to be closer to Croatian Assembly President Stipe Mesic's than to Tudjman's. A 13 April VJESNIK article points out that, in accordance with the constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, the federation president cannot be chosen by the "simple process" of the Assembly voting on nominated candidates. The governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Herceg-Bosna must agree upon a single candidate to be presented to the Assembly. To be elected, the candidate must then get the majority of votes of both the Croat and Bosnian Muslim representatives. The paper predicts that such an election will "obviously" entail difficulties.
