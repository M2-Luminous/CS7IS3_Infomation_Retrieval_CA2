Contrary to their competences they had illegaly obeyed the orders of former ministers of the interior in regard to the rules of defending the border. Through their bad behaviours they have violated the personality of man and have mistreated different persons who have tried to cross the state borders and have walked the borders victims before crowds of people. In the summer of 1990, although communist dictatorship had declared that border crossing was no longer considered treason, hundreds of young boys and girls who attempted to cross the border were killed. A total of 80-110 persons were killed during 1989-1990, according to experts. The trial of Engjel Thoma, former commander of the border guards of Samrisht, Shkodra District was held on October 27, 1993. Six young Albanians were killed in 8 months' time in 1990 in the border center. Official figures on the murders of Albanians are expected to be higher. Various reports published in the Albanian press over the last three years show that senior officials of former state security and former President Alia are responsible for these murders.
