FBIS4-6459 "dreas077_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 North Korea Radio Condemns U.S.-ROK 17-18 Apr Air Exercise Radio Condemns U.S.-ROK 17-18 Apr Air Exercise SK2004041494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 19 Apr 94 SK2004041494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 19 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to military sources, U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets conducted provocative joint aerial war exercise aimed at a northward invasion on 17 and 18 April by drawing in various military planes from overseas bases. On 17 April, fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes, and electronic intercept planes took off from U.S. bases in the Pacific area and were deployed to the U.S. Air Force bases occupying South Korea for this war exercise. On 18 April, combat planes of the Air Force and the Marine Corps, and an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane flew in from bases in Kadena and Yokosuka, Japan to South Korean bases. Prior to this frenzied war exercise, EA-6 electronic intercept planes created an electronic jam mainly in the skies above Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Pyongtaek. An EH-60 electronic warfare helicopter guaranteed a strike air corps' surprise attack by creating an electronic jam while repeatedly circling around in the skies above Kapyong, Pochon, and Kanghwa Island. Various fighter-bombers, assault planes, and observation planes mobilized in the skies above this area were madly engaged in an intensive striking exercise against targets in the electric jam. This fire game commotion [pulchangnan sodong], for which as many as 500 military planes of various types were mobilized, was aimed at examining the practicality [hyonsilsong] of a surprise attack and the consecutive bombing capability of air corps of each type of plane with electronic jamming. While the joint aerial war exercise was frantically conducted on 18 April, an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane flew from Kadena base in Japan to South Korea, and madly carried out electronic reconnaissance and aerial photographing of important strategic areas of the northern half of the Republic while making round flights in the skies above Yangyang, Hongchon, and Tokchok Island. On 17 and 18 April, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane and an RV-1 tactical reconnaissance plane were madly engaged in aerial reconnaissance on the overall area of the northern half of the Republic while flying in day and night in the skies above the area near the military demarcation line. Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets conducted firing [chongpo sagyok] near the DMZ, in front of us. A tank group of the puppet Army was moved and deployed in an area near Kumpa-ri, Paju county on 17 April and fired some 170 tank shells on the banks of the Imjin River. An artillery unit of the puppet Army's occupied a firing position in Yonsan-ri, Kachon county and wielded a war frenzy by randomly shooting some 80 bombshells at areas near the DMZ. On 18 April, after occupying a combat position at Konsol-ri, Yanggu county and at Kojanha-ri, Yonchon county, the puppet armed rascals stirred up a war atmosphere by arbitrarily firing some 1,000 large-caliber gunshots. The war commotion by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets is becoming all the more unscrupulous with the U.S. military leaders' repeated conspiracy with the puppets to plot a war scheme and their dragging in and deploying slaughtering equipments, such as Patriot missiles, to South Korea. It is driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to a grave phase.
