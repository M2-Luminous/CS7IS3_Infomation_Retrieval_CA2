Our navy will, as earlier, serve as the watch-dog of the country", first deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's Navy Admiral Igor Kasatonov said on Thursday. The admiral, who arrived in Murmansk to participate in the northern fleet's military maneuvers, heads the state commission on the preparation for the 300-year anniversary of the Russian fleet. He emphasised that the Russian fleet was created by the whole country, and so the celebration of its anniversary will be not a departmental, but a nation-wide event. Speaking about the military readiness of the country's naval forces, Admiral Kasatonov said, "the results of the first stage of battle training are now being analyzed on all the fleets. On the whole, I am satisfied with them. But there are some things which need to be worked upon. In particular, we need to give our sailors more time on the open sea. I think we will be able to correct that problem during the summer", he said.
