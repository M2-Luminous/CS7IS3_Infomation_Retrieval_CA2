FBIS4-12217 "drnes066_k_94011" FBIS-NES-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 IRAQ U.S. Official's `Absurd Accusation' Criticized U.S. Official's `Absurd Accusation' Criticized JN0604092894 Baghdad INA in Arabic 0840 GMT 6 Apr 94 JN0604092894 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Baghdad, 6 Apr (INA) -- An official spokesman in Baghdad said today the accusation made by U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry yesterday --that the Iraqi Government is behind the killing of several foreigners in the Kurdistan region -- is an absurd accusation. It shows to what extent the U.S. State Department is deliberately seeking to mislead public opinion and not tell it the truth about the deteriorating security situation in that region. The Iraqi spokesman said the Kurdistan region, which is under U.S. protection and control, is rife with thugs, armed men, and thieves. The people there do not dare go out at night or travel between cities and villages. Incidents of killing and robbery by highwaymen in Kurdistan occur almost daily. The spokesman added that the newspapers run by the armed cliques in the Kurdistan region are full of complaints and criticism about the deteriorating security situation. The newspapers daily accuse the Kurdish authority of being unable to control its armed men and from time to time publish reports about armed robberies and holdups committed by those armed men. Sometimes, those armed groups fight over spoils. They also trade accusations in public about who is responsible for the deterioration of security in the region from the warlords in the region, Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani and other leaders of the armed cliques who were armed by the Americans. The Iraqi spokesman added that the U.S. State Department's accusation of the Iraqi Government is clear disinformation and political deception. It is part of the U.S. blind hostility to Iraq.
