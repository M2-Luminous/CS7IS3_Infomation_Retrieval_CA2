The 112 kg of heroin is the largest such bust on the territory of our country. The drug was contained in one kg bags hidden in a special container inside a bus driving on the Turkey-Germany route. In order to find the hiding place, the whole bus had to be taken apart piece by piece. It appears that the head of the network of traffickers was a known figure in the Spanish underworld. It is worth mentioning that the bus with the 112 kg of heroin managed to cross the border; the drugs were discovered and seized in Bucharest.
