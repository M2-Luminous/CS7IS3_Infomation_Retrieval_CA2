Talking to reporters in the federal assembly, Jovanovic stressed that he was not familiar with the crux of the agreement but he nevertheless cautioned that nothing good would come out of the agreement if it constituted a block of two sides in opposition to the third side, the Serbs, along the lines of "take it or leave it." "In that case the agreement would be no contribution to peace -- on the contrary," Jovanovic said. In his words, the signing of the agreement may mean that the Croats and Muslims abandoned "what was agreed at an earlier stage in Geneva." "Depending on the essence of this agreement, the Serbian side will formulate its attitude to it," Jovanovic said.
