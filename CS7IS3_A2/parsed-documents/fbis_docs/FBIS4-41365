Concerning Ukraine's participation in the NATO program Radetskyy said that the Ukrainian army was going to participate in several NATO exercises within the framework of military cooperation. For instance, one company will take part in an exercise in the United States and one platoon will be involved in an exercise in Belgium this autumn. Ukraine joined NATO's program last February. Radetskyy said that financial constraints were the sole brake on contacts under the Partnership for Peace plan. Radetskyy was evasive when asked about statements by the Ukrainian parliamentary speaker that a joint command of the Ukrainian and Russian fleets in the Black Sea was a possibility. Radetskyy believes that the Black Sea Fleet problem is the business of governments and parliaments while "the military must execute decisions made."
