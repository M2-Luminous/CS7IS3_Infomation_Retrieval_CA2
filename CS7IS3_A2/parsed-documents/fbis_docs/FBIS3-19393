Schmidbauer said Iranian Intelligence Minister 'Ali Fallahian had made this unreasonable request to him during talks in October 1993. Schmidbauer, who is responsible for secret service coordination, therefore confirmed the talks with Fallahian, which he had previously disputed, on the background to an attack on 17 September 1992 during a Socialist International congress, in which four exiled Iranian politicians were murdered. During persistent questioning Schmidbauer said he had categorically rejected the Iranian's proposal as it was the job of independent judges in Berlin to rule on the case. He had also said there would be a period of frosty relations between the two states if it emerged that Iran was behind the attack. The case continues.
