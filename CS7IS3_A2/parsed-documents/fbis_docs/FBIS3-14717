This does not mean that the Arab League's friend-or-foe detection system went haywire or felt a sudden surge of love toward Israel, but it is yet another indication of the collapse of inter-Arab solidarity. The Gulf war blew Arab unity to smithereens. The disagreements among the Arab countries worsened in the wake of that war and became more acute as a result of the absence of a charismatic and influential Arab leader. For years hostility toward Israel was the only glue that kept all their conflicting interests together, and now that glue is beginning to come unstuck. Not so much because of our beautiful eyes but because of interests: The Syrians see a chance of getting back the Golan Heights in the context of a peace arrangement and play down their outrage in reaction to the Hebron massacre; 'Arafat sees a rapid implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement as the only chance for his survival; the Gulf states see no reason not to do business with Israel at a time when the "direct confrontation states" -- Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon -- sit around the table to negotiate with Israeli representatives. Although this is a welcome shift, one should not indulge in illusions. It is still a long way between inter-Arab disagreement over the definition of Israel as "the common enemy" and accepting Israel as an observer in the Arab League. A decrease in hostility toward Israel definitely hinges on the rate of progress in the peace process.
