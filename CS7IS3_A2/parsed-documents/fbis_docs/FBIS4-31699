According to his words, Czech firms should be given preference in equipping the Army with modern types of weapons. "In modernizing and reequipping the Army, we are guided by the following basic philosophy: The final supplier will be a Czech company. Only those components will be imported that cannot be manufactured here or for which no one in our country holds a production license. We will have all modernization projects ready by the end of June. The problem lies in disposable resources, that is, in how much money we are going to get from the government and parliament. Money is the absolutely determining factor in modernization. We focus on Czech suppliers, which means that finances invested in the modernization of the army could yield a multiple return because they mean jobs for hundreds of thousands of people. As regards foreign firms that will be interested in cooperating with us by means of joint ventures, licenses, or technology transfers, we want this cooperation to help us secure markets for our products. To put it in simplified terms: 100 pieces will be manufactured, of which the army will take 10 and the rest will be sold abroad. The profit made on those 90 pieces must cover the cost of the army's 10 pieces. This approach means, first, that the army will be equipped with modern weapons; second, that people will have jobs and money will flow into the state coffers from exports; and, third, that money will be saved that would otherwise be spent on restructuring, unemployment, and so forth." [Frydl] Will you tell me with the weapons of which domestic firm the Army will be reequipped? [Baudys] I will not. A quite regular tender will have to take place to determine this. Zbrojovka Cesky Brod is no longer the sole company capable of manufacturing weapons for the Czech Army although, naturally, it is a hot contender. I repeat again: We will have the modernization projects, including priorities, ready by the end of June. Then it will be necessary to conduct a series of talks to determine what we can actually count on. That will be followed by the invitation of tenders and, subsequently, talks with foreign firms. There are areas in which the Czech Republic is traditionally on a top level. One is small arms, the other is aviation technology. The future L-159 fighter plane could become a hit worldwide. Some heavier types of weapons are another area. Here we count on the utilization of our heavy industry, such as Skoda Plzen and others.
