The official stated: "Macroeconomic measures should be included in a market-opening package to be compiled in late March." He stressed that the ruling coalition parties need to make a quick decision on the tax system reform which is currently under discussion. With regard to macroeconomic measures, the idea of increasing the amount of public works spending has now cropped up. However, a U.S. Government official previously said: "Even if the public works program is revised, the U.S. Government will not highly appreciate it." It appears that this U.S. view has been conveyed to the Japanese Government. For this reason, the major point at issue is how the government will spell out its direction in tax system reform. Referring to the possibility of Japan offering to implement [income] tax reductions of 6 trillion yen a year for three consecutive years without deciding on revenue sources to fill in shortfalls therefrom, the senior official insisted the revenue source question should be decided at the same time, saying: "Otherwise, that is tantamount to announcing a plan to issue 18-trillion-yen worth of deficit-covering public bonds." He then added, "Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura who is in charge of finalizing the package, and the Social Democratic Party of Japan should come up with responsible proposals on this," thus serving warning to the two who are reluctant about resolving the two issues at the same time.
