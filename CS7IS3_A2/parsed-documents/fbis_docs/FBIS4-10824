During his first day of official activities in this South American country, Robaina, who arrived yesterday in Lima, outlined his country's situation, problems, and current interest in foreign investments. He said investments must fulfill the needs of capital, technology, and markets within a plan in which Cuba provides raw materials, qualified labor, and infrastructure. Robaina added his country is perfectly aware of the need to create conditions of trust and safety for investors, for which it has already established the prerequisite legal framework. The head of Cuban diplomacy stated his remarks to approximately 100 businessmen who have invested in Cuba despite various obstacles, including the ones concerning the fact the island is learning and adapting to new circumstances. Robaina also reviewed the U.S. blockade, saying Washington is determined to exert pressure on investors so they will desist from investing in Cuba. The visitor said: Eight of every 10 businessmen who want to do business with Cuba become discouraged for this reason. He said his country does not discriminate against the source of foreign investments, but it certainly gives priority to the ones coming from Latin America, because this region is part of its history and geography. The Cuban foreign minister also referred to his country's daily problems and the efforts to forge ahead amid great problems. We do not care whose model it is; we only want it to be Cuban and feasible, said Robaina, who ruled out a possible automatic transfer of experience from other states to the island, although he said his nation takes the good things from others. The Cuban minister's statement led to questions from the Peruvian businessmen. The questions indicated their interest in possible investments in Cuba and their doubts about transportation, investments, financial operations, and other issues. Robaina is visiting Peru during a Latin American tour which includes Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay. His agenda here, until tomorrow, includes meetings with Efrain Goldenberg, foreign minister, and Jaime Yoshiyama, president of the Democratic Constituent Congress.
