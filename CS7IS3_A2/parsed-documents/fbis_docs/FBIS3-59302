A provincial official in charge of transport said that this south-east China Province had already spent about 700 million yuan on laying 400 kilometers of roadbed this year. "The high-grade highway in the province will be extended by 241 kilometers by the end of this year," the official said. Fujian is one of the provinces which piloted in the reforms and opening further to the outside world, and its economy has developed more rapidly over the past decade and more. But its economic development has been hampered by poor transport facilities due to historical factors and geographic conditions. To solve the bottleneck problem, Fujian last year decided to invest more in highway construction. According to the decision, the province would build a 400- kilometer-long expressway running from Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, to Xiamen, one of China's special economic zones, and Zhangzhou in the southern province, and upgrade and expand five national and one provincial highways and a number of trunk highways to form a transport network.
