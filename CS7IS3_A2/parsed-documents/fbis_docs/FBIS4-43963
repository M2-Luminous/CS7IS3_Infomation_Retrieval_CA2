Until the cease-fire between the KDP and PUK was signed earlier this week, violent clashes erupted dividing the two groups and creating an atmosphere of instability in the area. All the while, the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is outlawed in Turkey, had been stepping up its own efforts to seize the initiative in the region. In fact, Turkey is worried that the PKK might be manipulating the conflict by providing aid to the PUK. This fear reportedly led Turkish officials to warn the PUK not to collaborate with the PKK during the KDP-PUK meeting held in the Turkish border town of Silopi on Monday [6 June]. Despite Turkish worries, the PKK has maintained that it is making considerable efforts to end the clashes between the feuding Kurdish groups in northern Iraq. Yet it is clear that the PKK has been exploiting the instability caused by the clashes to expand their activities and influence in the region, by holding meetings, making declarations and distributing propaganda in favor of the organization's separatist ideology. Their targets are the Turkish fugitives that supposedly fled the fighting in southeastern Turkey to find safer havens in the border towns of northern Iraq. The PKK apparently sees the Turkish refugees as a valuable resource and potential force to be tapped into in the future. Sources close to the PKK have confirmed this view, saying that the refugees could later join in the PKK's struggle against the Turkish state. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, trying to draw attention to his organization, asserted that the problem of the Kurds is now an international problem and added that the establishment of peace in the region depended on the resolution of the Kurdish problem in Turkey. He also claimed that the people of the "North" and those of the "South" had united following the migration of Kurdish-origin Turks to northern Iraq. Taking his vision of a united "North" and "South" one step further, Ocalan introduced the concept of a "Greater Kurdistan" and reportedly contacted the KDP and PUK in an attempt to interest them in the idea. After the emigration of approximately 20,000 Kurds from the regions of Turkey close to the border, neutral observers say that these emigrants might join in the clashes in the future. "These people, who fled when their villages and their houses were burnt down, are already living through a war. Most of their children are among the guerrillas and they might join in the fighting too," say the sources. Whether they do or not remains to be seen, but it is obvious that Turkey will have some difficult questions to answer when international talks on the 20,000 emigrants begin. The PKK aims to gain strength in the North with the migration to Northern Iraq. All the migrants are people whose houses and villages had been demolished in military operations and who are claimed by Turkish officers to be supporters of the PKK. It is most likely that such people will be force into the arms of the PKK. The PKK is in a difficult situation after the destruction of the villages from which the organization obtains most of its logistic support. Its declared aim of concentrating its activities in areas known as "pilot regions," fits with the strategy of a "Greater Kurdistan." It is known that the PKK is in agreement and collaboration with the PUK and that the KDP is much concerned by this collaboration. Turkey shares the same feelings as the KDP, as the Peshmergas of the KDP are not skilled in warfare. Indeed, the PKK has a clear superiority over both the KDP and the PUK in this sense and this is the underlying reason for all the anxiety. In addition to this, the Turkish military faces problems in initiating operations in Northern Iraq as the PKK shifts its forces there. The migration of people from border regions to deep inside Iraqi territory will make matters even worse. It is even predicted that the UN might intervene with the situation in such a state of confusion. Another development that gives encouragement to the PKK is the interest shown by certain groups within the KDP towards the PKK. It was stated that the Peshmergas that were sent to the Turkish border began cooperating with the PKK 2-3 months later and that the situation deteriorated as more Peshmergas arrived in the region. Rumors said that around 600 families were to emigrate from Halepce to Turkey because of the clashes between the KDP and the PUK. Even though they have not been ascertained, these rumors are in accord with Ocalan's declarations. Ocalan says, "There are Northerners who went to the South. The North has already united with the South." This statement reflects the primary condition of the PKK for the application of the strategy for a "Greater Kurdistan." The important thing for PKK members is not the action taken by the leaders or the organizations but the relations between peoples. Significantly, the PKK have left a door open to the KDP. "We do not want everything for ourselves. The important thing is the harmony between the ideals for Kurdistan. We would even support Barzani if he achieves this. The important thing is unity," they say. The PKK hopes to profit from the situation created as the groups in the KDP that regard the PKK with sympathy put pressure on Barzani. The PKK claims that the establishment of peace in the Middle East depends on a solution to the Kurdish problem, now assuming the dimensions of an international issue. For that reason the PKK is trying to seize the initiative in Northern Iraq. However, if we consider that four large countries--Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria-- are involved in this issue, we can only wait and see whether these efforts will succeed or not. We ought to deliver PUK leader Talabani's message: "Do not fear our collaboration with the PKK." The region continually gives birth to new developments. In Turkey one hears the words, "PKK members are also our children." Could this be interpreted as a good omen?
