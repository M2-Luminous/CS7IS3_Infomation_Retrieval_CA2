And perhaps the only question to which the answers will be different is: "Why is the bloc being created?" Literally a year from now we will become witnesses to the birth of a new alliance -- the Baltic Alliance. And this is not a prediction but a visible prospect. So, this question is already appropriate: "Why?" We Have Sent A Note to NATO As had been anticipated, a sensation due to Lithuania's entry into NATO did not occur. But President Algirdas Brazauskas' official request, which was sent to the North Atlantic Organization at the beginning of this year, once again confirmed the strategic goals not only of that country but also of the Baltic states as a whole. In the middle of December, the general opinion that only NATO is capable of guaranteeing the security of the Baltic republics was expressed at a meeting in Tallinn of the three presidents -- Algirdas Brazauskas, Guntis Ulmanis and Lennart Meri. It is erroneous to think that these conclusions were arrived at under the influence of the "Zhironovskiy factor" in the Russian parliamentary elections. We think that this is only a reason for the outcome because, in a joint statement on the meeting's results, even the presidents stressed that attempts for a rapprochement with NATO arose, not under the influence of the elections in Russia, but because the Baltic countries have already been long interested "in closer ties" with that military bloc. It is characteristic that last summer and autumn we saw in local politics the banner of the creation of a regional security system. And the priorities of cooperation began to be seen more clearly as winter approached. At a meeting of the armed forces (defense forces) Commanders-in-Chief of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and this was in October, it was announced for the first time that the Baltic states need their own "Baltic NATO". And the need to create a "unified Baltic countries military system according to the NATO type" was officially confirmed already at the prime ministers December meeting. According to certain data, they plan to sign a comprehensive treaty on a defensive alliance already at the end of this year, immediately after, as they think here, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia. And during the time remaining they propose developing a package of specific agreements in the military sphere which will help to immediately begin the realization of the main treaty. Now obviously the time has come to answer the question: "Why is the new bloc being created?" Lithuanian Minister of National Defense Linas Linkyavichyus expressed that most frankly when he said in a national television interview that the Baltic countries "should not knock at the door of the collective security system with their hands extended" but that they need to have their own effective military structures which will then be added to NATO. One Battalion Is Already Standing Roll Call What documents already exist? The Lithuanian Ministry of National Defense had already prepared one of the drafts of the treaty on military cooperation during the summer and it was sent to the Latvian and Estonian ministries of defense. It provides for the creation of a unified air defense system, joint protection of ground and maritime borders, and the exchange of operational information. Furthermore, it is considered advisable to have a common training facility to train troops and a Baltic arms development and production program. For now we know that on the whole the Lithuanian draft was supported by its neighbors. They decided to create a "hot line" between the three ministers of defense and to exchange military attaches as "operational measures", and they also planned to strengthen the eastern borders in the near future. They plan to discuss these problems in more detail in January at the prime ministers meeting in Riga. It is understandable that the development of military cooperation will primarily depend upon the level of "rapprochement of the politicians". Right now a working group has been created to develop the charter of the Baltic countries presidential council. (A statute on the Baltic Assembly, a distinctive Baltic parliament, has already been adopted --Authors' comment). Later, as usual, the creation of all of the vertical structures of the new alliance will begin. Analysts agree that only the proposals on the organs of military command and control could cause serious disagreements. If you take the Lithuanian variant as a basis, you can hardly restrict yourself to the armed forces Commanders-in-Chiefs conference (council). A permanent organ in the form of a unified command authority will most likely be required. But even this diagram is not at all flawless. If, for example, you count on the entry of the Baltic republics into the North Atlantic Organization in the relatively near future, the organs of joint command and control that are being created will simply remain unnecessary. Well for the time being the politicians have only begun to discuss the problems of a military alliance and the military personnel themselves have already taken part in the matter. The October commanders-in-chief meeting that was mentioned here made a joint decision on the creation of a "Baltic Battalion" by the end of 1994 which will then be placed at the disposal of UN peacekeeping forces. Diagram of One Possible Variant of the Future Alliance They plan to deploy the battalion at Alitus (Lithuania). It will have a strength of 650 men. The structure: command structure, staff and three companies (Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian). A Lithuanian officer will become the commander, a Latvian officer will be deputy commander, and an Estonian officer will be chief of staff. The leadership and staff will be changed annually. They plan three exercises, an infantry company from each country will participate, in order to create the battalion this year. But what if the UN does not require this battalion? Or if the leaders of the three countries do not decide on the participation of this subunit in peacekeeping operations? Estonian Defense Forces Commander-in-Chief Major-General Aleksander Eynseli thinks that even if the politicians do not determine their positions, the creation of the battalion will become "one more step toward the military cooperation of three countries". But CNN Will Be the First To Arrive to Assist As we know, any military alliance assumes that armies are structured on approximately identical principles. But if Estonia has already begun the transition to NATO standards (it concluded a contract for the delivery of $50 million worth of Israeli arms -- small-arms and antitank weapons, light air defense systems, etc.), Latvia is counting primarily on "humanitarian weapons assistance" from Germany and Sweden, and for now Lithuania is oriented toward Russian arms. In the future, Lithuania intends to resolve part of its own light weapons needs using its own resources. An experimental enterprise to produce military output ("Vityaz-2" machine-pistols, hand grenades, etc.) has been created based on Kaunas NII [Scientific Research Institute] of Construction and Architecture. Estonia plans to independently produce small-arms ammunition according to NATO standards. There are differences in the organization of the armed forces and "standardization" must entail changes in legislation. Time will be required to do that. Enormous resources will have to be spent on the creation of an air defense system and on real air forces that are practically nonexistent right now. The budgets of all three countries are incapable of supporting these costs. So, the new alliance's capabilities "to support defense" will not emerge from the purely political sphere for a long time yet. It is no accident that one Finnish analyst has noted without irony in this regard: "It would probably be more correct to characterize the current strategic doctrine of the Baltic states as defense oriented on CNN. The idea consists of the need to defend yourself... until the entire world is able to learn that you have been subjected to attack". But you can rest assured that the Baltic states will not have to carry out this "dream". Indeed, the impression has formed that Latvia and Estonia are increasingly proceeding from Russia's allegedly inherent hostility toward them in their international policy. So one can anticipate that they will also begin to utilize the new alliance in order to present themselves, as before, as "hostages" of their Eastern neighbor. And then appeals will follow to fill the existing "security vacuum" with the assistance of the Western states. As for Lithuania, while submitting a request for entry into NATO, it especially stipulated in advance that its desire is not directed against third countries. But even Baltic military integration, in which Lithuania has been quite definite, will inevitably affect the displacement of the Baltic region states' cooperation with the West in the military sphere. And this can already be considered to be a challenge to Russia. The First Measures For the Creation of a Military Alliance: -- establishment of a "hot line" between the ministers of defense; -- obligations to strengthen the states' eastern borders; -- the exchange of military attaches; -- the conduct of joint exercises (February 1994 -- on the territory of Estonia, July 1994 -- on the territory of Lithuania; October 1994 -- on the territory of Latvia) in the context of creating a unified "Baltic Battalion"; -- monthly meetings of the heads of the main staffs (in the beginning of January 1994 in Tallinn, they discussed the specific problems of the formation of the "Baltic Battalion" and they will next meet on 14-15 February in Riga).
