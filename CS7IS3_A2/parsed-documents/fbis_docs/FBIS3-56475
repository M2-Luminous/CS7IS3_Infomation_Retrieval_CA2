FBIS3-56475 "drsov011_b_94063" FBIS-SOV-94-011 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Jan 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues `Sources' View New Government Posts, Structure LD1501194694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1457 GMT 15 Jan 94 LD1501194694 Moscow INTERFAX Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Yuriy Yarov will apparently retain their present posts of vice premiers in Russia's government and Yegor Gaydar and Oleg Soskovets will remain on the posts of first vice premiers, reported sources in the apparatus of the Russian government who preferred to stay anonymous. They are convinced that on January 18 Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will call these names along with the name of Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, who has already been appointed to this post by a presidential decree, as Chernomyrdin promised at the meeting with the Federal Assembly deputies - heads of administrations on previous Friday. The same sources drew attention of Interfax to the fact that federal executive bodies, including 23 ministries and 44 state committees, committees, departments, federal services and agencies (their list is applied to Yeltsin's decree "On Structure of Federal Executive Bodies" dated January 10) have been distributed according to the principle of "five verticals." According to the sources, "these verticals" will be spread among functions of vice premiers as follows (according to the order in which ministries and departments were presented in the supplement to the presidential decree on corresponding ministries and departments): - Oleg Soskovets will be entrusted with monitoring of federal bodies' structures by the first of the "verticals" - fuel and energy complex, transport and communication, construction and architecture, industrial policy and defense industry, metallurgy and machine building, chemical and oil-chemical industry, space agency; - Yegor Gaydar will be in charge of economics and finances, foreign economic relations, and cooperation with CIS countries, antimonopoly policy and support to new economic structures, management of state property, customs and tax services, currency and export control, extraction, production, and export of precious metals and stones; - the issues of education, science, and culture, labor and employment, social security, youth's problems, physical culture and tourism, mass media and cinematography, migration and archive services will be conferred on Yuriy Yarov; - along with the issues of the agricultural industrial complex Aleksandr Zaveryukha will be responsible for the problems of trade, environmental and natural resources security, land survey and cartography, hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring; - and, finally, President Yeltsin will apparently take responsibility for the fifth, "power vertical," that is beginning with defense, foreign and domestic affairs and ending with nuclear and radiation security, report the same sources in the governmental circles. Consequently, the number of deputies of the chairman of the RF government, including the two first deputies, will not exceed four, as it was foreseen in the presidential decree "On Structure of Federal Executive Bodies." As far as Chubays is concerned, he is not included into the "big four" determined by this decree but according to one of the next presidential decrees was appointed additionally to them. This is "an absolutely logical move," believe the sources in the Cabinet, "because his major responsibility - privatization - is a process underway in Russia which is to be concluded earlier or later." Sources in the governmental apparatus do not rule out possibility of slight changes in distribution of duties between the future vice premiers.
