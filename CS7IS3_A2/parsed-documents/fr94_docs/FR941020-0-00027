FR941020-0-00027 FR941020-0-00008 III. Director's Findings Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendment to the Indiana program. Nonsubstantive word changes and paragraph notation changes also appear in the final adopted version of amendment # 93&hyph;2. However, only the substantive changes are discussed below. 1. 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5‚ê£Petition for Review; Response Indiana is making numerous changes to this section. Subsection 5(c) is reworded to provide that when the director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) determines that a permit issued pursuant to IC 13&hyph;4.1 and 310 IAC 12 should be suspended or revoked, the director of the IDNR (or a delegate of the director) shall issue to the permittee an order to show cause why the permit should not be revoked or suspended. Deleted from this paragraph is reference to IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3&hyph;8. This deletion does not render the provision less effective because IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3 continues to be cited at subsection 5(g)(1) for the procedures to be followed if an answer is filed by the permittee concerning a show cause order. The Director finds that these changes are consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 843.13(a)(1) concerning pattern of violations. In subsection 5(c)(2), the words ``alleged in the order to show cause'' are added after the word ``violations.'' In subsection 5(c)(2)(B) a reference to the Indiana surface coal mining regulations at 310 IAC 12 is added at the end of the sentence. The Director finds that these changes are consistent with 30 CFR 843.13(a). In subsection 5(e), the first sentence is reworded by referring to ``an order to show cause.'' The word ``service'' is deleted and replaced by ``permittee's receipt of the order to show cause.'' The Director finds these changes to be consistent with 30 CFR 843.14 concerning service. Subsection 5(e)(1) is amended by deleting the words ``as described in'' following the word ``violations.'' Reference to 310 IAC 12 is added following the second reference to IC 13&hyph;4.1. The Director finds these changes improve the clarity of the provision and are consistent with 43 CFR 4.1192(a), regarding answers to show cause orders.
