Speaking at a gathering of U.S. businessmen hosted by the U.S.- China Business Council here, Zou said that over the 15 years since China and the United States established diplomatic relations, despite ups and downs, difficulties and disputes, the overall relations between the two countries have moved forward with exchanges and cooperation in various fields on constant increase. The world has undergone some major and profound changes in the past few years, but the importance of Sino-U.S. relations remains unchanged. They have extensive shared interests and common responsibility in many areas such as safeguarding world peace and stability, ensuring a secure and prosperous Asia-Pacific region, promoting global economic prosperity and bringing about a better environment. One outstanding feature of the post-Cold War world, he said, is that all countries have given their top priority to economic development. Asia-Pacific region, by maintaining the best growth records for years running, has caught attention in the world. On the other hand, he added, international economic competition, as seen in fierce rivalry for market shares, has become increasingly heated. New opportunities and new challenges keep presenting themselves one after another. Under such circumstances, he stressed, it behooves both China and the United States to seize the opportune moment by pushing vigorously for exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology. "This is not only in the fundamental interest of the two peoples, but also contributes to peace, stability, prosperity and progress of the world at a large," he noted. Speaking of bilateral trade, mutual investment, and economic and technological cooperation, Zou said, in 1993, Sino-U.S. trade volume reached 27.65 billion U.S. dollars according to Chinese customs statistics, which was an increase of more than ten times over 1979, with China's imports from the United States up by 20.1 percent over the previous year. The United States has retained its place as China's third largest trade partner. In terms of investment volume, the United States still leads other overseas investors. By the end of last year, the contractual value of U.S. investment in China had totalled 11 billion U.S. dollars, and the number of U.S. funded projects surpassed more than 8,000. More than half of American investment in China was made by large companies and their projects are large in scale, high in technological standards and quite profitable. Facts have shown, Zou said, that it is entirely possible for countries of different social systems and ideologies to actively develop economic and technological cooperation to the benefit of both sides. Zou maintained that the differences between China and the United States in the economic and trade fields are being ironed out gradually with the signing of a number of memorandums of understanding in 1992. "What I want to emphasize is that the Chinese Government will, as always, honor its commitment in accordance with the requirements of the three memorandums of understanding. We hope that the U.S. Government will also strictly honor its commitment. In our view, all the problems between us can be resolved by way of negotiation and consultation as long as the two sides abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit." He promised that China's sustained and rapid economic growth and its ambitious development program will surely bring about more opportunities for the American business community. For example, every year China imports from the United States large quantities of wheat, aircraft, computers, chemical fertilizer, cotton, paper, pulp, machinery, electronic equipment and equipment for chemical and petroleum industries. It is expected that from now to the year 2000, China will import one trillion U.S. dollars worth of commodities from the international market. "We hope that American businessmen will take up a larger share of that import," Zou said. However, he reminded the audience that competition among the world's major powers in the Chinese market is very intense. Advanced technology and equipment and fine service alone are not enough. "They must be accompanied by a long-term, stable and harmonious environment for cooperation in the economic and trade field," he said. "Frankly speaking," he pointed out, "American business people are not as advantageously placed as their counterparts in Europe and Japan. It is very clear that the annual dispute over the MFN status causes serious damage to the development of economic and trade ties between our two countries." Then he stressed that the mutual granting of MFN status is the foundation stone for Sino-American economic and trade relations. If this is undermined, it will do serious damage to the economies and trade of the two countries and to the interests of their consumers." He deemed it the duty of the Chinese and U.S. governments to encourage and support business people of the two countries to conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, thus creating favorable conditions for closer bilateral relations. He stated that the Chinese Government always attaches importance to the relations with the United States and has made tremendous and effective efforts to improve and develop them. Facts have proved, he added, that "so long as the two sides act in accordance with the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, bear in mind the larger picture, stand on high ground and extend the vision, we will be able to rise above the present differences and bring bilateral relations back on track soon for a healthy development, thus contributing to stability and prosperity in the Pacific rim and the world at large."
