XINHUA, however, did not say whether the North Korean nuclear crisis, which has escalated into an international controversy, was mentioned in the meeting. President Jiang Zemin received a visit by a North Korean military delegation, led by Chief of General Staff of the People's Army Choe Kwang, at his office and described Beijing-Pyongyang ties as "interdependent, like teeth and lips," according to XINHUA. Strengthening and developing the bilateral friendship remains a firm policy of the Chinese party and Government and the wish of the party and the people, Jiang was quoted as saying. Choe, noting he came to China as bilateral relations are deepening, said it is also the position of the North Korean Nodong (Workers') Party to build the two nations' friendship for generations to come. XINHUA said Choe conveyed greetings from North Korean supreme leader Kim Il-song and his heir-apparent, son Chong-il. President Jiang reciprocated with greetings to the two Kims. Choe and his military delegation arrived in Beijing on Monday for a week-long visit and met Zhang Wannian, chief of general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They also met with Chi Haotian, Chinese national defense minister, after their talks with Jiang and attended a dinner hosted by Chi. Despite the notable absence of the nuclear problem in the Jiang-Choe talks, Western diplomatic sources said the Chinese leadership will warn North Korea of the chance of war on the Korean peninsula in case of U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang while explaining the tense moves within the United States and the United Nations regarding the nuclear issue. China's leaders will try to drive home the seriousness of the present situation to the North Korean military, especially since Choe wields considerable influence, the sources said. They will convey Beijing's position that in order to seek a solution through dialogue, North Korea must immediately stop unloading fuel rods from its nuclear reactor, they said.
