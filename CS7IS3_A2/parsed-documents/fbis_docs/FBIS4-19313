In a wide-ranging foreign policy speech at the Mansion House in London, he lamented the narrowness of current political argument in Britain, typified by the fracas over Maastricht and voting rights in Europe. Mr Hurd said: "While we dispute among ourselves, we risk failing to notice how the world is changing." He said the country ran the risk of "intellectual shrinkage -- as if we despaired of convincing anybody of anything, as if we simply wanted to devise ways of protecting ourselves against a Europe and a world which was bound to run against us." He said: "This is negative and damaging nonsense. This country has been, ought to be, can be, a powerhouse of ideas about the future of Europe and more widely about the relationship between states and international institutions. We cannot pick and choose to which continent we belong. We cannot stop the world in order to get off." Mr Hurd said Britain's influence remained strong across the world -- in Europe, where "our wholehearted involvement is essential," increasingly in South America, in India and Australasia, in southern Africa and in the Far East despite recent disputes with China and Malaysia. Mr Hurd said he wanted the European Union to be more than merely a single market but one that defined its limits, was more sensitive to its citizens and which stopped seeking to take more powers to the centre. The Foreign Secretary also made a renewed pitch for a rapprochement with Malaysia, following the breach in trade links caused by British press reports about alleged corruption in the Malaysian Government. The Trade and Industry Department hopes to send a ministerial trade mission to Malaysia before the end of the year as part of a push for business in the Far East, Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said last night.
