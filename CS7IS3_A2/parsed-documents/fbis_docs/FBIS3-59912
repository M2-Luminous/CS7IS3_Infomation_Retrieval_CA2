One of the main issues will be the fate of Baykonur. Under the May 1992 agreement signed by Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev, the cosmodrome is a troop formation of the Russian military space forces. While it is in joint use, 94 percent of the cost of maintaining it is borne by Russia, which effectively remains its master. All launches of "Proton" rockets and commercial launches are carried out from Baykonur, as at present they cannot be carried out from Russia's "Plesetsk" cosmodrome. To construct a new facility capable of replacing Baykonur would take Russia at least seven years, plus enormous sums that the Moscow treasury currently does not have. Kazakhstan is unable either to service or to operate Baykonur, but nevertheless it would like to gain the status of a space power and is presenting new conditions to Russia. It established its own aerospace agency and put forward the idea of setting up on the basis of Baykonur an international company with the involvement of Ukraine and other countries. Moscow turned this down and stated that it is prepared to lease Baykonur from Kazakhstan. Before leaving for Almaty, Viktor Chernomyrdin received a letter from his Kazakhstan counterpart, Sergey Tereshchenko, saying that Kazakhstan agrees in principle to this option, but is asking for an excessive sum from Russia -- several billion dollars a year for the right to use Baykonur. We were told at the Russian Space Agency that in this instance Kazakhstan's appetites exceed not only Russia's capabilities but all headings of the Baykonur budget. And this is despite the fact that the space research carried out at Baykonur has never yielded revenue. The problem of Baykonur is closely linked with the problem of the status of the Russian Army on Kazakhstan's territory. At present the Russian servicemen at the cosmodrome, and also at other facilities, incidentally, have the status of foreigners. There is no treaty on military cooperation between Moscow and Almaty. It is quite possible that the leasing of Baykonur would set a precedent whereby all other Russian military facilities in nearby foreign countries would be regarded as bases for which payment should be made. At present Kazakhstan merely keeps an eye on order at Baykonur and sees to it that nothing goes missing from this large facility. It has introduced customs controls, posted military guards, expropriated a number of Russian Army buildings and offices, and carried out a careful inventory of all property.
