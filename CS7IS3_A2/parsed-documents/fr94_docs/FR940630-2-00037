FR940630-2-00037 FR940630-2-00036 [OPP&hyph;30365; FRL&hyph;4869&hyph;6] Acetochlor Registration Partnership; Approval of Pesticide Product Registrations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Acetochlor Registration Partnership, to conditionally register the pesticide products Acetochlor Technical and Acetochlor EC containing new active ingredients not included in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Robert Taylor, Product Manager (PM) 25, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 241, CM #2, Environmental Protection Agency, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;6800). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA received applications from Acetochlor Registration Partnership (c/o ICI Americas and Zeneca Agricultural Products) P.O. Box 751, Wilmington, DE 19897, to conditionally register the herbicide products Acetochlor Technical and Acetochlor EC (EPA Registration Numbers 66478&hyph;1 and 66478&hyph;2) containing the active ingredients acetochlor, 2-chloro- N -(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)acetamide and acetochlor 2-chloro-2'-methyl-6'-ethyl- N -ethoxymethylacetanilide at 92 and 81.15 percent~ respectively, active ingredients not included in any previously registered products. Both products contain a different formulation of the chemical acetochlor. However, since the notice of receipt of applications did not publish in the Federal Register , as required by section 3(c)(4) of FIFRA, as amended, interested parties may submit written comments within 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. The applications were approved on March 11, 1994, as Acetochlor Technical for formulation of herbicide products only (EPA Reg. No. 66478&hyph;1) and for restricted use of Acetochlor EC for use on (corn) field, silage, and pop (EPA Reg. No. 66478&hyph;2). ~~ A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of acetochlor~~, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that use of acetochlor~~ ~~during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that this conditional registration is in the public interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions, and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment. More detailed information on this conditional registration is contained in a Chemical Fact Sheet on acetochlor~~. ~~ A copy of the fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;305&hyph;5805). Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed to the Freedom of Information Office (A&hyph;101), 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Such requests should: (1) Identify the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information desired. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 136.
