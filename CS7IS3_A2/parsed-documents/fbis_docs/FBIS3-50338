In Simic's assessment, today's meeting is paving the way toward the realization of the joint declaration signed by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia two weeks ago in Geneva. Two exceptionally important proposals were made concrete today: To set up a joint commission under the aegis of international humanitarian organizations (ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] and UNHCR). Deputy Prime Minister Simic laid special emphasis on the beginning of regular visits by highest-ranking officials from Belgrade and Zagreb, which in practice starts on 12 February when the FRY deputy prime minister will be received by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. In Simic's opinion, this will, at the same time, be an inaugural meeting of the Commission for Missing Persons. Serbian-Croatian relations can be successfully resolved only through bilateral efforts and this is an example of how to tackle the crisis in former Yugoslavia, said the Yugoslav deputy prime minister, concluding his statement for TANJUG.
