Speaking at the All-Russian conference of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service [FCIS] in Moscow on Thursday, he pointed out that "violent crimes by organized groups take the form of criminal terrorism." In Yeltsin's words, "the corruption of power structures, law-enforcement and other state bodies especially in the sphere of redistribution of property is extremely dangerous for the state." The Russian president noted that "organized crime is already not confined to the sphere of regular crimes. It seeks to enter big politics, to gain access to ruling the state and its regions." The FCIS should prevent such attempts with all of its operational and technical potential, Yeltsin said. "In interaction with the Interior Ministry and tax police it is necessary to reveal criminal sources, the financing of political campaigns, ties of state and political figures with organizers of criminal gangs which seek to have their people in state bodies, and are subsidized from abroad," he pointed out. The president noted that Russia's nuclear safety is an extremely important problem. "We should prevent proliferation of nuclear and other arms of mass annihilation all over the country and abroad," he noted. Yeltsin believes that the counter-intelligence bodies should be outside politics. As for its servicemen they cannot combine their work with political activities, i.e. to serve the interests of a party or a public organization.
