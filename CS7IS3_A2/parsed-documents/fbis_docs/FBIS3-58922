Since then it has hardly reappeared, to the point that many people probably believed it had been buried. But this was not the case. In fact, the project has reached the stage of active preparation among Defense Ministry advisors. Leo Delcroix will present the cabinet with a document on the subject next month. Most of the material was ready last December, but the social situation, more than tense at the time, was hardly propitious for the project's advancement. Supply and Demand What is in the document? There is no doubt that any obligatory and/or unpaid formula will be avoided. The possibility of civic, social or cultural service will be addressed to volunteers and will include payment at least comparable to that given to conscripts, but there will be no wages (with their share of social payments, pension payments, etc.). Although Delcroix has been made responsible by his colleagues for clearing the terrain, the formula is not linked specifically to the Defense Ministry. The Army will be only one of the sectors open to those entering the scheme. In the Army scheme, they will be able to follow in-depth training in an active unit and then can be added to the reserves. In addition, there will be a considerable range of social or cultural positions which could be filled. "The question is to create a demand which meets the supply of young people who want to put their ideals at the disposal of society," they say at the Defense Ministry. Reserves A scheme of this sort, for which no budget has been fixed, nevertheless raises reservations in some circles. Besides the fact that no real equivalent exists abroad, Delcroix will obviously have work to do in convincing sceptics that he is not seeking to form a new low social category or a way of getting unemployed people to work. On Tuesday [18 January], when questioned by Ecolo [French-speaking Green Party] MP Philippe Dallons in Parliament, the minister stated that the service would last for a short period, its start-up would not be linked to the problem of employment and the objective would be to counter social problems which presently have no ideal solution. Evidently, joint action with the language communities and regions will be necessary, but the framework will be set at the federal level. Insofar as there is agreement with its aim.
