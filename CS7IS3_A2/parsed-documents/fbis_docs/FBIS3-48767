The coalition made the decision at a meeting of leaders of the seven coalition partners after Yuichi Ichikawa, a chief negotiator for the coalition, just before midnight declared an end to a series of talks in a joint Diet committee. The committee, comprised of members of both houses of the Diet, was discussing salvaging the government reform package. However, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told reporters the joint Diet panel still continues to exist and that his party will not agree to hold a summit meeting while panel talks continue. Lower house speaker Takako Doi urged Ichikawa to continue efforts to reach a compromise in the joint Diet panel. The coalition and the LDP are far apart over the electoral and political reform bills and if a top meeting between Hosokawa and Kono is held, the prospect of reaching an accord is dim, political analysts said. If Hosokawa and Kono fail to reach a compromise, the coalition will put the package to a floor vote a second time at a plenary session of the House of Representatives to seek a two-thirds majority vote to enact the bills. The package cleared the lower house last November but was voted down by the House of Councillors last Friday. Although the LDP is divided over electoral reform bills, the coalition will fail to secure a two-thirds majority vote in the lower house, political analysts said. The coalition will need some 70 rebels from the LDP to secure a two-thirds majority. If the package is killed, Hosokawa will be forced to make his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for a snap general election, they said. Hosokawa said Thursday he will not to cling to power if he fails to achieve political reform by Saturday's closure of the current Diet session.
