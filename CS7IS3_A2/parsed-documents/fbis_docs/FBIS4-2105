In reviewing the 1993 procuratorial work, he said: Last year, under the leadership of the provincial party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the supervision of the provincial people's congress standing committee, procuratorial organs across the province conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the work plans of the provincial party committee and the provincial people's procuratorate, and the resolutions of the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress, adopted a series of measures to intensify the legal supervisory functions, made overall plans for procuratorial work in line with the principle of "enforcing laws strictly and handling cases relentlessly," concentrated efforts on handling major and appalling economic offenses on corruption and bribery, dealt strict blows to serious criminal activities, investigated and handled criminal cases on infringing upon the democratic rights of citizens and dereliction of duty, strengthened supervision over law enforcement, made new achievements, and played a positive role in safeguarding Liaoning's political and social stability, guaranetting the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, and promoting the development of the socialist market economy. 1. We Participated Actively in the Anticorruption Struggle and Handled a Number of Economic Criminal Cases on Corruption and Bribery [subhead] In 1993, procuratorial organs across the province achieved a fairly great success in fighting corruption and bribery. They accepted 4,996 economic criminal cases on corruption and bribery during the year, an increase of 30.9 percent over the previous year, 2,299 cases of which had been filed for investigation, up 20.7 percent. Of these cases, 1,211 were criminal cases on corruption and bribery, 598 of which were cases involving over 10,000 yuan but less than 100,000 yuan, 51 involved over 100,000 yuan but less than 500,000 yuan, and five involved over 500,000 yuan but less than 1 million yuan, and two involved more than 1 million yuan; of the 583 cases of misappropriation of public funds, 27 involved over 500,000 yuan; and a number of these cases involving 77 cadres at and above the county section level were filed for investigation and handling, showing an increase of 89.7 percent. During the year, 955 economic criminals were prosecuted by procuratorial organs. Through handling the aforementioned cases, illicit money and bribes totalling over 111.35 million yuan Renminbi were recovered, an increase of 44.14 percent over the previous year. On 21 October last year, after the issuance of the major plan for anticorruption struggle worked out by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission on behalf of the party Central Committee, procuratorial cadres and policemen across the province rapidly participated in the anticorruption struggle, gave priorities to investigating and handling cases on corruption and bribery that emerged in party and government organs, judicial departments, administrative law enforcing departments, and economic management departments, and concentrated energy on handling major and appalling cases well. Crime report work was actively strengthened. In four months, procuratorial organs across the province processed 11,237 clues reported by the people, an increase of 130 percent over the total of the previous eight months, or an increase of 450 percent over the same period of the previous year. We implemented a system in which chief procurators assumed responsibility for handling cases and a system of sharing responsibilies among all levels, strengthened unified command and coordination, and concentrated energy on cracking a great number of major and appalling cases. In four months, we filed 418 major cases each involving corruption or bribery of over 10,000 yuan or misappropriation of over 50,000 yuan in public funds for investigation and prosecution, an increase of 32.28 percent over the same period of last year; and investigated and handled 59 criminal cases involving cadres at and above county and regimental levels, an increase of 15 times over the same period of last year. Chief procurators of many procuratorates took the lead in taking meals and living at the organs or in places where the cases occurred, led procuratorial cadres and policemen to work overtime, and investigated cases round the clock. Through the painstaking efforts of procuratorial cadres and policemen across the province, we witnessed a good start in the anticorruption struggle and achieved initial results in this aspect. A. We investigated and handled a large number of criminal cases committed by the functionaries of party and government organs and particularly by leading cadres with regard to embezzlement and bribe-taking. The number of such criminal cases reached 251 and showed a 72-percent increase over 1992. What was startling and appalling was the case uncovered by the Tieling city people's procuratorate, in which the criminal ring on the grain front of Changtu County embezzled and diverted public funds, received bribes, and evaded taxes. During their tenure, Gui Bingquan, director of the county grain bureau, and Yang Maoyuan, deputy director of the county grain bureau, caused great losses of almost 100 million yuan to the state by accepting bribes in order to satisfy their personal desires. They were greatly generous at the state's expense by spending the state's subsidies to the grain front at will and issuing orders on several hundred occasions to various grains depots to buy various equipment whose quality was poor but whose prices were high. Thus, a large number of relevant personnel illegally made a large amount of money from buying these equipment whose prices were, several, tens, or dozens of times higher than the originals. The city people's procuratorate put the cases committed by 30 functionaries on record; arrested 17 personnel, including Gui Bingquan, Yang Maoyuan, and Xu Lianzhong, vice chairman of the county Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committee; and recovered over 10 million yuan of embezzled funds. The provincial people's procuratorate directly cracked down and put on record the appalling bribe-acceptance case committed by Wang Yanling, director of the Fuxin city material supply bureau. The Shenyang city people's procuratorate put on record as well as investigated and handled the case committed by Hu Yongshan, secretary of the Kangping county party committee and acting head of the county, who embezzled 20,000 yuan in public funds. The Jinxi city people's procuratorate investigated and handled the case of "fake recruiters," which exerted the worst influence in society. In this case, Wang Tieshan, deputy director of the Huludao district armed forces department in Jinxi city, and Meng Fanchun, clerical worker of the allowance section under the Jinxi city civil affairs bureau, colluded with one another in accepting bribes by providing over 300 fake registration and physical examination documents for 340 fake recruiters. The case involved over 40 cadres of the city party and government organs, including the civil affairs bureau and the armed forces department, and over 170 personnel were associated with the fake recruiter incident. The Jinxi city people's procuratorate arrested 15 local personnel whose crimes had been proved. B. We investigated and handled a large number of criminal cases committed by judicial personnel who violated the law while enforcing the law by embezzling public funds, accepting bribes, and practicing favoritism. In 1993 the province put on record the cases of various crimes committed by 102 judicial personnel, which showed a 64.2 percent increase over 1992. Arrested by the Shenyang city people's procuratorate, Ma Shiteng, leader of the public security brigade under the Shenyang city public security bureau embezzled a tremendous amount of money by illegally establishing another charge for public security management during his tenure. The province put on record as well as investigated and handled 27 cases throughout the year of crimes committed by judicial personnel in practicing favoritism and conducting irregularities. The number of these cases showed a 285-percent increase over 1992 and has been the peak of such criminal cases over the past years. When investigating and handling the criminal cases committed by clandestine gangsters, the province discovered that every criminal case of gangsters' ring had involved the judicial cadres and policemen and that there were over 30 cadres and policemen who were involved in the cases, of whom, 20 had their cases of embezzlement and practicing favoritism put on record for further investigations. As for the crimes committed by the personnel of procuratorial organs, the provincial people's procuratorate neither tolerated nor yielded to them by any means and investigated and handled them in a timely manner as soon as they were exposed. In addition, the province also strictly investigated and handled a large number of cases committed by judicial cadres and policemen in obtaining confessions through coercion. Of these cases, 19 cadres and policemen whose crimes of reprehensible conduct and causing serious consequences were proven, were put on record for their pursuit of their criminal liabilities. C. We investigated and handled some cases committed by administrative and judicial personnel in extorting those they served or managed, seeking and accepting bribes, and violating the law while enforcing it. The number of cases that were put on record for further investigations reached 98 and showed a 20.43 percent increase over 1992. Chen Shijie, director of pharmaceutical administration section under the provincial public health department, and Liu Shengxian, director of the medicine supervision office, accepted a tremendous amount of bribes on many occasions from pharmaceutical factories and in dealing with units by taking advantage of their special administrative and law enforcement rights and by bargaining counters in the establishment of new pharmaceutical factories and in the production of new medicines. Their cases were put on record for further investigation by the Huanggu district people's procuratorate in Shenyang city. Some administrative and judicial personnel asked for bribes to the Yixin construction company in the Bayuquan district of Yingkou city before its formal opening, which distributed a tremendous amount of cash to relevant personnel of the departments of commercial inspection, land management, railway transportation, as well as industry and commerce. The number of personnel who received bribes surpassed 20. The Yingkou city people's procuratorate put cases in which crimes were proven on record for further investigation. D. We investigated and handled a number of crime cases involving corruption and bribery among functionaries of economic management departments. All criminal cases on corruption and bribery uncovered in the course of rectifying the financial order in close coordination with the policy decision of the party Central Committee and the State Council on strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control were investigated and handled according to law by procuratorial organs throughout the province. During the year, we investigated and handled over 240 cases in financial departments, which accounted for over 10 percent of the total number of cases filed for investigation. The Shenyang city Procuratorate filed for investigation the major case of Gao Wenxia, deputy manager of the business department of Liaoning branch of China Industrial and Commercial Bank and of Chang Xinkai, the person in charge of granting loans, who made use of the convenience provided by their posts to examine and approve of certain loans for which they accepted over 100,000 yuan in bribes from applicants. In line with crime reports from the masses, the Benxi City Procuratorate filed for the investigation of an appalling case in which Gao Mingqiu, president of Benxi branch of the China Industrial and Commercial Bank, Sun Maorong, Fei Zhirong, and Jiang Baofu, vice presidents of Benxi branch of China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and Li Zhende, chief of the comprehensive planning section, each accepted 43,000 yuan, 15,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan in bribes. According to initial statistics, procuratorial organs across the province filed for the investigation and handling of over 30 people in a number of cases involving bank presidents and vice presidents, and directors and deputy directors of business departments of banks at all levels. The provincial procuratorate investigated the crimes of Guan Weiguo, vice chairman of the Shenyang City Commission for Economic Restructuring and director of the city securities supervision committee, who made use of the influence of his post to examine and approve of the establishment of shareholding enterprises and the issuance of stock by successively accepting 55,000 yuan in cash bribes from four companies. This case was brought before court for public prosecution. The major case of Xu Shiqing, chief of the securities section of Fushun city's financial bureau, accepting 96,000 yuan in bribes, was investigated by Fushun city Procuratorate and prosecuted before the city intermediate people's court. E. We ferreted out a large number of "moths" in enterprises that embezzled great amounts of public property. Jiang Rensheng, manager of Dalian city Bohai Housing Development Company, took advantage of his position to commit crimes in 20 cases and to embezzle 2.8 million yuan in public funds by resorting to such means as understating compensation funds for relocating households, creating a false payroll, and signing contracts on selling commodity houses at a low price but taking a higher payment from buyers from July 1990 to July 1993; and at the same time, misappropriated 1 million yuan in public funds for personal profit-making activities. Discovering hints of Jiang Rensheng's crimes, the Ganjingzi District Procuratorate in Dalian city adopted resolute investigation measures and caught him red-handed. His case was brought before the Dalian city Intermediate People's Procuratorare for prosecution. The case of Hu Lin, the person in charge of signing contracts for the marketing section of Fushun Steel Plant who embezzled the large sum of 1.11 million yuan in bribes was brought to trial for public prosecution by the Fushun city Procuratorate. F. We expanded the degree of investigating and handling cases on crimes involving taxation or fake trademarks. During the year, we accepted 2,437 clues to tax evasion crimes, refusal to pay taxes, and cheating the state with tax refunds. Of these, 392 were filed for investigation and handling, and 30 were major cases each involving over 100,000 yuan. During the year, we recovered 91.27 million yuan in tax losses for the state by investigating and handling criminal cases, and working with tax departments to safeguard tax collection. We should actively participate in the struggle to check fake products and investigate and handle the year's 134 cases on using fake trademarks, an increase of 143.6 percent over the previous year. 2. We Dealt Strict Blows to Serious Criminal Activities in Line With the Law and Safeguarded Political and Social Stability in Our Province Procuratorial organs at all levels across the province followed the unified plans of the central authorities and the provincial party committee, maintained close coordination with the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial administrative departments, continued to uphold the principle of dealing heavy and rapid blows to criminals in line with the law, and dealt strict blows to all sorts of serious criminal activities. During the year, we approved the arrest of 25,459 persons involved in various kinds of criminal cases and decided to prosecute 23,213 persons. In the struggle to "deal strict blows to criminals," we upheld the following few points: First, we pinpointed some priorities for attack. We gave priority to dealing blows to vicious criminal activities, such as murder, robbery, rape, bomb-planting, and committing crimes armed with guns, and criminal activities involving underworld groups, and guaranteed the manifestation of dealing heavy and rapid blows in the course of investigating the cases, approving arrests, and bringing suits to court. Recently, crimes committed by underworld gangs occurred frequently in our province and have become a problem which we must not neglect in current public security. The people's procuratorates of various localities regarded the work of handling these cases as an emphasis and selected and dispatched their outstanding personnel to examine the cases, to approve the arrest, to check the indictment, and to attend the trial to support public prosecution. They earnestly implemented the duties of legal supervision and upheld the principle of tracking down escaped criminals and bringing supplementary suits against them so as to exterminate the evil thoroughly. Over the past year, the province has approved of the arrest of 278 members of underground gangsters' rings. Second, we heavily and rapidly dealt serious blows at criminal elements. As for serious and appalling cases for which the masses showed concern and about which society had lodged strong complaints, we upheld the principle of joining in the investigation by public security organs and the pre-trial activities in advance so as to be familiar with the cases and to grasp evidence rapidly, to approve the arrest or to indict convicts rapidly within the legal date, and to rapidly put the abominable criminals to trial. Procuratorial organs throughout the province joined in the investigations of 1,750 appalling criminal cases in the year in advance and played active roles in dealing heavy, rapid, and serious blows at criminal elements. Third, we actively joined in the activities of dealing blows at special crimes and conducting special management of public security. Working in close coordination with public security organs, we took the spring offensive by regarding as a main content the struggle against "train bandits and highway despots" and the activities of "dealing blows at criminal rings, pursuing and capturing escaped criminals, and cracking down on appalling cases." We handled a large number of cases by rapidly approving the arrest and indictment of convicts. A large number of escaped criminals were captured, brought to justice, and punished in line with the law. We also earnestly implemented the three decisions made by the standing committee of the National People's Congress with regard to banning narcotics and dealing blows at abduction, and selling and buying of prostitutes' services. We arrested 113 criminals for violating the aforementioned prohibition and indicted 108 convicts. Fourth, while "dealing serious blows to crime," we actively joined in the comprehensive management of public security. In line with the activities of handling cases and the procuratorial function, we implemented measures in the procuratorial link with regard to the comprehensive management of public security and eliminated some factors that harmed stability. 3. We Enhanced the Work of Supervising Law Enforcement, Safeguarded the Correct, and Unified Enforcement of State Laws A. We enhanced supervision over investigation and emphatically dealt with the problems of leaving crimes unchecked and replacing imprisonment with fines. The people's procuratorates of various localities upheld the system of joining the investigation activities conducted by the public security organs in advance and of keeping up with the investigation activities to conduct supervision. They conducted supervision and correction in line with the law over the problems of leaving the crimes unchecked and replacing imprisonment with fines. They also made suggestions on putting on record the cases that deserved to be noted, on pursuing and capturing escaped criminals who deserved to be arrested, and on forming indictments against those who deserved to be tried. Over the past year we have captured 369 criminals and formed indictments against 147 unpunished convicts. We supervised 578 personnel to correct their investigation activities from violating the law. Meanwhile, we made the decision not to arrest 2,755 suspected criminals whose crimes did not conform with the regulations of law and ensured that every criminal was handled with no wrong treatment or appeasement. B. We enhanced supervision over criminal trials and emphatically dealt with the problems of giving no punishment to suspects who have actually committed crimes, giving light sentences to convicts who deserve to be heavily punished, giving heavy sentences to those who deserve to be lightly punished. Over the past year we have lodged appeals in line with the law for 67 cases in which the people's courts have made wrong decisions. We conducted macro supervision over the problems of trends cropping up in the criminal trials, put forward the procuratorial suggestion on the strict enforcement of laws, and corrected the phenomena of violations cropping up in the trial activities. C. We enhanced inspection over jails and detention houses and emphatically dealt with the law-violation problems committed in jails or detention houses. We conducted 8,297 inspections over the enforcement of laws in the year, exposed 3,925 cases of violations in various categories, and put forward 2,663 cases for correction. Of these cases, 1,827 were corrected. We conducted inspection and supervision over the implementation of criminal judgment, adjudication, and of the decision on reformatory education. Meanwhile, we put forward the opinions for correction cases in which 5,386 suspects were illegally detained. Of these cases, 1,668 were corrected. D. We enhanced inspection of the process of filing charges in court and appealing against decisions and emphatically grasped reexamination of appeals against court judgments and adjudication as well as over the no admittance of appeals by the procuratorial organs. We handled 1,112 cases of various categories with regard to filing charges in courts and appealing against decisions. E. We enhanced the legal supervision over the trials of civil affairs cases and over administrative lawsuit activities and emphatically grasped the examination and the appeals against the judgment and adjudication on civil affairs and administrative cases. We accepted 315 cases in the year, put 171 cases on record, and corrected some wrongly decided cases. 4. We Upheld the Principle of Managing Procuratorial Organs Strictly and Strengthened the Self-Development of Procuratorial Contingents In 1993, procuratorates at all levels across the province continued to exert efforts to build procuratorial contingents with a strong sense of politics, good professional skills, strict discipline, and tough work style in accordance with the principle of "building the procuratorates in line with law and managing the procuratorial contingents strictly," and gave priorities to grasping four aspects of work: First, they attended to the building of leading bodies of procuratorates at all levels. Second, they strengthened ideological and political work, mobilized the enthusiasm of all procuratorial cadres and policemen to the fullest extent, and guaranteed the fulfillment of all kinds of procuratorial work. Third, they grasped anticorruption work among themselves. After the convocation of the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the provincial procuratorate decided to conduct a struggle between two lines among procuratorial organs across the province, gave play to the key role of procuratorial organs during the anticorruption straggle, attended to the internal anticorruption work of procuratorial organs, and strengthened administrative honesty among the procuratorial contingents. Leading cadres of procuratorates at all levels acted strictly in line with the central stipulations on keeping oneself clean and self-disciplined, conducted self-investigation and self- rectification, resolutely checked and corrected all sorts of phenomena on discipline and law violations, strictly investigated and handled procuratorial personnel who violated law and discipline, and screened and transferred 31 procuratorial personnel to other posts who were not suitable for procuratorial work. In light of the problems discovered, we further improved the system on administrative honesty. Through education and rectification, the number of cases on law and discipline violations involving procuratorial organs across the province declined noticeably. Last year only 16 cases involving 16 persons occurred, showing a decline of 46.6 percent and 51.5 percent respectively from the previous year, thus marking the year as one with the fewest incidents of crime in this category. Fourth, they strengthened education and training for cadres and succeeded in enhancing cultural and professional levels of procuratorial contingents. We also had many problems in our work, which mainly included: The lack of even development in the work of investigating and handling economic criminal cases on corruption and bribery and the inadequate efforts in handling appalling, influential cases; the lack of courage in a small number of chief procurators in enforcing the law justly; the low level of law enforcement by certain cadres and policemen who could not meet the demands of the struggle and the frequent occurrence of careless handling of cases or the failure to enforce laws strictly; the overstepping of rights by some units in pursuing their own interests while handling cases; and some localities not carrying out law enforcement supervisory work. We will conscientiously resolve these problems in our future work. Yang Yeqin said in conclusion: We sobemnly recognize that during this year the task of investigating and handling economic crimes on corruption and bribery will be more arduous, that more painstaking efforts will be demanded for dealing blows to serious criminal activities, and that greater courage and energy will be required to strengthen law enforcement and supervisory work. Procuratorial organs across the province have decided to regard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the guiding principles, implement the guidelines of the national and provincial public security, procuratorial, and judicial work conferences and of the national work conference of chief procurators, uphold the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both, adapt themselves to the demands of building the socialist market economic structure, strengthen the legal and supervisory functions, continue to make overall plans for all procuratorial work in line with the principle of "enforcing law strictly and handling cases relentlessly, give prominence to handling major economic criminal cases on corruption and bribery, deal strict blows to all sorts of criminal activities, safeguard political and social stability, and make new contributions to safeguarding and promoting Liaoning's reform and opening up and realizing the grand objective of conducting the "second pioneering program."
