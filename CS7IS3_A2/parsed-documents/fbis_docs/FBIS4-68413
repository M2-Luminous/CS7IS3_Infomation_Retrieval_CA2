How do you evaluate the situation in the republic? [Giorgadze] Complex and ambivalent. We have negotiated the stage of civil war and conflicts in the zone of Tskhinvali and Abkhazia. I would like to hope that they will not resume. The joint statement of Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze and the agreement signed in the wake of this by the Council of Heads of State of the CIS instill hope that a settlement will be achieved by the political, peaceful path. The economy of Georgia is falling apart, transport is paralyzed, and the financial and credit system is in a state of collapse. The vast majority of the population is eking out a semi-starvation, beggarly existence. Parliamentary and government decisions proceed from the fact that it is only possible to emerge from this state by developing cooperation and integration within the framework of the CIS. There is opposition to this viewpoint, of course, and the opponents' main argument is that the republic could be deprived of sovereignty on this path. But the country's present economic state would, in my view, deprive it, rather, of sovereignty and integrity. Our opposition desires an orientation toward the West, which is not a sinful desire in itself, but under the present circumstances Georgia's path to the West lies via Russia. [Logachev] The most serious political question for Georgia is the conflict in Abkhazia. Could it grow into even more serious forms? [Giorgadze] I would like to hope that the joint efforts of the CIS countries, primarily the active mediating role of Russia, will help in the very near future--I stress this--to exhaust this conflict completely and return the refugees to Abkhazia. If the peacekeeping force of the CIS, and if we are to call things by their name, primarily Russia, joins in these processes and if this force does not passively observe the course of events but actively becomes a part of the process as an interested mediator, the problem will be resolved. Russia has already signaled such a position. [Logachev] Nonetheless, in what form might the Abkhazia problem be resolved, for all that? [Giorgadze] Undoubtedly as a compromise. A federal arrangement of Georgia would seem the most practicable. Those who believe that this would damage the statehood of the Georgian Republic are, in my opinion, wrong. We could perfectly well negotiate with both the Abkhaz and Ossetian sides specific mutually acceptable forms of statehood. I would not want to anticipate events, but any form of state arrangement that satisfies the population of Georgia and Abkhazia is at this time acceptable in principle. And the details could, after the guns have died down, be specified at the negotiating table. [Logachev] Does Tbilisi understand that unless the Abkhaz problem is resolved in the very near future, Georgia, as a Christian state, runs the risk of a clash with its Muslim Caucasus neighbors? [Giorgadze] I have been working in the system of the security authorities for 26 years now and have in this time been involved in such an area, atypical of us, as the study of public opinion. The head of the Georgian state recently instructed us to ascertain the extent to which the population of Georgia supports the steps being taken by the leadership of the republic. According to our figures, approximately 80 percent--practically the entire population of Georgia--advocate a peaceful settlement of the Abkhaz conflict, realizing that its prolongation will mean the failure of the statehood of the republic. [Logachev] How do you view the possible participation of a UN peacekeeping force in a solution of the Abkhaz conflict? [Giorgadze] I value the status and authority of the United Nations highly. But, like any representative of the special services, I am accustomed to relying on facts and their analysis. Let us take a realistic look at the results of the activity of UN peacekeeping forces. They are ineffective, as a rule. On the other hand, Georgia is a participant in the CIS, and a UN peacekeeping contingent would hardly solve the question better than the Commonwealth's peacekeeping force is doing. [Logachev] You have mentioned Georgia's desire to cooperate with the West. How do you see relations with the European Union and NATO? [Giorgadze] Following the signing of the framework agreement with Russia, the leaders of our states declared that the strategic interests of Russia and Georgia coincide. Consequently, we cannot belong to different blocs and organizations. For me this is rudimentary. [Logachev] Many people in Russia are arguing about participation in the Partnership for Peace program. What is your thinking on this score? [Giorgadze] My first impression is that not everything has been fully thought through here. Why and to what end is it necessary to participate in cooperation with a prospect of association within the framework of NATO? I have a guarded attitude toward this idea, although many countries have latched onto it readily. [Logachev] Much has been said in the Russian press about Georgia's drift toward the United States. There have been references to American advisers here.... [Giorgadze] If there are, indeed, advisers, this is not a sign of some tilt. We have found ourselves in a difficult situation, and if the United States has extended the hand of assistance to us, this absolutely does not preclude more serious contacts with Russia. This also applies to cooperation along special service lines, incidentally. For some reason or other the press has made very one-sided mentions of the presence in Georgia of CIA advisers, but has remained silent about our traditional relations and contacts with Russia. Georgia needs considerable assistance, in questions of personnel training included. A number of agreements with Russia along Ministry of Defense lines and between us and Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service are currently being made ready for signing.
