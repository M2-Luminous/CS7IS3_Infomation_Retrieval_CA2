Meanwhile, the National Assembly adopted a constitutional reform measure creating a Senate and canceling the law preventing a candidate who lost an election from entering the government for a period of 18 months after the election, it was learned from a parliamentary source. In a brief televised statement, Mr. Oye-Mba described the government's resignation as "natural" because "we are entering a new political era," referring to the results of the 5 December presidential elections which saw the victory of the head of state. Under the Constitution, the government must resign after the swearing-in of the head of state. Also today, President Bongo made known "his intention to form a new government very quickly and to call on all qualified people without any political considerations." In an appeal to both the majority party and the opposition, read by his spokesman, Jean Ovono-Essano, the head of state urged political leaders to come together and draw up a one-year "priority action program." At the same time, the National Assembly, which has been meeting in extraordinary session for one month now, passed a constitutional reform bill presented by the government "to reflect the evolution in the political situation.' Out of 120 deputies, 117 took part in the voting, with 80 voting in favor, 36 against, and one abstaining. According to an opposition parliamentarian, seven opposition deputies voted in favor of the bill despite their parties' opposition to this reform. In addition to creating the Senate, the reform cancels the measure disqualifying candidates defeated in an election from entering government for 18 months after the election. This measure particularly applied to opposition candidates in the December presidential elections, which resulted in the reelection of President Bongo and were contested by the opposition.
