Specifically, those who resisted to the last the incorporation of post-Soviet space into the sphere of Moscow's vital interests. Even more specifically, that same Georgia. When we distill from it the acid syrup of diplomacy and analyze the dry residue of the real policy, this cunning concept reduces to two or three mundane formulas: 1. If some independent state does not wish to enter the sphere of Russian interests on its own, then it should be compelled to do so through economic influence or by bringing up military-political arguments. 2. After this, it would be preferable to structure relations with such an independent state in such a way that a) it would have the appearance of a gesture of good will, b) it would secure for Moscow the right of primarily military presence on designated territory, and c) it would postpone distribution of rewards for loyalty to some indefinitely remote future. 3. The ultimate objective would be a state of affairs under which the content of item 2 is perceived by public opinion as incredible generosity on Russia's part, bordering on extravagance. It wouldn't be difficult to note that the statement of the Duma's Committee for CIS Affairs provides for implementation of item 3, which is essentially an ideological cover for actions it itself criticizes. After all, the reason the president signed a treaty which he doesn't intend to submit for ratification is that for Moscow, this document is but formal confirmation of the new geopolitical reality in relations with Georgia: It in no way ensures equal cooperation and Russia's fulfillment of its obligations of reviving the Georgian economy and supporting the national integrity of the Republic of Georgia. The reason why the "Grachev-Patsatsiya Protocol" is not subject to ratification but becomes effective directly is that it discusses some very serious things--establishing Russian military bases on Georgian territory. (Only Georgia of the three Transcaucasian republics is objectively capable of serving as a strongpoint for Russian influence in the region. Neither Azerbaijan nor Armenia is fit for this role, first geographically and second because in the context of the permanent Karabakh crisis Moscow has been pursuing a "pendulum policy" in its relations with the warring sides for a long time. And alternating manipulation by the carrot and the stick doesn't favor establishment of a dependable, permanent military-political beachhead on these territories.) What is important is not what is being substituted--regiments for divisions or armies for regiments (by the way, what is important in these things is not the number of personnel but the nature of their combat use and the quality of their training): The main thing is that Moscow now has the legal right to maintain a military presence in Georgia. As for possible use of equipment supplied by Russia and personnel trained by Russia against Russia, the concern expressed by the Committee for CIS Affairs in this regard appears fully justified. Pharisaism is all right as long as it doesn't transform from a spicy complement to political soup into total policy. Then the burdened and humbled people will begin to resist, giving no thought to who gave them the weapons and who taught them how to use them.
