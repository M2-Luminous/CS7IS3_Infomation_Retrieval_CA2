The villagers stormed the Jiachong Town Police Station, smashed police equipment, and beat up police officers and policemen, resulting in a serious incident. At about 0500 on the morning of 1 April, Jiachong Town Police Station under the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau dispatched about 10 police officers and policemen to Baigang Village to arrest the criminals Chen Renshan and Chen Yonghui on blackmail charges. As scheduled, the two criminals were soon rounded up by the police. However, as the police were taking away the criminal Chen Renshan, he suddenly shouted: "Help!" Immediately, Chen Renshan's brothers and sisters-in-law ran forward with sticks and rocks in their hands. Policeman Liu Jinxin, who was at the front of the police squad, was hit in the head by a brick thrown by Chen Renchao, Chen Renshan's elder brother. Liu Jinxin lost consciousness. The crowd then rescued Chen Renshan amidst chaos. After rescuing Chen Renshan, Chen Renchao turned and began chasing and beating the policeman Zhou Jinbao. Zhou fired a warning shot at once, but failed to stop Chen. With his life under threat, Zhou again opened fire and hit Chen Renchao in the leg, thus temporarily bringing the situation under control. At about 0900 on the morning of 1 April, Liu Rihua, the political instructor of Jiachong Town Police Station, set out for Baigang Village with a team of police officers and policemen to explain the truth to the villagers. However, on their way to the village, they were met by a group of villagers armed with all types of weapons who were heading for Jiachong Town Police Station to cause trouble. After being persuaded and educated by the police, some villagers returned to the village. However, incited by Chen Renshan and some other people, more than 100 villagers still went ahead and reached the police station where they demanded the immediate release of the criminal Chen Yonghui. The police then formed a human wall to repel the crowd. Failing to enter the police station, Chen Renshan incited the villagers to take down the station's sign board. The crowd then smashed the sign board and began frenziedly cuffing and kicking the police officers and policemen. At that moment, Zhang Xinde, chief of Daya Bay Public Security Bureau, arrived at the scene with a team of police officers and policemen. While educating the villagers on the legal system, the police acted resolutely and arrested Chen Renshan, Chen Shaowen, Chen Renhua, Chen Huijun, Chen Qiaoning, and some other ring leaders, thereby putting an end to the incident. At present, Daya Bay Public Security Bureau is investigating the incident and is expected to mete out, in accordance with the law, stern punishment to those principal culprits who brazenly obstructed public security police officers and policemen from performing their official duties, incited the masses to storm the police station, and beat up police officers and policemen.
