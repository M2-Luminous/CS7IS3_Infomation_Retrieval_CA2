DP President Yi Ki-taek has seized every opportunity to stress the need for unifying the opposition camp, assuring that he will make every effort for this purpose. UNP President Kim Tong-kil, NKP President Yi Chong-chan, and Pak Chan- chong, head of the New Party for Political Renewal [NPPR] are all stressing the need for bringing the opposition forces together, although there are shades of difference in the substance of their statements. Yi Ki-taek, Kim Tong-kil, and Yi Chong-chan met on 16 April and agreed in principle to a three-party merger of the DP, UNP, and NKP. However, the road to a unified opposition party is far from smooth. Each party has a different goal for and a different interest in the proposed merger. Even in the same party the opinions of the factions are as much different as their interests and emotions are. The opposition camp consists of the existing opposition political parties (the DP, the UNP, the NKP, and NPPR) and dissident groups. Naturally, the party that will become the center for the merger of the opposition forces is the DP, the first opposition party. Within the DP there are roughly three different views among its factions regarding the opposition merger issue. The mainstream, consisting of the followers of DP President Yi Ki-taek and the Tonggyodong faction, regards it as the primary goal to merge the DP, the UNP, and the NKP into one. It is also searching for ways to bring the dissident group led by Kim Kun-tae, who is preparing to organize a group called the "Society for Political Renewal," into a unified opposition party. NPPR President Pak Chan-chong, whose goal is to become the "prince of the opposition camp," is excluded for the time being. However, NPPR President Pak Chan-chong is included, in addition to the UNP and the NKP, in the targets of an opposition merger as conceived by the DP non-mainstream led by Standing Advisor Kim Sang-hyon. The nonmainstream also calls for the inclusion of all dissident forces including Kim Kun-tae in the merger of the opposition forces. It is also discussing role sharing between the DP and civic groups. It is studying ways for the DP's area-by-area coalescence with civic groups in areas such as environment, pollution, education, and rural problems. In brief, its idea is to organize a united "anti-DLP" force through an opposition-wide merger or coalition. DP Supreme Council Member Cho Se-Hyong has a similar opinion. He conceives of a "platform formula" by which the existing political parties, dissident groups, and civic organizations formulate a joint platform and policy with the DP at the center and join forces under this platform and policy. This idea is similar to the "idea of forming a non-LDP coalition government" in Japan. On the other hand, the Society of Political Reform, a group of dissident-turned National Assembly members, attaches greater importance to the DP's merging with the dissident forces than the merger of the existing three opposition parties. The group takes the position that in turning the DP into a reform force, it is more desirable to bring together the DP and the dissident forces as a whole than to have dissident figures join the DP individually. In this connection, DP assemblymen Yi Pu-yong, Yim Chae-Chong, Che Chong-ku, and three dissident figures, namely, Yi Chang-pok, Chang Ki- pyo, and Kim Kun-tae, launched a forum tentatively named "the New Age Plaza" on 13 April. Their purpose in organizing this forum is to "bring the dissident forces together for reform and national unification." The UNP is divided over the opposition merger issue with its assemblymen having different views. There is one faction that has a positive view of the DP-led merger of the opposition camp. Its president, Kim Tong-kil, is the key figure of this faction. There is also an independent faction which calls for the formation of a UNP-centered third party. The idea of this faction is to organize a third party by joining forces with the NPPR led by Pak Chong-chan. The advocates of this idea is called the school of strengthening or reinventing the UNP. Assemblyman Han Yong-su is at the center of this school. UNP President Kim Tong-kil has signed for now, but he is not too keen about this idea. The third faction favors the preservation of the UNP, namely, the merger of the opposition camp centering on the UNP. This faction takes a passive or negative attitude toward the idea of creating a third party by joining forces with the NPPR. This faction consists mainly of former DLP members. President Yi Chong-chan and assemblyman Chang Kyong-u of the NKP has a positive stance toward the merger of the opposition camp centering on the DP. NPPR President Pak Chan-chong is searching ways for a merger with some members of the UNP while advocating an "anti-DLP, anti-DP" cause. He demands an end to "politics by two Kims," namely, ROK President Kim Yong-sam and Kim Tae-chung, board chairman of the Asia-Pacific Foundation, and shift in generation. To this end, he demands that President Kim withdraw from the DLP, and that Kim Tae-chung completely give up his idea of staging a political comeback by using the DP as a foothold. Pak Chan-chong says that he will organize a planning group in April to push forward with his plan. He has practically no interest in a DP-centered merger of the opposition forces. Dissident figure Kim Kun-tae plans to launch a preparatory committee for the "Society for Political Renewal" on or about 23 April to consolidate the internal unity of the dissident camp as an alternate political force. The road to the merger of the opposition forces is far from smooth because as you see, different parties, and even different factions in each party, have their own ideas about merging the opposition forces, depending on their interests. Some DP members, a sort of vested interest group, have a negative view of the merger of the opposition. Those who have grown up as party bureaucrats in the DP are particularly against the idea because they fear that a merger of the opposition parties or the dissident forces will weaken their "position." Some DP assemblymen fear that a wrong step in merging the opposition forces might give birth to an "anti-DLP, anti-DP party." In this event, they fear, the purpose of bringing the opposition forces together as a counterbalance to the mammoth government party would be defeated. It would become a case of "go for wool and come home shorn." Another factor that makes the merger of the opposition forces difficult is the fact that the DP does not have a decisive enough strength to be at the center of the opposition camp. In the case of the UNP, the amount of subsidy it receives from the national treasure has drastically increased as a result of the new legislation for political reform. This poses another obstacle to the merger of the opposition forces. Next year the UNP will receive a subsidy of 10.9 billion won in connection with four local elections. Even now the party has little financial trouble thanks to the state subsidy exceeding 200 million won. Still, it will receive a far larger sum of subsidy next year. Some UNP assemblymen such as Yi Cha-hon and Kim Yong-hwan are against the UNP's merger with the DP because of their temperament. Assemblymen from the Taegu-Kyongbuk area, including Yu Su-ho and Kim Pok-tong, feel the same way. Nevertheless it is questionable whether the move for the formation of a third party by some of the UNP members and NPPR President Pak Chan-chon will proceed smoothly. Pak insists that he should be both the head of the new party to be organized and its presidential candidate in the 15th presidential election. This demand will place the greatest obstacle in the way of organizing a third party. While searching for ways of merging with the UNP and the NKP, the DP is contacting some of the UNP assemblymen separately just in case the efforts for merger are aborted and UNP members join the DP individually. The targets are those UNP assemblymen who are in favor of or at least not opposed to joining the DP. The DP expects that as next year's local elections draw near, the atmosphere will grow more and more in favor of the merger of the opposition forces and the merger issue will become an active topic. But the DP thinks that the conditions are not yet ripe.
