"Today I resume my press conferences as were held previously," Ozawa told a crowd of reporters, breaking silence for the first time since November 8 last year. Reflecting Ozawa's political clout, a number of reporters asked the Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) secretary general for comment on wide-ranging issues. Ozawa said nothing new, however, sidestepping all questions on his alleged entanglement in a widening money scandal involving the nation's leading general contractors. Concerning 5 million yen he accepted from scandal-ridden Kajima Corp. in December 1992, the coalition's key strategist repeated his earlier statements that he took the cash as a legal political donation, not as a back-door fund. In the November 8 press briefing, he acknowledged the acceptance of the money but stated he received the 5 million yen in accordance with the law. Ozawa had since refused to hold news conferences following the clash between him and the press, which first broke in October. The row erupted after Ozawa barred the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and the SANKEI SHIMBUN from his regular press conferences, accusing the national dailies of carrying inaccurate stories without asking him for comment. Ozawa dismissed demands by journalists from the two news organizations and 14 others to lift the ban, insisting his news conferences were "a service to the press" rather than a duty to the public. The lawmaker, who is said to have masterminded the ouster of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from power last August, had scrapped the practice of holding briefings with reporters on his beat and met the press only at his "open" news conference. The journalists from 16 major Japanese news organizations insisted Ozawa's action ran counter to his policy of opening his press conferences to all media, including magazines and foreign media. At the outset of Monday's 30-minute press briefing, Ozawa said he decided to resume his news conferences because he and the 16 news organizations reached an accord that they will try to resolve future differences through dialogue. On the issue of political reform, he voiced confidence in the passage of a package of government-sponsored political reform bills before the current Diet session ends January 29. Ozawa said that after the passage of the reform legislation, on whose enactment Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political fate, economy-spurring measures and administrative reform would be high on the agenda. He declined comment on a reported shakeup of the Hosokawa cabinet after the passage of the reform package, saying only that the premier has the authority to reshuffle the cabinet. Last June, Ozawa broke away from the LDP with his loyalists to create Shinseito, which subsequently joined hands with six other parties to deprive the LDP of its 38-year hold on power.
