Government Should Do Its Utmost To Avoid Worldwide Financial Uncertainty"] [Text] Indicators, one after another, are showing a further decline of the level of Japan's economic activities. Among them, the Industrial Production Index [IPI] decreased 5.1 percent in October over the previous month, the worst rate of decline in 40 years since the index has been taken. Based on the forecast indexes for November and December issued by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], the seasonally adjusted index for the October-December period in 1993 declined 3.1 percent from the previous quarter's [the July-September period's] 91.7, down 13.0 percent to 88.9 (1990 = 100) in terms of annual rate. After the index hit 92.7 in the October-December 1992 period, it reached 93.1 in the January-March 1993 period which is a temporary increase of 0.4 percent from the previous period, but then dropped 1.5 percent to 91.7 in the second quarter. The forecast mentioned above for the production level in the October-December period in 1993 is 4.1 percent lower than the corresponding period of last year which was considered to be the bottom. As far as the IPI is concerned, the current state of economic activities can be described as "double dip" in terms of both "level" and "trend." Now the actual statistics can be said to start supporting this writer's warning that the economy in the latter half of 1993 is in extreme danger, which was made through this magazine in mid-June, a half year ago. Besides, there is still no guarantee that the economy will stop to deteriorate any further. . Effective Demand Policy Is Effective The IPI trend has been on the decline for three years since its peak 102.7 in the January-March 1991 period, and the index may fall 13.4 percent in the October-December 1993 period. Compared to the index's decline at the time of the first oil crisis of 1973, which continued for nearly a year and a half, the current decline in production has already lasted two times longer. Behind this strong contractionary pressure is the financial system malfunction caused by the steep fall in the value of assets such as stocks and real estate since early 1990. It not only acted as a sudden break on the expansion of private investment (plant and equipment investment plus investment in housing) but also worked to largely push down the level of private investment. The amount of private investment decreased sharply from its peak in the January-March 1991 period to the April-June 1993 period, approximately 13.6 trillion yen in accumulation. The steep reduction in investment will cause a contraction in production and income with a time lag. However, the private sector is not the only one which makes investments. The increase and decrease in public investment by the government also causes fluctuations in production and income, as private investment does. In the same period when the above-mentioned private investment was declining steeply, public investment, due to the implementation of an economic stimulus package, indeed increased to about 10.4 trillion yen. Nevertheless, the increase of seemingly extremely large-scale public investment was still not enough to complement the amount of private investment decrease. The fact is that the gross investment, private and public investments combined, declined approximately 3.2 trillion yen during the same period mentioned above. Private investment, like plant and equipment investment, can be considered to have a larger multiplying effect on expanding income than public investment. However, even if the multiplying effects of private and public investment were regarded as the same for the simplicity of discussion, there is no wonder about the continuation of a negative growth trend in which the level of production and income had a tendency to decline for the last two years when the total amount of investment had decreased over a long period of time. It is clear from this observation that a further and rapid expansion of public investment which does not conform to the norm of so-called "economic measures" of the postwar period was necessary to increase production and income by expanding the gross investment during the private investment's decline. In other words, we should think that the Japanese economy, affected seriously by the decrease in private investment, would have been in a more serious situation than it is now if the above-mentioned public investment of about 10.4 trillion yen were not made. Those who might simply claim that the Keynesian effective demand policy has lost its validity should give enough thought to this point. Why Is the Emergency Economic Stimulus Package Unsatisfactory? An immediate problem related to the sudden fall of stock prices this fall is that there was the risk that the gross investment may decline by about 6.3 trillion yen in accumulation within fiscal 1993, even if business managers' own plans for plant and equipment investment and the trend for a possible public investment were taken into consideration. Considering the risk of this sharp reduction in the gross investment, it can be easily understood that the Hosokawa cabinet's emergency economic stimulus package totaling approximately 6.15 trillion yen announced on 17 September was truly not enough to avoid the risk of further economic slump due to the gross investment's decline. Not all of the emergency pump-priming package's money lead to the increase in public investment but most of it was just a loan plan taking over the role of private financial institutions. With the Hosokawa cabinet's emergency economic stimulus package alone, not only the present decline in gross investment cannot be stopped [but also there are some other problems]. Under the situation in which plant and equipment investment might see a further decrease in the next fiscal year, a prediction can be easily made that it is natural even if the contractionary pressure on production and income, caused by the decline in gross investment due to the insufficient increase of public investment, continues throughout fiscal 1994, when the time lag between the changes in investment and the changes in production and income is taken into consideration. It can be naturally expected under such circumstances that there is the risk that corporate earnings may continue to decline in fiscal 1994 from fiscal 1993. In early fall this year, the prospective price-earnings ratio for the 225 listed issues in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange [TSE] reached an unstable stage of around 90 times. To stabilize stock prices by reducing the price-earnings ratio in such a situation, the lowering of interest rates was required as a matter of course, but it was more important to be able to expect an increase in corporate earnings as the expansion of the economy raises the sales of companies. However, such was impossible under the emergency economic package that actually came out. The only way left was the downward adjustment of stock prices. The steep fall of stock prices can be said to be inevitable. The release of private corporations' worsening mid-term earnings reports in September and the listing of East Japan Railway Co. stock in the TSE were just triggers. In addition, what made the situation more serious was the confused discussion of short-term economic stimulus measures and policies that may increase the economic efficiency in the long-term, such as deregulation, and measures to pass on the exchange rate profits to consumers. It is only natural if such governmental confusion were criticized as it created an illusion that new corporations will be established immediately and employment opportunities will increase once deregulation is promoted, and therefore played a role in neglecting the discussion of demand management to prevent the economy's "double dip" Risk for Worldwide Simultaneous Low Stock Prices The Nikkei average declined steeply since it marked a recovery high of 21,448 on 13 September. Nevertheless, the prospective price-earnings ratio for 225 issues listed in the first section of the TSE has still been around 80 times lately. Because of this, Japanese stock prices appear to be significantly higher to the eyes of the cool-headed investors in the light of Japan's profit and interest rate levels. While a strong potential downward pressure is still being applied on Japanese stock prices, the fact that Western stock price levels have become abnormally high in light of Western investment standards -- New York's prospective price-earnings ratio increasing from 25 to 30 times, for example -- is complicating the situation. As it is now reported in Japan, even companies which are not suited for a stable long-term investment are disclosing their stocks at the over-the-counter market in New York. This kind of speculation in stocks can be collapsed anytime, triggered by a slight increase in interest rates. Such signs [to indicate the market is on the verge of a crash] have been emerging rapidly since this fall. Prior to the heavy fall of New York stock prices in October 1929, Joseph Kennedy, father of the late President Kennedy, realized that the collapse of stock prices was approaching when he saw that even a shoeshine boy was absorbed in playing the stock market, and he was able to save himself from the stock price fall by selling all of his holdings. If the announcement of a concrete additional economic stimulus package is delayed due to the confusion and delay of the political reform debate in the Diet, then it can be easily expected that the potential downward pressure on Japanese stock prices will become more tangible. If it happens to trigger New York stock prices to plunge at once, it could rebound to the Japanese stock prices, initiating a vicious cycle. In that case, it will be extremely difficult for the policy-making authorities to stop the steep fall of Japanese stock prices. Based on the steep decline of stock prices since late October this year, the 225-issue Nikkei average around 12,000, which is said to wipe out the stocks' latent profits of most of the Japanese banks, is within hailing distance. There is no wonder if the failure of a bank which carries a huge amount of bad loans comes to the surface. Without the help of the central bank as "the last lender," the situation might cause a loss of confidence in the financial system itself. Banks which have virtually fallen into liability excesses by the increase of bad loans due to the fall of stock prices will not be able to raise funds from the short-term money market. If there is not enough supply of liquidity from the central bank, banks will be required to sell more of their securities, whose liquidity is high, at markets both at home and abroad. That will cause further turbulence in the capital market both at home and abroad, and the fall in asset prices will suffocate the banks, producing a vicious cycle. Because of the depletion in asset prices, it will be difficult for the banks to meet the demand for private corporations' operating funds as the end of fiscal 1993 nears. Settlement accidents resulting from a bank failure in Japan have a great risk of immediately expanding to a worldwide financial uncertainty through the international chain of credit. If the decline in asset values, like stock prices, etc., cannot be stopped because of a delay in financial measures, the bank failure scenario will no longer be unreal. The government and financial authorities are required to fully inspect the contingency plan, including unlimited special lending measures, and to reconfirm the utmost level of political leadership to carry out the plan to avoid the risk that a domestic bank crisis, which may occur frequently at the same time, may lead to a worldwide financial uncertainty.
