Northwest China, including Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai Provinces and Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions, covers one third of the country's territory and is well endowed with natural resources. But overseas investors were discouraged by its remoteness, tough climate and inconvenient communications. As a result, the region has lagged far behind the rest of China in the drive for opening up and in economic development. The 1990s, however, saw a turning point for the region, which is badly in need of overseas investments for an economic take-off. Latest statistics show that overseas-funded ventures numbered more than 3,000 by the end of 1993, over ten times that at the beginning of the year. The figure has raised the region's percentage of the national total from 0.6 to 1.6 percent. Contracted foreign investment has amounted to more than five billion U.S. dollars, the statistics indicated. In Qinghai, one of the most impoverished provinces of China, overseas-funded firms rose from three in 1991 to over 60 by 1993, involving a combined foreign investment of more than 96 million U.S. dollars. Foreign investments have expanded from service industries to sectors of energy, the exploration of raw materials, processing and high-tech industries. And cooperative parties have increased to more than 20 countries and regions. Moreover, the province has also improved cooperation with the World Bank and foreign governments in loans, technology and labour service. Officials said that it is the abundance of natural resources and promising development prospects that have brought investors to Northwest China. According to Liu Guanghe, vice-governor of Qinghai, more than 60 of the 160 proven minerals have been found in the region, adding the reserves of some 20 of them rank first in the country. The official cited the Tarim Basin, which has a prospective reserve of more than 20 billion tons of oil. He also said Northwest China is home to two of the three large gas fields already confirmed in China. "The development of the vast Northwest China has a significant impact on the overall progress of the country, which is short of energy," the vice-governor said. In Shaanxi, overseas-funded ventures topped 1,000 by the end of last year, compared to 200 two years ago. "Foreign investors are assured by China's reform and opening-up policies as well as by the country's political stability," said Xu Shanlin, vice-governor of the province. Officials said the improvement in investment climate in the region has also enhanced its competitiveness in attracting foreign funds. Automatic switchboards have been installed in the five provincial or regional capital cities, and direct international dialing can reach more than 100 countries and regions worldwide. The expansion and upgrading of three airports in the region have completed, and direct air routes have been opened between the region and some major cities in the world. The longest railway in China, known as Euro-Asia Continental Bridge, and open border cities have helped connect the region with the rest of the world, officials said. To support economic advancement in the region, the central government has approved the five capitals and over a dozen of border cities to open to the outside world, and preferential policies have been granted to them. In addition, three state-level high-tech development zones have been established in Northwest China. The provinces and regions, meanwhile, have promulgated preferential treatment policies to encourage foreign investments and the establishment of joint ventures. They also have set up organizations to coordinate overseas investments.
