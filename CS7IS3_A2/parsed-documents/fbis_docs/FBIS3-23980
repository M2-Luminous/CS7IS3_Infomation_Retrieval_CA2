But in March It Will Be Possible to Sustain Oneself With This Money No More Than One Week"] [Text] The Ministry of Labor [Mintrud] of the Russian Federation has prepared draft documents for raising the minimum wage, and also the rate for the first grade of the unified tariff schedule, from 1 March. It is proposed to increase the minimum wage from 14,620 rubles to 20,500 rubles. And Mintrud considers it expedient to establish the rate for the first grade at a level of 21,000. The main question is: Will the new minimum wage, if it is adopted in this form, improve the position of those who are inadequately provided for? In order to answer, let us recall that, according to data of the Russia's Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the subsistence minimum, which is calculated according to what just barely makes ends meet, was 58,000 for the able bodied Russian in January. In March, according to my calculations, this minimum, in line with the rise in prices, will increase to 78,000 rubles. Thus the new minimum wage will be about a quarter of the subsistence minimum. Moreover, if one takes not the whole subsistence minimum, but only the most meager collection of food products necessary for survival (39,400 in January, 53,000 in March), then the new minimum wage in March will be enough for a very meager diet for only 12 days. The question is: How to live through the remaining 18 days? Incidentally, this is not the first year in Russia that the minimum wage has been completely separated from reality. This is nothing new. What is surprising is that the gap between the minimum wage and the subsistence minimum, despite widely circulated statements of Mintrud, is not being reduced but increased. From 1 December of last year, when, by an edict of the president of the Russian Federation [RF], the minimum remuneration for labor was increased to 14,620 rubles, prices rose--in December by 13 percent and in January by 21.3 percent; and in February, according to preliminary estimates, they will rise by 16 to 18 percent. THUS FOR THE THREE MONTHS PRICES WILL GO UP 1.59 TO 1.62 TIMES, BUT MINTRUD IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE BY ONLY 1.4 TIMES--that is, to still further separate it from real requirements. I remind you: The amount of the minimum wage is the determinant of the level of most socially guaranteed payments--benefits, stipends, etc. Is further lowering of the standard of living admissible, when today 52.6 million Russians (according to January data) had an average per capita income below the subsistence minimum, and for 26.3 million citizens (or one out of every five!) this income was less than the value of the collection of food products necessary for survival. In other words, 26 MILLION RUSSIANS ARE LIVING HALF STARVED. Does Minister of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan understand what the threat to the country is of further "pressure" on people who have already been pushed to the limit? It is true that, with respect to the budget sphere, Mintrud is nevertheless proposing to establish supplementary increases to the rates for the first, second, third and fourth grades in order to at least to some degree raise the miserly wage. But even with the supplementary increases, the new March wage for these workers will fall substantially short of the "products minimum." This miserly "handout" will be extended to many "budget workers"--secretaries, typists, cashiers, draftsmen, bookkeepers, file clerks, clerks, workers in photo labs, records managers, workers in copying and duplicating offices, nurses aids, hospital attendants, and other workers whose positions and categories fall into grades 2 through 4. Mintrud has set for them payments (together with supplementary increases) of less than 45,000 rubles a month. Will it be possible to survive more or less decently on a wage of 35,000 to 45,000? In a number of regions, evidently, these amounts will permit people to keep themselves "afloat," for example, in the Ulyanovsk, Belgorod, Tula, Orlovo, Smolensk, Voronezh, and Penza oblasts, where the subsistence minimum, if one believes Russia's Goskomstat, did not exceed 30,000 rubles in January. But in most territories, the humiliating amounts that are conventionally called "a wage" are only heating up the social atmosphere in society. In my opinion, the practice of approving a single minimum wage and rate for the first grade for the entire country is in principle mistaken. This can only be an accounting indicator. Each region should have its own minimum wage, linked in specified proportions to the local subsistence minimum, gradually approaching it so that in one and a half to two years they will be equal. Simultaneously with the proposals for the minimum wage, Mintrud has finally prepared and sent to the White House a draft law on the subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation. It is stipulated in the draft that the government should determine the relationships between the amount of the minimum wage and of workers' pensions, and the size of the subsistence minimum of the corresponding social-demographic groups of the population. Let us assume that in 1994 the minimum wage will be 50 to 60 percent of the subsistence minimum, in 1995--80 percent, and that in 1996 the minimum wage will equal the subsistence minimum. These figures are not in the draft; the relationships must still be determined if the law is adopted. The emphasis in the draft is also on extending to those who are inadequately provided for specifically targeted social assistance in kind or in value form (through the resources of the subjects of the Federation). But what seems absolutely unacceptable is the item in the draft stipulating that Mintrud of the RF will approve the size of the subsistence minimum. Not the government, not the State Duma, but precisely that department that has been the object of serious complaints in the area of social policy. This is a risky experiment.
