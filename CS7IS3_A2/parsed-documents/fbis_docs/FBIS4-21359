Chien was responding to reports from Geneva saying that the CITES Standing Committee has yielded to Beijing's pressure and decided to refer to Taiwan as "Taiwan, China" in its report on wildlife conservation on the island. "Such a decision is ridiculous," Chien said, stressing that Taiwan is a separate political entity and has never been ruled by Chinese communist authorities. Chien said Beijing's intention to downgrade the ROC in the international arena by suggesting the use of such a designation in the CITES report would only worsen relations across the Taiwan Strait and would not alter the fact that Taiwan is a separate political entity. Beijing has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and sought to limit Taiwan's movements on the world stage. The Council of Agriculture (COA), which is in charge of wildlife conservation affairs, said it will protest the CITES decision. "If CITES does not use our formal national title in its report, we hope it can at least refer to us as Chinese Taipei," COA Vice Chairman Lin [words indistinct] said.
