He said the composition of some of the multiparty committees should be decided "in the next day or so". There had been delays in getting names of prospective committee members from parties and there had also been queries over incomplete or defective lists. He had been asked to expedite the formation of the constitutional affairs, education, finance, home affairs, justice, public accounts and security services committees because there was apparently legislation for them in the pipeline. He had been hoping it would be possible to reduce the number of committees from 26, or one for each ministerial portfolio, to about 18. He made this proposal to the African National Congress but was told they were "not very happy with that". "At this point I'm not sure how many there will be eventually," he said.
