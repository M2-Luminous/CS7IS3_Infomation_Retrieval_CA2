His visit was a complete success, having attained the goals of enhancing understanding, developing cooperation, and promoting good- neighborliness and friendship. We would like to offer our warm congratulations. Premier Li Peng's five-nation tour was an event of profound significance in the history of China's relations with those countries. During the visit, Premier Li Peng held several rounds of friendly and sincere talks and meetings with the leaders of the five countries, during which they conducted businesslike and realistic discussions on further developing bilateral relations. Relevant departments on both sides signed approximately 20 agreements or letters of intent. Premier Li Peng also had an in-depth exchange of views with the leaders of the five countries on regional and international issues of common interest, reaching a broad consensus in this respect. Premier Li Peng's visit marked a new stage of development for China's friendly relations and cooperation with the five countries. Premier Li Peng and the leaders of the five countries shared the view that maintaining good-neighborly and friendly relations over the long term would benefit not only the peoples of their respective countries, but also stability and development in the region. China and the five countries are complementary to each other in the economic realm, and there are broad prospects for strengthening cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit. Both sides indicated that they would adopt positive and feasible measures to further enrich the substance, improve the quality, and expand the scope of mutually beneficial cooperation, particularly referring to measures aimed at encouraging entrepreneurs on both sides to increase contacts and develop various forms of multilevel economic cooperation and trade. The entrepreneurs traveling with Premier Li Peng concluded a set of agreements or letters of intent on cooperation with their counterparts in the four Central Asian countries. They also explored ways to further develop economic cooperation and trade. Premier Li Peng and President Nazarbayev signed a Sino-Kazakh border agreement, which was a major event of historic significance for relations between the two countries. We firmly believe that the Sino-Kazakh border extending more than 1,700 km will become a bond of friendly cooperation and common prosperity. Both Premier Li Peng and President Akayev said they would assume a positive attitude toward resolving the border issue between China and the Republic of Kyrgyzstan through friendly consultation and negotiations at an early date. Special emphasis should be placed on the fact that Premier Li Peng delivered an important speech in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, in which he systematically and comprehensively set forth a four-point basic policy for developing China's relations with the Central Asian countries. The speech elicited positive response and favorable comment. Remaining on friendly terms for generations represents the common aspiration of the Chinese and Central Asian peoples, and is entirely consistent with their fundamental interests. China attaches great importance to developing friendly relations with the Central Asian countries; respects their independence and sovereignty, the choice of social systems and development paths made by their peoples in keeping with their national conditions, and the foreign policies they pursue; and appreciates their efforts to develop relations with their neighbors and other countries. China abides by the principles of equality and mutual benefit, will develop economic cooperation and trade with the Central Asian countries to promote common prosperity, and will make due contributions to building a new "Silk Road." China sincerely hopes for stability and development in the Central Asian countries and region. A stable and prosperous Central Asia is in the long- term interests of Central Asian countries, and is closely related to peace and development in Asia and even in the world at large. We believe that with the passage of time, the four-point basic policy enunciated by Premier Li Peng will demonstrate strong vitality. Since China and Mongolia normalized their relations in 1989, their relations have experienced new developments. During Premier Li Peng's visit to Mongolia, China and Mongolia signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, an important hallmark of the development of relations between the two countries. The leaders of China and Mongolia expressed the identical view that the two countries should constantly consolidate and develop good-neighborly and friendly cooperation on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Developing relations with neighboring and adjacent countries is a very important part of China's independent foreign policy of peace. Regardless of what may happen in the world, China's policy of good-neighborly and friendly relations will never change, and China will always be a good friend and neighbor who can be trusted by adjacent countries. We firmly believe that through the joint efforts of China and the five countries, the results of Premier Li Peng's visit will surely be consolidated and expanded. China's good-neighborly, friendly, and mutually beneficial cooperation with adjacent countries is bound to be filled with even greater vim and vigor.
