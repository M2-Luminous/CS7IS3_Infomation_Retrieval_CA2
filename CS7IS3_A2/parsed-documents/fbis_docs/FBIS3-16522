Latvia will continue its path to the full integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization because it is the only organization capable of extending security guarantees in the conditions of foreign jeopardy, Berzins said. NATO extension rests with NATO itself, Berzins noted. Berzins is deputy head of the majority Latvia's Way faction and member of the parliament's Foreign Affairs' Committee.
