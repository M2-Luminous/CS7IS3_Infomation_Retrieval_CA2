It is a known fact that the problem concerns exports of such goods towards third countries. Difficulties arise from the need to reconcile the free movement of goods in the market without borders with the control of certain "sensitive" exports towards a number of third countries. If there is no common regime, then goods and technologies which could be used for military purposes would leave the [EC] Community and cross countries which do not have sufficient controls. This issue has implications on the defence policy of Member States which makes it difficult to define what regime should be introduced. UNICE recalls its earlier suggestions for resolving this problem through "effective export controls" which are not detrimental to the competitiveness of European companies. It affirms: "Although the Council's work has since made considerable progress, UNICE regrets that it has not been concluded. Ministers of the Twelve still do not agree on a number of points, such as the "catch-all" clause (treatment of suspect customers), length of and measures applicable during the transition period, which are fundamental to the efficient operation of a European Union export control system. Consequently, UNICE calls on ministers to resolve the outstanding problems urgently. The abolition of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) on 31 March, which UNICE welcomes, makes the setting up of a European Union regime of export controls on dual-use goods and technologies all the more necessary. It would strengthen the European Union's position in the current negotiations related to the establishment of the New Forum in charge of defining the lists and procedures for future controls on dual-use products. For economic operators, cooperation between countries which have developed effective and reliable control regimes is essential to prevent distortions of competition both in Europe and with third countries. Lastly, at a time when the United States is reviewing its own export control regime, the European Union should seize the opportunity to show the way forward by putting in place an innovative system of export controls based on a licence-free European zone which could evolve in time into a licence-free zone at multilateral level, including the United States, Japan and any country which could meet the criteria defined in common. For all these reasons, UNICE stresses how urgent it is that decisions be taken."
