The Food Agency earlier this week ordered rice sellers to mix domestically and foreign-grown rice for retail sale, to avoid any hoarding of domestic rice. The agency originally set the supply proportions for domestic, Thai, and U.S. and Chinese rice at 30 percent, 20 percent, and 50 percent, respectively. But the delay in imports of Chinese rice so far has forced the agency to change the proportions to 50 percent, 25 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Blended rice will likely be put on the market as early as next week despite much opposition from consumers and rice sellers. Some rice wholesalers said they will sell a set of foreign and domestic rice instead of blended rice, a choice the agency has tolerated. A Tokyo-based wholesaler said, "consumers desire a domestic-foreign rice set, not blended rice. I think the proportion of Thai rice in the rice set will be approximately the same as that of blended rice."
