Rabin said that there is no room for a meeting between himself and Yasir 'Arafat at the present time. [Begin recording] [Rabin] Did anyone expect some kind of hocus-pocus? Anyone who thought that everything could be wrapped up within two or six days was simply wrong and did not understand the situation. If an agreement is not reached or, at least, until such an agreement is secured, we will have to clarify to the Palestinians how the economic side of things will be implemented. [Economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein] In your opinion, is there room for another meeting between Yasir 'Arafat and yourself at the present time? [Rabin] I think it is preferable to prepare such a meeting -- if and when it takes place -- in such a way as to preclude the possibility of another meeting between 'Arafat and myself ending unsuccessfully. [end recording] Our economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein reports that the prime minister was speaking after a ceremony marking the sale of the Bet Shemesh engine factory to the Ormat company.
