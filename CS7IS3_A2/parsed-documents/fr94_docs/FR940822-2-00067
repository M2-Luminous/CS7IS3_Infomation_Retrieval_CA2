FR940822-2-00067 FR940822-2-00048 Over the years, there have been literally thousands of persons and entities that have provided services to insurance companies. According to the ACLI, because of the size of insurance company general accounts, the number of service providers raises the possibility of countless, technical prohibited transactions which have posed no possibility of abuse. Thus, the ACLI requests relief for transactions that would be prohibited merely because a person is deemed to be a party in interest to a plan solely by reason of providing services to the general account (or who has a relationship with such service providers described in sections 3(14) (F), (G), (H), or (I) of ERISA). The ACLI further represents that, under the Department's plan assets regulation, 29 CFR ยง2510.3&hyph;101(f)(2)(iii), an insurance company investing general account assets could be viewed as a ``benefit plan investor'' for the purposes of calculating the 25 percent significant participation test in section 2510.3&hyph;101(f)(1) of the regulation. This could increase the number of entities that would hold plan assets as the result of a general account equity investment in an entity, and thereby also increase the number of possible prohibited transactions. 4 The ACLI notes that, as a further consequence of the general account's investment in an entity, the manager of the entity (and other service providers to the entity) might be deemed to be fiduciaries or other parties in interest under section 3(14) of ERISA. Therefore, the ACLI requests broad relief for transactions that would be prohibited solely because an entity has significant participation by benefit plan investors as a result of equity investments by general account(s). 4 It is the Department's view that, for purposes of determining whether equity participation in an entity by benefit plan investors is ``significant'' within the meaning of the significant participation test contained in the plan assets regulation, 29 CFR ยง2510.3&hyph;101(f), only the proportion of an insurance company general account's equity investment in the entity that represents plan assets should be taken into account. Therefore, the proportion of that investment that represents plan assets would equal the proportion of the insurance company general account as a whole that constitutes plan assets. Employer Securities and Employer Real Property The Applicant represents that the breadth of general account investment activities over the last 20 years makes it likely that insurance companies have purchased and continued to hold for their general accounts, securities issued by or properties leased to employers of employees covered by plans that purchased general account contracts. Because insurance companies have made such investments with the understanding that general account assets were not plan assets, it is possible that general account investments include securities issued by employers, and real property leased to employers, that do not meet the standards set forth in section 407(a) of ERISA. The ACLI also believes that relief is necessary for the acquisition or holding of qualifying employer securities or qualifying real property by a plan under circumstances where the acquisition or holding contravenes sections 406 and 407(a) solely by reason of being aggregated with employer securities or employer real property held by an insurance company general account in which the plan holds an interest as a contractholder. The Applicant notes that the relief requested for such ``excess holdings'' is similar to the relief provided for pooled separate accounts in section I(c) of PTE 90&hyph;1. 5 5 PTE 90&hyph;1, Section I(c) provides relief for: Any acquisition or holding of qualifying employer securities or qualifying employer real property by a plan (other than through a pooled separate account) if_ (1) The acquisition or holding contravenes the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1)(E), 406(a)(2) and 407(a) of the Act solely by reason of being aggregated with employer securities or employer real property held by an insurance company pooled separate account in which the plan has an interest, and (2) The requirements of either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section are met. The Proposed Exemption The scope of the exemption being proposed by the Department differs from that requested by the Applicant. As previously noted, the Department has granted a class exemption for insurance company pooled separate accounts that provides relief from ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions for a variety of transactions between separate accounts and parties in interest with respect to plans participating in such accounts. The Department has decided to propose similar relief, as described below, with respect to insurance company general account transactions to the extent that it believes that the requirements of section 408(a) of ERISA would be met. On its own motion, the Department is also proposing relief for certain transactions involving the operation of certain asset pool investment trusts. However, as more fully discussed below, the Department is not prepared at this time to propose several additional exemptions requested by the Applicant. Internal Transactions After considering the ACLI's requested exemption for activities in connection with the internal operation of general accounts, the Department has determined that it does not have sufficient information regarding the operation of such accounts to make the findings required by section 408(a) 6 of ERISA. In a letter dated May 20, 1994, the Department has requested from the ACLI the necessary information by posing a number of questions concerning the internal operations of general accounts. In that letter, the Department indicated that it would proceed with its review of their application as it pertains to the external transactions while awaiting their response to the questions. 6 Section 408(a) of ERISA provides, among other things, that the Department may grant an exemption from the prohibited transaction rules only if finds that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries, and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plan.
