The only answer to protect workers' rights and interests was an independent workers' union free from government and party control, it said. The newsletter, Workers' Square, was put out by a group of labour activists trying to organise workers in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Three of the activists Li Wenmin, Kuang Lezhuang, and Liu Hutang were reportedly arrested last month in Shenzhen. Although their arrests have been reported in the Hong Kong press, the Shenzhen Government and public security authorities refused to confirm them. But a source said the activists had been followed and were under police surveillance since early this year. Despite the strong pressure, the activists managed to put out three issues of the Workers' Square before they were arrested, the source said. According to copies of the Workers' Square obtained by the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, the activists held that only when united could workers fight against exploitation, and they could no longer rely on the official unions to protect their interests. The first issue of the publication blasted authorities for allowing sweatshop factory bosses to ignore safety regulations. One of the most appalling cases was a fire that killed 84 workers in a toy factory in Shenzhen last November. "Employers, unions and government officials have been shielding one another. They ignore regulations, abuse the lawful rights of workers and humiliate workers' dignity. China is a signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights," the article says. "It is a member of the International Labour Organisation and has promulgated a large number of labour laws. But why do so many of our wishes remain mere illusion even until today? Why are we still alone in disputes?" the article asks. "The answer is that we haven't united." Another article cited a dispute in a garment factory in September last year, saying that government labour authorities had failed in looking after the interests of workers. There were articles and verses on the misery of workers in sweatshop factories. "The improvement of working environments, improvement of living conditions, shortening of hours and increase of wages will not be bestowed on us," an article said. "It's something we must fight for. If we unite, we will become a strong force." The editors of Workers' Square said that a publication by workers and for workers was the first step to fight exploitation. It was a forum to expose "crimes committed by capitalists".
