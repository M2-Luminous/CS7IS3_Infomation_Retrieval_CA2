Likewise, the statement calls on the president of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, Igor Smirnov, and the leader of the Supreme Soviet, Grigore Maracuta, to investigate in a principled manner the illegal actions committed against soldiers of the Russian Army and inform the 14th Army Command of the steps taken. This quasi-ultimatum attitude is the result of the increasing tension in Tiraspol, where, for some time, the Dniester leaders, on the one hand, and General Lebed and Colonel Mihailov Bergman, on the other, have been engaged in a real duel of mutual accusations. After General Lebed's recent meeting with directors of schools and presidents of the trade union committees of these institutions, to whom he suggested civic disobedience, and at which meeting the Tiraspol leadership was harshly criticized, the Russian officer was accused of plotting the overthrow of the government. University Professor Vasiliy Yakovlev, leader of a group of civic organizations, described the general as an agent of the Moldovan Republic. Regarding the general's participation in a meeting convened by the Tiraspol Town Educational Directorate, the same Yakovlev accused General Lebed of being an accomplice in the Romanization of education in the Dniester region by recognizing the right of Moldovan children to study in Romanian in Latin script. Likewise, in a statement adopted recently, the aktiv of the Interior Ministry expressed its determination to defend the statehood of the so-called Dniester Republic, no matter from where the threats may come. Deputy Interior Minister Nicolay Medveev called for the two Russian officers to be declared persona non grata and expelled from the Dniester region. All this has increased tension in Tiraspol alarmingly. As the local correspondent of the National Radio Network of the Republic of Moldova reported, in a way, a certain duality of power has been established in the town. Both sides have sufficient and well-equipped military and paramilitary forces. Yesterday, General Aleksandr Lebed, writing in IZVESTIYA, proposed a solution, quote: to eliminate all odious elements -- certainly he was referring to the Tiraspol leaders -- organize new elections, and put certain credible persons in power.
