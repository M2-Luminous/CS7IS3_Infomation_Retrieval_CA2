Rybkin is in China on an official visit. "We are bound to live together by destiny and must supplement each other through close cooperation for our mutual benefit," Rybkin said. Russia is going through radical transformation and has serious interest in Chinese reforms, he said. The Russian leadership is determined to continue "serious work in the interests of strengthening bilateral relations." Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit is viewed as part of this policy, Rybkin said. Qiao Shi shared his words, adding that "China and Russia are neighbours. We value good neighbourly and friendly relations between the two countries which were not easy to establish." He pointed out that China's policy aims at developing friendly relations with all countries, including Russia, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Qiao Shi expressed the hope that bilateral cooperation between Russia and China will expand and grow. Rybkin invited Qiao Shi to visit Russia. He also met with Deputy Chinese Foreign Minister Tian Zenpei who confirmed that relations with Russia are one of the priorities of the Chinese foreign policy. He noted that the two countries have similar positions on many issues. Speaking about recent hearings in the State Duma on Russian-Chinese relations, the Chinese diplomat said that Duma factions have close positions on relations with China, despite disagreements over other matters. He said the Chinese Foreign Ministry stands for further development and strengthening of relations between the Russian and Chinese parliaments.
