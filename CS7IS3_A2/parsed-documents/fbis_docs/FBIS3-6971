Noting that the change coincided with the resumption of dialogue, including the working-level contacts between the South and the North, relevant authorities including the MND are speculating that this may mean a change in system, including the complete transfer of North Korea's supreme power to Kim Chong-il, or a change in policy toward South Korea.
