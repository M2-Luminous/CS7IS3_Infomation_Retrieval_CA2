In this Talk of the Week, Mr. Dao speaks about the tasks of the Vietnam Fatherland Front in implementing that resolution. Mr. Dao maintains that to make full use of all advantages, overcome difficulties and challenges, and push down all threats now as more than before, it is required to implement great national unity and strengthen a United National Front, raising unity to an ever-higher level. This will create a strong motivation for the development of Vietnam's history. It is required to rid Vietnam of poverty and backwardness and build it into a powerful country with rich people and an equal and civilized society. This would implement the last will of the late President Ho Chi Minh to build a Vietnam of peace, unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity; and contribute positively to the cause of peace, independence, democracy, and progress in the world. Mr. Le Quang Dao pointed out that to obtain the above-mentioned objectives, the Vietnam Fatherland Front unites Vietnamese people of all social classes, ethnic groups, religions who reside in Vietnam and abroad, and approve of the common objectives mentioned above. The front takes a great duty as its common objective and can accept the different viewpoints which are not running counter to the common interest to mobilize people in building and defending the nation. The Vietnam Fatherland front will broaden its activities from charity and humanitarian to political, economic, social, and cultural activities to be suitable to each social circle and class. The Front promotes the positive role of front-ranking people in all social classes and quarters, ethnic groups, religions, and revolutionary veterans, attracting all talents to state institutions, social-economic, and mass organizations. After highlighting the contributions of the Vietnam Fatherland Front in institutionalizing the great unity of the Vietnam Communist Party and state as well the Front's participating in building a state governed by law, a state of the people, by the people, and for the people, Mr. Le Quang Dao concluded: In the new period of time, the Vietnam Fatherland Front is a political alliance, a voluntary union of mass organizations and individuals representing all social classes, strata, ethnic groups, and religions. In the coming years, the Vietnam Fatherland Front will broaden its organizations and activities to become a substantial organization of great national unity. The Front shows aspirations and will of people of all strata, focuses the people's wisdom, and unifies all members' activities. The Front joins the administration in implementing democracy and social renewal; takes care and protects the legitimate interests of the people; builds, supervises, and defends the administration. It also participates in management and implementation of economic, cultural, social, security, and national defense tasks to become a steady bridge linking the people with Communist Party and the state.
