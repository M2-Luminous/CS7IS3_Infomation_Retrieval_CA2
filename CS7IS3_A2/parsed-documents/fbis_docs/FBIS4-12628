Thus I have accepted this heavy and difficult responsibility represented by taking in charge the burdens of the prime minister while I have in my mind the following basic preoccupations: -Consolidating the state's institutions, -Reviving the national economy, -Promoting national solidarity. I hope to find among Algerians--I believe this is possible--men and women who have the necessary competence to achieve the break up which the head of state called for. This is the break up with the negative practices of the past. This break up will enable to give to this people again confidence in itself and in its government, state, and future. The new government headed by Mokdad Sifi will work for the respect of all the commitments which Algeria took at the national and international levels.
