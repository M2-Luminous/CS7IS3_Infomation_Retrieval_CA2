FR940127-1-00051 FR940127-1-00014 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR 50 CFR Part 17 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 131 Endangered and Threatened Species; Delta Smelt and Sacramento Splittail; Water Quality Standards for Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta AGENCIES: Environmental Protection Agency and Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rules; notice of public hearings and extension of public comment periods. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under section 303 of the Clean Water Act, give notice that joint public hearings will be held in California for the revised proposed critical habitat determination for the delta smelt ( Hypomesus transpacificus ), the proposed threatened status for the Sacramento splittail ( Pogonichthys macrolepidotus ), and the proposed water quality standards for surface waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta, California. The comment periods for the Service's proposed rules for the delta smelt and the Sacramento splittail will be extended. DATES: The comment period for the Service's proposals is extended until March 11, 1994. EPA's closing date for public comments remains March 11, 1994. Four joint public hearings for the three proposals will be held on the following dates: (1) February 23, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in Fresno, California; (2) February 24, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in Sacramento, California; (3) February 25, 1994, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. in San Francisco, California; and (4) February 28, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in Irvine, California. ADDRESSES: The joint Fish and Wildlife Service and Environmental Protection Agency public hearings will be held at the following locations: (1) Holiday Inn Center Plaza, 2233 Ventura Avenue, Fresno, California; (2) Expo Inn, 1413 Howe Avenue, Sacramento, California; (3) EPA Regional Office, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California; and (4) City of Irvine City Hall, 1 Civic Center Plaza, Irvine, California. Written comments and materials relating to proposed Service actions should be sent directly to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Sacramento Field Office, 2800 Cottage Way, room E&hyph;1803, Sacramento, California 95825&hyph;1846. Written comments and materials relating to the proposed EPA action should be sent directly to the Bay/Delta Program Manager, Water Quality Standards Branch, W&hyph;3, Water Management Division, Environmental Protection Agency, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment, at the above addresses. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dale Pierce, Fish and Wildlife Service, Sacramento Field Office (see ADDRESSES section) at 916/978&hyph; 4613 or Susan Hatfield, Environmental Protection Agency (see ADDRESSES section) at 415/744&hyph;1991. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The three proposals being addressed at the public hearings are components of a coordinated Federal interagency initiative responding to water management issues in the San Francisco Bay and Delta. EPA and the Service are working closely together and with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to develop a comprehensive, habitat-oriented approach to water and fish and wildlife resource management issues in California. Critical habitat designation for the federally listed threatened delta smelt would provide additional protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action. As required by section 4 of the Act, the Service will consider economic and other relevant impacts prior to making a final decision on the size and configuration of critical habitat. Sacramento splittail occur in Suisun Bay and the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary in California. The Sacramento splittail has declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years. This species is primarily threatened by large freshwater exports from Sacramento and San Joaquin River diversions, prolonged drought, loss of shallow water habitat, introduced aquatic species, and agricultural and industrial chemicals. EPA has proposed a rule to establish three sets of Federal criteria to protect the designated uses of the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. The three sets include: (1) Salinity criteria protecting the estuarine habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses; (2) salinity criteria (measured in electrical conductivity) to protect the fish spawning (striped bass) designated use in the lower San Joaquin River; and (3) salmon smolt survival index criteria to protect the fish migration and cold freshwater habitat designated uses in the estuary. The hearings and the extension of the comment periods will allow all interested parties to submit oral or written comments on the three related proposals. The three proposed rules were published in the Federal Register on January 6, 1994 (delta smelt (59 FR 852), Sacramento splittail (59 FR 862), and EPA water quality standards (59 FR 810)).
