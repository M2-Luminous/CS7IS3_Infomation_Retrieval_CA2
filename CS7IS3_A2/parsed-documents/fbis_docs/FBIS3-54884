Zhirinovskiy during his election campaign in Russia. The political aspects are not the issue here, according to the newspaper, but possible violations of the law on granting credits. Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN, touching on press reports that the Dutch company GMM granted Zhirinovskiy's party $800,000 to fund its election expenses, remarks in its commentary: "So far there is no precise information suggesting the Dutch company's role in financing the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], but as of today it has been definitely confirmed that branches of the Zhirinovskiy party election campaign had premises in GMM advertising branches in Russia, and that the Dutch company's advertising and Zhirinovskiy's election campaign were funded from the same source. "Light may be thrown on the Dutch firm's role in funding the LDPR in the near future, since the Netherlands Ministry of Finance has begun an investigation into GMM's activity, using as a pretext this firm's breach of national laws on security transactions."
