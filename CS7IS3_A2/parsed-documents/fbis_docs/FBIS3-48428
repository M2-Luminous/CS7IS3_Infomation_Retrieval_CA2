"The army must take more active measures...to struggle against corruption and smuggling in its ranks," the daily said, adding that the measures were a "limited" success in 1993. About 100 corruption and smuggling cases were adjudicated by the army, of which 20 were decided by military tribunals, it said. The corruption cases concerned military vehicles used to transport smuggled goods and the diversion of funds or materials, the QUAN DOI NHAN DAN said. Several members of the communist party serving in the army were sanctioned last year due to their direct or indirect participation in corruption and smuggling, the newspaper said. It put the value of goods recovered by the army at several hundred thousand dollars. A senior military official, General Nguyen Truong Xuan, was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in 1987 for his role in trafficking in the northern port of Haiphong. Corruption is increasingly affecting the institutions charged with defending the stability of the government -- the police and, to a lesser extent, the army -- at a time when Vietnam is working towards a market economy. The monthly wage of an officer varies between 300,000 and 700,000 dong (30-to-70 US dollars). The Vietnamese army has about one million men, according to official estimates.
