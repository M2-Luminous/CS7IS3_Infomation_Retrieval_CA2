Meanwhile, on 18 February the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, which is one of the organizations that best reflects the feelings of society, suffered a jolt: a drop of almost 10 points. Are Franco and model Lilian Ramos to blame? Partly. According to a market expert, the stock market fell because in the morning of 18 February there was a rumor that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso went to Juiz de Fora to submit his resgination. The rumor did not turn into reality but the reaction of the stock market shows that Finance Minister Cardoso has become a more important point of reference than the president. Even if President Franco and Minister Cardoso were prisoners in the same boat, they would be treated by Congress as separate forces, as happened on 17 February when Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party--Rio Grande do Sul], the rapporteur of the constitutional revision, criticized President Franco for proposing Cardoso's presidential candidacy. According to Jobim, the president's proposal obstructs the negotiations for voting on the Social Emergency Fund. [passage omitted] The presence of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the government today is what gives perspective to society. He represents initiative, he gathers power around him, and even his personal contacts with Franco give support to the president. These are compliments but they are the type of comments that leave the minister concerned and the president annoyed. Of the four finance ministers in the country in the last 16 months, Cardoso is the one who has been able to maintain cordial, frank, and constant relations with Franco for the longest time. [passage omitted] He represents power and work. While Franco remained in Juiz de Fora, Minister Cardoso was one of the four ministers working in Brasilia on 18 February and preparing his agenda for the next day. With one hand on politics, he articulated the voting of the Social Emergency Fund to be held on 23 or 24 February. With the other hand on the economy, he was preparing the very complex monetary transition to the URV [Real Value Unit].
