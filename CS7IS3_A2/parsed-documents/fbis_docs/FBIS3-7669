He said none of the refugees had been forced home against their will. The deputy commander said the refugees had been moved to a site in Ban Saptali after their representatives asked the task force not to push them into returning from where they had come. "We had to relocate them to a safe area for humanitarian reasons," he told some 40 reporters on a tour of Ban Phakkat and Ban Saptali organised by the Supreme Command headquarters. "It would have been forceful repatriation if we pushed them back in the same direction from where they had come." About 25,000 Cambodians took refuge along the border near Ban Phakkat in Pong Namron District when Phnom Penh forces seized the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin last week. Rear Admiral Thirat said the refugees had all been repatriated last Saturday after he received an order from the Government to push them back to Cambodia. He said the task force commander Vice Admiral Manat Pinkunabut, met with representatives of the refugees last Friday where he was asked to repatriate them to a safe area within at least 10 kilometres of Ban Phakkat. The deputy commander said Ban Saptali about 20 kilometres north of Ban Phakkat had been selected as the repatriation site as about 400 Cambodians lived in the area. The Cambodians had volunteered to be relocated to Ban Saptali. He said the allegation that authorities had been guilty of inhuman acts while conducting the repatriation was unfounded. "We did not force them to Ban Saptali. They volunteered to go there. It is the safest site. This is not inhumanity." Rear Admiral Thirat said local authorities had to provide aid to refugees for humanitarian reasons which "does not mean we are supporting either side."
