It is the first step toward safeguarding security and stability in Europe after the Cold War, the Foreign Ministry said. This urgently required safeguarding is the focus of EU expansion. During the long nights in Brussels, Bonn had to play a central role in order to avoid a failure, high-ranking diplomats participating in the talks said. A first analysis said that, after five days and three nights of dramatic struggles, the EU has now regained its balance. The entry of the Nordic countries and Austria will end the tilt toward the south. The north will support German foreign policy in terms of integrating Central and East Europe. The north of Europe has a different sensitivity for the new problems arising at the end of the Cold War. Many members of the current Union are still caught in a reactive frame of mind. Some of these countries seem to be sitting in a television chair watching whether Central and East Europe get to their feet or break down. An analysis of the situation to the east of the Union is far from reassuring. This is why strategic changes will have to be made in the Union's way of thinking and acting. The entry of the new members -- provided that an agreement is achieved with Norway and membership is approved in the referendums -- will be helpful in this respect. Diplomats taking part in the negotiations said it was no exaggeration to say the agreement was reached only because the Germans made the others feel the full weight of their new role in the center of Europe. In fact, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had not accepted postponing the decisions, thus requiring all participants to come together. Several times, when the negotiations threatened to fail, he simply refused to get up and leave. Germany faced a challenge and made its point, the Foreign Ministry said. If the negotiations had failed this would have indicated to the reform states that the West Europeans do not even want to accept the rich countries in the north, not to speak of the others in the East. If Norway wants, things will work out fairly quickly in Brussels, the Foreign Ministry said. As in Finland's case, securing the transatlantic connection is vital for Norway. Yet, the referendums that are still to be held will not be a walkover. The Germans have internally been accused of selling off the EU cheaply. But Bonn was guided by the idea of helping the governments of the applicant countries alleviate the short pain of adjustment so that everything can get back to normal quickly, the Foreign Ministry said.
