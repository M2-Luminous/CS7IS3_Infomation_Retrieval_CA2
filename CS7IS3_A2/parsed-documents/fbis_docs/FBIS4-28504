Interest rates for spot financing, however, are on the rise. Sources at trading companies said that inter-Korean trade including processing-on-commission dealings is going on as usual. Businesses which deal with North Korea said they will watch how the situation develops before placing new orders with the North, adding this does not mean they would suspend processing-on-commission dealings with the North. A source at Hyundai Business Group said Hyundai is purchasing zinc ingots without any interruption and that the nuclear dispute is not harming trade with other countries. But he said interest rates for long-term spot financing by overseas branches and locally incorporated firms of Korean businesses are rising slightly. Other sources said they believe there will be little change in South Korean trade with the North and other countries before international sanctions against Pyongyang are actually adopted.
