This was reported by Palestinian sources in Tunis. They said Sa'ib 'Urayqat traveled from Jerusalem to Tunis to deliver the message. The PLO terms are as follow: -- Israel will disarm the settlers and permit international presence in the territories. -- Israel will stop expropriating Arab lands in the territories and building new settlements. -- Israel will restructure several settlements situated close to Palestinian population centers, such as Netzarim in the Gaza Strip, Qiryat Arba', and two settlements in the Jericho area. 'Arafat suggests that the Netzarim residents should be relocated to another settlement in southern Strip, and that Palestinians should be allowed to purchase some of the evacuated lands.
