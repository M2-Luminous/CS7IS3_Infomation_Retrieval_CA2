FR940304-0-00016 FR940304-0-00006 Two commenters request that the proposal be revised to allow credit for modifications accomplished previously in accordance with the original issue of the CSB. One of the commenters points out that the only revised listing that appears in Table II of Revision 1 of the CSB is Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;53&hyph;233, which describes additional inspections to be conducted after accomplishing the modification specified in the service bulletin. This commenter states further that it was not the intent of the AAWG to mandate that modifications be accomplished in accordance with the latest issues of the service bulletins. The FAA concurs. After accomplishing the modification described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;53&hyph;233, certain inspections are required. Those inspections are described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;53&hyph;238, which is listed in Table II of the revised CSB and required by paragraph (c)(1) of the final rule. The scope of the required inspections is dependent upon which version of Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;53&hyph;233 an operator accomplished; this issue is addressed under Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;53&hyph;233 in the ``Remarks'' section of Table II of the revised CSB. The FAA finds that accomplishment of modifications in accordance with Table II of the original issue of the CSB may continue. Accordingly, paragraph (e) of the proposal, which would have required certain structural modifications in accordance with the service bulletins listed in Table II of the CSB, has been removed from the final rule. The contents of the first sentence of the second ``NOTE'' that appeared in paragraph (e) of the proposal, which indicated that Lockheed Service Bulletins 093&hyph;57&hyph;184, Revision 6; 093&hyph;57&hyph;196, Revision 5; and 093&hyph;57&hyph;203, Revision 3; are addressed in paragraph (f) of the proposal, are specified in ``NOTE 3'' under paragraph (d) of the final rule. In addition, paragraph (d) of the final rule has been revised to specify that modifications accomplished in accordance with Table II of either the original issue or Revision 1 of the CSB are acceptable for compliance with the requirements of that paragraph. Further, paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of the final rule have been revised to specify that modification in accordance with paragraph (d) or (e) of this AD or in accordance with the applicable service bulletin listed within the inspection portion of either the original issue or Revision 1 of the CSB constitutes terminating action for the individual inspection requirements of the applicable service bulletin. One commenter asks that the number of Model L&hyph;1011 series airplanes of the affected airplanes in the worldwide fleet be revised, since the actual number is larger than that reflected in the economic impact information specified in the proposal. The FAA concurs. The FAA has verified that the correct number of affected airplanes in the worldwide fleet is 241 and has revised the economic impact information, below, accordingly. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 241 Model L&hyph;1011 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 112 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The actions required previously by AD 91&hyph;05&hyph;05 necessitate 1,200 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $40 per work hour. The cost for parts required by that AD is $52,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost of AD 91&hyph;05&hyph;05 to affected U.S. operators over an initial 5-year time period was estimated to be approximately $11,200,000, or $100,000 per airplane. The actions required by this AD will require an additional 549 work hours per airplane to accomplish at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (Note that, in order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has increased the labor rate used in calculating the economic impact of this AD activity from $40 per work hour to $55 per work hour.) Required parts will cost approximately $21,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the additional costs to U.S. operators with regard to the actions required by this AD is estimated to be $5,733,840, or $51,195 per airplane. Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD action on U.S. operators is estimated to be $16,933,840, or $151,195 per airplane. The total cost impact figure(s) discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of either this new AD action or the previous AD, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would be redundant and unnecessary.
