President Lacalle said in Rome that Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries need to contact a public relations firm in Europe and the United States to make the region known abroad. Regarding the foreign service's reform, the sources said changes are needed in order to gain "efficiency and more dynamism," adding that the present structures do not help create an effective presence for the country abroad. The sources said the presence of a permanent ambassador is necessary in countries like Italy, Spain, or France, adding that the diplomatic coverage of countries like Poland could be made through an area ambassador who might even reside in Uruguay. That ambassador could be informed by agents in the respective countries and then schedule regular and efficient visits. The sources said the new system will permit an important reduction of costs in residences, and the money could be used to raise the salaries of diplomats living in Montevideo, whose incomes are usually lower than when they are abroad. President Lacalle, as well as Foreign Minister Abreu, have spoken in the past about the need to reform the foreign service. The minister even insisted that the service's economic and commercial character should be emphasized.
