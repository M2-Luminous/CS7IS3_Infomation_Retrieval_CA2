Young peasants are finding that scientific and technological means are more important in their farm production, as a craze for new farming skills and advanced methods of production emerges in the vast rural areas of this huge agricultural country. The progress of the state "Spark Program", which is aimed at using advanced but suitable technology to promote the local economy in the rural areas, has helped train large numbers of young peasants in Central China's Henan Province. They have been equipped with modern know-how and land management knowledge. The province's over 13 million young farmers are now very active in technical training. More than 50 percent of young people in rural areas have mastered one or two skills. Lou Tingfeng, a young peasant in Baofeng County, Henan, now earns 50,000 yuan (about 5,882 U.S. dollars) each year by raising scorpions after attending a training course. He and the neighboring township government jointly founded a specialised scorpion farm with a total investment of 800,000 yuan (nearly 100,000 U.S. dollars). The farm is expected to produce an annual production value of six million yuan (about 700,000 U.S. dollars) and make a profit of one million yuan. Following his example, many local villagers have come to him for technical advice. Lou has held four training classes on scorpion raising, with the attendance of over 500 people. Now his students are scattered in surrounding counties, spreading the technique. Lou has been called by local government an outstanding young man in helping others to get well-off. Henan now has over 20,000 such young people engaging in various types of specialised production such as fish raising, farm product processing, and fruit tree and vegetable planting. They play an exemplary role in the local economy. Statistics show that 180 technical projects have been carried out in the rural areas of henan. The provincial government has carried out a demonstration campaign on rural comprehensive development among young people in its seven cities, 25 medium-income counties and 20 poverty-stricken counties in the Funiu and Taihang mountains. A total of 45.5 million yuan (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars) has been invested in 401 rural development projects involving thousands of young peasants. The projects have made profits of 850 million yuan (about 100 million U.S. dollars). At the same time, various forms of special technology associations, research societies and technical service firms have mushroomed in the province to serve the campaign. In such organizations, young farmers are learning new techniques with great enthusiasm. Local officials hold that there will soon be an average of 6,000 young peasants trained in the province in the province each year.
