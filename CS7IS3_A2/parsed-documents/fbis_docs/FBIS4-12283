But there are only a handful of them. They fled Afghanistan to Kenya among a group of other Arabs who have recently sought refuge in Africa. Led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian medical doctor, this group is seeking entry into southern Sudan from Kenya. Al-Zawahiri has been to Nairobi a number of times in an effort to find a place for Arabs forced to leave Pakistan. Khartoum has balked at accepting them. Over the past three months, there has been a mass exodus of "Arab Afghans" who have taken Pakistan's threats to expel them seriously.
