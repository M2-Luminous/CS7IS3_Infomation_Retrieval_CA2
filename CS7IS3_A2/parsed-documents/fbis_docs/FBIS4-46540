Zhitnikov under rubric "TEKHNIKA I VOORUZHENIYE Catalog": "Tunguska Gun-Missile Air Defense System"] [Text] The system is intended for air defense of motorized rifle (tank) regiment subunits against strikes by tactical and army aviation, fire support helicopters, cruise missiles and remotely piloted vehicles, and also for engaging lightly armored ground targets and personnel. The system is capable of engaging targets at a range up to 8 km and at an altitude up to 3.5 km. It includes a self-propelled antiaircraft mount, loader/transporter, servicing and maintenance equipment, and an automated monitoring and test station. The self-propelled antiaircraft mount on a tracked chassis (MT-S) base is the system's weapon platform. A hydromechanical transmission and hydropneumatic suspension are used in the chassis construction and provide high off-road capability, good maneuverability, and smoothness of movement over rugged terrain, which permits firing on the move. Two 2A38M twin-barrel automatic antiaircraft guns covered by an armored jacket are located on the sides of a turret with 360ï¿½ traverse. Their principle of action is based on using the energy of powder gases led off through a special opening of the barrels into gas cylinders. A liquid evaporation system is used to cool the barrels. The twin-barrel configuration of the automatic gun permits an intensive rate of fire of up to 5,000 rounds per minute. The automatic guns have a belt feed. The ammunition belt is filled with standardized 30-mm rounds with the help of a ramming machine [nabivochnaya mashinka]. The loader/transporter loads the unit of fire. Loading time for a full unit of fire is 16 minutes. Shipping-launching containers with missiles also are situated on the sides of the turret and protected by an armored enclosure. They perform functions of sealed storage container and launcher. The system's 9M311 guided missile is bicaliber and two-stage. It has a separating solid-propellant booster motor which gives the missile a speed of almost three times that of sound. The launch weight is half that of single-stage missiles with similar characteristics. The small-caliber propulsion stage preserves high speed on the entire flight path. The missile warhead is continuous-rod/fragmentation. It has impact and proximity fuzes, which ensures destruction of a target both with a direct hit as well as when flying by it at a distance of up to 5 meters. The missile control system is semiautomatic, with a radio command communications link. The light flux from a light source installed on the missile hits the optical direction finder and is converted into an electrical signal proportional to deflection from line of sight. The signal goes to the central computer system, which generates control commands. Then they are transmitted in the form of coded pulses through the tracking station to the missile, where the gear generates commands for controlling the steering drive. The missile is moved onto the line of sight and held there. The radar system of the air defense system consists of acquisition and tracking radars as well as a ground interrogator. The acquisition radar has a high scan rate and reliable means of suppressing a signal from local objects, which permits discriminating low-flying targets at ranges up to 18 km with high probability. The interrogator operates in two radio wavebands and provides guaranteed target recognition. The tracking radar accomplishes automatic lock-on and tracking of a target at a range up to 16 km. Hydraulic drives support precise, rapid training of weapons in a wide dynamic range when firing from in place and in movement. The system's high-speed central computer system was developed based on the series-produced Aron-15 computer. It monitors the status of weapon systems, of the turret horizontal gunlaying drive, and of the entire system by simulating an aircraft overflight. It outputs data on target parameters and generates data for firing missile-gun armament. The majority of operations for controlling systems of the air defense system are the responsibility of the computer and automatic equipment unit. This permits a crew with average skills to perform combat work successfully. A team consists of four persons: commander, operator, gunner and driver. The Tunguska is outfitted with special equipment for protecting the crew against weapons of mass destruction and for creating normal conditions for its functioning within the turret.

The surveillance radar scans air space while in place and in movement. After acquisition, targets are identified. The system commander, after determining that there is a target, selects the kind of armament (gun or missile) and passes target designations to the operator for lock-on and tracking. The operator monitors automatic lock-on on the radar screens. If the enemy employs communications jamming, the target is locked-on in a manual mode. The tracking radar outputs precise target designations over synchronous communications to the optical sight and moves it onto the line of sight. The gunner detects the target in the sight's field of view, takes it for tracking, and holds the sight aiming mark on the target in the process of guidance. Data go from the radar to the central computer system for controlling successive fire on targets by missiles and gun armament. Based on results of fire, the commander makes the decision on transferring fire to another target. System reaction time from the moment of target acquisition to firing on the target is 8-10 seconds.
