The Chinese delegation had previously held a series of contacts and meetings that are summed up in the following report by our correspondent: During his meeting with CPPCC Vice Chairman Wang Zhaoguo and members of the accompanying delegation, House of Representatives Speaker Tahir al-Masri said that Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty King Husayn, believes that real peace should be founded on bases that secure its continuation and comprehensiveness and recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and of all the peoples in the region. Al-Masri stressed that Israel has not shown real interest in the peace process nor has it demonstrated a commitment to the resolutions of international legitimacy and a willingness to save the region from the whirlpool of conflict by ending the causes of this conflict. Al-Masri said that the House of Representatives decided to send parliamentary delegations to a number of countries, including China, to explain the dimensions of the siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah and the harm it is causing to the Jordanian people. For his part, Zhaoguo said that the Chinese people highly appreciate Jordan's accomplishments under the leadership of His Majesty King Husayn in all fields, especially in terms of entrenching a democratic regime inspired from Jordan's own characteristics and genuine Jordanian traditions. Zhaoguo explained that the Middle East problem is one of the oldest and most complex international conflicts. He noted that China believes that this problem can only be solved through peaceful negotiations in order to reach a solution that secures the national rights of the Palestinian people--a peace based on the principles and related resolutions of international legitimacy. Zhaoguo said he will convey to the Chinese Parliament and Government the suffering of the Jordanian people as a result of al-'Aqabah siege. He stressed that the Chinese people deeply sympathize with the Jordanian people, hoping that this problem will be solved soon. [passage omitted]
