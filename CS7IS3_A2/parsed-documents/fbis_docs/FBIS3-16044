Are your modest activities or the evasion of publicity responsible for this? [Mintautas] Yes, the press has devoted too little attention to us. I think this is because we are not a state-run organization, like the national defense system or SKAT. As any family, however, we also have some naughty children, but we do not have such problems as the military or volunteers. [Mickeviciute] What are your union's relations with military and volunteer organizations? [Mintautas] Our ties with the national defense system have never been ideal. They have been this way since the time when Mr. Butkevicius became head the National Defense Department. The National Defense Ministry [KAM] has long been persuading us to join it. However, our principle is to be independent. True, I do not envision riflemen without firearms, and an armed organization should be subject to some structure. No government would like to have independent armed men. However, we do not want to engage only in marching and playing brass nicely. Moreover, the national defense system has many people whom the riflemen do not trust. These are former high-ranking Soviet Army officers. We have met with them and we know what they are like. Our cooperation with the SKAT is traditional and sincere, because the latter actually originated from the Riflemen's Union. Having regained some of their prewar facilities, the riflemen are sharing them with SKAT and using its training bases. [passage omitted] [Mickeviciute]What was your attitude toward the volunteer mutiny headed by Maskvytis in the woods near Kaunas? [Mintautas] We did not make any statements during that mutiny. We thought later that we could have assumed a conciliatory function. [Mickeviciute]The community thinks that the Riflemen's Union is in opposition to the elected government. Is this opinion grounded? If there is any confrontation, what are its reasons, and how can they be removed? [Mintautas] I expected such a question. The members of our organization are really dissatisfied with the current Seimas [parliament] majority. This is natural, because most of us come from the other side of the barricades. The Riflemen's Union supported, supports, and will support Lithuania's right-wing forces. However, this should not evoke any dangerous confrontation. I have always claimed that the Lithuanian Government was not brought on tanks from Warsaw, Moscow, or Berlin, and we must get on with it. There are no reasons that should be removed. However, we are unlikely to have good contacts with the current authorities. One cannot shout in a silly manner that everything is bad. For example, a good resolution allowing citizens to keep firearms has already been adopted, which is particularly important to us, the riflemen. [passage omitted] [Mickeviciute]What problems do you have? [Mintautas] We appealed to all our governments for some guarantees. Our members offered their services in guarding the Russian Army while it was here. We would like to contribute to the enforcement of public order, but the police do not want such support. They do not want to grant us even such powers as civilian militia supporters used to have. The police do not forbid us from assisting them, but we ourselves will be responsible for the consequences. We have knocked on many doors concerning these and other similar issues. We have received replies from the ministers of national defense and justice, saying that our request for arms and guarantees should make us subordinate to the KAM or the Interior Ministry. There have been suggestions to draft a new statute because the old one was registered by Mrs. K. Prunskiene [first prime minister of independent Lithuania]. The current draft statute was prepared very quickly, indicating that the Riflemen's Union operates under the KAM. It was presented back in December to Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, who replied that he would like to meet and talk with us. After we draft the new statute, we will hold a congress and decide whether to remain with the KAM or remain independent. We have received a proposal to become a police reserve, but this would mean the end of such organization as the Riflemen's Union.... Our people would not like this.... [passage omitted] [Mickeviciute]Tell us briefly about the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union. What are the number and age of your members? What are your rules of admission? [Mintautas] The union has about 7,000 members, including a small number of former professional USSR officers. We have 15 divisions comprising 150 territorial units. We do not admit former communists to our union. We had not had such a principle before we adopted it at our first congress in 1990. Some of former Communist Party members became our members, took an oath of allegiance, and are now in the ranks of our union. Such was former SKAT chief Colonel J. Gecas. The Riflemen's Union also operates among Lithuanian emigres, and we maintain good contacts with them. Actually we live on financial support from riflemen emigres. Young people between 30 and 35, mostly workers, account for almost 40 percent of our members. We would also like to attract intellectuals to our ranks. Women also belong to our organization, but their number in different divisions is uneven: Kaunas and Utena divisions have 30 females each, while Vilnius -- only 10. Our divisions are rather autonomous. Each division commander is a member of the union's Executive Council. [Mickeviciute] What are your immediate plans? [Mintautas] First of all, I will meet with the national defense minister. Many issues must be discussed and made clear. We do not intend to ask for a single cent from the KAM budget. I do not know why the press reported so. [passage omitted]
