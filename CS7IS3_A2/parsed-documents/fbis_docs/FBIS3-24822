Today the negotiators were expected to start discussing national reconciliation. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports by telephone: [Begin Ligio recording] The second point of the second round of the Lusaka peace talks has entered its embryonic stage. The mediator and the troika of observers are working together on the general principles that have been presented by both sides as a first attempt to narrow differences. Similarly to what has happened when other points have been discussed, frightening and disparate demands will become a document in line with the constitution in force in this country. This is what the troika of observers and sources close to the mediation have said. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye held a news conference. Blondin Beye announced that he will be leaving for Abidjan tomorrow to attend the funeral of the late Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. He added that proceedings will continue to follow their normal course during his absence. Asked about negotiation delays, Beye blamed the negotiators and said that everything that takes place in Lusaka will ultimately lead to the reintegration of National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, men into Angolan society. The Lusaka talks will not veer from what is recognized in the Constitution. They are creating a mechanism to increase trust (?between Angolans and the mediators). The proverb says that persistence pays and that is borne out by facts. After much insistence, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye made an exception and broke his information blackout [preceding word in English] [words indistinct] a plenary meeting with all those participating in the talks so that the media could get pictures. Silence greeted reporters again, however, shortly after the introductory speech. [end recording]
