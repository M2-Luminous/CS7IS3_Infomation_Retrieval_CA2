This is noted in a statement from the committee made public by its chairman Konstantin Zatulin at a news conference in Moscow. The document notes: There are no grounds to trust the capability of the Georgian side to guarantee that the weapons will be handled carefully or that the treaty's stipulation on not transferring them to third parties will be strictly fulfilled.
