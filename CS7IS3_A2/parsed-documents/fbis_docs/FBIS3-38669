Opening the 31st conference on security in Munich, Kohl addressed 220 defense politicians, diplomats and journalists. In his speech, Kohl again supported Bundeswehr participation in so-called peacemaking combat missions. [Begin Kohl recording] I believe a policy which in such a situation invokes peace, but on the other hand refuses the international community the instruments for preserving peace, is not credible or convincing. For that reason, I regard it as indispensable for Germany to participate in all future peacekeeping and peacemaking measures -- naturally, only with our partners and friends in NATO and the European Union. We realize that all our partners expect this of us. Ladies and Gentlemen, this also means that Germany needs a Bundeswehr which meets the demands made on it, including these new demands, a Bundeswehr which must be equipped accordingly. We have learned, perhaps more so than others, that peace and freedom cannot be obtained at no cost. [end recording] [passage omitted]
