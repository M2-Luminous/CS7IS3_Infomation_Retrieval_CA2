Speaking at a meeting with representatives of local and state administration of the Zilina district, Kovac stressed that without privatization Slovakia would not cope with its present serious temporary economic and social troubles. The influx of foreign capital, indispensable for Slovakia, depends on the irreversibility of economic changes and the stability of the domestic political situation, Kovac said. "Although Slovakia has a new government sworn-in in a legitimate way, the tension in our society has not yet dwindled completely," he stated, adding that weakening of the fragile democratic system could "result in the return to the authoritative regime". Kovac called for national and political reconciliation and the unity of citizens. According to him, some people use the "Slovak principle" as a pretext for the search of "lines of separation, accusations, and finding of enemies." In a discussion Kovac reacted to a statement by Zilina Mayor Jan Slota, made at the meeting, who cast doubt on the need to pay heed to what Western countries say on developments in Slovakia. Kovac said that Slovakia's integration into European economic, political, and security structures was in its national and state interest, which must not be challenged by anybody. As a new country, Slovakia is perhaps monitored in a far more sensitive manner than Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. In this connection, reactions in Slovakia are also sensitive when some Western politicians omit Slovakia when listing the countries of Europe's interest, Kovac said, adding that he himself was very sensitive to it. "When we find out...that it is caused by our domestic policy, we are obliged to draw changes from it," he said. Referring to the question of the Magyarization of ethnic Slovaks living in southern Slovakia, Kovac said he was disturbed by this, but the solution of the problem was in the hands of the Slovak cabinet, which could, for example, earmark certain funds from the state budget. During his two-day working stay in central Slovak districts of Zilina and Cadca, Michal Kovac is also to visit enterprises and cultural and historical monuments, and meet with business people.
