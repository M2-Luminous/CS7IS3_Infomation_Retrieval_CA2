Reina was questioned today by opposition politicians and local analysts, who suggested he remove Defense Minister General Reynaldo Andino from his post for disagreeing with the draft bill which the government sent to the National Congress to reform military service. The reform changes compulsory military service to "voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic" service. According to Andino, the Armed Forces do not agree with the change, but will abide by the president's decision. Those who are questioning Andino's remarks argue he has shown disrespect for the president's authority, because by law the military must be "apolitical, obedient, and nondeliberative," and, therefore, they feel the president should remove him from his post. Reina said there is no insubordination on the part of the general and that everyone interprets the draft military service reform as he sees fit. The president asked, "How can it be insubordination, when he is obeying the orders of his commander?" Reina also noted that any citizen can express doubts about the proposal, which, in his opinion, is a democratic right. In referring to those people who contend the defense minister is defying his decision, Reina said, "It seems to me that this is not a correct interpretation, perhaps because of a lack of information or because they do not agree with what is being done." The president said the draft bill on reforming military service was discussed with his cabinet ministers, his advisers, and the military command "until we reached a point of consensus." Reina told newsmen that, after he announced that he had sent the draft bill to the legislature on Wednesday, he received a call from Divison General Luis Alonso Discua, the chief of the Armed Forces, "congratulating" him. The president reiterated on three occasions that he is the Armed Forces commander in chief and that he is not afraid of being wrong, because it will be the National Congress which will open the debate on military service. "The people are represented there in Congress, and if Congress rejects the proposal, then I will know that I have been mistaken," he said. He also said the Armed Forces have admitted that the traditional military draft "was inappropriate, inadequate, and violated basic principles." Reina maintains that military service "has only been compulsory for the poor" and that "terrible injustice was committed under the former system."
