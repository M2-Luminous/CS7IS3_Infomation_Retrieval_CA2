The statement follows media reports from the past two days which quoted Ukrainian Ambassador Volodymyr Krzhanitskiy as saying "the first trainload of nuclear warheads has already arrived in Russia from Ukraine." The embassy said the only thing the ambassador mentioned in recent interviews was that "plans are under way to transfer missile units for subsequent destruction in Russia." The statement describes media reports about the "first trainload of warheads" as an attempt at rushing things.
