The director of defense information, Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, stated this today while speaking with newsmen in Lagos. Brig. Gen. Chijuka said Nigeria had always been an advocate of peace in any conflict involving several African states. The director explained that the Nigerian Army was a tested Army, while the Cameroonian Army was not and could not even quell a common unrest in their country. On the claim by Cameroonians that they had sank two Nigerian ships, Brig. Gen. Chijuka said the claim was the figment of the Cameroonian imagination. The director said the presence of Nigerian troops on the peninsula had stopped the activities of Cameroonian gendarmes on Nigerians living there. He explained that Nigeria has remained level-headed despite the age-long provocation by the Cameroonian gendarmes. Brig. Gen. Chijuka recalled that five Nigerian soldiers were killed by the gendarmes while several others were wounded in 1991. Nigeria, he said, did not retaliate all along because of its responsibility to the continent. He said the Nigerian ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula is based on historical factors and that over 90 percent of the inhabitants of the peninsula were Efik-speaking Nigerians. Brig. Gen. Chijuka said Nigeria's door was still opened for negotiations but cautioned that the Nigerian Army would be there to protect the Nigerian border, and when they come under any attack they would have no choice but to defend themselves. Meanwhile the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, has said that the Nigeria-Cameroon border problem would be discussed later this week at the OAU ambassadorial level. He was answering questions from newsmen in Maputo, Mozambique.
