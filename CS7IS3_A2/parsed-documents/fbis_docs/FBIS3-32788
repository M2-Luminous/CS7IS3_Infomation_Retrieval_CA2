[Begin recording] Well, the most significant, the most important point of the visit was the attitude that exists in Europe toward Cuba, an attitude of interest in Cuba, and a very respectful interest. Many people are following the development of the Cuban situation, its problems, and the way we are facing them. There is interest and concern. I would also say that there is a great respect for, a great understanding of what we are doing. This has been conveyed from an official point of view. We received very cordial treatment from government officials in Belgium, Germany, and France. This same attitude was conveyed by all political sectors of those countries we visited. I think this process will lead to the imminent signing of that framework agreement, that overall cooperation agreement between our country and the European Union, that is, the set of countries that comprise the European Economic Community. As you know, we have relations with each of those members bilaterally. We also talked, and there is great mutual interest, especially with Germany, about working on a specific agreement for the promotion and protection of investments between our two countries, similar to the agreement signed with Italy.
