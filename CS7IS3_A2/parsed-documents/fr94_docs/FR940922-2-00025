FR940922-2-00025 FR940922-2-00007 [A&hyph;583&hyph;806] Small Business Telephone Systems and Subassemblies Thereof From Taiwan; Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: On January 18, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on small business telephone systems (SBTS) from Taiwan covering the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. We are now terminating that review. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jacqueline Arrowsmith or Michael Rill, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 23, 1993, Bitronic Telecoms Co., Ltd. (Bitronic), a manufacturer/exporter of SBTS from Taiwan, requested that the Department conduct an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on SBTS from Taiwan covering the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. On January 18, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (58 FR 2593) a notice of initiation of an administrative review of the order. This notice stated that we would review this one manufacturer/exporter covering the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. On May 19, 1994, Bitronic requested that it be allowed to withdraw its request for a review and that the review be terminated. Section 353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations states that ``The Secretary may permit a party that requests a review under paragraph (a) of this section to withdraw the request not later than 90 days after the date of publication of notice of initiation of the requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the Secretary decides that it is reasonable to do so.'' Because no significant work has yet been done in this review, we have determined that it is reasonable to extend the 90-day time limit and to allow Bitronic to withdraw its request for review. See Steel Wire Rope From Japan; Partial Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews , 56 FR 41118 (August 19, 1991). Furthermore, we note that no interested party objected to termination of the review. Accordingly, the Department is terminating this review. This notice serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with section 353.34(d) of the Department's regulations. Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. This notice is in accordance with section 353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.22(a)(5)). Dated: September 14, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary, for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23503 Filed 9&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
