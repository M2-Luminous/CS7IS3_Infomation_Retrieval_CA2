The warning comes just days after the disclosure by SEGODNYA, the Russian daily, that GMM had financed the election campaign by ultra-nationalist Zhirinovskiy. In a letter, the bank wrote that the illegal activities of GMM constitute a "direct threat to the interests of people who have entrusted the firm with their money." GMM is operating illegally as it does not have a bank license. According to A. Nenachov, the Russian director and sole shareholder in the Netherlands bv, this is not necessary as GMM is a trust company. Russian law makes no provision for this kind of institution. The Russian Finance Ministry issued an identical statement at the end of October, but this was not acted upon. The political allegations made by SEGODNYA shed new light on the affair. The only basis for this warning is that a member of Zhirinovskiy's liberal party, Aleksey Zoyjev, is an adviser to GMM. The Russian daily SEGODNYA is financed by MOST bank, one of three commercial banks which supported the election campaign by Russia's Choice. Russia's Choice Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar unexpectedly lost to Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Party in the elections. Russia's Choice has been seeking an explanation for Zhirinovskiy's success ever since. After allegations that former members of the KGB financed and supported the Liberal Party, the GMM is now being used as a scapegoat. Shortly before the elections, Russia's Choice was itself involved in a scandal. The U.S. marketing company Sawyer Miller Group produced advertising on Russian television for Gaydar's party. This was part of a privatization campaign conducted by Sawyer Miller with U.S. Government money. Instead of the usual slogan -- "Your voucher, your choice" -- Sawyer Miller broadcast an advertisement immediately before the elections with the slogan "Your choice, Russia's choice." GMM's activities are scarcely any different than those of other Russian financial institutions which are earning large amounts of capital in Russia's economic climate of high inflation. The only grounds for criticism is that GMM presents itself as an experienced Netherlands player on stock exchanges in places such as Amsterdam, New York, and Tokyo. GMM, however, is not really involved in such activities, but such a claim relieves the firm of the obligation to apply for a bank license in Russia. The company is in fact an inactive "incorporated company" which was taken over and given new life by 27-year-old Muscovite Nenachov, who also set up Moscow's first federal bank. This is the first time that one of the new capitalist institutions which flourished under Gaydar's influence has been involved in a political scandal. GMM's Moscow office is closed at the moment for the "New Year holidays."
