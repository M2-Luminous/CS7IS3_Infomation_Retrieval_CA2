At the same time he criticised the government for nominal increase in the defence budget. "Indians are building missiles and our government is oblivious of the country's defence needs", he said while commenting on the federal budget Thursday in his chamber. He said he would make a substantive comment on the budget in his speech in the National Assembly. "However my initial impression is that the budget has broken the back of poor people." he said. He said he did not find a single word for the poor in the finance minister's budget speech. He said that increase in the gas prices would result in increase of prices of every commodity. About the 35 per cent increase in the salary of government servants, he said that it was good. But added that what would happen to the ordinary labourer and to the people who were not government servants. He said government had proposed no programme for their well-being. Nawaz Sharif lamented that the new budget offered no relief to the poor. He said that after going through the budget, his initial reaction was that the government had no economic agenda of its own. "They are carrying on the policies of my government", he said. He said there was no substantive increase in the defence budget despite the fact that Indian missile programme posed a serious threat to country's security, demanding more vigilance and military hardware for defence. He said unfortunately Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in her speech to the nation Wednesday said that the armed forces had agreed to the proposal of no increase in the defence budget. He said that the government should have voluntarily increased the defence budget. "Our armed forces are not of such character that they would come to Benazir Bhutto and would bet for increase in the defence budget". He lamented that the government was oblivious to the defence needs of the country. He said that the prime minister should have realised the need for increase in the defence budget. He said that he would make a substantive comment on the budget in his forthcoming speech. However, the secretary general of PML (N) [Pakistan Muslim League -- Nawaz], Sartaj Aziz said that the budget contained a very heavy dose of taxation. He said that the taxation is of indirect nature, burden of which would be borne by the common people. APP adds: Sartaj AZiz said that there was no "new initiative" by the government in the budget. He said tax net had been extremely widened that would adversely affect the common man. He said there had been increase in inflation, the budget deficit had been brought down marginally as compared to last year budget and there was no development programme. He said bulk of the new taxation was on common man. "Never in the history of the country poors were burdened with such a heavy taxation." he added.
