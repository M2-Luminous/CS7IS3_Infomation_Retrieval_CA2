The prime minister said this at Government House this afternoon. [Begin recording] [Chuan] This was a topic discussed in the National Security Council meeting, to the effect that some countries appeared to be prejudiced. Therefore, the mass media is asked to cooperate. [Unidentified correspondent] Will the government readjust its policy toward Cambodia? [Chuan] I said two days ago that there would be no changes in the policy. [Second correspondent] Did the military give you any new information? Did it ask for approval to carry out any action? [Chuan] No. It was I who invited the defense minister and the supreme commander to discuss issues which were touched upon earlier, such as the border and the Cambodian issues. [end recording] Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri told newsmen after his meeting today with the prime minister that he informed Chuan that he would inspect the Cambodian border in Ubon Ratchathani and Trat Provinces. He would listen to briefings by local officials and visit the border areas where residents might be affected in order to gather information for planning appropriate measures. Prasong said the Thai ambassador in Phnom Penh has been sending him regular reports and has tried to call on the Cambodian Government to clarify matters and to request certain documents, such as photographs. The photographs concerned have not been supplied so far. The ambassador reported this morning that from 2-7 May Samdech Norodom Sihanouk will hold a roundtable meeting between the government and the Khmer Rouge with the aim of creating national reconciliation. This roundtable meeting is a good idea. The foreign minister said he hopes that the problems will be resolved. Diplomatic measures will have to be carried out promptly in order to achieve understanding between the two countries. Regarding the Thai military's reaction to the Cambodian Government's conduct, the foreign minister said the military probably wanted to gauge the people's reaction. The people's tolerance also has its limits. Regarding possible interference by third countries, the foreign minister said the issue could not be verified at this time. Therefore, it is not prudent to charge any country of interference unless there is evidence to substantiate it.
