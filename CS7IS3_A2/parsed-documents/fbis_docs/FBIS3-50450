The treaty will take effect once the two countries' congresses ratify it. The treaty was an idea proposed during the last OAS General Assembly in Managua. It was signed by Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma and Nicaraguan Ambassador to Santiago Roberto Ferrey. Chilean Justice Minister Francisco Cumplido characterized the ceremony as "very important," adding that the agreement is a step forward in the fight against crimes whose effect go beyond national borders, such as terrorism and drug trafficking. Cumplido made it clear that the new treaty will have no effect on the extradition petition for Chilean ultra-leftist leader Sergio Bushman that Chile presented to Nicaragua months ago. Bushman, a high-ranking Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR) leader, has been sought by Chilean justice since 1987 when he broke out of a Valparaiso jailhouse while standing trial for the contraband of weapons for use against General Augusto Pinochet's military regime (1973-90). Bushman lived a few years in Sweden and then moved to Nicaragua, where he lives as a political refugee spending his time dedicated to the theater, according to what he told journalists. Francisco Cumplido said he hoped the Bushman case will be resolved before the new treaty takes effect following its ratification by the Chilean and Nicaraguan Congresses. Foreign Ministry Legal Department sources said Bushman's extradition petition currently is being studied by the Nicaraguan Supreme Court.
