Katyal: "Pakistan Terms for Talks Rejected"; quotation marks as published] [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 19--India today rejected--in forceful, categorical terms--Pakistan's suggestion for the future bilateral talks focussing on "modalities for the holding of plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir [J & K]." Pakistan's plea contained in a non-paper given to the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad yesterday, was seen as a restatement of the pre-conditions for continuing the dialogue, raised at the foreign secretary-level talks earlier this month. India, however, reiterated its readiness to discuss with Pakistan all issues pertaining to bilateral relations in accordance with the commitments and mutual obligations of the two countries under the Shimla Agreement. In a statement, the Foreign Office spokesman here dealt with the plebiscite issue thus: "India categorically states once again that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. The question or the need for conducting any plebiscite in any part of India including in the State of Jammu and Kashmir simply does not arise. The people of the State of Jammu and Kashmir have exercised their democratic rights repeatedly as people in other parts of India, unlike the case in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and what Pakistan has labelled as `Northern Areas'. Apart from plebiscite modalities, Pakistan, in another non-paper, dealt with "measures required to create a propitious climate for peaceful solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and other issues." The Indian statement regretted that Pakistan was attempting "through their propaganda exercise to obfuscate the realities of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. India drew attention to three points. One, the violence in Jammu and Kashmir was being perpetrated with the connivance and active support of Pakistan. Two, the government had the will and commitment to counter terrorism, while continuing efforts to enable the people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise their democratic rights. Three, the level of security forces deployed in the State corresponded to the level of violence created by the militants; cross-border terrorism was a major concern of the government and a hurdle in India-Pakistan relations. Pak. support to militants: Dealing with Pakistan's involvement in terrorist violence, the statement said: "There is a climate of violence in which the people of Jammu and Kashmir have had to live through in the recent period. This violence is being generated by militants and foreign mercenaries who have been trained and equipped on Pakistani soil and who have infiltrated into India with the connivance and active support of Pakistan, with the sole objective of eroding the territorial integrity and political stability of India. We have repeatedly called upon Pakistan to desist from sponsoring trans-border terrorism which contravenes the very basic norms of inter-State conduct and good-neighbourly relations." The resolve to counter the designs of militants was reiterated in the following words: "While the Government's endeavour continues to be to provide full opportunities for the people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise their democratic rights and no efforts which could lead to this process is out of consideration, we will not spare any effort to oppose any moves directed against the country's unity and territorial integrity. Pakistan should not have any doubt whatsoever on this score." Setback in talks: The process, set in motion by the talks by the two foreign secretaries, Mr. J.N. Dixit, and Mr. Shahryar Khan, suffered a setback, as a result of Pakistan's stand, as conveyed through the non-papers. The copies of the two documents were given to Mr. Dixit by the Pakistan High Commissioner here, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, yesterday. The first reaction of Mr. Dixit was reflected by a query regarding Pakistan's intentions. The contents of the Pakistani non-papers served to harden India's stand. This was evident, apart from the tone of today's statement, by the absence of any reference to the six proposals, intended to be submitted by India to give a positive twist to bilateral ties. According to Pakistani sources, the door for negotiations had not been closed and that Islamabad continued to be interested in a dialogue and wanted the environments to be improved for this purpose. Pakistan, perhaps, would like the Kashmiri leaders like Mr. Abdul Ghani Lone and Syed Ali Shah Gilani to be released to create proper atmosphere. At the Islambad meeting, the initiative was with India, as Mr. Dixit promised to submit proposals on six subjects including nuclear non-proliferation, other confidence-building measures [CBM], stabilisation of the Line of Control [LoC] in Jammu and Kashmir. The rationale was clear--that the two sides try to foster confidence and mutual trust, as they engage themselves in substantive discussions on Jammu and Kashmir. Because of the sensitive nature of these subjects, there was no escape from intensive internal discussions by the External Affairs Ministry and other concerned ministries. This exercise took time, but the package was getting a final shape. On nuclear nonproliferation, for instance, India intended proposing expansion of the existing treaty on non-attack on nuclear facilities, with a provision, among other things, for observers to watch the functioning of nuclear reactors in the two countries. The two non-papers, perhaps, represented Pakistan's bid to wrest the initiative from India. It would be a pity if the advance, represented by the newly-resumed dialogue, was allowed to peter out. It was worth preserving and building upon. Despite harsh words, the two sides had not given up the path of negotiations.
