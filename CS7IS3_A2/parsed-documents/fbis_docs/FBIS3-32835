It is believed that PNP [Peruvian National Police] General Luis Dominguez Soliz, the Dincote Commander, has been notified. The promoters of this decision believe a cut in personnel will enhance the efficiency of police action. This opinion, however, is not shared by most Dincote officers who say that many times Dincote personnel cannot cope with the volume of work in their fight against terrorism. Reliable sources state that this decision reflects a government decision to cut the Dincote budget and eliminate the 300-soles bonus given to its personnel. It was leaked that the cut in Dincote's specialized personnel will be made in three stages. The first stage entails the dismissal of 200 chiefs, officers, and subalterns, in February. The second and third stages foresee the lay-off of other 100 detectives, thus concluding the personnel reduction. It has not been disclosed what will become of those who will be laid off. Asked to comment on this, some officers noted that the decision caused disappointment among Dincote personnel and a split into two groups -- those who favor and those who oppose the measure. Officers pointed out that the latter group represent the majority who believe a reduction in personnel will virtually curtail the unit that has produced the most resounding successes of the PNP. Our source stated that the current budget was drafted when PNP Lieutenant General Antonio Ketin Vidal Herrera was installed as the Dincote commander. It was precisely at that time that Dincote personnel made the so-called "most spectacular capture of the century," when they arrested [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman Reinoso without firing a single shot on 12 September 1992. Unless the Interior Minister reverses its decision, morale will be further undermined -- especially that of subalterns whose wages are very low. One Dincote officer remarked that last month Interior Ministry spokesmen announced a pay increase for subaltern personnel, but this has not yet happened.
