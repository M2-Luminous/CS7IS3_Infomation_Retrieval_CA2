I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire application which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room. All applications should be either typed or printed and clearly labelled ``Application for Crude Oil Refund.'' Each Applicant must submit an original and one copy of the Application.

C. Payments to the Federal Government and the States Under the terms of the MSRP, 40% of the alleged crude oil overcharge amounts subject to this Decision, $244,000, plus accrued interest, will be disbursed to the Federal government and the remaining 40%, $244,000, plus accrued interest, will be disbursed to the states for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶ 90,509 at 90,687 (1986). When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement.
