Present at the signing ceremony at the Union Buildings in Pretoria were Freedom Front leader Gen Constand Viljoen, ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki, and government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer. All three signatories to the accord hailed it as underlining the importance of peaceful negotiations to reach solutions and avoiding conflict. Gen Viljoen said had it not been for the forum negotiating the accord, "major conflict might by now have erupted". It was also a demonstration of the desire to reconcile the two major indigenous groups. This was the beginning of a process which offered hope of peaceful co-existence. The FF [Freedom Front] had chosen the path of negotiation to avert senseless and futile violence. Gen Viljoen called on Afrikaners to come out in support of his strategy to realise self-determination. ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki said the accord lay the basis for addressing Afrikaner self- determination. Alluding to the Conservative Party [CP], he added it was regretful that some still chose to stay outside the peaceful democratic process. In the aftermath of the elections, the discussions would continue, he said. "This sends a message that there is no need to resist change through violence. We need to accommodate each other. This is another step to create a South Africa in which all citizens will feel they belong to one common whole. It is important that all of us commit ourselves to seek solutions through peaceful negotiations (rather) than by war," Mr Mbeki said. Mr Roelf Meyer said the accord removed all the reasons the CP had advanced for not taking part in the elections. The accord provided for the debate on self-determination to carry on after the elections. The government believed a volkstaat was not viable, he added. "It remains an unrealiseable idea because Afrikaners do not form the majority of the population in any region of the country," Mr Meyer said. The government and the National Party believed self- determination could be exercised in other ways and through other mechanisms than through a volkstaat with demarcated geographical boundaries, he said. Responding to a question about the ANC sending out mixed messages on the "volkstaat" issue by Nelson Mandela saying there "will never be a volkstaat", Mr Mbeki said the ANC would not have been involved in nine months of negotiations on the accord if the organisation did not believe it necessary to discuss Afrikaner self-determination. No volkstaat had been presented as yet to approve or disapprove of, he said. However, the ANC would never accept an Afrikaner "volkstaat" where the objectives of non- racialism and democracy were subverted. The accord, he said, provided for the election results, non-racialism and the encouragement of peace to be taken into account. If the election results signified "substantial support" for a "volkstaat", it would not be the only criteria, Mr Mbeki said. Gen Viljoen said he would regard "above 35 to 40 per cent" of the estimated 1.8-million-strong Afrikaner electorate as proven support, but the interpretation of "sufficient" support lay with the constitutional court. Asked how the move would affect the National Party's support, Mr Meyer said "more than half of those people calling themselves Afrikaners don't want an own geographical area". On the chances of the CP now joining the process, Gen Viljoen said CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg had insisted on 800,000 votes to be agreed on as "substantial support". In addition, Dr Hartzenberg sought agreement that the polling of 800,000 votes would guarantee an Afrikaner Volkstaat. If these demands were not met, the FF should withdraw from the elections. The CP also felt that participation in the polls would legitimise the elections, Gen Viljoen said. Nevertheless, the interim constitution's principle 34 provided for a volkstaat council to be established and the FF might also include experts of the Afrikaner Volksfront on the council. Gen Viljoen said he was concerned about the far-rightwing's threats to destabilise the country and disrupt the elections. He said they should be "wisely" dealt with to avoid bloodshed. Their serious emotional commitment was not difficult for him to understand, he added. He called on them to rather join the FF's strategy and offered to negotiate, facilitate and mediate to avoid violence.
