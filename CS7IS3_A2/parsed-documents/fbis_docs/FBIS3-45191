At the meeting, it was decided that all outstanding pay for teachers and workers should be paid by the Spring Festival. For historical and geographical reasons, economic development in our region has been rather uneven over the years, and some prefectures remain quite impoverished. This plus mismanagement and inefficiency of many enterprises have resulted in back pay in many localities. To solve this real difficulty for teachers and workers, the regional government convened a meeting of leading officials of the economic commission, banks, financial departments, labor departments, planning commissions, and education commissions to look into the situation of back pay and come up with a solution. At the meeting, regional leaders Abulaidi Amurdurexiti, Wang Lequan, Wang Yousan, and (Ufuer Abudula) asked in great detail about the back pay situation in various sectors, offered their views on how to settle the problems, and criticized some departments for incompetence and mismanagement. It was decided at the meeting that the regional treasury should come up with 200 million yuan to pay the arrears. Outstanding wages owed by enterprises should be paid with bank loans. All back pay for teachers and workers must be paid by the Spring Festival so they will be able to have a satisfying holiday.
