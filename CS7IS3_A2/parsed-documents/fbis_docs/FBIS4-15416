Tarasov] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Komsomolets tragedy slightly lifted the veil of secrecy shrouding the loss of submarines in the former Union. So, at present, five nuclear submarines and 43 nuclear warheads are resting on the bed of the world ocean. No doubt, many submariners today remember colleagues who failed to return. This day should rightly become a national day of commemoration for all sailors who have perished.
