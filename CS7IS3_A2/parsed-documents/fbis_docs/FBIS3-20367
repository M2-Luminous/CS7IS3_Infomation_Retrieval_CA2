"We are not going to involve ourselves in each others' internal affairs," said VL general secretary Matti Viialainen after the decision was reached yesterday. "This is an important day for the Finnish left." SKP-Y Chairman Yrjo Hakanen thought that the two parties actually "didn't apply for a divorce," but rather are strengthening their cooperation in the fight against mass unemployment and for maintaining the welfare society. Yesterday's decision means that leadership of the SKP-Y quit the VL. The 14 district organizations of the SKP-Y are to later also leave the VF. The 19-person parliament delegation will continue its activity as before, despite the fact that within it there are some who are regarded as close to the SKP-Y. These four are Marjatta Stenius-Kaukonen, Ensio Laine, Esko-Juhani Tennila, and Jaakko Laakso. SKP-Y Chairman Hakanen said he does not consider any MP as "his own." How the two parties will continue cooperation -- which now is to be normalized -- is still not clear. No decision on campaign cooperation in the parliamentary elections has yet been reached. SKP-Y, which in continuing the activity of the [former] SKP, does not intend to enter the election with its own lists. VL again expects to have also nonmembers on its candidate lists. Double Membership Restricted Viialainen has worked to get SKP-Y members and district organizations excluded from the VL ever since the foundation of VL four years ago. To achieve the goal, the Alliance's party rules are to be amended to allow prohibiting double membership. Now this amending will not be needed, since the agreement satisfactorily resolves this issue. Paragraph 7 [of the agreement] was written so that a member participating in acts harming the party can be expelled. [passage omitted]
