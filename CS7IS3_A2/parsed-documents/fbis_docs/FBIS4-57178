One of the issues discussed was actions against social phenomena that degrade moral values. Female and male prostitution, streetwalkers, and pimping were terms that gave rise to comments stressing the need for legal support and repression to punish these activities closely tied to tourism. The effectiveness of recent police operations to preserve an orderly society were also acknowledged. On the other hand, it was mentioned that the solution to the problem ought to lie in prevention and in teaching the youth in school to repudiate socially sanctionable behaviors. In workshops being conducted in several provinces, students are found to have a noncritical and, of course, tolerant attitude due to a lack of information. This reaffirms that the home must take on an increased level of involvement and responsibility. Among the issues discussed by the commission were community efforts in youth recreation and praise for the accomplishments attained by the People's Councils working closely with political, cultural, and sports organizations. There are already 18 discotheques nationwide and several more will be opened this year; there will also be a significant increase in youth clubs. The care of people with mental problems was also discussed and it was clear that even though the Cuban state, with scarce resources right now, gives priority to these cases, the legal responsibility for the mentally ill lies with the family, which in certain cases relinquishes their care. The plenum of the commission discussed very contemporary issues which generally cause concern to the population. It was a very up-to-date and down-to-earth plenum.
