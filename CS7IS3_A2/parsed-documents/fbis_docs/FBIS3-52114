He talked about politics, the economy, and prospects for political dialogue. Here is a summary of the main topics from Malek Elilmi. [Malek] At a request from the National Dialogue Commission, Mr. Redha Malek said the Higher State Council [HCE] is continuing its task for another month to give greater opportunities for the dialogue to continue and for a national conference to be held. Mr. Redha Malek said the HCE has completed its task and had prevented Algeria from becoming a new Afghanistan. He said history will bear witness that in this difficult situation we have saved the state and democracy. Redha Malek said the aim of the national conference is to arrive at the minimum level of consensus among Algerians who understand the democratic game and those who favor the rule of law and political pluralism. He said the dialogue is open to all reasonable Algerians who oppose terrorism and realize it is an impasse. We favor breaking with the mistakes of the past, Redha Malek said. We have gotten into this situation because the state did not play its role and the consensus which existed was broken up and eroded. Deviations occurred, Redha Malek said, which caused the people to lose confidence in the state. The political authorities will now endeavor with full determination to build a firm state which has credibility among the people, Redha Malek added. On Algeria's debts and economic revival, Redha Malek said Algeria will meet all the deadlines and will pay all its current debts of $25-26 billion. Debt servicing has become a heavy burden this year, reaching 9.3 billion. Since December, we have opened up a dialogue with the IMF. A meeting with our experts resulted in notable progress, and in January we will try to reach an agreement to ease debt servicing. This stage is difficult, Redha Malek said, but it is temporary. We have great human and material resources, and we will endeavor to convince the international community to participate in reviving the Algerian economy.
