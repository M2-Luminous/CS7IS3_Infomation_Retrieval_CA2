Here is a report by Adnana Hadziahmetovic and Zoran Pali on today's Assembly session. [Begin recording] [Hadziahmetovic] According to the draft law on the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that the deputies adopted today, the government is to perform the function of government of the Federation until a final peace solution on Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached and implemented. Expounding on this proposal, Dr. Kasim Begic pointed to the need to legally and technically coordinate this proposal with the first Law on the Government of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina that was adopted yesterday. What is involved is, as he put it, the government with the same personnel composition playing a double role. This legal and technical coordination should be done by the Government and the Legislative Commission. At the same time, the law on ministries and other state bodies of the republic was adopted in the form of a draft and deputies will present possible remarks on it to the Legislative Commission by 10 June. The law on ministries and other state organs of the republic should be adopted at the next assembly meeting in 14 days. Deputies of the Republican Assembly today also adopted the Law on (?Ratifying) Decrees with Legal Power to the [word indistinct] draft decision on endorsing ordinances adopted by the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina acting as assembly. Presenting the Legislative Commission's decisions on the further procedure of adopting these laws and decisions, Dr. Kasim Begic made the following proposal: [Begic] All 594 ordinances adopted by the Presidency acting as the Assembly should be ratified, thereby ensuring the consistency of the functioning of the republic's legal system. We also suggest that the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Assembly reexamine all these documents, each in detail, within the next three months, so we can decide which law, decision, or appointment and dismissal [word indistinct], that is, which individual provisions in them should be amended or deleted. [Hadziahmetovic] As they did not take part in endorsing these decisions, deputies of the Croatian Democratic Community will be directly included in the procedure of adopting them. Later at the session, the draft law on Bosnia-Herzegovina's independence day was endorsed; the Assembly will decide on it at its next session. [Pali] The Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted the proposal of the law on the amendments to the law on roads. Before adopting the law, deputies Pero Vasilj and Abdulah Konjicija took part in the debate. Vasilj said that before voting in the Assembly, one should draft a serious program and only then discuss it and make decisions. Konjicija spoke of several roads used to bring humanitarian aid to Sarajevo and added that prices would be lower by one-half of a German mark if these roads were repaired. Despite the war and the lack of resources, one should plan to repair these roads, Abdulah Konjicija said. With 10 votes against and four abstentions, the deputies also adopted the Law on International Road Transportation. In the second part of the session the deputies attention was distracted by the long-awaited draft law on temporarily making available to former owners the nationalized offices and city development land. Due to the seriousness of the problems with this law, it was decided after a brief debate to prepare the draft, with certain amendments and improvements, to be adopted at the coming session of the Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the second day of the session, the Assembly adopted a series of legal documents without debate, including the Law on Zoning Activity, [word indistinct], and the laws on amendments to ordinance on pension insurance in case of war or direct danger of war, on military prosecutors' offices, and on regional military courts. Concluding the session, Miro Lazovic, chairman of the Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in agreement with heads of caucuses, convened the next Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina session for 15 June.
