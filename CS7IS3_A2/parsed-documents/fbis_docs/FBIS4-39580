A spokesman for the department Dmitriy Kokorin said that at the end of last month the leadership of the country's only tanker fleet Novoship (Novorossiisk) asked the department and the State Oil Company Nafta to give priority to Russian tankers in transporting export oil. Novoship and the department account the steady decline in the share of export cargoes transported by Russian tankers to the fact that most oil contracts between Russian exporters and foreign customers are on FOB (free on board) terms. Under such contracts exporters deliver oil to the port of dispatch while the importer is responsible for the rest of the transportation. At the moment most Western oil importers are using their own tanker fleets while Novoship tankers are standing idle. Novoship has 45 tankers with a combined payload of 2.1 million tons, 16 oil and ore ships with a payload of 1.4 million tons and 5 oil and ore ships working for the Russian-Norwegian shipping line Novoklav.
