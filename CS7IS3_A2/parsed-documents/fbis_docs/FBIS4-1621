Deng Rong is demanding 70,000 renminbi [RMB] (HK$61,600) from the Yantai Printing Factory in a suit filed in the city's middle courts last month. The Yantai factory is understood to have hired a lawyer to defend itself against the charges, raising the possibility that Deng Rong herself might appear before the court at a hearing this month. "The Yantai factory is not going to admit to the charge. But it's hard to say now whether she will go," a source said. Deng Rong -- the youngest of Deng Xiaoping's three daughters and perhaps his closest confidante -- felt Shandong authorities had been too soft on the factory. The Shandong Press and Publications Bureau fined the factory only RMB 20,000 earlier this year after it admitted printing 30,000 illegal copies of the popular book. Private investigators hired by Deng Rong later discovered that more than 100,000 copies had been run off. "Mao Mao [her pet name] felt it was useless to rely on the Shandong authorities because this factory is part of their system," a source said. "We suggested she delay the suit and allow administrative measures to take effect but she insisted on going ahead right away." My Father, Deng Xiaoping has been the target of book pirates ever since it hit the shelves in China last September. Pirate editions may outnumber the 900,000 officially issued copies by as much as 10 times, sources said. Another state printing factory, in Wuhan, admitted to pirating 10,000 copies, although the books were confiscated before being sold. Other printing factories in Guangxi and Shaanxi were under investigation by the State Copyright Administration (SCA) on special orders from Deng Rong, the sources said. Those pirated in Guangxi were of such low quality that it was difficult to read, which Deng Rong believed lowered the book to the level of underground trash novels, the sources said. She hoped the Yantai case, where a decision was expected by the end of this month, would serve as a warning to other pirate printers. She also wanted the problem to be solved before her second volume of the biography -- covering the patriarch's life since 1976 -- appears in a few years. Juicy details about the elder Deng's role in crushing the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, as well as other political storms since the Cultural Revolution, would make even richer pickings for book pirates, especially if he had died by the time the volume came out, the sources said. SCA sources have confirmed that copyright violations will soon be made a criminal offence subject to jail terms of up to seven years. As reported earlier in EASTERN EXPRESS, Beijing leaders promised to pass the criminal legislation after Deng Rong flew into a rage over rampant piracy of the biography prior to a trip to Japan in February. A special National People's Congress Standing Committee will be held in May to pass the legislation. When asked about the piracy problem during the recent meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing, Deng Rong grimaced and replied: "Of course, I'm not happy about it."
