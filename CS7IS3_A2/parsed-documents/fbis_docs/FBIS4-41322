At a briefing in Moscow Thursday he expressed his satisfaction that recently the tension around the sanctions "has slightly waned." Panov drew attention to Russia's proposal to convene an international conference on the problems of the Korean peninsula. In particular, he pointed out that "the bilateral negotiations held between the United States and North Korea, North Korea and IEAE, and North Korea and South Korea were fruitless." "It would be more expedient for all interested parties to meet at a conference," said Panov. Moscow proposes that at this conference the agenda include such problems as a guarantee of the Korean peninsula's non-nuclear status, normalization of relations between North Korea and the United States, North Korea and Japan, and North Korea and South Korea, and implementation of confidence measures between North Korea and South Korea. Panov also underlined that Moscow proposes to convene an international conference of foreign ministers in Geneva within two weeks after adoption of a corresponding decision of the UN Security Council. Panov believes that in the future the conference may continue its work in Pyonyang and Seoul. According to Panov, the United States has given its backing to the idea of the conference, China and Japan have also expressed a positive attitude towards this idea though they believe that "major attention should be attached to bilateral negotiations." Responding to Interfax concerning the possibility of a revision of Russia's position with respect to the sanctions in the case that a conference prove fruitless, Panov said: "Let's try such a form of negotiations and then we shall think want to do next."
