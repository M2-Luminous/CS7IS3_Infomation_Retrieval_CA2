As a result, one might conclude that all Japanese have become enthusiastic supporters of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a way to dispel what many view as totally unfounded suspicions. That, however, is not entirely the case. Although the Japanese government has firmly maintained its support for extending the treaty indefinitely beyond 1995, when it is due for renewal, other influential people --including scientists, some lawmakers and the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- argue that the pact should not be extended without correcting what they feel are its gross inequalities. The treaty was established in 1970 to prevent additional countries from acquiring or developing nuclear weapons. But Japanese critics say Tokyo should make its support for extension of the pact conditional on more efforts by existing nuclear powers to shrink or eliminate their own nuclear arsenals. ``If you want to build a truly effective non-proliferation regime, the real question will be how to let countries like India, Pakistan and Israel into the system,'' said Kumao Kaneko, a professor of international relations at Tokai University and a former director of the Foreign Ministry's nuclear energy division. The three countries have so far refused to sign the treaty. Doubly Unfair He is not alone in sympathizing with such nations, which have resisted international pressure to join the treaty on the ground that the declared nuclear powers -- China, France, Russia, the UK and the U.S. -- have not done enough to cut their own atomic weapons, as required by Article 6 of the treaty. The current pact is doubly unfair, developing nations contend, because unlike other signatories, the five declared nuclear powers are under no obligation to accept international inspections of their nuclear facilities. And it is practically impossible to rectify this situation because the consent of all five is needed to amend the treaty, critics point out. ``The veto power of the five nations is clearly a problem,'' Ryukichi Imai, who represented Japan at a disarmament conference in Geneva, told a recent international forum in Tokyo. Looking back over the past 25 years, some important but unexpected developments, such as the breakup of the Soviet Union, have occurred, which demonstrate the treaty's inadequacy, he said adding, ``You cannot guarantee that similar things will never happen in the next 25 years.'' Imai thus objects to an indefinite extension of the treaty. Instead, he said: ``We can extend it by another 25 years. After that, we can take another look at the system.'' Annette Schaper, a nuclear physicist at Germany's Peace Research Institute Frankfurt, agreed. ``The extension of the treaty should be ... linked to nuclear disarmament,'' she said at the Tokyo forum. Even some Japanese government officials are resentful of the existing regime's shortcomings. In fact, one of the main reasons that the government failed to clarify its stance over extension of the treaty by the time of the G-7 summit last July in Tokyo -- which initially stirred overseas speculation about Japan's nuclear intentions -- was that many Japanese officials had difficulty with the tendency of the declared nuclear powers to stress non-proliferation while showing relative indifference to nuclear disarmament and security guarantees for non-nuclear states. Classic Dilemma To the Japanese officials, the issue of strengthening the treaty poses a classic dilemma of making a transition from an imperfect to perfect world. ``I very much understand the sentiment of those developing nations who complain about the (treaty's) unfairness,'' said Akira Hayashi, director general for arms control and scientific affairs at the Foreign Ministry. However, if Japan makes its support for extension of the pact conditional on nuclear disarmament, this would encourage other nations to harden their stance against the existing agreement, he said. ``This would undermine the chances of even extending the treaty for a short period. And it is better to have an imperfect regime than no regime at all.''
