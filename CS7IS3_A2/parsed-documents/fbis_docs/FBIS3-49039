The most important topics were the cessation of the Croat-Muslim conflict, sending humanitarian aid, and the problem of territorial settlement between the Croatian and Muslim communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. An agreement has been reached that in the next two years Mostar should be administered by the European Union. The heads of delegations, [Croatian Foreign Minister] Mate Granic and [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister] Haris Silajdzic, also met peace negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. Negotiations are to be resumed tomorrow. A good start in Vienna: a principled readiness for peace, and the free dispatch of humanitarian aid to all. At one-hour tete-a-tete talks held behind closed doors, the envoys for President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic set the agenda for the talks, and then all members of the delegations entered the conference hall in Vienna's Hofburg Palace. The Muslim side expressed its principled readiness for a complete cease-fire. This is a preparatory meeting for Geneva, with envoys being in permanent consultations with Zagreb and Sarajevo. [Begin Granic recording] We spent most of the time on cease-fire talks and future Croatian-Muslim relations. [end recording] They spoke about the main issues -- securing aid for the entire population, Croatians and Muslims, securing freedom of movement for aid convoys. They also discussed the completion of POW exchanges based on the all-for-all principle, whereby the Croatians have so far done more. Topic number one was a cease-fire and the cessation of all hostilities. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Has a step been made toward peace, in central Bosnia for instance? [Silajdzic] We will continue to discuss that issue tomorrow. You must understand that in light of our past experience, I speak with slight reservations about global and final solutions. I can tell you that my impression is that there is a great deal of goodwill on both sides and that is a good start. [Correspondent] The issue of sea access was raised and will continue to be discussed. Croatia's positions on this issue are firm. Reference is being made to the lines of demarcation within a union of the Bosnia-Herzegovina republics. [Granic] Some progress has been made with regard to humanitarian issues. Talks about all other issues will resume tomorrow. [Correspondent] The atmosphere at the talks reflects the difficult situation in the field, where Muslims cannot benefit any further from continuing their war against the Croats. Although all issues were touched upon today, a general agreement is no nearer. [Granic] This is a preparatory meeting before Geneva, even much more in view of the situation in central Bosnia. [Silajdzic] The atmosphere can be described as constructive. Today we discussed humanitarian convoys, and I think we agreed to hold a meeting shortly to agree on continuing sending fresh convoys, desperately awaited by the population of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We also discussed Mostar. We, of course, agreed that the European Union would administer Mostar over two years or even less, depending on what we agree. I can also say that I am very pleased with the fact that both sides accept the idea of Mostar for the people of Mostar [Mostar Mostarcima], in other words the return of all the people of Mostar to their town. [end recording] Croatians accept this idea of Mostar's status, providing it implies the departure of those who are not from Mostar, who came from elsewhere, of Muslim newcomers. Negotiations in Vienna are continuing.
