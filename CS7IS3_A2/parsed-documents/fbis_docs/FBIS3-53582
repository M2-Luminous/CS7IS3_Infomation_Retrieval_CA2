The stands were clear: Al-Asad, who called for the peace of the brave, was not and will never be like 'Arafat who distorted this slogan and turned it into a capitulatory slogan for the defeatists. Al-Asad, who was the first to raise this slogan, wants it to be clear and frank. He wants peace to be based on achieving justice and restoring rights. The U.S. officials, who dreamed of achieving something from this meeting in the interest of the Zionist entity, did not hide this fact when they conveyed Clinton's impressions about President al-Asad's steady and firm stand on issues considered by Damascus to be among its top priorities and commitments. At the top of these commitments is the fact that the Palestinian vanguards, which found shelter, sympathy, and care in Syria are militant and liberation vanguards that seek to achieve their Palestinian people's freedom and to see dawn on their usurped lands. Thus, Arab Damascus refutes American and Zionist allegations that the Palestinian liberation factions are terrorist organizations that undermine peace. Clinton said at his news conference that differences with Syria lie in different fields, including the presence of certain groups, such as the Jibril group [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command], as he said in his statement. This reaffirms our Palestinian people's confidence in al-Asad's Syria, which forced Clinton to publicly annul the label of terrorists with which the vanguards of our people were described and to acknowledge the firmness of the Syrian stand. Therefore, the expectations of some observers have been reiterated; namely, the clear and firm Syrian stand will not be changed by all that has been connoted by Zionism and all that it has planted in the mind of the U.S. Administration in order to keep the United States a tool in its hand. The al-Asad-Clinton summit very ably disproved the picture drawn before the U.S. President by the stands of capitulation and shame adopted by some defeatists and surrenderers who, falsely, claim the representation of our heroic people. Those defeatists and surrenderers panted in Washington just to put their hands in the hand of terrorist Rabin and to sign the accord of treason with him at the expense of their people's objectives and aspirations. Greetings of appreciation and pride from our Palestinian people to the stand of brotherhood, fraternity, struggle, and determination to achieve justice advocated by al-Asad's Syria from the beginning of our people's cause when 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam led our people's strugglers, until he was martyred in Ya'bad's jungles, and when Sa'id al-'As carried out his heroic acts, until the full liberation is achieved, God willing.
