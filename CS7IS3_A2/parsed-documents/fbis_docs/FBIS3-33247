The guerrillas' plan to prevent the election process has been expanded to eastern Santander Department, where the subversives have intimidated voters in rural areas. Voter lists were destroyed in the area's municipalities and a warning was issued: No one will be allowed to go to the voting sites. In the 12 municipalities where guerrilla raids have taken place, the rebels have warned that they will control highways until election day and will close the area to visiting political candidates. The area where the death threat against voters has been made includes the municipalities of Surata, Chata, Matanzas, and Veta, all of them in eastern Santander, Santa Elena, [words indistinct], and Pata, where police have not been allowed to enter, and the entire province of Velez, where the guerrillas threaten to kill any candidates who attempt to visit the area. On Monday the mayors will present a report on the situation to the defense minister and the Army commander.
