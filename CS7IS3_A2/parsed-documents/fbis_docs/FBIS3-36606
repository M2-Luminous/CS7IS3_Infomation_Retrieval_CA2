The verdict was announced on February 7 in Tbilisi. Sharmaidze, 21, alleged that he had fired at a passing car, not knowing who was in it, after hopeless attempts to stop any car to borrow several liters of gasoline. A bullet hit Fred Woodruff in the head. The head of Eduard Shevardnadze's security service, who was driving the car, was freed from his duties after the tragedy. According to various sources, Woodruff was a high-ranking CIA staffer who instructed Shevardnadze's security guards in Tbilisi. CIA chief James Woolsey came to Tbilisi to collect Woodruff's body.
