On the night of 3 March, Amorim confirmed here to GAZETA that Gore will meet Franco. After visiting Argentina, Gore will come immediately to Brazil, where he will discuss topics such as the environment, sustainable development, and the U.S.-Latin American summit to be held in Washington this year. Amorim said Gore will visit Brazil in an atmosphere of positive bilateral relations as a result of the U.S. decision to refrain from imposing trade sanctions on Brazil as part of its quest for ensuring protection of intellectual property rights. Commenting on this issue -- which was resolved on 25 February, Amorim noted that Brazil benefited from the new framework created on the subject, that is, the wording of "TRIPPS" (Trade-Related Intellectual Property Protection System) negotiated under the GATT Uruguay Round. Amorim also noted that Brazil has made progress in this area and that his willingness to go to Washington on 16 February just to discuss the matter with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor -- during a 90-minute meeting -- created a good impression in the United States. Speaking to this newspaper, Amorim said: "They felt that we have shown interest." Amorim said a new positive stage has started in our relations that is "very favorable for cooperation in sustainable development and investments. Potential issues of conflict have been eliminated."
