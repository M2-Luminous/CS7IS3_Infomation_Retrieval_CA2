In a statement today, the Movement voiced its strong rejection of the agreement's provisions and all its repercussions on the Palestinians. It said the agreement is expected to have serious connotations and repercussions which might result in confrontations among the Palestinian people themselves, something which the Israelis had been endeavoring to realize for a long time. The Movement said: We are apprehensive that when the Palestinian police arrive in the Gaza and Jericho areas, they will be transformed into forces whose aim would be to continue arrests among our people instead of providing security, reassurance, and stability which were denied the Palestinian people for a long time. The Movement hoped that the Palestinian police force will back their Palestinian brothers and will not be a burden to them. It warned that the Movement will not sit idly by if these forces adopt the role of an honest guard to the Zionist settler presence. The Movement said that if the 'Arafat leadership followed the policy of gagging people, confiscating their liberties, and imposing emergency regulations on the citizens, it will enter into a big labyrinth and the situation will become like a powder keg, liable to explode at any moment.
