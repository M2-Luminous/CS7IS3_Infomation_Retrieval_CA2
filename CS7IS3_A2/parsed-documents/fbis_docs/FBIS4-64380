The German armed forces have increasingly turned into a "quantity that is negotiable at short notice," he stated today in Bonn during the presentation of a book by Bundeswehr Inspector General Klaus Naumann. "If this development continues, we will be facing problems," he pointed out. Woerner criticized that the strength and the structure of the Bundeswehr seem to be "manipulable at will." This cannot be blamed on the defense minister alone. The whole government and the whole parliament are responsible. Woerner added: "If the impression is created among the public that one can treat the Bundeswehr in this way, this is the beginning of the end of sensible security precaution in Germany." Yet not the soldiers are to blame but the entire political class. The NATO secretary general stressed that the reunited and sovereign Germany can only remain a reliable partner if, as the central land power in Europe, it maintains armed forces that correspond to its geostrategic situation and its political significance -- both in quantitative and qualitative terms. At the beginning of his speech, Woerner pointed out that, as NATO general secretary, he is not allowed to interfere with the internal affairs of the member states of the alliance.
