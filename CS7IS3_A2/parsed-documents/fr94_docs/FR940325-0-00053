FR940325-0-00053 FR940325-0-00013 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 99 [GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100; FCC 94&hyph;30] Narrowband Personal Communications Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This Memorandum Opinion and Order ( MO&O ) finalizes the spectrum allocation, service rules, and pioneer's preference decisions for the narrowband personal communications service (PCS). This action is taken in response to eight petitions for reconsideration and clarification of the First Report and Order ( R&O ). These rules are intended to foster introduction of this new service to the public, contribute to development of the national information infrastructure, and provide for ubiquitous wireless access to new voice and data services. Facilitating the introduction of these services will create new jobs and promote U.S. competitiveness in the global telecommunications market. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tom Mooring, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;8114. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a synopsis of the Commission's MO&O in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100, adopted February 3, 1994, and released March 4, 1994.

Synopsis of MO&O 1. In the R&O , 58 FR 42681 (August 11, 1993), the Commission defined PCS very broadly to encompass a wide variety of mobile and ancillary fixed communication services, which could provide services to individuals and business, and be integrated with a variety of competing networks. Narrowband PCS was defined as PCS services operating in the 901&hyph;902 MHz, 930&hyph;931 MHz and 940&hyph;941 MHz bands. Narrowband PCS services are expected to include advanced voice paging, two-way acknowledgment paging, data messaging, and both one-way and two-way messaging and facsimile. Three megahertz (MHz) of spectrum were allocated for narrowband PCS services; 2 MHz were made available for immediate licensing and 1 MHz remains to be addressed in the future. A channel plan was adopted based on 50 kHz-wide channels with 26 channels generally available to all interested parties. In addition, eight 12.5 kHz-wide (paging response) channels were made available only to existing paging licensees. Three different-sized PCS service areas were adopted: Nationwide, areas based on Major Trading Areas (MTAs), and areas based on Basic Trading Areas (BTAs). (MTAs and BTAs are defined in Rand McNally's 1992 Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide at pages 38&hyph;39.) Eleven channels were made available on a nationwide basis; 13 channels were made available on a MTA basis; and 10 channels, including the 8 paging response channels, were made available on a BTA basis. Each entity was permitted to acquire up to three licenses per geographic area. Geographic-based construction requirements were adopted that required nationwide licensees to construct 250 base stations in 5 years and 500 base stations in 10 years; MTA licensees to construct 25 base stations or serve 25 percent of the MTA's geographic area in 5 years and to construct 50 base stations or serve 50 percent of the MTA's area in 10 years; and BTA licensees to construct 1 base station and initiate service in 1 year. In order for a base station to be counted toward the required number of base stations, the base station had to serve 3,000 square kilometers (km2). Base stations that serve less than this area had to be aggregated to form an equivalent service area. Finally, in the R&O the Commission granted Mobile Telecommunication Technologies, Inc. (Mtel) a pioneer's preference for a nationwide 50 kHz-wide channel for developing and testing ``multicarrier modulation'' technology capable of transmitting a 24 kilobit per second simulcast signal in a single 50 kHz channel and for designing a system capable of providing a variety of new two-way services in a single 50 kHz channel. An additional 18 pioneer's preference requests were denied. On reconsideration, in the MO&O the Commission took the following action:
