FBIS4-6477 "dreas077_c_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 North Korea Anti-Chongnyon Demonstration in Tokyo Denounced Anti-Chongnyon Demonstration in Tokyo Denounced SK2104105694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1016 GMT 21 Apr 94 SK2104105694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- More than 70 members of 20 organisations under the "Kanto Council of the Great Japan Patriots Union", a rightwing organisation in Japan, on April 19 kicked up a row against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) in front of the Korean hall where the central headquarters of Chongnyon is housed, and the Tokyo head office of the Korean Bank and the Tonghae Trading Company, Ltd., according to a KNS report from Tokyo. The rightwing gangsters riding in 30 loudspeaker cars committed rowdyism, letting loose an ugly torrent of words such as "Chongnyon, get out of Japan" and "North Korea, immediately stop nuclear threat to Japan". This provocation came at a time when the Japanese reactionary authorities were zealously joining the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique in the anti-DPRK nuclear rackets. It can never be considered to be an accidental or isolated incident. Chongnyon and the Korean residents in Japan are sternly denouncing this exceptional provocation, regarding it as an offspring of the Japanese authorities' hostile policy toward the DPRK and the anti-Chongnyon moves, not a self-determined act of rightwing gangsters.
