Every year enterprises discharge more than 30 million tonnes, and motor vehicle transport 20 million tonnes of these substances into the atmosphere. There are 400 kg to every inhabitant of the country. One-half of our population drinks dirty water. Around 28 cubic km of dirty water are discharged into reservoirs every year. Participants in the first scientific and practical conference on "Problems of the Rehabilitation of the Population in Zones of Ecological Violations," which concluded in Moscow yesterday, spoke about all this with alarm. It was organized by the International Fund for Socioecological Aid and a number of trade union, state, and other organizations in the framework of preparation for the All-Russia Day of Defense Against Ecological Danger. The assembly discussed draft normative documents on ecological state of emergency and ecological disaster zones and the compensations procedure for damage to the health and property of citizens caused by pollution of the environment. The conference appealed to the Russian president and the organs of legislative and executive power to adopt urgent measures to fulfill the Russian Federation Law "On Protection of the Natural Environment," drawing attention to the fact that ecological policy should become a component of economic and social transformations.
