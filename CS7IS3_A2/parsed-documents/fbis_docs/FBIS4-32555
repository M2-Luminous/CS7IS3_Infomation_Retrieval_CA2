The Center Accord [PC] itself you built up as rather an opposition to the ZChN. Today, the PC and the ZChN are the core of a new confederation of the right, the Alliance for Poland. How should one treat that alliance: as your success, your defeat, or the closing of some chapter? [Kaczynski] Before 19 September [date of most recent parliamentary elections], I knew that, without an accord, the right would meet defeat. I expected an even better result for the left--that it would have two-thirds of the Sejm. Today, I regard the alliance with the ZChN as a success, though too late. [POLITYKA] Do you expect a rise in popularity as a result of the joining of these two banners? [Kaczynski] It is the joining not only of banners, but also of organizations, including at the local level. The Alliance for Poland will find its own legal and organizational formula. In Poland, it is not possible to register parties that are made up of other parties, so we will have to think about this matter. [POLITYKA] But what new political quality will emerge upon the joining of too separate groupings that nevertheless retain their separateness? [Kaczynski] On the one hand, organizational rapprochement; on the other, a programmatic compromise as well. There were fierce negotiations and occasionally crises over the program, but, in the end, we worked out the outline of a program. [POLITYKA] You speak about unification and success, but there were several divisions before that unification was reached. The Movement for the Republic and Aleksander Hall's party disassociated, and strong tendencies against the alliance with the PC in the ZChN itself. Is such a unification through division really a step forward? [Kaczynski] One can look at the right from two points of view. One can exaggerate phenomena we consider the scraps, or one can look at what is essential. I understand that there are forces and groups that are hindered or even threatened by the united right. We are simply uniting in a rational way; it is not possible, after all, that everyone should unite. [POLITYKA] Do you mean to say, then, that the fundamentalist wing within the ZChN, represented by Jan Lopuszanski or Marek Jurek, is a meaningless scrap? [Kaczynski] I would not unite the names of Lopuszanski and Jurek; they are completely different politicians. I do not regard Marek Jurek as a scrap. I hope he stays in the ZChN. The essence of the present arguments in that party are not entirely clear to me. But the fact that we will differ in many matters seems to me completely natural. An example is the Bavarian CSU, where there is room for both clerics, or let us say "church people," and liberals. To use Polish terms, in such a right-wing party there is room for both Marek Jurek and Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. Perhaps not for Donald Tusk, because he is surely an unreconstructed liberal. [POLITYKA] So you have hope for the right? [Kaczynski] It should stabilize the political order, which is now so unsteady. There emerges a chance for a quadripartite system: the postcommunists, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], the Freedom Union, and the united right. There could also be room for the Union of Labor, which might take the place of the postcommunists. This is not out of the question. [POLITYKA] You would then be the party furthest to the right? [Kaczynski] The furthest of the significant parties, meaning those that are capable of gaining at least 15-20 percent of the votes in an election--because it is characteristic of Poland that 15-20 percent is entirely sufficient to rule the country, as shown by the PSL. [POLITYKA] What would a united right have to offer, in the sense of a program or idea? Whatever you might say, the Polish right calls to mind a kind of Catholic fundamentalism, radical decommunization slogans, or just inscrutability. [Kaczynski] You have presented the propaganda version of the right--the leftist version. We really have had and do have a program in all the important areas of life, but they have not drawn the interest of the media, which have only played up the decommunization. It is true that these programs must be worked on. [POLITYKA] After its unification congress, the Freedom Union is often perceived as a right-wing party; clear anticommunist accents have appeared, along with signs of reconciliation with the church. Please tell us what really makes the Alliance for Poland's program different from that of the Freedom Union? [Kaczynski] I am glad that our positions, which at one time were roundly condemned, are now adopted by part of the Freedom Union. But let us be clear: I am only moderately convinced by those declarations. The Union is made up of people who have certain resumes, views, and sympathies. I do not really see Jacek Kuron, for example, as a liberal conservative, though that is how I would describe Bronislaw Komorowski, for example--or Bielecki. But many others have views that are liberal, socioliberal, or even libertine. I am talking here about values. Of course, if the Union moves right, that would be a positive process. Every move to the right is desirable because only the right can reform Poland. Nothing will change my conviction on this. [POLITYKA] Values are one thing, but what else divides the Union's "right" from yours? [Kaczynski] Essentially, attitude toward the present social and political order is most important. We have demanded and continued to demand the fundamental reconstruction of that structure, which must include the very painful humbling of some groups. [POLITYKA] How do you imagine this might happen, inasmuch as you said two years ago that it was already too late for many things? [Kaczynski] It is true; some things cannot be reversed. The huge sums stolen by the so-called nomenklatura corporations can not be recovered. That money has now gone through so many owners that it would be impossible to recreate the path it has taken. [POLITYKA] There would have to be another theft of that which, in your opinion, has already been stolen? [Kaczynski] I would use another term, perhaps: One would simply have to call into question in a radical way the certainty of law and of business transactions, and that is just not worth it. Not that I would have any moral objections to doing that, but, for certain reasons, it just is not worth the effort. There are, however, moves that can be easily made without threatening the system in any way--for example, changing the management of state banks. [POLITYKA] Can a one-time change of people restore the system's health? [Kaczynski] Yes, because until now the nomenklatura has been giving out money to its own people. [POLITYKA] You often offer three slogans as a shorthand for the program of the PC: Christian values, national traditions, and acceptance of the free market economy. I would think that millions of Poles would be prepared to declare themselves for such a program. Yet the PC has neither millions of members nor, what is worse, millions of voters. [Kaczynski] Those are higher goals and values and, thus, general; they must be achieved. But today immediate goals are also important. One must answer the question of who is to be in charge in our country, what the new class of owners should look like. This is the essence. We have taken up the struggle with the strongest. That we are right is shown by the fact that they are trying to destroy us. They have begun a fierce campaign. [POLITYKA] How many members does the Center Accord have today? [Kaczynski] Approximately 7,000. [POLITYKA] What, above all, must be done today in Poland? [Kaczynski] The foundations for a change in power must be created. One of these foundations is the unification of the right. I am not a fan of going out into the streets, of great strikes, and of other such revolutionary methods. [POLITYKA] Then what is your position on the latest wave of strikes in our country? [Kaczynski] I regard it as a justified reaction to this gigantic swindle that took place in Poland before the election. The promises of the left could be calculated at some 300 trillion zlotys, which of course excluded the fulfillment of such promises. Actually, it is good that they have not tried to fulfill them because that would mean the end of our economy. The political order we have today is bad not only because it is contrary to our values and views but also because it has a confrontational character. The enemy has reappeared, and that fosters revolutionary situations. Things were not always as they should have been over the previous four years, but there were never huge upheavals because that enemy was not there. It is true that there were shouts of "thief" during demonstrations every week in front of the Office of the Council of Ministers, but, despite everything, there was not a confrontation. However, for many people who still identify with Solidarity, the present government is unacceptable. The strikes that occurred recently would not have been possible at all during the so-called Solidarity governments. [POLITYKA] It seems as if a miners' strike is scheduled on our political calendar more or less twice a year. [Kaczynski] I am not suffering from loss of memory, and I remember those strikes, too. But please note that the present government went to unheard-of lengths to make concessions, and, despite this, the strike continues to smolder. I do not know that it can be easily extinguished because we have a new situation: a strike when communists are ruling, yet there are no repressions like in the old regime. There is no element of fear, but there is the element of political confrontation. This is a new quality, and the effects of this cannot clearly be seen. [POLITYKA] Do you see a locus for the united right in Solidarity? Will you be trying for the union's support? [Kaczynski] Using trade unions--and I'm thinking here of Solidarity--for directly political goals is the action of politicians who have lost their own political means. There is an error in thinking here because Solidarity is internally quite varied. What, after all, links Ewa Lewicka from the Mazowsze region, who is a supporter of the Union of Labor, to Slawomir Siwek, who has always declared himself a right Christian Democrat? [POLITYKA] So Solidarity does not interest the right as a partner? [Kaczynski] I repeat: We do not support the direct use of the union. Nonetheless, we count on rational thinking winning out in Solidarity and the union placing its support with those political forces that are really able to change Poland within the limits of economic reason. [POLITYKA] What scenario do you envision for the unified right? [Kaczynski] A deepening of internal integration and the building of a common program. And also political activity, which will be particularly evident this fall. [POLITYKA] Will the local government elections be a test for the new right, or don't you treat them that way? [Kaczynski] In a direct sense no, because we have entered various coalitions in different localities--including with the Freedom Union. We want to hold back the ruling coalition in order to lessen the dimensions of its victory. This will be difficult because the countryside is dominated, without exaggeration, by a PSL political monoculture. The structures of the United Peasant Party were not dissolved when the time was right, and now we have the result of this. [POLITYKA] In an interview for GAZETA WYBORCZA after the election, you spoke about the need to rethink, reevaluate attitudes toward the Alliance of the Democratic Left [SLD], which is an enduring element of the Polish political scene. There is no evidence of such rethinking and reevaluation in what you say. The rhetoric has changed, but the essence has remained the same. [Kaczynski] I have reevaluated. At first I assessed their political qualifications higher, and now I consider them to be close to zero. To win the election and have really almost no power--that is almost impossible to imagine. Walesa took some of the power, Pawlak took the rest, and Kwasniewski managed to believe in what the press wrote about some kind of super prime ministership. He completely forgot that institutional positions and not a series of awards or titles are important. The SLD is like officers who look good on the parade ground but do not count for much when it comes to a real battle. This, of course, creates the hope that the results of the last election will not be repeated. And, besides the tactical defeat, there are the policies they pursue, which I consider to be destructive. [POLITYKA] You said that they do not have power, so how could they conduct a destructive policy? [Kaczynski] Well, they are not overthrowing the government; they are not leaving the coalition. They thus give permission for that policy. This does not encourage one to see them as someone who might in the future be a lasting partner in a general political endeavor. [POLITYKA] You envision, therefore, an unending confrontation, along the lines of: In one election they do us in, and in the next we do them in. And once again we will reckon, decommunize, lustrate. This method of acting does not seem to enjoy much popularity in public opinion. [Kaczynski] If we were to win the election by ourselves, which does not seem to be in the cards, someone who was in the security apparatus could with certainty count on only the lowest pension. In addition, he would have to thank us because even more drastic methods would be considered just. But, because we live in soft times, those lowest pensions would have to do. As far as immediate public opinion is concerned... [POLITYKA] ...not only: the election verdict as well. [Kaczynski] Public opinion is changeable. I assure you that if, in 1989, the PRL [Polish People's Republic] was clearly separated from the new era and decommunization had been conducted with a series of trials, that opinion would be radically different. [POLITYKA] Thank you.
