For example, we have been troubled by separatist and terrorist activities over the past 10 years. Had the state been aware of the realities and allowed the professionals to continue the struggle against terrorism, the problem would have been resolved a long time ago, before it assumed dangerous proportions. The continuation of terrorist activities has not only harmed the people's unity but also wasted many resources, which could have been used for development. Meanwhile, several foreign countries, in an effort to impose their policies on Ankara, have used the separatist and terrorist activities against Turkey. The photograph that was published in SABAH on page one yesterday clearly indicates the way the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] has been used to implement the ugly designs of foreign forces against Turkey. The photograph depicted PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan standing beside an Armenian priest, as if waiting for instructions and funds! It is common knowledge that many of the Armenian people are hostile to Turkey, so much so that they would not mind upsetting their life. However, what can be said about Greece? Terrorism is a very serious crime against humanity. A country may find itself isolated for supporting terrorist activities in the world. In fact, the countries that have been isolated in the Middle East are not few. The suspicion Greece has aroused on the matter may place that country in a more degrading and despicable situation than that of Libya and Syria. Obviously, several of Turkey's neighbors are supporting the PKK in order to impose their policies on Ankara. However, Greece is using that organization to promote its trade and increase its revenues in the tourism domain. Tourists left Turkey and made reservations in the Greek islands after bombs exploded in Antalya in 1993. We wrote in this column at the time that the state should abandon its timid approach and take daring steps to deal with the matter. We urged the state to properly assess the evidence and act accordingly. However, that has not been done. Bombs exploded in the middle of the tourism season in 1993. Explosions took place even before the tourism season began in 1994. Former President Kenan Evren has not hesitated to blame Greece. No one in his position would dare blame any country on mere suspicion and without official information. Turkey must persuade its neighbors not to use the PKK as a means to promote their interests. The silence that has been maintained has increased the number of countries which use the PKK as an instrument against Turkey. Using acts of terrorism against a neighboring country is shameful. However, it is even more shameful to condone such a behavior in order to "avoid creasing problems."
