Currently, the Communist Party of Crimea [KPK] has some 48,000 members. Leonid Grach received more than 13 percent of the vote and ranked third in the presidential elections. In the Supreme Soviet elections, communists were supported by fewer voters -- they won only two out of 14 seats -- because voters, in general, voted for "Russia's Bloc." The development of events in the Crimea finally upset the KPK, and Grach voiced concern over this very fact after the news conference. We have learned about Meshkov's plans to reform the executive bodies -- to liquidate executive commissions within the local soviets and nominate interim heads of administrations. Grach believes that this "destruction of some old bodies will at least bring about some order in the state." Communists voice doubts over the moves of the new government (half of this government consists of Moscow residents). In the opinion of Leonid Grach, "they are failures in science and, to a greater extent, failures in practice." The management is experiencing a vertical split, the government is going to manage the state through duty-shifts [vakhtovyy metod]. The KPK cannot, in Grach's opinion, remain aloof when "the Crimea is undergoing humiliating experiments." Moreover, management "has not only been left without a local staff, but the basis for an open `witch-hunt' has been prepared." The depth and tragedy of this precipice, into which Crimea is headed, are both deepening, according to Grach, due to the government's inefficiency, the president's lack of competence, and a generally low level of education (in the sphere of legal knowledge within the state). Those, who learned the classic adage -- divide and conquer -- take advantage of this situation. "I state with full responsibility that if a shot is fired in the Crimea, it will not be the result of political or interethnic tensions. Residents of the Crimea should understand: They will be armed to fight for ownership," said Grach. Having rebuked Yevgeniy Saburov for the "anticommunist yearning after the Moscow model," Grach voiced surprise over the government's immense expenditures on their own needs, and said that their holiday hotel "More" -- their headquarters in Alushta -- was built as an imitation of the Zavidovo Hotel in Moscow. Leonid Grach is convinced that, despite the utmost discord between Kravchuk and Meshkov and lack of direct contacts between Yeltsin and Meshkov, they are objectively assisting one another. Kravchuk believes that the worse the situation in the Crimea is, the better for him, while Russia simply behaves like an owner in the Crimea. As to the question of why Russia behaves like an owner in the Crimea, Grach answers without thinking: "Shokhin's Russia." The KPK leader also confirmed that communists, who during the elections had supported Meshkov with some reservations, currently represent an opposition because "they cannot sacrifice anything -- except rallies, tents, and rejected resolutions -- to the fatherland." Reiterating that the Crimea will not overcome the economic crisis alone and the union of fraternal republics should be restored on a new basis, Leonid Grach said that the KPK considers Leonid Kuchma the most proper candidate for Ukrainian president.
