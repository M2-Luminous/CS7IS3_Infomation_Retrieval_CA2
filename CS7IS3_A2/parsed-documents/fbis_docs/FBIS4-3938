Officials of the Beijing Urban and Rural Construction Committee said that the industry had a turnover of 7.5 billion yuan and exports worth 31.33 million U.S. dollars in 1993. A large part of the value was created in modern building materials, such as cement, new wall material, sound-proof, fire- proof and water-proof materials, porcelain ware, decoration materials and hardware, rather than in bricks, sand and other traditional products, the officials said. According to the officials, energy-saving and other high-tech new building materials will be the direction for future development.
