In this connection, he singled out four main factors of the future activities of the Cabinet. First, organizational. "It is not enough when the government gets corresponding authorities from the parliament. It should be efficient, functional, take decisions in time, suggesting draft laws, necessary mechanisms and implementing them," the president said. Second, time factor. In Snegur's opinion, the reorganization of ministries and departmeent should be carried out quicklu and with a considerable reduction of their personnel. The president said that in the past four years the share of state clerks in the total number of employed grew four times, state budget spendings for maintainance of the personnel rose from 0.8 percent in 1989 to 3.2 percent in 1993, and their salaries exceeded the average ones in the republic twice. In the opinion of the president, this tendency is characteristic for the controlling bodies. Snegur spoke in favor of their reduction, pertinent to the need for the merger of the state control bodies and the existing controlling bodies attached to ministries and departments. The president named the third priority: the preparation by the government of its program for the next two-three years. In his opinion, this program can be worked out by 1 July. The president thinks that it should envisage acceleration of restructuring and moderniation of the national economy, activization of privatization and social support for the population. The president said the fourth priority is the personnel issue. In his opinion, now "exact selection and professional training of top executives" are important. The government decided at its first meeting to recommend the parliament in the near future to ratify the signed agreements on Moldova's entry in the CIS and the Economic Union. At the moment of the Presidential Bulletin's publishing, it was announced that the parliament ratified on Friday the agreement on the creation of the CIS with amendments proceeding from the republic's legislation, as well as the treaty on the creation of the economic union. The changes concern in particular the non-alignment of the republic to military agreements, and non-participation in setting up unified armed forced and the ruble zone.
