I believe the answer to this question will be the linchpin of political action in the near future, and for years to come. In order for the answer to the question to be efficacious, I believe AKHBAR AL-YAWM, in cooperation with a research organization, should hold a conference in which Egypt's scientists and political and intellectual leaders take part in adopting a "strategic Egyptian plan" for facing the coming challenge. The plan would include a method for managing the "coming peace struggle" primarily in Egyptian, and, secondarily, in Arab terms. Every party to the conflict has its own vision of the post-peace phase. Israel: Israel sees, in this peace, the second phase of Israel's evolution. The first phase was the establishment of the state itself; it was established, and expanded gradually, to enter into the phase of hegemony over the region. This was proclaimed by Ben-Gurion in the 1950s, to be a regulation for all the Israeli leaders who came after him, doves and hawks alike. Ben-Gurion said, "Peace is essential for Jewish genius to gain control over Arab money and Arab labor, in order for this genius to put both (money and labor) to the best use." Israel began early to initiate studies, research, and projects preparatory to the peace phase. Israeli espionage agencies and research institutions specialized in studying and gathering information about Arab capabilities in all areas. I may mention one interesting incident that occurred at the book fair. Specialized national councils exhibited volumes containing Egyptian scientists' views on internal Egyptian affairs, on housing, agriculture, Nile water, and livestock, in addition to issues of extremism and deviance. The Embassy of Israel alone bought more than one copy of each volume, to make use of them in post-peace planning. Israel keeps silent about "cooperation in the context of peace," as well as about its maneuvers in international finance organizations. Despite that, some studies on the Israeli concept of peace have emerged from the realm of secrecy. There was--one of countless examples--the outcome of an economic conference held at the University of Tel Aviv entitled "Economic Cooperation in the Middle East, From a Dream to Reality." Hayyim Ben-Shahar urged this and included it in a book published in London in 1989, called Economic Cooperation in the Middle East. In the view of that conference: Israel suffers from a water shortage, and the water surpluses of the Nile River, the Litani River in Lebanon, and al-Yarmuk River [in Jordan] are being lost to evaporation. The conference view was of Israel's "need" to benefit from these waters. The conference proposed the extension of the Tapline to Haifa; this junction would be 40 percent cheaper than traversing the Suez Canal. They speak of developing Arab-on-Arab wars, and linking them to the Israeli arms trade. Israel has submitted several Middle East development projects to the World Bank, on condition that they involve more than one country in the region, with Jewish "genius" being the key point of each. The projects included water transport, electricity transport, the establishment of ports, the extension of railroads, and a network of roads linking Israel and the Arab states. Israel's problem is that the pivotal Israel philosophy in regional cooperation is hegemony. The Oil Arabs: After Saddam's invasion of Kuwait and the fact that some Arab countries supported the invasion, and the PLO's support for that cruel attack, there was a radical change, and a 180 degree turn in the minds of the "oil Arabs." They renounced Arabism; they renounced the Palestinian cause; they imagined that Israel was closer to them and easier to take than their "treacherous Arab neighbor." Israel, they imagined, was a powerful country, capable of offering them help and protection against the perfidiousness of friends and brothers. With the encouragement of the United States, they secretly rushed to Israel to sign trade deals and get their sick treated in Israeli hospitals. The Israeli press has even begun to call Hadassah Hospital the Rich Arab Patients Hospital. Israel has respected the Arabs' wish for secrey in their visits and cooperation. Then there was the Gaza-Jericho agreement, dispensing even with the fig leaf, with the beginning of a phase of openness and pride in the agreement and visits to Israel. We began to read, in Gulf newspapers, about the need to nullify the Arab boycott of Israel at all its levels. Trade with Israel has begun in many Gulf countries, and all this has begun even before a comprehensive peace or the return of the occupied Arab land. The thing that defies human understanding is that one "revolutionary" Arab country, rejects the Gaza-Jericho agreement and Camp David and all forms of negotiations with the Israeli "enemy." This country got Israel to produce water pipes for one of its huge water projects, and oil pipelines too; Israeli factories are working night and day to meet that country's needs. The Palestinians: I was utterly surprised at the Palestinians' ebullient feelings about 'Arafat's outstretched hand and Rabin's hesitant one at the White House festivities for the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. Then the Palestinians began a free-for-all to announce Palestinian-Israeli cooperation to the Israeli media. "Combatant" Palestinian leaders thrust themselves in front of Israeli television cameras to talk about "the friendly Israeli people." I felt that the Palestinians and the Israelis were speaking one language in which I was not fluent--which I did not even understand; that they were on the same side, against the Egyptian concept of peace. Our peace, in the opinion of Prof. Ibrahim Sa'dah, is a cold peace, while the Israelis and Palestinians have a torrid peace! As if what has happened over the last half century was a mere tempest in a teacup; as if we had just been meddling in someone else's business all that time. I was even more surprised when I heard one of the leaders of the Palestinian "struggle" use an expression that nauseated me, saying that "Israel is an honorable enemy; the Arabs are treacherous friends." The Syrians: Some of them believe the Syrian presence in Lebanon is far more important and beneficial than the Syrian presence on the Golan, because the Golan--as one of them put it--is a desolate area, whereas Lebanon is Syria's true outlet to the Mediterranean Sea; thus any peace accord requiring the Syrians to stay out of Lebanon would be unacceptable, even if it liberated the Golan. This is a brief look at Israel's dreams, and of the Arab political circus, which gives special importance to writer Ibrahim Sa'dah's big question: What will be Egypt's position if Israel realizes its dreams of a new "warm" peace with all the Arabs, as distinct from the "cold" peace with Egypt? Yes, Egypt. Egypt today is demanding a correction in the Arabs' course, their attention to detail, and some understanding on the part of those who are rushing blindly toward Israel. Only Egypt will stand by the Arabs; only Egypt will stand against Israeli hegemony in the region; only Egypt will turn hegemony into cooperation between partners. Hence my proposal at the beginning of this article, about the need for the questioner to hold a scientific conference in which we would call upon Egyptian genius to set us an Egyptian strategy for managing the coming peace struggle. Yes, through that conference we would get a plan for rebuilding this region on new bases, or, in other words, a "strategy for thwarting Israel's plan for hegemony," especially as Egypt has intellectual, human, geographical, and material resources greater than Israel's, and these scattered resources must be gathered into a single order so that we need not fear cooperation with Israel. This proposal could be submitted to the Arab nation at an Arab summit, as Prof. Ibrahim Sa'dah asked. We would commit ourselves to it and then, subsequently, enter into regional cooperation with Israel--after it has withdrawn from the occupied territories. I give warning that without a plan, and Arab solidarity with it, and commitment to it, then Israeli dominance is on the way--no doubt about it.
