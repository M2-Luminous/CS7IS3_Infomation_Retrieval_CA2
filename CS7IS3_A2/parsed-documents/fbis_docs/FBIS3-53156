Informed sources told AL-HAYAH that al-Bishari and the Omani official discussed developments in the Lockerbie crisis between Libya and Western countries, the current Arab situation, and bilateral relations. The sources noted that the Libyan visits and messages to Muscat, which ceased about one year ago, had recently resumed despite the limited relations between the two countries since the Lockerbie crisis and Libya's quest for the mediation of moderate Arab contries such as Oman, the Gulf states, and Egypt, to avoid an unequal confrontation with Western countries and reach a political solution to the crisis. Although Oman has avoided commenting on the crisis itself, it has expressed, in a cautious and indirect manner, its reservations about the sanctions imposed on the "Libyan people." Mr. Yusuf Bin-'Alawi told AL-HAYAH, when the international sanctions were first imposed on Libya, that it was the Libyan people who would suffer from the boycott. However, according to diplomatic sources in Muscat, Oman is not expected to play an active role in mediation efforts between Libyan and the West, not only because it may see a "realistic" chance for solving the Lockerbie crisis only through acceptance and implementation of the UN resolutions, but also because bilateral relations with Libya remain limited, and were until recently impaired by a certain distrust due to differing political stances during the 1970's and 1980's. These sources believe that the Libyan envoy, who was once foreign minister, may have sought to move bilateral relations towards the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Libya is currently the only Arab country with which Muscat does not have diplomatic relations. Among the things the Omanis may be interested in knowing is how far Libya would go in opposing the Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. The Sultanate enthusiastically supports the agreement and has sought to support it both in the Gulf region and the Arab world, after Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Muscat directly after the agreement was reached. Diplomatic sources say that the message that Libya has received from other Arab parties--that actual opposition engaged in by the Libyan Government to obstruct the Palestinian-Israeli agreement "could be an additional factor complicating chances to solve the Lockerbie crisis politically, and exposing Libya to new difficulties"--might be the same thing al-Bishari is hearing in his meetings with Omani officials during his visit, which ends today. Unlike many subjects, Libya's and Oman's views on the current state of Arab relations are close. They both affirm the need for starting a new chapter in these relations and getting out of the rut of the Gulf crisis, including opening the door to Iraq's return, as long as it obeys the UN resolutions.
