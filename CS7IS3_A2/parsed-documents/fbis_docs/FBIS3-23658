These and other questions were touched on in the discussion of the editor-in-chief of the journal VESTNIK PVO, Colonel Mikhail Zakharchuk, with PVO Troops Main Staff Chief Colonel-General Viktor Sinitsyn. [M. Zakharchuk] Viktor Pavlovich, the problems that we will touch on today are not new ones for our Air-Defense Troops. The incorporation of electronic gear, automated systems and means of command and control into combat and training processes has been underway for years now, if not decades. I will nonetheless be so bold as to assert that they have taken on particular urgency lately, literally during the period of emergence of the army of Russia. [V.P. Sinitsyn] That is indeed so. Recent events in the country and the armed forces, in which you and I are living participants, have become so dynamic that we will not be able to handle them, to master them, based only on our past experience. We need a qualitatively new augmentation of our knowledge and skills. Whence the necessity of increasing the role of intellectual support for the work of the staff, on which I, by the way, would like to place the principal focus of our discussion. [M. Zakharchuk] I understand that your terminology is clear to specialists. But they are not the only ones who read your journal. So let us first orient ourselves with respect to definitions, at least those that are advanced during our conversation. [V.P. Sinitsyn] I have no objection. And I will start with the fact, for example, that the term "intellectual support for staff operations" is currently becoming more and more widespread, as is the modern interpretation of the existing concept of "automating staff processes based on the use of computer technology (EVT)." This is evidently conditioned by the fact that the processes into which computer gear is being incorporated are of an intellectual nature as a whole, since they permit a quantitative evaluation of logically substantiated variations of enemy actions, alternative variations for the operations of one's own troops and a determination of the optimal ones, and the receipt of unexpected results according to the results of multivariable modeling. The phrase "intellectual support" signifies that the main role in the process of making (or clarifying) decisions remains with the person, while the information and computational systems (IRS) -- the intellectual basis of which are mathematical models (MM) and information and computational tasks (IZ and RZ)--are just a tool for staff officers. As for the heuristic activity of officers in the process of operational and combat training, here we have in mind the aggregate of logical techniques and methodological rules for theoretical research and seeking out the truth or the simplest method of training that facilitates resourcefulness and activeness in the person. The term, in other words, is not imbued with any outside connotation. [M. Zakharchuk] So let us please return to where we started -- raising the role of intellectual support for staff operations. [V.P. Sinitsyn] It is conditioned by the sharp increase in the number of uncertainties that most be dealt with in order to make the necessary decisions, the acute lack of time assigned to substantiating the plans for combat operations, and the optimal variations for the combat application of various types of manpower and equipment. The experience of wars and conflicts of recent years testifies convincingly that modern combat operations are characterized by great rapidity, intensity and dynamism, and consequently an acute shortage of time to make or clarify decisions. The process of decision-making is becoming more and more difficult, crucial and collective under those conditions. More crucial because losses, both human and of material resources, could prove to be catastrophic and lead to the complete loss of the fighting ability of troops in the face of the increased firepower of modern weapons systems and equipment, as occurred in the Persian Gulf. More collective because under conditions of an acute shortage of time, commanding officers at all levels encounter a host of uncertainties that it is becoming impossible for one person to deal with, even with a high level of professional training and intellectual potentialities, without the aid of professional experts and advisors, a large portion of whom are concentrated on the staffs. It must be understood in this regard, when speaking of decision-making, that it (the decision) is a result of the activity of a system created for that purpose, in which some evaluate the alternative variations of the actions of the opposing sides (the staffs), while others (the commanding officers at all levels), agreeing with a proposed variation and approving it, assume responsibility for the consequences of decision-making, relying on collective reason. More difficult because the scarcity of time allotted for obtaining, processing, analyzing and evaluating an enormous quantity of information, on the one hand, and the enormous responsibility -- which in some cases becomes nationwide or universal in nature -- on the other, condition the necessity of the mandatory performance of multivariable modeling of the confrontation of SVN [offensive air weapons] and PVO, with the aim of increasing reliability and reducing erroneous decisions to a minimum. It is also more difficult because staff officers, in a collective search for the optimal solution to a specific task (heuristic activity), run up against a shortage of initial information and a host of uncertainties. A scarcity of information and a number of uncertainties exist, in particular, at the stage of evaluating the enemy, making it more difficult to deal with the possible intent of his actions (targets, amount and sequence of missions being carried out, sectors of the main and other thrusts, composition of forces and equipment employed, and determination of the force of the strike by sectors, as well as in the accomplishment of specific tasks -- the operational disposition of forces in echelon or a massed strike, the expected duration of SVN operations and the like). At the same time, without having determined with a certain degree of reliability the intentions of enemy actions, it is impossible to evaluate the potential capabilities of the existing PVO system (subsystems for reconnaissance, command and control, fighter, aircraft and surface-to-air missile cover, and all types of operational, rear and technical support). The presence of uncertainties in evaluating the enemy obviously engenders uncertainty in the evaluation of one's own troops and the choice of variations for combat operations, and ultimately has an effect on the reliability and objectivity (quality) of the decisions being made (or clarified). [M. Zakharchuk] The conclusion could be drawn from what you have said that an objective necessity has appeared on the agenda today of having a unified system of mathematical models and computational tasks, allowing officers not only to deal with the uncertainties you have mentioned in a short period of time, but also to suggest to them the optimal variations of solutions for combat operations, for the restoration of a destroyed PVO system, and for the resolution of other issues that arise in the dynamic combat environment. But how should a system of mathematical models (MM) and computational tasks (RZ) look? Or rather, to what requirements must they conform? [V.P. Sinitsyn] The functional essence of the system can be summarized according to the following parameters, without going into the details of it. First, optimized models and computational tasks "suggesting" the best variation for a solution out of some quantity of possible ones should constitute the foundation of the system. A large portion of the existing MMs and RZs do not conform to this requirement, since they are in essence informational-computational. Second, the MMs and RZs in the system should reflect more accurately the physical sense and specific nature of the confrontation of PVO Troops with the forces of an airborne attack. One shortcoming of the existing MMs and RZs is the fact that unilateral combat operations, in which the enemy is relegated to the role of an abstractly standardized target, is inherent in them. The specific nature of the confrontation of PVO Troops with the forces of an airborne attack assigned to suppress them is not reflected in the models. The actions of echelons and groups for PVO suppression are not modeled as a consequence of this, and the outcome of the confrontation is not always taken into account in the evaluation. Third, the results of a decision issued for display should reflect the situation in dynamic mode, the position of the opposing sides in space, in real time, using three-dimensional graphics. Most of the existing MMs and RZs do not meet this requirement, since they issue for display the results of decisions in the form of tables, graphs and contour lines. Thus, the scientists of the PVO Troops, in order to meet the needs of practice, must develop a system of mathematical models and computational tasks using a uniform methodological foundation; possessing hierarchical coordinability and systems-engineering coordinability of the indicators and criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of combat operations, allowing staff officers to uncover the possible intentions of an airborne enemy, evaluate his potential capabilities, predict the outcome of a confrontation of the sides, optimize variations for the actions of the enemy and his troops and depict the three-dimensional position of the opposing sides in dynamic fashion. [M. Zakharchuk] The requirements for the level of training of staff officers are growing. No one today doubts the necessity of improving the methods of instilling skills in modeling a confrontation of SVN and PVO, analyzing the results and preparing proposals substantiated by computations. But what about this question -- how will all this be achieved? The more so as the forms and methods of training today contradict the requirements of progress in the military arts. [V.P. Sinitsyn] That same scientific and technical progress, on the other hand, gives us the opportunity to increase the efficiency of staff officer training through the incorporation into operational and combat training of computer games and automated systems for modeling the combat situation. The tasks of gaming combat operations must be resolved with the use of modern computer hardware united into local networks. This will make it possible to perform an evaluation of the conceptual framework of the operational application of PVO formations according to the results of multivariable modeling, and to determine the optimal variations for the combat application of PVO formations and large units of the PVO Troops and special troops, as well as to obtain objective evaluations of the level of professional training of the officers of directorates and staffs at all levels. [M. Zakharchuk] How do matters stand in this regard with the use of automated systems for modeling the combat situation in the United States and the other NATO countries? [V.P. Sinitsyn] You can have no doubt that they are proceeding apace with scientific and technical progress there. A center for modeling the combat environment, for example, has been created at the Ramstein Air Base (Germany). A practical verification of the capabilities of the center was performed during the comprehensive Ex-91 and Cactus Juggler-92 command and staff exercises, as well as the Caravanguard-91 and Reforger-92 exercises. The spending for the actual performance of exercises on the scale of Cactus Juggler-92, in the estimation of the NATO combined forces command in Europe, would be 100-150 million dollars, while the cost of the computer version did not exceed one million dollars. The partial utilization of the combat-environment modeling center during the Reforger-92 exercises made it possible to reduce the cost of conducting them by 25-30 percent compared to prior years. Need one be persuaded that the adoption of computer games into the process of training, under conditions of cutbacks in appropriations for the maintenance of the armed forces, including spending on military training, is a promising direction for improving the operational and combat training of the PVO Troops? This direction is also a promising one because it makes possible, along with a reduction in spending, a rise in the quality of training via the repeated processing of different variations for the start and waging of combat operations. [M. Zakharchuk] I was telling you something at the beginning of our discussion, Viktor Pavlovich, that you undoubtedly know perfectly well yourself -- questions of the automation of combat training have long been under study in the armed forces. The development of MMs and RZs, in particular, have been underway in the interests of the staffs for more than 25 years now. An extensive store -- or better yet, a base of MMs and RZs -- has been created over that time. You will agree, however, that the effectiveness of their application for the preparation of operational-tactical computations and the study of the processes of operations (combat operations) remains low as before. What is going on here? [V.P. Sinitsyn] There is a host of reasons here. One of the main ones consists of the absence of uniform methodological, operational-tactical, informational and mathematical foundations for the structuring and application of models. Various models for one and the same purpose thus meet varying requirements, and various approaches were applied to their development. These have not been included, and cannot be combined into a unified system of software support for the command and control of troops without the corresponding refinement and development. The available models, as a rule, do not take into account all of the principal factors that have an effect on the course and outcome of operations (combat operations). There are still too few efficient models that would provide for the issue of the necessary data in real time for staff activity, answer the main questions in the preparation of operations (combat operations) and be of practical assistance to the commanding officers or commanders and staffs in devising solutions and planning operations of higher quality and in more operative fashion. This situation makes urgently necessary the devising of uniform requirements for staff models. The work that has been started at the PVO Military Academy imeni G.K. Zhukov for the creation of imitative models of bilateral combat operations for units in the branches of our forces and the comprehensive modeling of combat operations by large PVO units and formations is deserving of attention in this regard. The initiatives of scholars at the academy to create simulation and imitative systems are also deserving of attention and support; dynamic models of the confrontation of SVN and PVO are inherent in those systems, making it possible to reveal uncertainties in the actions of the enemy, predict the outcome of the confrontation, optimize the variations of the actions of the enemy and his troops and depict the results of the computations in dynamic form, and the actions of the sides in space and time using a three-dimensional graph. I am convinced of the expediency of continuing the work to create mathematical models, computational tasks, and dynamic scenarios of the confrontation of SVN and PVO, with their subsequent incorporation into the practice of operational and combat training. This would make it possible to increase markedly the effectiveness of training for staff officers at all levels, through the more detailed study of various aspects of logical-analysis and logical-synthesis activity. [M. Zakharchuk] So if the task of providing a uniform methodological approach in the creation of the foundations for the computerization of the training and combat processes (and there should be no doubt of this) faces us once again, what requirements should those foundations meet? [V.P. Sinitsyn] I will list the principal ones as a start. They are a uniformity of the operational-tactical fundamentals for structuring it; the trustworthiness of the results of modeling; operativeness in the receipt of results; conformity to the level of command; a systemic approach; standardization of the indicators and standards used; and, uniformity of the information base. The requirement for uniformity of the operational-tactical fundamentals of structuring the models envisages the necessity of the complete realization of the basic principles of the military arts, and first and foremost those such as a determined concentration of efforts in the most important areas, the uninterrupted nature of combat operations, the comprehensive and coordinated application of all manpower and resources, and uninterrupted command and control, support and combat operations. This requirement, moreover, assumes the observance of a uniform substance of the specific operation (combat operations) and structure of the conceptual model, and a formalized description of the processes using the corresponding mathematical methods. The trustworthiness of the results of modeling is understood to mean a sufficiently precise reflection of the most material aspects of the processes being modeled and the general laws characteristic of them. Trustworthiness of the results can be achieved not only through the modeling of the most substantial aspects of the operation or combat operations, but also through a correct regard for the connections between them and a suitable regard for the various factors, conditions of the situation and methods of combat and supporting operations. The PVO formations, in my opinion, should take into account the following basic factors and conditions of the situation in order to fulfill the requirement of the trustworthiness of the results in the model of an operation or combat operations. Regarding the enemy: - the composition, basing, TTKh [tactical-performance characteristics] and operating methods of enemy SVKN [air and space offensive weaponry]; - the combat readiness of SVKN; - the employment of conventional and nuclear weapons, cruise missiles launched from various platforms, long-range radar-detection and reconnaissance-strike aircraft systems; - the fire and electronic suppression of PVO Troops and assets; - the maneuvering capabilities of SVN; - the capabilities of command-and-control and navigational systems; - the capabilities for repeat operations by SVN; - enemy losses in the course of repelling his strikes and capabilities for reinforcing forces in various sectors; - and, the level of enemy knowledge on the PVO system. Regarding one's own forces: - composition, stationing, TTKh and operational methods; - the combat readiness of units and large formations; - the employment of conventional weaponry and missiles with special charges; - the fire and electronic suppression of the enemy; - the maneuvering capabilities of PVO Troops and assets; - the capabilities of reconnaissance, command-and-control, guidance and support systems; - the capabilities for repeat operations by PVO Troops and assets; - interaction; - the stability of elements of the PVO system; - troop losses; - restoration of the fighting ability of units and large formations; - the availability of false positions and forces; - and the utilization of reserves. Regarding targets, conditions and the area of combat operations: - targets in the defense and their characteristics; - the state of the airfield network; - the radar environment; - the electronic environment; - and the specific military-geographical features of the area of combat operations. Operativeness is understood to mean the possibility of obtaining and making practical use of the results for the necessary quantity of variations of modeling in the rhythm of staff work. Evaluations of operativeness must take into account the total time expended for the preparation of data, the entry of that data into the computers, the machine computations and issue of results to the display devices or documentation, and for the operational-tactical analysis of the results obtained. Conformity to the level of command is understood to mean the use, in a model, of information with a level of detail and precision that is characteristic of this level of command and control, and the depiction of the results of modeling in a visual form that corresponds to the form and content of the documents that are developed by the staff at the given level. The requirement for conformity to the level of command conditions the necessity, on the one hand, of maintaining an equal degree of detail for each partial process, and on the other of aggregating the indicators used to the extent of ascension from the tactical to the strategic scale. Higher-level models should thus make use of data obtained in models from lower levels, in the form of summarized indicators and standards. The horizontal links between models at lower levels should be taken into account therein. Important to ensure meeting the requirement for the model to conform to the level of command is the selection of the primary object (element) of the modeling. This question remains unresolved up to the present. As a result, the individual PVO asset is taken as the primary object in certain models, for example, the subunit in others, and the unit or larger formation etc. in still others, even though the model was developed for one and the same level of command and control. The selection of the primary object of modeling should be made according to the following criteria: First, the object should be the foundation of the structural entity for a given level of command and control, through which the composition of the field formation of the given level is defined. The force composition of a fighter air regiment [IAP], for example, is typified by the quantity of fighters, and a surface-to-air missile brigade [ZRBR] or regiment by the quantity of systems. The primary object of modeling for the former is consequently the fighter, and for the latter the system. The composition of the PVO formation, as a rule, is determined by the quantity of units and formations of the branches of service, and the unit or formation could consequently be considered the primary object for a model of the operation. Second, the object should have a significant influence on the results of the modeling. The results of the battle of an individual system and fighter, for example, will be significant for the ZRBR and IAP and insignificant for the large PVO formation. The battalion and fighter are thus primary for a model of battle, and the IAP and ZRBR for a model of the operation. Third, the elements of the object should be located on the terrain in compact fashion. The IAP or ZRBR, say, could be considered the primary object for the model of an operation, since the elements of that object are located on the terrain in relatively compact fashion, while the large formation or EW unit could not be considered a primary object for the same model, since it does not possess the trait of compactness, not to mention the fact that the capabilities of individual EW subunits, especially forward ones, could prove to have a substantial influence on the results of modeling the operation. The requirement for a systemic approach signifies that the model should be a constituent element of a unified system of software support for the command and control of troops that is coordinated with others by aim, purpose, operational allocation, composition of factors taken into account, limitations and allowances, indicators and standards, system of classifying and coding data, principles for the protection of information, etc. Any RZ or model, in accordance with this requirement, should be developed as a constituent element of the whole and be characterized by a functional completeness, and have the possibility of realization both autonomously and as part of a definite system. The requirement for the standardization of indicators and standards consists of performing calculations and modeling of combat operations using indicators and standards that are coordinated among each other. The uniformity of the information base assumes the use of databases in the machine as the object of collective and multipurpose use, and assurance of the uniformity of one and the same data for various models and computational tasks. [M. Zakharchuk] There are probably other special technical requirements that support the reliable operational and thematic substance of the mathematical models and computational tasks. Could we dwell on those you listed? It will be no less important, in my opinion, to clarify what properties a unified system of software support for the command and control of troops (SMOUV) should possess. [V.P. Sinitsyn] First, the software support should reflect the actual physical and information processes. If the staffs are fed a flow of data being processed by computer, then the officers preparing the proposals and making the decision must combine the creative principle with the results of modeling and computations. The SMOUV must consequently have an immediate influence on command and control. Second, the software support (models, RZs etc.) is, as it were, the collective reasoning of people put into material form, and should naturally provide intellectual support for the work of staffs and other command elements. Third, the SMOUV is inseparably linked with the theory of command, since its structure and content depend on the structure and content of the processes of command and control of the troops. A direct and reciprocal link thus exists between the theory of command and the SMOUV. The use of the SMOUV thus stimulates the development of command theory, and the theory the development of the SMOUV. The SMOUV acts as a uniting link between the theory and practice of command. Thus, there is the conclusion that the SMOUV is becoming an organic constituent element of command and control, and should have a substantial influence on the substance and methods of staff work. The properties cited provide grounds to consider it expedient to recognize software support for command and control as a new category of the military arts, and the operational arts in particular. This recognition provides a correct orientation for theory, will make possible a more complete regard for the requirements of practice and will lead to more energetic efforts not only by the commanding officers and staffs, but also military scholars on questions of improving command and control of the troops at a qualitatively new level. [M. Zakharchuk] In concluding our discussion I would ask you, Viktor Pavlovich, to provide at least a general outline of promising directions in the development and improvement of systems of software support for the troops. [V.P. Sinitsyn] These would be, first and foremost, the development of the methodological, operational-tactical, mathematical and information foundations for constructing and employing software support within the framework of a unified system. The creation of scientific-methodological means and a methodology of constructing the system and its elements, along with the evaluation of the suitability of the models and the effectiveness of their application, is an important area of this work. General organizational-methodological foundations for the development and incorporation of models and RZs are needed. The creation of fundamentally newer and more suitable models is a topical task. The problem of the optimal nature of the decisions made is a central one in the command and control of troops, and is directly linked with the quality of the models and the computational tasks. The adoption of a model for use is of an evaluative nature today. The use of such models predetermines the necessity of ascertaining several variations of the actions of the sides, with a quantitative evaluation of each of them according to an accepted criterion. The method of running through variations reduces the operativeness of command and control, and forces a limitation on the number of variations. The selection of the best from among variations being considered does not give full confidence that it is the optimal one, or meets the conditions of the situation to the full extent. The creation of optimized models that make it possible to devise the most acceptable variation for troop operations under the set conditions of a situation is thus an important task. The development of techniques for the application of models and computational tasks, the operational-tactical analysis of the results obtained and the devising of new methods of staff work with the use of software support should be considered a no less important area. In connection with the fact that the use of formalized methods in the practical activity of commanding officers and staffs to resolve many intellectual tasks is difficult, the creation of expert systems is an exceedingly important and, at the same time, extraordinarily complex task. Particular attention should be devoted to researching the problem of constructing expert systems. It would be expedient to perform special, comprehensive scientific-research work, with the aim of gradually creating such systems. Only the availability and application of expert systems will provide effective intellectual support for the work of staffs and other command and control elements. [M. Zakharchuk] Thank you for the discussion. COPYRIGHT: "Vestnik PVO" 1993.
