The Constitution's provisions on the parliament and presidency was passed by 266 legislative votes, exceeding the required 233 votes, which is two-thirds of the Supreme Soviet. As members of the Counting Commission reported at the press conference, election of the first Belarusian president should be expected not later than 26 June this year. Curiously, several days before the voting, the Belarusian Popular Movement [BND] leadership, which has repeatedly said that it could block any issue, came out against the presidency. Why did they vote for it then? Observers say that there could be three reasons for this. First, the NDB altered its position in the last minute. Second, it has been concealing its true position until now. Third, the movement's members have failed to obey decisions made by its leadership. Incidentally, a leader of an organization that is part of the NDB denounced the voting by NDB members, especially its communist faction, as insubordination to the leadership, and suggested applying party disciplinary measures. Immediately after the vote, our correspondent met with three people's deputies and asked them to answer several questions connected with the introduction of a new power institution in the Republic. [RESPUBLIKA] Can one be absolutely positive that Belarus will have its president? [Dmitriy Bulakhov] We have passed the most difficult stage in introducing the presidency in the Republic. This does not mean, however, that it is a foregone conclusion. Ahead lies the adoption of the constitution as a whole, and debates over transition provisions on its activation, which are very complex issues. [RESPUBLIKA] Are you for the presidency? [Bulakhov] Absolutely. [RESPUBLIKA] How would you explain your position? [Bulakhov] Weakness of the power results in the power of violence -- uncontrolled and executed not according to laws and the Constitution, but according to muscle. This means a language of ultimatum and pressure on any procedure. So, it is better to have stronger power. This can only be possible when two conditions are met: legitimacy supported by a popular vote in general elections, and the lawfulness stemming from laws and the Constitution. As a matter of fact, the presidency is not a new thing for us. Except for the past three years, it has always been present in Belarus. We had our presidents in the face of first secretaries of the CPSU Central Committee, only we did not talk about this. For all its notoriety, the one-party system was manageable even during the most crucial and difficult stages of economic and political development. What we have today is a general lack of responsibility, or, to put it another way, a mess -- and not the pinnacle of democracy as some make it out to be. Democracy is not ochlocracy. Democracy is when everyone abides by the law, and everyone understands that their rights and freedom are limited by the rights and freedoms of others. At the same time, an individual should have priority over any national and supranational rights and freedoms of a group of individuals. [RESPUBLIKA] Will you run for the presidency? [Bulakhov] I am too young now. And, as a matter of fact, it's not my business. No, I will not run. [RESPUBLIKA] How realistic is the outcome that a new president will be elected by the parliament, as an exception, and not by all the people? [Valeriy Tikhinya] This outcome should not be ruled out. However, the candidate who will seek this post and the forces that he represents will hardly accept it -- because it is so obvious that it is going to be a puppet president without strong power. As his legal status will be diminished, he will have to look to the Supreme Soviet all the time, which gave him its support. In my opinion, it is not the best way to elect the first Belarusian president, and I hope it will be rejected. [RESPUBLIKA] Will you propose yourself as a candidate for president and, if so, as a candidate of what party? [Aleksandr Lukashenko] If I will, I will be a candidate of the left center. Basically, all the candidates are already known: Lukashenko, Kebich, and perhaps Hryb and Tikhinya -- left of the center; Shushkevich, Karpenko, Paznyak -- right of the center. Other candidates also may appear. But I do not think it's very likely -- political figures do not come out of the blue. For me, the arrangement of forces is already clear.
