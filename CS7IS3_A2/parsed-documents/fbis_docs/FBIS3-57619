This was stated on Wednesday to South Korean journalists by Major-General Han Sung-Ui, a representative of the South Korean military establishment, in connection with press reports that Russia had recently offered to pay back South Korean credits by deliveries of the latest military technologies, the South Korean press reported today. Han Sung-Ui said it was difficult to include Russian military hardware in the arsenal of the South Korean Armed Forces, because the latter were organised and equipped according to the American system. However, limited amounts of Russian armaments could be used to study the Russian tactics and military doctrine, and also to polish off operations to beat off a possible attack from North Korea, whose troops are armed with Soviet-type weaponry. The representative of the Defence Ministry stressed that the Seoul government would go on adhering to the priority development of military cooperation with its closest ally -- the United States. At the same time, it will promote relations with the neighbouring countries, such as Russia and Japan, including in the sphere of defence. "I am referring primarily to exchanges of cadets and servicemen," Han Sung-Ui stated. Director of the second Asia department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Nikolay Solovyov stated in Moscow that the Russian Foreign Ministry did not forward to the South Korean side any official documents on the sale or joint production of armaments, as well as of up-to-date technologies, in payment for Russia's debts. South Korean representatives have received a package of proposals on military-technical cooperation during Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin's visit to Seoul last August. Confirming this fact, Solovyov noted that no official reply was received from the South Korean side so far.
