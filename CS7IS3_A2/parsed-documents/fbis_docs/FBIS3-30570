The assembly was then addressed by Tvrtko Mevkestoc, president of the Croat Coordination Council. The assembly's main task is to define the general social position of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to chart the course of future social trends, and to articulate the Croats' national aims. An undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina is in the vital interests of the Croatian people, Nevjestic stressed. The participants in the assembly were also addressed by Zvonimir Separovic on behalf of the World Victimology Society. Speaking about the conflict between the Croats and Muslims, Separovic pointed out that this had only helped the aggressor and that the conflict ought to be brought to an immediate end. He also read out a joint statement by the Academies of Sciences of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In it, the members of the academies demand an immediate end to hostilities, peace, freedom of movement, and the return of refugees to their homes. The Assembly of Croats is a historic event as it is beneficial to Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as to its citizens, Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency said in his address. The assembly's decisions are of decisive importance as life in the future Bosnia-Herzegovina will depend on them, Miro Lazovic, president [speaker] of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly says. [passage omitted] The former allies have clashed and have started hating each other, thus enabling the aggressors to do whatever they want. The Croatian people's interests lie in coexistence with others. At the moment, a defensive and just war is being waged in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ivo Komsic [member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency] said. [Begin Komsic recording] We certainly know that one war was imposed on us whereas some of our people [Croats] should also take the blame for our being drawn into the second war. We demonstrated that we can organize defense by defending ourselves from Serbian aggression. In many areas Croatian fighters should take credit for the fact that the Serbian aggressor has not crushed the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina and completed its conquest. [end recording] Following the debate, during the course of which a large number of those present voiced their views, the assembly passed a declaration demanding an immediate end to the war since an undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only Bosnia-Herzegovina that the Croats desire. Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croats regard territorial conquest and its legalization by any side as unacceptable and impermissible. This is why the participants in the assembly demand that the plan for the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina must not be signed. Even if it is signed the Croats will regard it as null and void, as stated in the declaration adopted at today's Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croats.
