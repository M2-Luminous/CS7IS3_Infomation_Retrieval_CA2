[begin Andrejevs recording] At this time, after getting acquainted with this document, and discussing this document in the government, as well as talking with representatives of one or two other countries' governments, the impression arises that President Yeltsin has given in to the influence of more conservative forces in Russia, which have evidently come through the Ministry of Defence, putting forward such demands, or proposals, let us say for the present, knowing beforehand that they are not acceptable to Latvia, absolutely incompatible with either the letter or the spirit of the draft treaties, agreements, worked out long and hard, which have been initialled in Moscow, so that their signing will not take place at all [sentence as heard]. That is how we have to interpret it, and all three essential things are included in (?the first line of) this order, namely: the establishment of military bases; the testing of new types of armaments on their territory; and the guaranteeing of the security of these countries mentioned, including the Republic of Latvia, to be undertaken by Russia; so, for all three of these announcements the Latvian Government makes its explanations. We have never agreed to the development of these military bases in Latvia, as at present none of the military units has the status of a military base in Latvia. We have never allowed the testing of new types of Russian armaments. And we have not delegated to Russia the right to provide us here with security for this country in the event of another country's attack. All this is mentioned in the statement adopted by the government, which will be read out in full on television as well. Tomorrow it is to be introduced to the envoys of countries accredited here, and of course in the press the full text will be [words indistinct]. [end recording]
