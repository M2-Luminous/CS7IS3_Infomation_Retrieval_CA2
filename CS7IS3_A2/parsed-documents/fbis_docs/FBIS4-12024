Our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus has learned that the Palestinians are avoiding agreements on various issues, and that they tried to reopen several issues which have already been concluded, such as the deployment of the Palestinian forces in Gaza and the timetable for the deployment of the police force in the autonomy areas. There are also differences between Israel and the PLO on the technical procedures for the entrance of the police force to the territories. Our correspondent was told that the Palestinians will not be given any responsibility over the autonomy areas before the agreement is signed, although they will be responsible for refugee camps handed over to them in these areas.
