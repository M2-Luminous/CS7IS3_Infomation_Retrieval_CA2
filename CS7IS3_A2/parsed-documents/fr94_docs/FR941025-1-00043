FR941025-1-00043 FR941025-1-00011 On July 1, 1994, the plaintiffs requested a 100-day extension in the comment period. Because the Secretary had no objection to a 30-day extension, both parties agreed to an extension in the comment period to August 31, 1994, which the Service published in the Federal Register on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38426). On July 27, 1994, the court ordered the comment period extended to October 31, 1994. The Service published this extension in the Federal Register on August 26, 1994 (59 FR 44125). In order that the plaintiffs may depose Dr. Atwood regarding his studies of the gnatcatcher, the court ordered on September 30, 1994, that the comment period be extended again to December 1, 1994. In addition, the court ordered that the Secretary publish the finding whether the listing should be revised or revoked in the Federal Register by February 1, 1995. References Cited Atwood, J.L. 1991.
