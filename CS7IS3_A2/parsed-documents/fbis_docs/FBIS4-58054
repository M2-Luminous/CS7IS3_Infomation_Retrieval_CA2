President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's General People's Congress (GPC) said a southern brigade had deployed in the Dhamar region, 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of Sanaa, on the orders of the GPC's southern rival, the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP). The GPC said it feared "more widespread clashes" between rival northern and southern forces. A military mediation committee was trying to "persuade the commanders of the Ba'Sahib brigade to return to their camp and eliminate military tension in the Dhamar region," the GPC said. On April 6 the GPC accused the same brigade of shelling official buildings, including Republican Guard and police headquarters, in the Dhamar region. YSP military officials said Friday a southern armoured brigade had retreated to the mountains around 'Imran north of Sanaa, following the latest fighting. The officials said the 1,200 troops pulled out after reinforcements of northern troops, including elite Republican Guards, arrived at 'Imran, 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Sanaa. Yemeni journalists who visited the scene said the northern troops gained the upper hand in the fighting, and the southern forces sought refuge with an allied tribe, the Bakil. The GPC said searches were under way for Colonel Sayf al-Baqri, commander of the southern armoured brigade held responsible for the bloody clashes in 'Imran. [passage omitted]
