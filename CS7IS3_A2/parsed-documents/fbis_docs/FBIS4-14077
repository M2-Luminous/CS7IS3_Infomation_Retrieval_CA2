He added that the inspections will be carried out by a neutral civilian body in the Port of al-'Aqabah instead of by offshore military vessels. The U.S. response to the Jordanian proposals came as a result of a solid Jordanian stand following Jordan's announcement on many occasions on its compliance with the UN resolutions. The inspection of 1,700 ships bound for al-'Aqabah has proven that these resolutions were not violated. Jordan has also announced that the offshore inspections are useless because there are too many other gateways to Iraq and because no inspection is carried out at these gateways. Therefore, there is no point in continuing the siege of al-'Aqabah alone unless the siege has other objectives related to the Jordanian stand vis-a-vis the peace process and negotiations. As the prime minister asserted in his meeting with the Arab and foreign journalists yesterday, Jordan rejects any encroachment on its sovereignty by any foreign side. The proposals presented by Jordan stipulate that a non-political and not-for-profit party should carry out monitoring work, not inspection, while Jordanian customs employees inspect the containers that arrive at the port on board al-'Aqabah-bound ships. The proposals also stipulate that the recommended party -- Lloyds Register -- is to monitor, check the documents of the cargo, and to report to those in charge of implementing the sanctions on Iraq. The U.S. agreement on the Jordanian proposals will end a clear contradiction between the objectives of the peace process and the unjustified imposition of sanctions on Jordan, for which it has paid dearly from its national economy.
