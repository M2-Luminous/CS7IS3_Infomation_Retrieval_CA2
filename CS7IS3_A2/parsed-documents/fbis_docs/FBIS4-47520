As the sorbent is used sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, either of these two compounds being chemically more active than the conventionally used analogous calcium compounds. The new method is not only almost waste-free but also more efficient, inasmuch as up to 95 % or even more of the SO[.sub]2[/] content will be removed, and simpler than the conventional one. The processes taking place are reaction of the sodium compound with sulfur dioxide in the presence of oxygen, which results in formation of sodium sulfate and sodium sulfite, followed by reduction of both these salts by methane, carbon monoxide, or molecular hydrogen. The principal end product is sodium sulfide, which by treatment with carbon dioxide and water vapor will be converted into sodium carbonate and hydrogen sulfide. A pump feeds sorbent from a storage tank into the flue duct for removal of sulfur, whereupon the clean exhaust gas pass through a dust trap- separator cyclone chamber into the air while the sodium sulfur salts are precipitated into an extractor into which also water is injected. Their water solution is fed into a centrifuge, from where they are loaded for sorbent regeneration while residual ash falls out. The equipment in such sorbent regeneration plant consists of: - evaporator - centrifuge discharging water - Claus furnace discharging sulfur - afterburning furnace for sulfur dioxide + hydrogen sulfide mixture - scrubbing chamber - methane combustion chamber with air injection and - melting chamber (1200�C) for sodium sulfur salts including makeup sodium sulfate - methane incomplete-combustion chamber with air injection and - sodium sulfur salts reducing chamber (900�C) - carbonizer with carbon dioxide and water vapor injection - two collector tanks, one for sodium sulfur salts coming in from the user and one for sodium carbonate going out to the user respectively. Inasmuch as installation of such an equipment in every plant and especially in small ones is costly, regional centralization of the treatment is proposed: one sorbent regeneration plant to collect on tank trucks sodium sulfur salts from all users in the region and to deliver to them on tank trucks regenerated sodium carbonate. Such a scheme is demonstrated on a radial grid with the sorbent regeneration plant at an optimum location within the Tula-Ryazan-Tambov-Lipetsk perimeter. Figures 3; references 10.
