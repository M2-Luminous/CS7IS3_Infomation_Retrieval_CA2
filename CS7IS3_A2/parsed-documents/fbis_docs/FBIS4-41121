The article takes a negative view of all the presidential candidates except Vyacheslaw Kebich. Especially many harsh words and offensive hints are leveled at ex-Speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich. Mr. Shushkevich's initiative group sent an official question to the Dutch Embassy in Warsaw. It received the answer: No publication by this name exists in Holland, and there have been no such articles in the Dutch press. The identity of the author of the forged article remains a riddle. The Oversight Council consisting of independent experts recommended that in the days remaining before the elections the mass media refrain from publishing sociological surveys because, the council thought, sociological services in the country are as a rule controlled by the government and some of its leaders are members of Mr. Kebich's initiative group. This decision evoked a negative reaction from official sociologists. According to their polls, Mr. Kebich has enjoyed unequaled popularity in the republic for a long time now, although observers believe that the real mood among the bulk of the population creates some doubt that the prime minister will win the 23 June elections.
