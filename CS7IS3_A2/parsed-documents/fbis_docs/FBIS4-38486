The Kiev conference, in which chiefs of the CIS Executive Secretariat took part, ended late last week. Having compared notes on antimonopoly activities, the participants decided to sum up their experience and, having further set up special working groups to coordinate efforts in building a competition-based economy for their countries, to standardize their antimonopoly laws. It was also decided to initiate an exchange of information on the state of commodity markets and the results of scientific research work and to exchange specialists in the field of antimonopoly activity. The brunt of the coordination of this work falls on the interstate CIS Council for Antimonopoly Policy, whose second sitting took place within the Kiev meeting framework. Among other things, it worked out proposals to the Executive Committee and the CIS Interparliamentary CIS Assembly on harmonization of antimonopoly laws within the framework of the Treaty on the Conduct of a Concerted Antimonopoly Policy signed by the CIS heads of government in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] in December 1993. Bulgaria wanted to accede to the treaty; participants in the conference supported its initiative on creating an interstate association on competition policy.
