This has transpired at the end of the talks between Israel and Jordan. During the talks, Israel demanded that King Husayn immediately put a halt to Hamas activity in Jordan. The Jordanian representatives, however, claimed that if they carry out the desired steps in the next few days, this would be construed as Israeli and U.S. intervention in Jordanian affairs. Consequently, they announced that such steps will be implemented only once there is sufficient cause -- for example, after another attack is carried out in Israel. Israeli sources said that Israel had no choice but to accept the Jordanian condition. At the same time, Israel was told that Jordan will gradually implement more long-term steps against Hamas.
