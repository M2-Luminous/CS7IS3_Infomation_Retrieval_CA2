Fujii told a regular press conference after the morning cabinet meeting that he asked cabinet members to "reaffirm" that the two be handled together and that there were "no objections." The issue has split government and ruling party leaders in recent days, with many calling for an early tax cut while leaving for the future the matter of how to pay for it. Fujii also said he interpreted comments made Monday by Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to mean that a joint economic forum between the government and the coalition has "decided" that the tax cut and hike will be linked. After a forum meeting, Hata told reporters that "tax cuts without future (funding) expectations are dangerous for the nation," adding that "it is necessary to indicate a set direction" for handling the consumption tax matter. Hata said the forum would issue its final decision by Wednesday. Fujii said the stimulus package, to be announced Thursday, would be "large-scale," hinting that it will exceed September's record 13.2 trillion yen package. He said he hopes it will be the last such package needed to get Japan's sluggish economy on track for full-fledged recovery in the fiscal year starting in April and stable growth in the following fiscal year. Fujii said Japan's economy is not in such dire straits as to require a stimulus financed by deficit spending that would erode the nation's fiscal position and later prove to be a "disgrace" to the financial authorities. Although he does not think the economy has hit bottom, he noted that Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno reported signs last week that corporate sentiment is improving. Fujii repeated that the same tax reform package that cuts taxes must include the "timing and new rate" of the consumption tax increase to guarantee repayment of any short-term bonds issued to finance the cut. To support his concern about deficit spending, he cited a report by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which he said proves the Japanese Government's consolidated fiscal position has become "the worst among the leading nations." He said "the world misunderstands" the issue, apparently referring to a U.S. Government contention that Japan has fiscal breathing room to cut income taxes without linking the move directly to a consumption tax hike. Fujii also said he would carefully watch long-term interest rates, which have recently begun to edge up, but he played down concerns that such upward pressure would put a drag on the economy, saying the government will not issue any bonds that cannot be "digested" by the market.
