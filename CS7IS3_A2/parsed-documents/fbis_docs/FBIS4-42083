Against the background of high unemployment, initiatives to promote economic growth and employment will stand in the foreground. Germany is to assume the presidency of the EU Council on 1 July, to be succeeded by France in the first half of 1995. In a government declaration on Europe policy that he delivered in Bonn last Friday [27 May], Kohl said that his objective was "to achieve certain agreement with our French partners to make sure that what we begin during our presidency can continue under the subsequent presidency." With measures at the national and European level it is of prime importance to fight unemployment, Kohl said. This joint initiative is supported by the leading business associations in both countries. A joint memorandum of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI], the Federal Association of German Employers' Associations [BDA], and the National Council of French Employers [CNFP], notes that the successive German and French presidencies must be used to create the conditions for a sizable improvement in Europe's competitive strength and employment. From the business community's point of view the decisive step toward improving the job situation in Europe is to take some burden off the enterprises. The starting point for a Franco-German initiative are probably proposals EU Commission President Jacques Delors made in his White Book on Securing Europe as an Economic Center. Kohl picked up Delors' suggestions for more flexibility on the labor market, reducing ancillary wage costs, creating new employment opportunities, and special measures against youth and long-term unemployment. Yet, Kohl also mentioned the trans-European networks in the areas of transport, energy, and telecommunications as suggested by Delors. The objective is to create as quickly as possible a fast rail link from London to Moscow via Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Warsaw. In one point, Bonn seems to be getting near Delors, whose position has been strongly supported by Paris. So far, the Federal Government has regarded the creation of European networks, particularly in the areas of energy and telecommunications, as a task for the private economy, for which only the preconditions ought to be created at the political level. What Bonn is eager to avoid is giving the EU the possibility to finance its budgets via credits through these programs, as was suggested by Delors. Thus, Finance Minister Theo Waigel emphasized in the Bundestag that for projects related to the transport infrastructure, one was expecting "a sizable contribution by the European Community, but no new credit instruments." In this connection, Waigel mentioned two essential transport routes that are important for Germany: the tunnel through the Brenner Pass, and a high-speed east-west rail link from Paris via Nuremberg to Leipzig and Berlin. Apart from its program on employment promotion, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mitterrand, in their talks in Mulhouse, will also examine the timetable for European monetary union. As a precautionary measure the chancellor pointed out that compliance with the stability criteria as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty would have precedence over keeping up the timetable. The cross-border fight against crime is also of major importance for the Federal Government. Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel emphasized in the Bundestag that the fighting of the narcotics mafia, illegal arms trade, and cross-border crime require the creation of a European policy authority and agreement on a common asylum policy. Another focus of Bonn's European projects is intensifying cooperation between the EU and the reformist countries in Central and East Europe.
