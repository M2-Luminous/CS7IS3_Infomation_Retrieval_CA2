The average per capita living space for urban Chinese residents has risen to 7.4 sq.m. at present, a sharp contrast to the mere 3.6 sq.m. fifteen years ago. According to Deputy-Minister of Construction Tan Qinglian, urban Chinese residents are now enjoying better housing conditions, with larger houses, better architectural designs and more beautiful residential environments. The senior official said that residential housing has been given top priority in China as a result of the government's macro control over the once overheated real estate industry. According to him, the construction of luxury hotels, apartments and villas has been strictly controlled since May of last year. The deputy-minister expects record growth this year in the construction of total floor space and the average per capita living space. To boost the construction of residential housing, the government has granted preferential treatment to housing construction companies in terms of land allocation and reduction or exemption of taxes as well as loans and materials supply. According to the government housing plan, the average per capita living space for urban Chinese residents should reach 8 sq.m. by the turn of the century. To meet the target, China has to build 150 million to 180 million sq.m. in floor space every year before the end of the century. The leading official said that the housing strain is still serious in China. Taking the country as a whole, more than 4 million urban households still live in houses with a floor space of less than 4 sq.m. per person. In addition, over 30 million sq.m. of old and dilapidated houses need to be renovated.
