AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kimberly Hardin, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0371. PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION: We preliminarily determine that phthalic anhydride (PA) from Venezuela is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act), as amended. The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Scope of Investigation The product covered by this investigation is PA, an aromatic synthetic organic chemical usually produced from a primary petrochemical called orthoxylene, although it is sometimes produced from naphthalene. PA is predominately used in the production of plasticizers, unsaturated polyester resins, and alkyd resins, which in turn are generally used to produce plastics and paints. This investigation covers PA sold in either flaked or molten form. PA is classifiable under subheading 2917.35.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes. Our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation (POI) The period of investigation is May 1, 1993, to October 31, 1993. Case History Since the notice of initiation on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 60847, November 18, 1993), the following events have occurred. On November 12, 1993, we sent a cable to the U.S. consulate in Caracas requesting a list of all known producers and exporters of the subject merchandise and information about the producer/exporter named in the petition. On November 26, 1994, we presented an Antidumping Survey to Oxidaciones Organicas, C.A. (Oxidor). Oxidor was named in the petition as the primary producer/exporter of PA from Venezuela. On December 6, 1994, Oxidor submitted its response to the Department's Antidumping Survey. On December 1, 1993, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination (USITC Publication 2709, December 1993). On December 20, 1993, we issued an antidumping questionnaire to Oxidor. We presented the questionnaire to Oxidor at its facility in Caracas, Venezuela, on January 4, and 5, 1994. On January 5, 1994, Oxidor requested a one-week extension of time in which to respond to Section A, the general information section, of the Department's antidumping questionnaire. On January 6, 1994, we granted the extension. On January 18, 1994, we received Oxidor's Section A questionnaire response. On January 18, 1994, Oxidor requested a three-week extension of time in which to respond to Sections B (sales in the home market or to third countries) and C (sales to the United States) of the questionnaire. On January 19, 1994, we granted Oxidor a partial extension of two weeks for the responses to these sections of the questionnaire. On January 21, 1994, Oxidor submitted corrections to its Section A questionnaire response. On February 7, 1994, we received Oxidor's Sections B and C questionnaire response. On February 8, 1994, Oxidor submitted one corrected page to its Section C questionnaire response. On February 14, 1994, petitioners requested an 11-day postponement of the preliminary determination. On February 15, 1994, we issued a deficiency letter to Oxidor regarding its response to Sections A, B, and C of the questionnaire. On February 22, 1994, Oxidor objected to petitioners' request for an 11-day postponement of the preliminary determination. On February 23, 1994, petitioners requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination in order to permit full consideration of whether Oxidor made home market sales at prices below the cost of production (COP).
