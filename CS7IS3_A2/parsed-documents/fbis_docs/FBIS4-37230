He ruled out "the possibility of a Security Council resolution to that effect because the interests of several Security Council member states are linked to Libyan oil." He pointed out that "the U.S. insistence on esclation could shut the door in the face of the attempts to resolve the Lockerbie crisis." He stressed that closing the door to a solution "would never change Libya's position or make it forfeit its sovereignty and break its laws." He said that "the Libyan people can live without the oil." 'Izz-al-Din al-Hinshiri, Libyan secretary of the General People's Committee for Communications (communications minister), left Cairo yesterday for his country via Tunisia after a visit to Egypt lasting several days. Early in the week, he survived a road accident on his way from Libya to Cairo in the al-Dab'ah area near al-'Alamayn.
