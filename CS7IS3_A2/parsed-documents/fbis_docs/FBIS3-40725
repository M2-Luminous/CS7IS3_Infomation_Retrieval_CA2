Delivering the presidential address at the physical sciences section of the 63rd annual session of the National Academy of Sciences here on Wednesday, Dr K. Kasturirangan, Director of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) satellite centre here, said studies exploring the possibility of such a mission carried out by ISRO were quite encouraging and the mission appeared feasible. The study was carried out in the wake of the recent advances made in the realisation of a geosynchronous launch capability. He, however, said a time schedule for such a mission had not been fixed as yet. Dr Kasturirangan said the GSLV could be used for a mission to launch a spacecraft to Mercury, either as a fly-by or as an orbiter to the planet using the gravity-assist trajectories of the planetary probe due to Venus and Mercury itself. He said ISRO has also framed the objectives and profile of an Indian planetary mission to Venus and Mercury. The GSLV would launch the spacecraft first into a 300 km orbit and later boosted to a heliocentric orbit. The spacecraft would be designed to provide three axis stabilisation using the sun for pitch and yaw control and a star as a roll reference. In situ particle detectors, plasma probes and magnetometer onboard the orbiter could provide vital information on solar wind and associated phenomena. A fly-by mission of Venus and Mercury would provide some opportunity to have a short glimpse of these planets. The mercury orbiter could carry a number of instruments for imaging the surface and for remote measurements of the surface parameters and environment of the planet. Dr Kasturirangan said the instruments in such an orbiter could include ultra violet spectrometer for determining elemental composition of rare and other gases and throw light on the sodium enigma of Mercury, plasma analyser to measure solar wind particles in the transitional atmosphere of the planet, imaging with television cameras at a high resolution of 50 to 100 metres in different visible and infrared bands, gamma ray, x-ray and infrared spectroscopy to study the composition of the surface material of the planet. He said India could also go in for a multi-wavelength space observatory that could be launched by the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) to a low earth inclined orbit. A space astronomy mission capitalising on simultaneous multiple wavelength observations of celestial "flash" transient phenomena.
