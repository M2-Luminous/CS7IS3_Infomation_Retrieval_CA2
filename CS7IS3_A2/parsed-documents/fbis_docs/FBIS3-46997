Director Pantaleon Dumlao, PNP deputy chief for operations, said the reward hopefully would encourage reluctant witnesses to cooperate fully with the police. The witnesses could even request anonymity, according to PNP Director General Umberto Rodriguez. A senior police officer said the reward was put up because the PNP still cannot clearly establish which group or groups carried out the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City and the subsequent explosions at three mosques. The police announced on Wednesday the arrest of two suspects in the cathedral attack. Intelligence reports indicated the two suspects, Abdul Munib and a man identified only as Jacob, belong to the Abu Sayaf, a Muslim extremist group. This has led police to deduce the Abu Sayaf is behind the bombing of the cathedral. But the police official said the police is "still looking" for more solid evidence against Munib and Jacob. So far, investigators are going by intelligence reports which said that the two arrived in Davao City from Jolo via Basilan on the last week of November along with 23 other Abu Sayaf members. "Even if the Abu Sayaf really is responsible for the attack on the cathedral," the source said, "there is still the matter of solving the bombing of the mosques." One police official in Davao is certain both the attacks on the cathedral and on the mosques were made by only one group. This group, according to Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian, police regional director, is out to sow chaos in Mindanao. "There exists a group that is out to create chaos between our Muslim brothers and Christians. Their targets are religious structures," Carian said. During the joint meeting yesterday of the Regional Peace and Order Council and the Regional Development Council, Carian said the bombers have only one objective: "Open a rift and create animosities that will open hostilities between Christians and Muslims in Mindanao." Carian and Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte also denied two Muslim men have been arrested as suspects in the cathedral bombing. "So far, there are no apprehensions made. No one is under our custody," Carian said. "We are not in a hurry. We haven't arrested a single suspect," Duterte said. It was Senior Inspector Tadgiro Ainin, the Santa Ana police chief, who announced the arrest of Munib and Jacob, who was positively identified by at least five witnesses. Carian said, "The same criminal groups which initiated these bombings in the first place," and a so-called "New Christian Democratic Army," which claimed responsibility for the attack on the three mosques, was part of this group. "I should not wonder if later on, there will be another group claiming to be anti-Christian group," he added.
