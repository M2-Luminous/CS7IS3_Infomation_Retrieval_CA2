Implementation of the law will mean the return of property to the previous owners, which will take a long time, the Macedonian Government says. Among those dispossessed of their property are large numbers of the Serbian nationality, who were expelled from Macedonia in 1941 by the Bulgarian aggressor, and Josip Broz's [Tito's] regime banned their return to their homes. Most of the owners and their heirs are now citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and a number of them also live abroad.
