They said this major social phenomenon is becoming a historical trend for China. For some years, in early spring, tens of thousands of young farmers, men and women, from land-locked provinces of Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou streamed into economically developed Pearl and Chang Jiang River deltas, Beijing, Tianjin and other cities to work, make money and learn technology. Such a grand scene in China's economic and social arena is described vividly as a "wave of migrating farmer-laborers." Statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture shows that, of China's total rural workforce of 430 million, 130 million are in redundance. Besides the 110 million already employed by township enterprises, 20 million are on the move every year. Guangdong, China's showcase province in reform and opening up in the south, leads the country in absorbing outsider farmers, which total more than 10 million. Sichuan, China's most populous province and leading grain producer, is a major source of the wave. Due to its limited farmland, 20 million farmers have become surplus. "Three months to work in the fields, two months to spend the Spring Festival holiday season and seven months to idle away at leisure" is a typical style of their life. They are eager to find jobs and fortunes in a new world. In 1989, the first groups of Sichuan farmers left their land for jobs elsewhere. The "Sichuan armies" of migrant farmers have since become well known throughout the country. Xiao Yang, governor of Sichuan and an NPC deputy, said that in 1993, five million farmers from Sichuan found jobs in all the other provinces, regions and municipalities except Taiwan. Remittances they sent back home amounted to five billion yuan that year. Zuo Mingzhong, a farmer deputy, said farmers's concepts have changed a lot. To them farmland is no longer their sole source for subsistence. Migrant farmers have broadened their horizons, learned skills and improved cultural and educational standards by assimilating nutrition from modern industries and urban civilization. Many farmers have returned home with technology and information procured from developed areas. They have launched businesses in their hometowns to help their villagers get prosperous, Zuo said. Li Youwei, major of Shenzhen city and an NPC deputy, said migrant farmers are a main workforce in the construction of the special economic zone. They work mainly in labor-intensive construction, transportation and toy industries. In Shenzhen, they are well received since they are good workers, Li said. Economists and sociologists among the NPC deputies maintain that the "wave of migrating farmer-laborers" is a historical trend under China's fledging market economic structure and planned allocation of production factors. The wave is, in essence, a process of optimizing the allocation of production factors -- a shift of rural laborers from areas with low productivity and efficiency to areas with higher standards. Some years ago, farmers moved locally, to non-agricultural sectors. But now they moved to other areas and are becoming urbanized. This tremendous social change shows that Chinese farmers who have relied on farming for centuries have begun to take part in the great modernization process and share social-economic benefits arising therefrom. "This is a historical progress," economists and sociologists said. They predicted, therefore, Chinese farmers are making their third great creation, following their first creation of the family-based farming system and their second creation of rural enterprises. The "wave of migrating farmer-laborers," however, has also become a headache for relevant authorities. For instance, the outflow of young farmers will hamper the modernization process in rural areas. The presence of armies of migrant farmers have put strains on transportation departments and management of public order in urban areas. Experts suggested governments exercise macro-guidance and coordination over the inter-regional flow of farmers in order to avoid chaos and set up more employment agencies to provide job information, training and consultation. Towns and townships should become the main reservoir to siphon surplus laborers in order to slow down their speedy flow to urban areas, according to the experts. They said that if China's existing 60 large and medium-sized cities are set to absorb rural surplus laborers, every city will have one million people more. So that is a choice. And there are also potentials in this regard for 300 small cities and 2,000 county towns. In addition, about 2,000 towns and townships out of a total 5,000 can be developed into "farmer towns." Thus it will be possible to absorb the 100 million surplus farmers. Recently, officials from nine provinces and regions which have the biggest flow of migrant farmers in and out gathered in Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi Province, to explore ways to strengthen organization and distribution of migrant farmers. The Ministry of Labor is also planning to study how to make rural laborers flow in an orderly way and how to get farmers employed in non-agricultural sectors.
