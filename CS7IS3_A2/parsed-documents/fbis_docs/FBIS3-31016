According to well-informed sources in the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS), this discontent is used as an argument in the efforts to open up the former military airport in Tuzla on the pretext that this would step up humanitarian aid. However, official RS sources confirm that there is enough food because all international aid for Tuzla passes through Zvornik, a town near the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the past ten days only, 13 convoys (a total of 172 trucks) of the U.N. High Commissariat for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) brought 1,400 tonnes of food and medications and 1,200 litres of engine oil and fuel to Tuzla via Serb-held territory. However, the bulk of this aid is siezed by the Bosnian Moslem army, never arriving in the hands of the tens of thousands of Tuzla's children, women, the ill and elderly, the Bosnian Serbs said.
