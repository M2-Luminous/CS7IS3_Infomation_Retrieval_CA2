Acknowledging a recent improvement in relations between Paris and Baghdad, Salih told AFP: "It is necessary that France takes a step forward and responds to the initiative that Iraq has taken." Bagdad opened an office in Paris in September, the first since the two countries broke off diplomatic relations in February 1991 during the Gulf war. Salih is leading a delegation of five Iraqi parliamentarians attending the 91st UNESCO interparliamentary conference taking place in Paris. The recent developments in French policy towards Iraq have been "very positive," Salih said, as much in the recent string of visits between the two countries as in its recent "moderation" of its stance on Iraq as a member of the UN Security Council. Salih said he was to meet French parliamentary speaker Philippe Seguin Friday and that he had had "other contacts" in Paris. Iraq has been fighting hard to get the UN embargo on Iraqi oil sales lifted -- only to see it reimposed by the UN Security Council last week. "There is no further justification for the embargo," Salih said, stressing the hardship it was causing the Iraqi people who "are starving to death." During the course of the Iraqi's visit to Paris, which has raised protests from the Iraqi opposition abroad, French oil groups Total and Elf Aquitaine have held discussions with Iraqi officials over plans to develop two oil fields in southern Iraq once the UN embargo is lifted. In New York Wednesday, the UN said it was planning a series of missions to Iraq to develop controls on its long-term military potential before there could be any question of lifting the oil sales embargo.
