Back Again Empty-Handed"] [Text] So far Clinton has not been too lucky in the field of international policy. Admittedly, this is no longer giving rise to pointed remarks as it did at the beginning of his presidency: It was said that all his knowledge had been acquired at the international club of blini lovers. But so far the U.S. President has not won any laurels in this field. His first European trip to Brussels, Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk, and Geneva was evidently undertaken in order to, first, enhance and strengthen the U.S. President's international prestige and, second, once again demonstrate support for B.N. Yeltsin, of which the Russian president is permanently in need. The problem is, however, that these aims are to a considerable extent mutually contradictory and this became clear during the first stage of Clinton's European marathon. In Brussels he made public the new U.S. "Partnership for Peace" concept. The package of measures -- as always bedecked in a fine propaganda wrapper -- comprises a program for the phased integration in NATO of the East European countries that were formerly members of the Warsaw Pact. The North Atlantic military alliance was at one time propagandized in the West as a strictly defensive alliance and its very existence and strengthening was attributed to the existence of the "Soviet threat." You would have thought that after the elimination of the Warsaw Pact and the self-destruction of the Soviet Union, after the United States was left as the world's only superpower, NATO should have disbanded immediately -- being totally redundant. Especially since, according to this military bloc's strategists, NATO no longer has any enemies and Russia is now regarded as a friendly democratic power. But they are not even thinking about dissolving NATO! The United States is leaving its 100,000-strong expeditionary corps in Europe. What is more, the latest phase in the policy of "rolling back" and forcing Russia out of its traditional spheres of influence is beginning in its new geopolitical form. The White House administration has already declared NATO's rapprochement with the countries of East Europe and their subsequent integration within the military bloc as a "highly important aspect of U.S. security." NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner does not conceal the fact that: "In the future the countries of the former Warsaw Pact will be given a seat in NATO. It is just a matter of time." But at the moment Washington is maneuvering, preferring to use the well-known sophistic method of describing as half-empty a glass that is half-full and giving Yeltsin the opportunity to do the same. U.S. General Shalikashvili said: "We cannot simply move the Berlin wall several hundred kilometers eastward." This cannot be done "simply" -- there are not only organizational-technical, but also psychological difficulties! Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev issued an exploratory statement: Russia may also decide to join NATO. To which Polish President Walesa responded that he would support this decision on one condition -- that Russia hands its nuclear arsenal over to NATO control. That is quite possibly what NATO strategists already want! A few days ago Deutsche Welle reported a curious information leak from NATO's Brussels headquarters: U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin suggested a concept, which presupposes "measures including air and missile raids on arms production sites." There was no reference to Russia and the concept has not hitherto won official approval, but you will agree that the very direction of NATO strategists' thoughts cannot fail to elicit profound alarm. All the more so since the NATO Council session involving President Clinton has already adopted a decree couched in the same adventurist vein: This is the first time that all the military bloc's 16 countries have backed a long-standing U.S. threat capable of causing an explosion of tremendous destructive force in the "Balkan powder keg." The NATO countries agreed to the possibility of carrying out air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. This decision also constitutes a direct challenge to Russia. After all, even Kozyrev's Foreign Ministry has recently begun to talk (finally!) of a traditional Russian-Serb partnership. You would have thought that the response to the NATO provocation should have been immediate condemnation of this adventurism. But no! Russia seems to have once again perceived a diplomatic slap in the face as something fitting, once again sacrificed the interests of its friends and, moreover, its own. Before Clinton's meeting with Yeltsin, rumors came from the Russian Foreign Ministry that were picked up by some publications: If the U.S. President takes it into his head to encroach on Russia's vital interests and, in particular, "tries to introduce the concept of internationalizing the conflicts on the territory of the former USSR, the Russian side intends to put up stiff opposition to these attempts." However, the rumors of a "stiff" Russian stance were simply bluff. In effect, it was once again a one-sided affair and Clinton understandably secured the diplomatic success planned in Washington. The U.S. President was particularly proud of the fact that he succeeded in persuading Ukrainian President Kravchuk to sign a tripartite statement and memorandum, in which Ukraine pledged to eliminate the nuclear arsenal left on its territory following the breakup of the Soviet Union: It is a question of 176 ICBM's and 15,000 nuclear warheads. Clinton described this as an historic agreement although he acknowledged that it will give rise to frenzied debate in the Ukrainian parliament. Be that as it may, the first aim of Clinton's European marathon seems to have been achieved -- at any rate, to some extent. Things are far trickier as regards support for B.N. Yeltsin. After all, the latest geopolitical concessions have occurred against a new backdrop. Britain's THE GUARDIAN points out that "pro-U.S. rhetoric has gone out of style in the Russian capital." And as for Clinton's latest promises "of support for Russian reforms," they are already generating ridicule, the newspaper remarked sarcastically. ...During the solemn ceremony in St. George's Hall in the Grand Kremlin Palace Bill Clinton delivered a welcome speech, which might be an illustration for Paragraph 545 of the primer by John Wood and Dzhan Serre [name as transliterated], "Diplomatic Ceremonial and Protocol," since it had all the components befitting the occasion: a greeting to his host, the general ideas behind the meeting, and, last, a desire for the prosperity and happiness of the country and people. There was, however, one blunder in the impromptu speech: The U.S. President uttered the words "Soviet nation." But a quick-witted interpreter omitted the careless phrase. The host of the reception also observed diplomatic protocol and, in the best U.S. traditions, "kept on smiling" as if saying the English word "cheese" in front of the television camera. Cheese is best supposed to "suppress the appetite" at receptions! It was announced that Clinton has promised Russia $900 million next year for aid with pro-Western reforms. This is probably the "piece of fresh free cheese in the mouse trap" that Aleksandr Rutskoy mentioned humorously before the summit in Vancouver when describing Western "aid"....
