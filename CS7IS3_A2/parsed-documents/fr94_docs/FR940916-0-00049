FR940916-0-00049 FR940916-0-00016 With regard to Primary financial requirements at Closing in paragraph (d), a commenter for shipyard interests stated that the factors upon which the existing financial requirements for a project are based, and which are made applicable under the interim final rule to a General Shipyard Facility owning AST/MST, do not appear to apply to such technology, and suggests that there should be a separate concept demonstrating how use of modern shipbuilding practices will enhance the shipyard's competitiveness. That commenter was also troubled by the fact that financial requirements are generally required to be based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), but that many potential applicants will not have GAAP-based accounts and that restatement to GAAP would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming. This includes the requirement to file MARAD Form MA&hyph;172. According to another commenter, since Actual Cost of a Title XI project, including AST/MST is made up of items that are usually capitalizable under GAAP, and costs of research and development must generally be expensed, in order to stimulate and encourage the development and construction of AST/MST MARAD should allow research and development costs to be included in Actual Cost. Another commenter representing shipyard interests argued that the requirement that a shipowner's equity be at least 50 percent of its long term debt, exclusive of Title XI debt, is unsatisfactory, adding that this standard will preclude many potential international shipowners from using U.S. shipyards, since in the international market, use of such factors as value of the collateral, possibly with some recourse, is the normal practice. Furthermore, it was argued that there are subsidies available through the European Union and the Australian government that tip the scales against Title XI financing. Accordingly, that commenter recommended that paragraph (d)(1)(ii) be amended to the effect that the Vessel will serve as the sole security for the Guarantees; that in a highly leveraged transaction, additional security should be considered; and that applicants with a well established market share and a solid trading and revenue profile be required to maintain equity of only 15 percent of total long term debt. Another commenter argued that MARAD's minimum working capital, net worth, debt to equity ratios, and other financial ratios are too conservative when applied to the construction of AST/MST, particularly in the first year when expenses are high. It was alleged that such severe financial restrictions will thwart the purpose of Congress in advancing and assisting the transition of U.S. shipyards to modern shipyard facilities. One commenter noted that use of the term ``Owner'' of technology in new paragraph (e)(3) may be limiting because the General Shipyard Facility may be a ``Lessee'' of that technology. Another commenter stated that MARAD should allow more flexibility in reviewing the financial strength of the applicant as MARAD's equity to debt test provides no flexibility for evaluating potential financial structures as is now used in the export market, particularly by U.S. aircraft manufacturers for exporting aircraft, nor would it appear to allow MARAD to review and approve a financing structure utilizing a foreign sales corporation. MARAD Response: MARAD is not persuaded by the suggestion that the primary financial requirements at Closing should not apply to a General Shipyard Facility because they do not apply to AST/MST owned by a General Shipyard Facility. These financial requirements are criteria used to measure how adequately a company is capitalized to undertake the business it intends to pursue. MARAD needs that information for AST/MST projects just as it needs the information for other Title XI projects to assure reasonable prospect of repayment of the underlying debt. Regarding the requirement for a restatement of accounts in GAAP format, modern financial analysis requires accurate and standardized information. Companies seeking loan Guarantees for multimillion dollar projects should be prepared to demonstrate their creditworthiness in a reliable and standard manner. Thus far, it has been MARAD's experience with the Eligible Export Vessel program that the requirement for GAAP accounting has not proved an undue burden on applicants.
