The agreement envisions dialogue and negotiation as the means to settle the conflict between the [Rwandan] Patriotic Front and the interim government. It should have taken effect immediately yesterday evening, but it appears that the fighting is continuing in Kigali. Paris has taken note of this latest cease-fire agreement and expressed satisfaction with it, but the French Government condemned the massacre which took place in a church in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, which is reported to have resulted in 30-40 deaths, according to the United Nations.
