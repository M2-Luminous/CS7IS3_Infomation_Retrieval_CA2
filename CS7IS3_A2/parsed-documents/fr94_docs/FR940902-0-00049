FR940902-0-00049 FR940902-0-00010 Some commenters wondered where the self-determination of demonstrated performance should be documented. Since it is not expected that the documentation be voluminous, the Department believes that it would be appropriate for recipient and subrecipient administrators to address the criteria listed in paragraph (d) in writing, in the JTP, GCSSP or EDWAA plan. In the case of the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) that the service provider possess, ``[t]he ability to meet the program design specifications at a reasonable cost,'' recipients and subrecipients need not undertake extensive cost comparisons. Section 627.422(d) implements the requirement in section 107(a) of the Act that the Secretary develop guidelines on determining demonstrated performance. Concern was also expressed that use of CBO's might be restricted by the requirement in paragraph (d)(1) that service providers have adequate financial resources or the ability to obtain them. Comments indicated that many CBO's only support is JTPA programs and their financial stability rests with their ability to win JTPA contracts. Where the reimbursement method is used, the entity must either have the financial resources to cover expenses until reimbursed, or must be able to obtain the financial resources through loans, etc. In the case of CBO's, many will be placed on an advance method of payment. As a result, the financial resources test is considerably less stringent. Awarding agencies should, however, check the financial stability of all organizations in order to determine that they possess the financial wherewithal to adequately undertake a JTPA program and whether they are on the verge of bankruptcy. Section 627.422 (e) and (f) reiterate the language of section 107 (a) and (c) of the Act concerning CBO's and educational institutions. These provisions must be interpreted in conjunction with the goal of the regulations to establish an ``even playing field.'' CBO's and educational institutions are to be provided copies of any RFP's, etc. Any proposals that are received from CBO's and educational institutions are to be reviewed and rated in the same manner as proposals from any other organizations. It must be noted that the 90/10 arrangements authorized for use with CBO's or non-profits are not to be taken into consideration in the rating criteria. Based on the special mention in the Act of CBO's, it would be appropriate in instances where competing proposals are rated the same, to use as a tie-breaker the status of the organization submitting the proposal (i.e., CBO). In the case of educational institutions that are providing education services, the language in the Act is more prescriptive. Therefore, in the case of a tie, the award must go to the educational institution, unless the organization does not pass the demonstrated performance test. Further, paragraph (e) is clarified in the final rule so that it is easier to read. Some questions were raised concerning instances where Statewide procurement policies call for awarding extra points to proposals received from such organizations as minority-business enterprises and women-owned businesses. If this is a State, SDA or SSG-wide policy, applicable to not only JTPA funds but other funds, the State, SDA or SSG may continue applying these policies to JTPA funds. If these policies apply only to JTPA funds, States, SDA's or SSG's may not continue applying these policies to JTPA funds. This is discussed in a new paragraph (l). Section 627.422(h) is redesignated as ยง627.422(k) and reiterates the Act's requirement that awards include appropriate amounts necessary for administration and supportive services (section 108(b)(5)). Several commenters felt that SDA's/SSG's should be allowed to continue making awards that do not include administrative funds. It is because of this practice that new language was included in the Amendments. In the past SDA's have indicated that, given the 15 percent limitation on administrative costs, they do not receive sufficient administrative funds to operate JTPA programs. It is equally difficult for other service providers to provide these same services when they are provided either an even lower level of or no administrative funds. Some commenters thought that the regulations, as written, will give service deliverers the right to claim whatever administrative costs they want. This is not the intent of the regulation. While the regulation does prevent an SDA from arbitrarily refusing to fund a service provider's administrative costs or from arbitrarily underfunding them, it creates no right in the service provider to demand any particular level or amount of administrative funding. The level of administrative funding to be covered by the agreement should be determined through negotiations. If either party is dissatisfied with the results of the negotiations, they should not sign the agreement. Such disagreements may be handled under State and local grievance procedures. Some commenters were concerned that awardees that fail to perform would argue that insufficient administrative funds were provided and, thus, were the cause of the failure. Because the agreement should be mutual, it should be difficult for an awardee to use this argument to excuse lack of performance. The Department does wish to note that it is inappropriate for the SDA to pre-determine that it will not provide administrative costs for awardees except in the payment of tuition or off-the-shelf prices. Others requested that guidance be given on how to determine appropriate amounts of administrative funds. The Department thinks this type of clarification is more appropriately provided at the State level.
