Yesterday, the sides met on their own. Today's meeting is being mediated by the United Nations. UNITA has already submitted a document to Alioune Blondin Beye calling for the replacement of the National Electoral Council [CNE] which conducted the September 1992 elections. A UNITA diplomatic source said this issue is not negotiable. UNITA has also asked for a more substantial and [words indistinct] role for the United Nations and a larger UNITA participation in the new CNE. Once this issue is dealt with, the negotiations will tackle national reconciliation, the future status of the president of UNITA -- the largest opposition party -- and the reciprocal return of property owned by the warring sides.
