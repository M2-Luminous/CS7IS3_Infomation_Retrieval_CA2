Correspondent Cha Man-sun has this report from Vienna: [Begin recording] Three inspectors conducted inspection activities in Yongbyon, North Korea, for the second day. Since yesterday, the inspection team has examined the counter and seals and whether the surveillance equipment installed at the 5-mw atomic reactor has been replaced. As a result, they have confirmed that the replacement of nuclear fuel rods has already begun. The inspection team, in particular, has focussed on examining, with the guidance of North Korean officials concerned, whether it is possible to take samples from the used nuclear fuels from the reactor in the course of the nuclear fuel rods being replaced. As a result, they judged that the replacement of nuclear fuel rods is now at an initial stage. It is learned that they have reported this to headquarters. Well-informed sources disclose that the inspection team has given its initial report saying that the replaced, used nuclear fuels are stored in such a way as to make it difficult to find out from which side of the reactor they have been taken out. The well-informed sources say that the persons in high-level policy-making authority at the IAEA are receiving, and are making a detailed analysis of, daily reports from the inspection team in North Korea on its inspection activities and the status of the replacement of nuclear fuel rods. They are discussing, the sources say, whether to seek solutions through future negotiations with the North. These sources predict that in view of the smooth progress of the consecutive two-day inspection activities, a scheduled, additional inspection of the radiochemical laboratory will also go smoothly.
