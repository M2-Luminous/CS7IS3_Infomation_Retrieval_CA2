The UN decision was made on Wednesday [5 January]. Belgium had put forward candidates to cover the remainder of General Briquemont's mandate, but did not insist. The custom is that this kind of succession is between officers of different nationalities. General Rose is the chief of staff of the British Army. He led the special commandos of the British Army during the Falklands War. He will face a degree of disquiet within the United Nations, voiced again yesterday by General Cot who is demanding "a very firm course" in the talks on Bosnia -- it is true that just yesterday evening, fierce fighting with heavy weapons and automatic weapons broke out in downtown Sarajevo and, according to blue helmet calculations, the city was hit by a total of 1,353 shells. Firmness? Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix shares this view. We questioned him on the reasons for General Briquemont's withdrawal. [Delcroix] He is really exhausted, it is a physical reason. That was true by mid-December. I understand him. Anybody who has visited Bosnia and Sarajevo can see that it is difficult to live and sleep there. General Briquemont thinks that you have to be in good shape to make good decisions. And he thinks that he is no longer in good shape. [Riche] The United Nations did not intervene and request his departure? Did the general's very critical statements not have an effect? [Delcroix] No, not at all. I have never received any such request from the United Nations. If the United Nations had had problems, it would have been its place to request his withdrawal. I am in favor of more freedom of speech for the military. I see nothing very bad in General Briquemont's criticisms. He is on the ground, he sees what is happening every day: His opinion is of interest to everybody, even if it is not always pleasant for politicians or diplomats. [Riche] But will this withdrawal not undermine the morale of the 1,000 Belgian soldiers still deployed over there? [Delcroix] There is no direct link. For instance, in Baranja, the situation is different and morale is good. But I admit that this withdrawal and General Briquemont's frustration may spark off a new process, provide an impetus for seeking other solutions. [Riche] There is increasing talk of a general withdrawal of the blue helmets. How can that be avoided? [Delcroix] I have always said in good time -- from the beginning of 1993 -- that some prospect was necessary in this military mission. Our soldiers have been there for two years. I do not think that we can continue like this for another two or three years. Something must change. The April or May deadline will be very important. It is now winter and we are still giving the negotiations a chance. But if no new prospect opens up in two or three months, we will think of other ways. [Riche] Some countries are considering purely and simply withdrawing. What would your choice be between a withdrawal or more offensive action on the ground? [Delcroix] We cannot all leave this country and give the warring sides the opportunity to "solve" their problem in their way. That would be very inhuman. It would be a total failure. But I think that in two or three months' time, if nothing changes, we will have to consider more strictly military methods. But that could go hand in hand with a withdrawal of ground troops. We will not increase offensive military means and at the same time leave our people exposed over there. [Riche] Are you not afraid of shortly being confronted with the difficult decision of sending more Belgians to be killed for Bosnia? [Delcroix] Yes, that would be a very difficult choice. I know that public opinion is demanding that something should be done. Even if this impression prevails, it is wrong to think that we are not doing anything now. We have saved many lives and prevented many misfortunes in Baranja and in Bosnia. Moreover, the initial fault does not rest with the Belgian or other military, but with the local warring factions. It is also for them to find a solution. I sometimes think that people are too hard on the military. I am personally in favor of stepping up the threat. The warring sides must be told that we will react with increased means. That is the only language they understand over there.
