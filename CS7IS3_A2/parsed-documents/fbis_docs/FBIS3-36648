[Zhirinovskiy] When I think about Germany, whether during the day or during the night, then I feel respect and a certain affinity. My heart tells me that our peoples are very similar and belong together as friends. Reason tells me that long-term peace can be secured in Europe if both Germans and Russians want that and will not allow themselves to be set against each other. My understanding of history also tells me that the lesson that is to be drawn from two murderous wars in which the Germans and Russians inflicted horrific losses on each other can only be to return to traditional German-Russian friendship, which was a blessing for our peoples in all areas for hundreds of years. [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The media, especially in Germany, are overjoyed that criminal proceedings have been instituted against you in Russia for "war-mongering." [Zhirinovskiy] Some people filed reports with the authorities and there are, of course, forces that want to eliminate me. My friend Dr. Frey has had criminal proceedings instituted against him 600 times and has never been sentenced. I have done nothing wrong. The Russian people and the Russian Army know that I adhere to the law and that I serve the interests of the Russian people, its right to exist with all my strength. Gutter Journalism [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The press, radio, and television in Germany have been trying to outdo each other in a concerted campaign aimed at turning opinion against you. You are depicted as an enemy of Germany. [Zhirinovskiy] Over the past 50 years, Germany has seen many foreign politicians who have been anything but friends of the German people. The more some people stirred up hatred against Germany, the more humble and submissive was the response. I cannot recall one foreign politician who has thought or expressed himself about the Germans in a friendlier or warmer fashion than I. I do not agree with de Gaulle's words that "the Germans are poor bastards, because they have been ruined." However, I do get the impression that the brain-washing of re-education, which has been going on for almost 50 years, has caused psychological, even pathological changes in many Germans. For example, Mrs. Thatcher writes in her memoirs in an epic manner about how she and Mitterrand sought to prevent the unification of the Federal Republic and the GDR, and for some people in the FRG, they are considered prototypes of modern Germany's friends. However, when I talk of reaching agreement on a settlement of the East Prussia issue in a way that will be to the advantage of Germany and when I also say that history has not said its last word about the terrible injustice of the Oder-Neisse line, which I believe can be revised through peaceful negotiations, then I am portrayed as some evil demon from hell and a fanatical enemy of Germany. Is National Masochism Something Attractive? [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The media are really producing a surfeit.... [Zhirinovskiy] ....of gutter journalism. However, in the Russian parliamentary elections, which were held in December, every fourth person who cast a valid vote voted for me, and the Liberal Democrats, whom I lead, are by far the strongest party in Russia. The sick, fantastic stories that are being spread about me by the media outside Russia will not stop one single Russian from voting for me. In fact, it will have the opposite effect. The international media outside Russia can indeed poison the political climate, but they can in no way influence the course of things in Russia. The Russian people and the Russian Army are behind me, and I have become the strongest element in free elections. That is something that cannot be said of Brezhnev or Honecker, regardless of how much one may want to. Nevertheless, the West German media and West German politicians sang the praises of both of them -- men who wanted Germany to remain divided forever, and they thoroughly enjoyed continually dropping to their knees and making gestures of submission. Is that not strange? [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] It is indeed strange, but at the same time, it is indicative of the prevailing attitude of the media, which want to undermine German confidence through a one-sided approach to dealing with the past, by developing ideas of "collective responsibility" and "collective liability" that also apply to Germans who have not been born yet. [Zhirinovskiy] I do not understand how the great German people can accept that. Is national masochism that attractive? Why should such masochistic exercises apply only to one people on this planet, while the rest of the international community would not even dream of being prepared to make prisoners of themselves in a similar way? No One Can Be That Stupid From the very outset, I and my friend Dr. Frey agreed that we would not level accusations at each other concerning guilt and that we would trade no such charges regarding the past. Dr. Frey was born after the Nazi seizure of power and I was born after World War II. There are many horrific and difficult problems to be dealt with at the present time. We cannot change the past, but we can try to make the present better and to master the future. That entails a good German-Russian relationship in every respect. What I would also add to the relationship is a rapprochement in the sense of the Bismarckian Reinsurance Treaty. In my case, Germany's reinsurance treaty is Gerhard Frey. [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Much of the German media has sought to create the impression that at the joint news conference at the Duma on Wednesday of last week, there were all kinds of attacks against Germany. [Zhirinovskiy] As everyone knows, there exists a sincere friendship between me and Dr. Frey. We discussed all the issues that interest us in a spirit of harmony during Dr. Frey's visit to Moscow at my invitation from Tuesday to Thursday of last week. How stupid must one be to believe that Gerhard Frey, who has fought for the good of Germany all his life and suffered exceptional persecution as a result, would appear with me at news conference in Moscow or anywhere else and listen to or accept the slightest negative remark about the German people. There cannot be anyone that stupid on this planet! If there is an idiot who believes that anywhere, then he should seek treatment from a psychiatrist as quickly as possible. They Want Germany To Be Bound At the news conference, which lasted almost two hours and took place before dozens of TV crews and hundreds of journalists from all over the world, Dr. Frey and I staged a real fireworks display of pro-German projects and policies of the kind that has certainly never been seen at the U.S. Congress, the British House of Commons, or the French National Assembly. I have proposed a joint German-Russian project for the construction of a highway linking Berlin and Moscow via Koenigsberg [Kaliningrad], that German should become the principle foreign language taught throughout Russia, that our students should participate in large-scale exchange programs, and that there should be a free cultural exchange between our countries. I have proposed that Germany play the leading role in the extraction of our mineral wealth, in our industry, and in joint defense projects. [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] You always say in German and in Russian: Germans and Russians -- friends forever. You said that at the DVU [German People's Union] rallies and press conferences in 1992 and 1993, at the Liberal Democrats rallies and news conferences in 1992 and 1993, and now you have said so again. [Zhirinovskiy] If I perhaps said that 20 or 25 times at our joint news conference at the Duma last week, then that will make me mortal enemy number one for the anti-German media in Germany. There are evidently forces outside Germany who are interested in preventing German-Russian friendship by every possible means. Germany should be bound, and remain deprived of its full sovereignty. However, if the two greatest and strongest nations in Europe stand together as brothers, then security and peace are guaranteed. That is essentially so simple, so clear, so obvious, and irrefutable that anyone of goodwill must comprehend it. I said that just as clearly at the DVU rally in the Nibelungenhalle in Passau. There is a video of the rally -- "Passau '93: Germany Must Live!" -- which contains my entire speech. Anyone who listens to that speech and still doubts whether I am a great friend of Germany must be mad in the best case and is more probably an enemy of Germany. Con Men Without Scruples [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Our media are spreading all kinds of fantastic stories about how you want to address a small splinter group at the so-called European Congress in Cologne. [Zhirinovskiy] People all over the world want to jump onto the bandwagon now. Some unscrupulous con men tell press agencies and other media that I will attend some event organized by them. In accordance with current "political standards," the press does not take the trouble to consult my colleagues, but diligently spreads the false report. I would not deal with such people in my wildest dreams, to come to Cologne and so on. I have also ignored other invitations, some were for the middle of January. I have discussed a whole series of further, sometimes large-scale events organized by the Liberal Democrats and the DVU with Dr. Frey. [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Along with Dr. Frey, you laid flowers at the monument to those who died in the struggle against French imperialism in memory of our comradeship in arms and our national heroes in liberating Europe from Napoleon I. [Zhirinovskiy] We must recall the great periods in our common history and thus show Russians and Germans symbols for the present and the future. God has dictated that we be friends.
