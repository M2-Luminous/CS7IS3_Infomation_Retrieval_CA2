FR940504-0-00040 FR940504-0-00010 (d) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the Commission's rules in connection with their participation in the competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other applicable sanctions, to forfeiture of their upfront payment, down payment or full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions. ยง1.2110 Designated entities. (a) Designated entities are small businesses, businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women, and rural telephone companies. (b) Definitions. (1) Small businesses. Unless otherwise provided in rules governing specific services, a small business is an entity that, together with its affiliates, has no more than a $6 million net worth and, after federal income taxes (excluding any carry over losses), has no more than $2 million in annual profits each year for the previous two years. (2) Businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women. A business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is one in which minorities and/or women who are U.S. citizens have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and 50.1 percent controlling interest in the applicant. For applicants that are limited partnerships, the general partner either must be a minority and/or woman (or minorities and/or women) who is a U.S. citizen and owns at least 50.1 percent of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women who are U.S. citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on a fully-diluted basis; agreements such as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to control an entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. However, upon a demonstration that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority and female principals of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated entity, a designated entity may seek a waiver of the requirement that the equity of the minority and female principals must be calculated on a fully-diluted basis. The term minority includes individuals of African American, Hispanic-surnamed, American Eskimo, Aleut, American Indian and Asian American extraction. (3) Rural telephone companies. A rural telephone company is an independently owned and operated local exchange carrier with 50,000 access lines or fewer, and serving communities with 10,000 or fewer inhabitants.

Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant to ยง1.2104(g)(2). (2) Within five (5) business days of the grant of the license application of a winning bidder eligible for installment payments, the licensee shall pay another ten (10) percent of the high bid, thereby commencing the eligible licensee's installment payment plan. Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant to ยง1.2104(g)(2). (3) Upon grant of the license, the Commission will notify each eligible licensee of the terms of its installment payment plan. Such plans will:
