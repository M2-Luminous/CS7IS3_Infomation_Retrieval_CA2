It is to be laid down that relations between the Russian Federation Government or federal organs of executive authority empowered by it and the leaders of federal state enterprises will be regulated on the basis of contracts concluded in accordance with civil legislation. This provision comes into effect when contracts are concluded with the leaders of federal state enterpises after this edict comes into force, both with newly appointed leaders and with leaders whose labor contracts have expired. Labor contracts with leaders of federal state enterprises will not be resumed or extended. 2. It is to be laid down that the obligatory terms of the contract with leaders of federal state enterprises are: --duration of contract -- not less than three years; --amount of guaranteed recompense -- not less than 10 times the minimum monthly pay; --the enterprise leader's share of the enterprise's profit to be determined after the corresponding enterprise has settled with budgets at all levels; --amount of compensation payable to an enterprise leader if a contract is canceled early on the initiative of the Russian Federation Government or a federal organ of executive authority empowered by it; --amount of compensation for an enterprise leader and members of his family moving to another locality stipulated by the contract; --social guarantees for the enterprise leader and members of his family, including in the event of the death of the enterprise leader or his ceasing to be fit for work; --rights and duties of the enterprise leader in connection with the management of the enterprise, including the right to hire and fire enterprise personnel, delegate authority, and manage enterprise property; --enterprise leader reporting procedure; --procedure and terms of early cancelation of contract; --enterprise leader's liability for breach of contract, economic results of enterprise activity, and safekeeping and specific use of property, including material liability for damage caused to the enterprise as a result of the enterprise leader's actions or inaction. 3. It is to be laid down that representatives of the state in management organs of joint-stock companies (associations or other mixed-ownership forms of enterprise), whose holding (stock, share) is federally owned (hereinafter, companies), will perform their activities in the management organs of the aforesaid companies in accordance with the present edict and decisions of the Russian Federation Government and also of federal organs of executive authority or the Russian Federal Property Fund, on whose behalf they are acting in accordance with Russian Federation legislation. 4. The following can be appointed to represent the state in companies' management organs: --state employees -- on the basis of decisions by the Russian Federation president, Russian Federation Government, the relevant federal organs of executive authority, or the Russian Federal Property Fund; --other citizens of the Russian Federation (except those elected to representative organs of state authority or local self-government) -- on the basis of contracts to represent the interests of the state concluded in accordance with civil legislation. Contracts with Russian Federation citizens to represent state interests will be concluded by the Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State Property, the Russian Federal Property Fund, or their territorial organs and must incorporate: --the term of the contract and the procedure for its early cancelation; --the amount of recompense to be received by the representative of the state; --the terms of material liability for breaching the terms of the contract to represent state interests. Contracts to represent state interests in management organs of joint-stock companies (associations and other mixed-ownership forms of enterprise, whose holding (stock, share) is federally owned, are to be registered at justice organs. 5. State representatives in companies' management organs are obliged to agree in writing with federal organs of executive authority or the Russian Federal Property Fund on whose behalf they are acting: --draft decisions of companies' management organs, which they will be submitting and supporting; --their future vote on draft decisions proposed by other members of companies' management organs. 6. Draft decisions and voting on draft decisions on the following questions will be agreed in accordance with the present edict (if they fall within the terms of reference of the corresponding companies' management organs): --amendments and additions to the statutes of joint-stock companies (associations and other mixed-ownership forms of enterprise); --changes in the amount of compoany capital; --the appointment (election) of specific individuals to management organs and supervisory organs of the corresponding companies; --acquisition of credits that are more than 10 percent greater than the corresponding companies' net assets; --the sale and other transfer of real estate and also mortgaging of real estate; --companies' involvment in the creation of other enterprises (including setting up daughter enterprises) amd industrial finance groups. The Russian Federation Government can make it incumbent on state representatives to consult on draft decisions and on voting on draft decisions on other matters which fall within the terms of reference of the corresponding company management organs, but which are not provided for in the present edict. If there are several state representatives in a particular management organ, delegated by different federal organs of executive authority and the Russian Federal Property Fund, the common stance of these representatives will be determined beforehand, in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Russian Federation Government. 7. Any breach by state employees appointed as state representatives in company management organs of the established procedure for agreeing draft decisions and votes on draft decisions, and also votes that do not accord with the results of consultations or decisions by the Russian Federation Government and the relevant federal organs of executive authority will result in disciplinary action, even dismissal from state service. Similar breaches committed by state representatives in company management organs who are not state employees will result in action envisaged by the contract to represent the state's interests. State representatives in company management organs will also be liable for their actions in accordance with the company's statutes. 8. State representatives in company management organs will submit reports on the activities of the corresponding companies to the relevant federal organs of executive authority at least twice a year in the form prescribed by the Russian Federation Government. 9. It is to be laid down that in cases where all owners of enterprises conclude contracts with their leaders in accordance with civil legislation, the social security terms for enterprise leaders will be no worse than those they would have if concluding contracts in accordance with labor legislation. 10. It is recommended that organs of executive authority of the components of the Russian Federation apply the rules of the present edict when concluding contracts with leaders of state enterprises that are state-owned by the corresponding components of the Russian Federation. 11. The Russian Federation Government has three months to approve: --the procedure and form of accountability of leaders of federal state enterprises operating on the basis of contracts concluded in accordance with civil legislation; --the procedure and form of accountability of state representatives in management organs of joint-stock companies (associations and other mixed-ownership forms of enterprise), whose holding (stock, share) is federally owned; --model contracts to represent state interests in management organs of joint-stock companies (associations and other mixed-ownership forms of enterprise), whose holding (stock, share) is federally owned (depending on the specific sector and territory) and the procedure for concluding and registering contracts. 12.
