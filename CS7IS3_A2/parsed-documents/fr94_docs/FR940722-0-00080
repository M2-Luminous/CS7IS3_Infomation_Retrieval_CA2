FR940722-0-00080 FR940722-0-00018 The FHWA has added definitions of these two terms. Section 420.205␣Policy This section explains the FHWA's intent to allow States maximum flexibility and discretion in managing and directing their FHWA planning and research funded RD&T activities while ensuring proper utilization of Federal funds and avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort. Except for removal of paragraph (h), this section is unchanged from the NPRM. Paragraph (h) includes the nondiscrimination provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and DOT and FHWA implementing regulations. Most of this paragraph was redundant of §420.121(m), which applies to RD&T as well as planning programs. The citation to 23 CFR part 200 that was in this paragraph has been moved to §420.121(m). Section 420.207␣Conditions for Grant Approval This section outlines the conditions that a State must meet for approval of FHWA planning and research funds for its RD&T activities. Paragraph (b) has been revised to indicate that a State's work program ``may'' include a line item for the costs associated with a peer review of its RD&T program. The FHWA will establish criteria and develop and maintain a list of qualified individuals who will be available to serve on peer review teams. A requirement has been added to paragraph (b) providing that at least two members of the peer review team must be selected from the FHWA list. The last sentence in paragraph (c) has been rewritten to eliminate the impression that the peer review team is under the direction of the FHWA. Section 420.209␣ RD&T Work Program This section outlines the items that must be included in a State's work program and incorporates by reference §420.115 for approval and authorization procedures. The title of this section has been changed from ``State work program'' to ``RD&T work program'' since it includes provisions applicable to the RD&T program. A requirement to include a summary, listing the major items and estimated cost, has been added to this section. The summary will provide a quick overview of the content of a State's RD&T program. Section 420.211␣Eligibility of Costs This section indicates eligible costs for FHWA participation in RD&T activities and references §420.113 for other eligible costs. Paragraph (c) was revised to conform with §420.113(b). Section 420.213␣Certification Requirements This section provides the format for a State's certification indicating (1) State compliance with the requirements of this subpart; (2) the condition under which a new certification is required; and (3) the due date for the initial certification. Several commenters noted that some States may not be able to comply with the proposed January 1, 1995, certification date. The date for certification has been changed to June 30, 1995. In addition, a provision has been added that allows the FHWA Division Administrator to grant conditional approval of a State's RD&T management process for a State unable to achieve full compliance by June 30, 1995. A conditional approval would cite those areas of the State's management process that are deficient and that all deficiencies would need to be corrected by January 1, 1996.
