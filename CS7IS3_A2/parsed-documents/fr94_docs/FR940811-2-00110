FR940811-2-00110 FR940811-2-00066 5.7‚ê£Acquisition of Intellectual Property Rights The legality of transactions resulting in an actual or effective acquisition of intellectual property rights is analyzed under section 7 of the Clayton Act and sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 645 F.2d 1195, 1210 (2d Cir. 1981) (patents); United States v. Columbia Pictures Corp., 189 F. Supp. 153, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (copyrights). The Department will analyze such transactions as acquisitions of assets just as it does other asset acquisitions. When a license is non-exclusive, the exclusivity is temporary, or the acquisition is otherwise structured to allow the parties freedom to compete independently in related products, the Department will take these aspects of the arrangement into account, as it does in the case of other asset acquisitions and joint ventures. With respect to horizontal acquisitions, the Department will apply the analysis contained in the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines. The Department will evaluate the effects of an acquisition of intellectual property in affected technology, innovation, and goods markets. As described in section 4 of the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines, the Department takes into account integrative efficiencies that could not reasonably be achieved without the acquisition as well as any anticompetitive effects of the acquisition from the lessening of competition among existing technologies or goods or from the lessening of competition to develop new technologies. Example 10 Situation: Omega develops a new, patented pharmaceutical for the treatment of a particular disease. The only drug on the market approved for the treatment of this disease is sold by Zeta, which has invested large sums in advertising to achieve brand name recognition. Omega's patented drug has almost completed regulatory approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Omega has invested considerable sums in testing market acceptance for its new drug. However, rather than enter the market as a direct competitor of Zeta, Omega licenses to Zeta the exclusive right to manufacture and sell Omega's patented drug. Discussion: Assuming that Zeta would manufacture and sell Omega's patented drug, the relationship of Omega and Zeta is in part vertical, because Zeta would be a customer of Omega in the technology market. However, their relationship is also horizontal in part, because Omega is a likely potential competitor of Zeta in the relevant goods market as well as in the relevant technology market. Although the vertical aspects of this arrangement pose no threat to competition in this example, the horizontal aspects would require further analysis. The Department would evaluate Zeta's acquisition of Omega's patent rights as an acquisition of the assets of a likely potential competitor, using the methodology described in the Department's merger guidelines. The Department would consider the impact of the acquisition on market concentration, other factors that affect the likelihood that competition would be affected by the acquisition, and possible efficiency defenses. In this example, Zeta's market position prior to the acquisition as the only seller of a drug treatment of this disease makes it more likely that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects. 6. Enforcement of Invalid Intellectual Property Rights The Department may challenge the enforcement of invalid intellectual property rights as antitrust violations. The Supreme Court has held that enforcement of a patent obtained by fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office can violate section 2 of the Sherman Act if all the elements otherwise necessary to establish a section 2 monopolization charge are proved. Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172 (1965). Enforcement of a patent obtained by mere inequitable conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office, however, cannot be the basis of a section 2 claim, because inequitable conduct does not involve knowing and willful patent fraud. Argus Chemical Corp. v. Fibre Glass-Evercoat Co., 812 F.2d 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1987). An objectively baseless infringement action, brought in bad faith, when the complainant knows the intellectual property right to be invalid, may violate section 2 of the Sherman Act. See Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 113 S. Ct. 1920, 1928 (1993); Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc., 743 F.2d 1282, 1288&hyph;89 (9th Cir. 1984). cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1190 (1985) (patents); Handgards, Inc., v. Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 986, 992&hyph;96 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1025 (1980) (patents); CVD, Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 769 F.2d 842 (1st Cir. 1985) (trade secrets).
