In a speech marking the Exim Bank's official opening, Mr Chuan said the bank would provide financial services to the export sector, particularly those services not yet offered by other financial institutions. These could include medium- and long-term financing for some specific export products, export insurance and guarantees. New and small exporters in particular stand to benefit from the expanded services and additional sources of working capital. The Premier said the insurance service would increase exporters' confidence in expanding their markets. [passage omitted] The Government believes that on any issues Thailand's trading partners consider unfair, Thailand must listen and address them appropriately, the Premier said. "But we will not give in to unreasonable demands from any particular countries. Therefore any concessions we make will be in agreement with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade." By following this line, Thailand has left the Priority Foreign Country list and is now on a Priority Watch List. Under the latter, Washington cannot retaliate promptly; the worst it could do is return Thailand to PFC status, Mr Chuan said. Commenting on the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, he said the Government realises the importance of international trade regulations and the need for a central agency. Such an agency, he said, can be a haven for small countries such as Thailand in international trade negotiations. "Now that the GATT negotiation is complete the Government is determined to follow the GATT agreement closely. We will strictly abide by the rules and demand the same thing from other countries." [passage omitted] "Although we try to avoid any adverse consequences, sometimes we have to make sacrifices on some issues or else our trading partners can use it as an excuse to make trade retaliations which will cost us more." [passage omitted] Prime Minister Chuan recalled that when he attended the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group summit in Seattle last November, last year, he was determined to show the world that Thailand believed in the spirit of economic cooperation among Asia-Pacific countries on technology transfer, personnel development and investment in the region. The Government is also firmly committed to the success of AFTA the ASEAN Free Trade Area, he said. "We will not only pursue the policy of the preceding governments but will speed up the procedures so that AFTA can accomplish its objectives sooner. Moreover we will increase the number of products listed in AFTA cooperation, which we believe other member countries will agree with." [passage omitted]
