FR941107-1-00019 FR941107-1-00007 •Civil and administrative proceedings resulting from a designated person's involvement in mail fraud, wire fraud, and fraud in connection with activities related to a business entity; 28 28 Disclosure of fraud-related legal proceedings currently is limited to criminal fraud actions and to the types of proceedings listed in n.27, above, that involve fraud. •Civil and administrative actions relating to a designated person's breach of a fiduciary duty owed to a corporation, partnership, business trust or similar entity; 29 29 Disclosure currently is required if the breach of fiduciary duty resulted in one of the restrictions identified in n.27, above. •Administrative orders restricting a designated person's business practices; 30 30 Administrative restrictions on business practices currently must fall within one of the categories identified in n.27, above, before disclosure is required. •Disciplinary sanctions imposed against a designated person by securities and commodities self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''); and •Comparable foreign legal proceedings. 31 31 Current provisions do not distinguish between criminal and civil proceedings brought within the United States and those pursued in foreign jurisdictions. The proposals would make it clear that disclosure is required of any foreign criminal or civil proceeding if its domestic counterpart would be required to be disclosed and would add provisions requiring disclosure of foreign administrative and bankruptcy actions. Disclosure would be required for 10 years following the specified event, expanding the current five-year provision. The proposals would rescind the general provisions that currently permit disclosure to be omitted if the registrant believed that the information would be neither material to investors in evaluating the ability and integrity of management, nor to a voting or investment decision; provisions relating to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, however, would retain the materiality language. In addition, the provision limiting disclosure to administrative orders that restrict activities for periods of more than 60 days would be deleted. 32 32 The provisions of paragraphs (f) and (g) of Regulation S-K Item 401 would be consolidated into a single paragraph (f). The proposals also conform the requirements in various forms and schedules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Finally, the Commission is proposing to add legal proceedings disclosure to investment company registration statement forms. II. Background of Legal Proceedings Requirements Disclosure of information regarding legal proceedings involving directors, executive officers, control persons, promoters and others has been required in various filings under the federal securities laws for many years. In 1956, the Commission adopted the current provisions requiring participants in proxy contests involving the election or removal of directors to disclose criminal convictions (other than traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) that occurred within the past 10 years. 33 Since their adoption in 1968, large shareholder beneficial ownership reports 34 also have required disclosure of criminal convictions with respect to the person or persons filing the report. 35 33 Release No. 34&hyph;5276 (January 17, 1956) [21 FR 577]. This originally was adopted as a provision of Schedule 14B, and a summary of this information was required to be furnished in election contest proxy statements. In October 1992, the Commission eliminated the Schedule 14B filing requirement and moved the legal proceedings disclosure provision from that Schedule into Item 5(b)(1)(iii) of Schedule 14A. See Release No. 34&hyph;31326 (October 16, 1992) [57 FR 48276]. That provision currently requires disclosure of any criminal conviction of a ``participant'' in the election contest that has occurred in the last 10 years. 34 Schedule 13D. Release No. 34&hyph;8370 (July 30, 1968) [33 FR 11015]. 35 The ten year disclosure requirement originally found in the Schedule 13D was revised to a five-year requirement in 1977. Release No. 33&hyph;5808 (February 24, 1977) [42 FR 12342].
