Box 1787, Jefferson City, MO 65102, Telephone Number 314&hyph;636&hyph;7104; or Mr. Bob Sfreddo, Design Engineer, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, P.O. Box 270, Jefferson City, MO 65102, Telephone Number 314&hyph;751&hyph;2876. supplementary information: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve U.S. Route 65 in Carroll, Lafayette, and Saline Counties, Missouri. 1. The proposed improvement would involve the reconstruction of U.S. Route 65 from immediately south of Marshall to just north of Carrollton. The project would be approximately 54.7 kilometers (34 miles) long. Improvements in the corridor are considered necessary to (1) provide additional capacity in the U.S. Route 65 regional corridor between the Iowa and Arkansas state lines to accommodate increasing traffic, and (2) improve regional mobility and connections to major linkages within the corridor. The U.S. route 65 corridor is the only mid-state, continuous, north-south corridor across Missouri. This proposal also includes the replacement of a functionally obsolete bridge across the Missouri River. 2. Alternatives under consideration include (1) a ``no build'' option; (2) using alternative travel modes; (3) phased construction of a four-lane freeway, with fully controlled access, substantially parallel to the existing route; (4) phased construction of a four-lane freeway substantially parallel to the existing route on a new location; and (5) phased construction of a four-lane freeway in an alternative corridor between Carrollton and Marshall. 3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping process has been initiated with Federal, State, and local agencies. Formal agency and public scoping meetings will be held. In addition, public hearings will be held. Public notice will be given in advance of the date and time of each meeting. The draft EIS will be available prior to the public hearing for public review and comment. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Any comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHW or the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department at the address provided above. Issued on: May 25, 1994. Donald Neumann, Program Review Engineer, Jefferson City. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14183 filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M
