It is customary that such a conference is held in the country that at the moment chairs the G-7; however, this time the conference will be held in Poland. It will be the first conference of the economic ministers of the "seven" and states implementing reforms in a postsocialist country. [passage omitted] [Kujawska] Last year's balance of foreign trade ended up in a deficit. What is your evaluation of this phenomenon? [Podkanski] I believe that, at this point, we should separate two issues: foreign trade and the evaluation of its results, and the broadly understood transformations and social costs related to them. As far as Poland is concerned, 1993 was very unfavorable to the balance of foreign trade, which amounted to $2.3 billion. There were many reasons for this, both internal and external. The latter are related to the recession in the world. Right now, our economy needs capital and supply investments. There is also the problem of fiscal instruments that would regulate the economy in 1993. Until August 1993, the exchange-rate policy favored imports rather than exports because the rate of devaluation of the zloty was clearly slower than the devaluation rate of the U.S. dollar or the German mark, and even than the scale of inflation in Poland. Apart from all this, there were various external issues, linked to the difficult situation of most medium-sized and small companies and difficult access to commercial and operating credits. Adding to these problems was the issue of the so-called infrastructure of exports--guarantees, guarantees of insurances, promotion. I believe it is necessary to create a uniform, coherent, and clear system of promotion, which we strive to establish. These are also experiences we want to share with our partners of G-7 and E-10. [Kujawska] What are the relations between Poland and its southern neighbors, who are participants in this conference? [Podkanski] I would like to stress strongly that, even though the signature of the agreement on free trade within the Visegrad Group last year did not yield any spectacular results in the form of an increase in the trade volume, we can still state with satisfaction that this agreement curbed the rate of decrease in cooperation, including a commercial exchange, which has been observed since 1991. This goes for both the exchange of commodities and the disappearance of so-called investment and cooperation links, which was a natural reaction at the moment of passing to free-market settlements. I believe that today all of the states will agree to pass to the free-market system, and that the rules of the game of the free market should go hand in hand with the ability to take advantage of the technical, technological, and production potentials that are possessed. They should also go hand in hand with the presentation of a commodity offer that would take into account the balance of the possibilities and needs of the markets of our neighbors. The commodity exchange with our neighbors is favorable--for example, because of lower transportation costs. This supports the argument that we should first seek contact with our neighbors, and only then across the ocean. There is no doubt, however, that there are areas and industry branches that may find partners across the ocean as well--in South America, in Brazil, for instance. Recently, in talks with a delegation of this state, we found many very interesting undertakings that may be very important to both states in the future; one of them is the proposal made by Brazilian investors concerning Polish transshipment ports--for example, for Brazilian iron ore, which might be shipped from Polish ports to the Visegrad Group states. Thus, in this way, we are trying to facilitate the implementation of goals that G-7 and E-10 are also trying to achieve. [Kujawska] The conference is to serve all its participants who, in practice, are partners with each other. What would you, as the Polish foreign economic cooperation minister, like to achieve during this meeting? [Podkanski] I would like to achieve three goals. The first one concerns full and genuine knowledge about the desires and capabilities of our foreign partners as far as investing in Poland is concerned. On the other hand, we would like to present Poland, taking into account its geographic location, as a state in which it is advisable and in which it pays to invest money. I would also like our potential investors to see their chance to participate in ownership transformations that are going on in our country. Also, I would like them to see their chance in linking their interests to Polish investors--for example, in the privatization process. I also believe that the conference in Warsaw will help the other E-10 states attain the same goals. I also want to make our partners realize that the aim of Polish privatization is changing not the owner but the economic situation, reconstruction, and the modernization of Polish industry. This is important because of the fact that the road to membership in the European Union will be long and winding. However, these are all inevitable processes. A separate issue is a thorough and solid evaluation of trade development prospects in Europe and the world, as well as Poland's participation in the international division of labor and in the trade turnover of the E-10 states; the evaluation should also take into account the rules of the game laid out in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round and the recently established World Trade Organization. It is a matter of shaping new principles and new rules, as well as a new system of world trade. Such a meeting right now supplies the answer to any doubts and questions concerning Poland's activeness in this process and our joining the international structures. I would like to be certain after this meeting that there is a joint desire, a desire to cooperate, as well as to know where the common interests are concentrated; I would also like to know what the possibilities of providing systematic solutions to the various problems are, through appropriate legal, organizational, and financial solutions. There is no doubt that there are great differences in the scale of development that has been accomplished in individual states. [Kujawska] The Warsaw conference is the third one. At each of them, certain decisions were made. Have they been implemented, and how have the interested states benefited from them? [Podkanski] It will be the third meeting. However, it cannot be compared to any of the other meetings because each of them was very special; each of them had different values and contents, and, mainly, the range of problems was different. The present conference is the richest as far as its form and contents are concerned. At the request of the Polish party, a meeting of the presidents of foreign investment agencies of the E-10 states was organized; it was held during the deputy ministerial session in March of this year. There will also be an East-West business forum and a traditional "roundtable" for the ministers and business representatives of each state. The earlier meetings were some kind of inspiration and a proposal; the list of members and participants is still being extended. At the Tokyo meeting, it was decided that small and medium-size business in the E-10 states must be supported. After the meeting, the Japanese Government allocated some money for the model restructurization of one of the Polish state-run enterprises of the machine-building industry. This is supposed to help work out a model of proceedings that can be used in other countries. As I see it, this is most valuable because it serves to shape the awareness of those who are in power. Also, a model of cooperation between countries as well as principles of providing aid should be worked out. The Japanese Government is already prepared to consider the possibility of granting interesting credits to Poland--this is the information I received when Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy returned from Japan. This would be, then, a result of the previous visit. [passage omitted]
