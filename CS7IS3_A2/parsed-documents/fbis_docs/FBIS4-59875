It issued its resolutions and recommendations and the Juba declaration document. The closing session was addressed by Angelo Beda, deputy speaker of the Transitional National Assembly and chairman of the conference steering committee, who said that the Juba conference constitutes a confirmation of national unity, a call to end the conflict, a prop for ongoing peace efforts, and an amplification of the voice of the silent majority of the sons of the south. He stressed that the conference was a means of strengthening federal rule, the policy adopted by the national salvation resolution to rebuild the country. Mr. Beda said the blend of cultures and different dialects emerging during the conference confirmed the keenness of the sons of the country to strengthen national unity. Mr. Beda then read out the conference resolutions and recommendations, which broadly call for adherence to national unity and rejection of foreign interference aimed at weakening the country. The resolutions and recommendations condemned the desperate attempts by some southern factions to introduce proposals inconsistent with the views of the majority. The recommendations also stressed the need to establish just, permanent, and comprehensive peace; to speed up the end of the war; to adhere to the principles laid down by the national salvation revolution; to accept the federal system as a safe means of achieving national unity and to ensure effective participation in the process to ensure its success; and to establish a general authority to follow up the proceedings of the conference by steering the peace movement from within. Afterwards, Professor 'Abd-al-Rahman Abu Zayd, rapporteur of the conference steering committee, presented the Juba declaration document, which appeals to those bearing arms to respond to the voice of reason, to stop the fighting, to return to the mainstream of the nation, to participate in the reconstruction of a respected and honored Sudan, to restore development and stability in the south, and to support ongoing efforts to establish peace from within.
