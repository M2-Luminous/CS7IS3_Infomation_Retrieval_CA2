The visit, which was made at a delicate time when the United Nations was discussing economic sanctions on North Korea, drew extraordinary attention at home and abroad. As to Choe Kwang's China visit, which was different from the courtesy visits by the North Korean leadership, the local experts had a more-or-less vague assessment that North Korea may have wanted to maintain a close military cooperation with China while international tension was increasing. The head of the North Korean department of a major business group, who is well versed in North Korean affairs, said, "We understand that the two sides had an extensive exchange of views over the pending issues between the two countries regarding the nuclear issue." Choe Kwang is a person who is regarded as the No. 2 man in the North Korean military, whose position is to take the whole responsibility for military operations under the KPA supreme commander Kim Chong-il. In particular, he has been directly involved in purchasing the oil for military use, which is "the most important job" of the North Korean military. The sources of information of the Singaporean oil market, who are well versed in the oil supply of the Asian countries, have watched with interest Choe Kwang's moves over the last several years. The reason is that whenever Choe Kwang conducted "military diplomacy" with Iran and Southeast Asia, there was talk about oil supply for North Korea. A bigwig inter-Korean trade agent in Singapore keeping in touch with the North Korean leadership said in an interview: "It is certain that Choe Kwang discussed with China the problem of oil supply for the military." Another trade agent, who supplied Russian oil to North Korea through a Chinese intermediary, said that the North Korean military purchased oil for itself through independent channels different from those of the party and the Administration Council. The purpose of Choe Kwang's visit to China is considered to include the problem of oil supply in preparation for wartime. That the North Korean military purchased oil independently through various channels was an object of major concern to the local strategic experts. We are greatly interested in how much oil North Korea has been stockpiling for military use. Local experts estimate that North Korea must be stockpiling oil for military use that will last for one year in preparation for war, despite its severe oil shortage. However, according to the Southeast Asian oil sources, North Korea failed to sign a satisfactory oil supply contract not only with Iran but with Indonesia, with which North Korea persistently contracted in 1993. A U.S. oil expert demanding anonymity, in a telephone interview, said: "The oil the allied forces spent during the Gulf war was 300,000 barrels per day. North Korea may not have even the minimum stockpile it needs." (Al Troner), Singapore branch head of the U.S. oil journal PETROLEUM INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY, said: "I have not heard that North Korea is trying to purchase oil from an oil market." U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher revealed that economic sanctions against North Korea must, first of all, block the incoming flow of petroleum and foodstuffs. Most of the domestic experts have been showing skepticism by saying that there will be no effect in the economic sanctions against the North if China, which is providing petroleum and foodstuffs to North Korea, does not take part in the sanctions. The analysis that China holds the key to economic sanctions against the North is only based on government statistics by countries exchanging trade with North Korea such as China and Russia. Therefore, it is a mistake to have overestimated the "influence" China has in the North Korean overall trade. An expert in North Korean affairs from a private economic institute claimed: "Even if limited sanctions are taken against the North, they would be a big blow to the North Korean economy, which has been recording a negative growth for the past four years." He also said: "It has been known that the practical effectiveness of the economic sanctions against the North would depend on China's attitude. However, even if China does not participate in taking sanctions against the North, the effectiveness of the sanctions against the North would be great." As a basis for this, he pointed out that the ROK and Japan are important countries in earning foreign currency, and equipment and materials for heavy industry facilities in exporting North Korean weapons are from eastern Germany and Russia. Therefore, when it becomes impossible to change facilities, North Korea will suffer an enormous blow. According to statistics by the PRC Customs and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, North Korea imported 649,000 tonnes of grain from China and 177,000 tonnes of grain from Turkey in 1992. It is not in the statistics, but from 1991 to 1993, North Korea imported a large amount of Canadian and Australian grain through a trading company in New Jersey, United States. In September 1992, after concluding a contract under the name of a third country's company, North Korea brought in 70,000 tonnes of wheat from Australia. In January 1993, 280,000 tonnes of wheat were exported to North Korea from western Canada, and 30,966 tonnes and 25,000 tonnes were exported to North Korea in February, and March, respectively. These were not listed in the statistics of the governments of various countries because companies of various nationalities were involved in the purchase, shipping, and transportation. According to North Korea's 1993 economic index as announced by the Korea Bank, North Korea's GNP was $25 billion. Among the $25 billion, the total amount of trade was $2.64 billion occupying only 12.9 percent of the total GNP. (When considering official statistics that can be tallied), North Korea imported goods from China (34.8 percent), Japan (14.3 percent), and CIS (14.6 percent) in 1992. Also 58.2 percent of the overall export was to these three countries. The Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security analyzed: "Economic sanctions against the North would have a great effect if economic sanctions are taken against the North internationally, because imports and exports are concentrated on these countries." U.S. economist (Gerry Hufbower's) studies show that a mere 36 percent of the 103 instances of economic sanctions imposed from 1914 to 1983 were successful. However, the effect of economic sanctions is a relative concept. The meaning of "effect" will change depending on what political purposes to pursue in economic sanctions. Therefore, the political purposes of sanctions on North Korea must be clarified before the effect of such sanctions is discussed. It is not clear at present whether economic sanctions on North Korea are intended for the eventual collapse of the North Korean establishment or whether they are part of an attempt to pressure North Korea into another round of negotiations to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. Countries involved in sanctions on North Korea have different interests of their own. Major domestic businesses that have earnestly traded with North Korea have a keen interest in how sanctions will be imposed. North Korea team leaders of major general trading corporations say that what they want to know most are the timetable of the sanctions and details of the sanctions for each phase. The Samsung Economic Research Institute said that U.S.-led international economic sanctions can be imposed in one of three different ways. Experts say that limited sanctions involving the ROK, the United States, and Japan may likely be imposed under circumstances in which China is opposed to UN-led sanctions. They predict that the United States and North Korea may enter into negotiations again after economic sanctions, which are of strong political and symbolic significance, are imposed. Our government is of the position that if the United States decides on its action plan, irrespective of whether it be a UN-led sanction or a partial sanction, our government plans to map out its own sanction plan depending on the intensity of the U.S. sanction plan. A government source said that the "possibility is nil at present that we will take the initiative" to put an end to indirect North-South trade and ban contacts with North Koreans. North-South trade has recently increased, even though tensions have continuously intensified on the Korean peninsula because of the nuclear issue. The volume of trade between the North and South was $187 million (on a customs-clearance basis) last year, a 7.6 percent increase over 1992. The ROK is North Korea's fourth largest trading partner, after China, Japan, and Russia. ROK businesses are North Korea's "extremely good" trading partners. Based on their strategic policy of maintaining a "channel of dialogue" with North Korea, big business groups involved in trade with North Korea have given the best terms to North Korea even if they lose money. They have bought North Korean goods with cash advances and sold goods on credit. A Singaporean trading agent says: "North Korea has many unpaid bills in trade with ROK businesses. If sanctions are imposed, ROK businesses will not be able to receive the money." However, big business groups say that "we did not begin trade with North Korea to make profit in the first place." ROK businesses bought goods worth $178 million from North Korea last year. The investments for processing on commission, the trade of goods sold in third countries, and unreported deals were not unaccounted for in the National Unification Board statistics. The volume of North-South trade is much greater than what the government's official statistics show, even though the government has painstakingly turned a blind eye to this status. A man involved in trade with North Korea says: "It is no exaggeration to say that North Korea has bought oil and food from China with the foreign exchange which ROK business has `given' it." He also says that the "blow which an end to North-South trade will deal to North Korea will be enormous."
