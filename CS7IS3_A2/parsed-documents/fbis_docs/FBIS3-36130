The journalist asked Lominadze to comment on the Abkhaz issue which, it is supposed, will be one of the key issues at tomorrow's meeting. [Begin recording] [Lominadze] My attitude toward and point of view on Yeltsin's visit is positive. I shall say more: I am pinning definite hopes on it. First of all, any visit of such a high ranking leader, moreover an official one, is in itself an event. Second, we know how many official visits by Russian leaders there have been before and whatever the quality of our relations with Russia may be in future, there will still be a touch of offense among the Georgian people as -- I do not hold the Russian official authorities and personally the Russian president in high esteem. They helped the Abkhaz separatists with all they could, literally using all available means. I am sure that our relations will be normal. We have no other option. We are destined to be not only neighbors but genuine friends. It is our past, our common faith, community of culture, and links which have been maintained with Russia for centuries now. Therefore, although difficult, still a big step is being taken toward improving these relations and -- I am looking into the future -- Russia can and must play the most important role in resolving this [Abkhaz] issue. [Dekanosidze] Let us hope that tomorrow's official visit by Boris Yeltsin will give us cause to hope that at least one step forward will be taken toward resolving the Abkhaz issue. [Lominadze] Personally, I hope and am sure that this issue will have a certain backing, undoubtedly will have backing because when such high ranking leaders meet against the background of all those events they cannot but discuss and come to a unanimous decision to resolve the conflict between the Georgian and Abkhaz population in Abkhazia. I am sure that Russia's realistic policy will positively influence a solution to this issue, and personally I am sure that Russia's president wishes to resolve this issue. Yeltsin's visit is one of the most essential factors which, in my opinion, can settle the conflict positively. [end recording]
