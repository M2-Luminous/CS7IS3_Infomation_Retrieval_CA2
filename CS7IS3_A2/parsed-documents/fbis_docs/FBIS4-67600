Health Minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai said yesterday the AIDS/STD (sexually transmitted diseases) Control Division would be placed under the Health Division of the ministry. ``There will be seven medical officers manning the unit and at least one (medical officer) in each state,'' Lee said after presenting a RM100,000 cheque from the ministry to the Malaysian Council of NGO's (non-government organisations) on AIDS. ``Our aim is to make every level of society aware of the disease,'' he said. Lee said that based on worldwide trends, the number of AIDS cases was expected to increase but Malaysia should not contribute to the increase. He said that there were already 179 confirmed HIV carriers this year. ``Out of 96 people suffering from the disease, 63 people have died up to January this year,'' said Lee, adding that the number of HIV carriers now stood at 7,579. When asked whether the government would stop importing drugs from British-based firms, Lee said his ministry would abide by the Cabinet net decision. ``We will have to refer to our experts though on certain drugs which may not be available elsewhere,'' he said. He said that five or six companies with contracts worth RM600 million would be affected. Lee stressed however that the ongoing contract between Yeoh Tiong Lay Construction and a Bristish company to build 12 nucleus hospitals would be honoured.
