FR940606-0-00007 FR940606-0-00003 The response to this comment is that the NRC's proposed rule was directed to a specific and narrow issue_whether a potential requester with actual notice of an application should be able to delay filing a hearing request until the application is granted. The notice did not contemplate revising the rule to change the concept of making the receipt of actual notice the basis of the time for filing a hearing request. 2. Comment of Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy (OCRE) The second comment was from Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy (OCRE), which objected to the portion of the regulation that bars petitions filed more than 180 days after the NRC's grant of an application. OCRE asserted that it was conceivable that someone would not learn of a licensing action until after the passage of 180 days, and would by then, through no fault of his or her own, have lost all opportunity to request a hearing. OCRE's point, like Kerr-McGee's, goes beyond the scope of the quite narrow change that the NRC proposed. The Commission's notice made clear that the issue to be resolved was whether potential requesters with actual notice of an application for a particular licensing action were intended to have two bites at the apple, or should instead be required to file for a hearing at their earliest opportunity. The concept of a 180-day cutoff was never identified as being subject to reconsideration by the Commission. Having considered the comments received, and finding that neither of them suggests a flaw in the specific correction proposed in the rule, the Commission has determined that the following final rule should be promulgated. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this regulation is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150&hyph;0136. Regulatory Analysis The Nuclear Regulatory Commission prepared a brief regulatory analysis for the proposed rule. Neither of the commenters having discussed the regulatory analysis, the Commission has not considered it necessary to prepare a separate analysis of the final rule. Regulatory Flexibility Certification As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule sets forth the time frame within which a person other than an applicant must file a request for a hearing in a licensing proceeding held under the informal procedures set forth in 10 CFR part 2, subpart L. The rule does not impose any obligations on regulated entities that may fall within the definition of ``small entities'' as set forth in section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or within the definition of ``small business'' as found in section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, or within the small business size standards contained in 13 CFR part 121. Backfit Analysis This rule does not involve any new provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). Accordingly, no backfit analysis pursuant to 10 CFR 50.109(c) is required. List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 2 Administrative practice and procedure, Antitrust, Byproduct material, Classified information, Environmental protection, Nuclear materials, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Penalties, Sex discrimination, Source material, Special nuclear material, Waste treatment and disposal. For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is adopting the following amendments to 10 CFR part 2.
