Former President Fernando Collor de Mello and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf are included on the list. [passage omitted] In addition to Collor and Maluf, the list includes Rio de Janeiro Governor Nilo Batista and Deputy Cleto Falcao. Written next to the names of Collor and Maluf are entries indicating that they received donations for their 1989 electoral campaign. There are also documents indicating that donations were made for a rally of then candidate Paulo Maluf in Rio de Janeiro. Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf has denied the charge that the numbers game operators made donations for his electoral campaign. He vowed to press charges against Biscaia. [Begin recording] This is an individual who is hysterically trying to get into the limelight. He is just a hasty, irresponsible rascal. His charge is a lie. I have never received any help from anyone. I have put the case in the hands of criminal lawyer Enio de Bastos Barros, who will bring this irresponsible individual to court. [end recording] In a statement, Collor also denied any donation to his campaign by kingpins of the numbers game. The former president contends that he fought the numbers game during his tenure as governor of Alagoas State. He adds that he was already found not guilty in the inquiries made of his accounts during the impeachment process. He concludes by stating that his executioners have already testified to the fact that he has never received one single cent from the illegal game he tenaciously fought as governor. [passage omitted] Federal prosecutors who are participating in the Rio de Janeiro district attorney's investigations are increasingly convinced that the numbers game was nothing but a front for other much more lucrative businesses, such as arms smuggling and the international drug trade. The prosecutors were quite impressed by the volume of transactions maintained by numbers game operators with some South American countries, such as the ties numbers game kingpin Rodomiro Garcia maintained with one of the most notorious Paraguayan smugglers: Carlos Barreto Sarubbi [governor of Alto Parana Department]. Rodomiro Garcia and Barreto Sarubbi own a casino in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, across the border from Foz do Iguacu. Garcia also owns a large estate in Paraguay, approximately 10 km from the Brazilian border. Barreto also owns an airstrip. He has been charged by U.S. police with having used the airstrip for many years for arms smuggling and drug trafficking operations.
