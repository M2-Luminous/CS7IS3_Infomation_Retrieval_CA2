Di Montezemolo, 68, is currently apostolic delegate to Jerusalem and Jordan and pro-nuncio to Cyprus. Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said last month that the appointee would keep his other functions, as representative of the Vatican to the local churches, and would reside at the Franciscan community at Jaffa, near Tel Aviv. Born in Turin, di Montezemolo is a seasoned Vatican diplomat and was one of the drafters of the December 30 agreement with Israel. In a reciprocal move, Israel on Wednesday appointed Shmuel Hadas as its representative to the Holy See, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. The Vatican had opposed Israel's first choice, Rabbi David Rosen, suggesting it preferred a career diplomat for the post. Hadas was born in Argentina in 1931 and emigrated to Israel in 1954, settling in the Nir-Am kibbutz, before joining the foreign service ten years later. In 1986 he was appointed Israel's first ambassador to Spain. Since 1987, he has run the Foreign Ministry's Cultural and Scientific Affairs Department, doubling as adviser to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Israel and the Vatican have agreed to establish diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level within four months of last month's accord.
