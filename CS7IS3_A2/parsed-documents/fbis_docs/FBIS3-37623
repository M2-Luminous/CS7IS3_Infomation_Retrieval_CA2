Despite many agreements, from Sochi to Geneva, perfidiously violated by the Gudauta side, savage bloody orgies conducted by bandit units comprised of or hired by Abkhaz separatists, the so-called Confederation of the Caucasian Mountain Peoples and Cossacks still continue. With the excuse of fighting partisan forces, they are brutally exterminating the Georgian population in Gali Rayon. Dozens of villages and hundreds of houses have been burned down. Escaping from the persecutors, over 3,000 people have fled to the mountains. Of these, several hundred people froze and died from the cold and hunger. Mass killings that are being carried out with particular cruelty are accompanied by rape, dismemberment, burning, and so on. The situation in the whole of Georgia is so tense that processes may become unmanageable and irreversible. At present, 300,000 desperate refugees are able to take extreme and undesirable actions at any time and even to arm and go en masse to their homeland, Abkhazia [words indistinct]. Therefore, if urgent and decisive measures are not taken on the basis of the Russian-Georgian agreements, as well as the United Nations' fundamental documents, tragedy will be unavoidable and it may be followed by a new, more large-scale and bloody Caucasian war, which may also involve Russia. Someone must eventually bring an end to these bloody orgies by the extremely impertinent representatives of the separatists and Russian reactionary forces and their henchmen. Leaders of far and near abroad, and Russian leaders and members of parliament in particular, must know that having usurped a group of Abkhaz separatists in the autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, succeeded in provoking a war after thorough and long preparation. The dictatorship of Ardzinba's fascist clique is by no means the same as the Abkhaz people and, moreover, the whole multinational population of Abkhazia. The world community has given an unequivocal assessment of the separatists' activities, regarding them as genocide, ethnic cleansing, and a crime against humanity. All these barbaric actions are happening while the world civilization is flourishing and ideas of humanity, democracy, and human rights are expanding in advanced states. Highly esteemed sirs, the arrival in Georgia of an honorable delegation from the Russian Federation led by Boris Yeltsin and the signing of the historic treaty have engendered high hopes in the hearts of the whole multinational population of Georgia, especially the refugees exiled from their homes in Abkhazia who are suffering extreme hardship. The Council of Ministers of Abkhazia appeals to you, esteemed sirs, to take decisive and radical measures for an urgent peaceful settlement of the conflict between the Abkhazians and the Georgians at last, and have the genocide and ethnic cleansing by the Georgian population of Abkhazia stopped, as well as to remove the threat to the very existence of the Abkhaz nation whose genetic stock is on the brink of extinction. [Signed] The Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, Tbilisi
