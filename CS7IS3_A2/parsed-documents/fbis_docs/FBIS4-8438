FBIS4-8438 "dreeu072__a94010" FBIS-EEU-94-072-A Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Kozloduy Chief, Official Comment on Safety Kozloduy Chief, Official Comment on Safety AU1304200294 Sofia BTA in English 1753 GMT 13 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1304200294 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Kozloduy, April 13 (BTA) -- Jean-Pierre Delcasso, leader of a team of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), described as very fruitful his work together with operators of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant for the upgrading of the nuclear and operational safety of the older generating units. Mr. Delcasso called a news conference today at the end of his one-year mandate as WANO team leader. The team has been working here for two and a half years. It exercises technical and management supervision and shares its experience with Bulgarian operators. Summing up, Mr. Delcasso said Units One and Two had been revamped and their safety upgraded. The WANO team has helped sign an agreement between an engineering centre in Lyons and Energoproekt of Bulgaria. Contacts have been established between the Kozloduy Power Plant and Buget of France, as well as between the National Electricity Company and Electricite de France. In 1993 alone the latter provided 12 million French francs to the Kozloduy Plant and a further 8 million is to come. Expressing WANO's position, Mr. Delcasso said the Kozloduy Plant was good and safe, adding that much money would be needed to keep it in that condition. He called on the Bulgarian Government to provide finance for the power plant and to commit itself to its future and to the future of nuclear power engineering. In France, both the prime minister and the finance minister bear direct, even legal, responsibility if they fail to perform their duty concerning nuclear power plants, Mr. Delcasso said. He presented the new team leader, Mr. Bernard Paillen, until now director of a nuclear power plant in Normandy. For his part Kozloduy chief Kozma Kuzmanov said: "The day will come soon when we will have to shut down the plant for lack of money needed for its safe operation." The plant got an average of 200 million leva a month from the exchequer in 1993, and a mere 180 million leva for the first quarter of this year, despite the deterioration of financial indicators: the strengthening of the dollar against the lev, a rise in inflation and the introduction of VAT [value-added tax]. The Kozloduy Plant is not ours, we are only employees here; it belongs to Bulgaria, it is the dynamo of Bulgaria's economy, a national asset, so that everybody should care for it, Mr. Kuzmanov told the news conference. He accused of demagoguery and terrorism "experts" who expressed faked concern in the press saying that the plant posed a danger. Kozloduy's operators and management bear the entire responsibility for its safety and they come in for a great deal of unfounded, tendentious and incompetent criticism. "We are tired of explaining that this is a normal power plant like any other power plant in the world. We have convinced the world of this but it will take more effort to do so in Bulgaria," Deputy Manager Ivan Ivanov said.
