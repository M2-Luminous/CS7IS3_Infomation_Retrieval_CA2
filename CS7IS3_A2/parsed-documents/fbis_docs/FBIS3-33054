He has resigned because he disagrees with the so-called La Cantuta Law, which has transferred the trial to a military court. It has been reported Bustamante confirmed his resignation when he learned of the sentences requested today for the people responsible for the disappearance of the students and professor. Meanwhile, international agencies reported today Bustamante's resignation has sparked a new political crisis in the Fujimori Government, because the La Cantuta case invalidates all the work Bustamante has carried out to improve Peru's image abroad. Bustamante is the fourth president of the Council of Ministers of this term. He is also chairman of the Commission for the Promotion of Peru's Image Abroad [Comision de Promocion de la Imagen de Peru en el Extranjero, Promperu] and industry, tourism, and integration minister. Bustamante and Economy Minister Jorge Camet have implemented an aggressive economic policy aimed at reestablishing economic ties with the developed countries. At the Industry Ministry it has been reported that Bustamante worked until noon today. The Government Palace has issued no official comment on the resignation of the Council of Ministers president.
