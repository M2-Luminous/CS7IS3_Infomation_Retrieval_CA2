Patrick, 37 and black, is a Harvard Law School graduate and a partner of the Boston firm Hill and Barlow. The Chicago native grew up in a poor and segregated neighborhood. He once worked at the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) legal defense and education fund on cases concerning voting rights and death penalty matters in the south. Patrick's nomination filled a spot left vacant for months after the withdrawal of Lani Guinier, Clinton's first choice for the post. Clinton abruptly withdrew Guinier's nomination after drawing criticism from some people in June, saying that he was surprised by the liberal bent to some of her writings on racial politics. The post has been vacant since Clinton took office on January 20, 1993. Wasting no time, conservatives called Patrick "a stealth Guinier." But, "he understands the law is a tool to help real people with real problems," Clinton said in today's Oval Office announcement, flanked by Attorney General Janet Reno and Vice President Al Gore. The Justice Department's civil rights division has protected civil liberties for "tens of millions of Americans," but there is still much more to be done, the U.S. President said.
