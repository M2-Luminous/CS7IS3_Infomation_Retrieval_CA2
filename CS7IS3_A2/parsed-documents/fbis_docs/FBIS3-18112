The magazine quotes planning papers by the German Chancellery, according to which a German administrator commissioned by the European Union is to rebuild the administration in the Croat-besieged Muslim stronghold of Mostar. German policemen and administrative officials could help the "emergency mayor." Under Bonn's plans, Bundeswehr medical officers are to operate the city's hospital and Bundeswehr engineers are to repair bridges and roads.
