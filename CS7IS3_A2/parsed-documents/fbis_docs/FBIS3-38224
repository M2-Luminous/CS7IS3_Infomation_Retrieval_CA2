About 160 municipal politicians expressed their concern about the imminent continuation of the construction of the Czech nuclear power plant in letters to the U.S. Congress. At the same time, the mayors contacted U.S. Ambassador Swanee Hunt and asked for an appointment for talks. Hunt was invited to acquaint herself about the nuclear concerns of the population during a visit to regions close to the border. Henry Gonzales, chairman of the Banking Committee of the U.S. Congress, was asked to brief Congress on the massive objections. Yesterday, Ernst Strasser, party secretary of the Lower Austrian Austrian People's Party called on all mayors, "independently of their political attitude," to oppose Temelin because no safety guarantees at all are given. Strasser said: "This is a concern of Lower Austria as a whole. In the event of a reactor accident in Temelin, the whole of eastern Austria will be affected." On Monday [31 January], about 50 activists of the environmental group Greenpeace protested against the Czech nuclear power plant Temelin by "occupying the roof" of the Austrian branch of the U.S. concern Westinghouse in Pasching near Linz and with banners saying "Stop Temelin" and "Waste-inghouse." Mothers with small children and demonstrators dressed as Death tried to hand over prior applications for damages amounting to 3 million schillings to Heinz Otto Fesselmann, managing director of Westinghouse in Linz. Heinz Hoegelsberger, manager of the antinuclear campaign of Greenpeace, stressed at the site of the events that the management does not want any contact with the activists. It denies responsibility, Hoegelsberger stressed.
