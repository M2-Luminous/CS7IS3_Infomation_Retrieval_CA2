Abstract: A statistically valid sample of homeowners who participated in the National Residential Radon Survey will be selected to participate in a follow-up study to measure year-long household exposure to radon. The EPA will use the results to validate the mathematical model used in preparing public information documents on radon such as the Citizen's Guide to Radon and the Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon. In addition, the results will be available in the Agency's national radon database and will be used in articles for publication in scientific journals. Homeowners will place radon detectors in specified locations in their homes, replace them quarterly for a year, and prepare a log of placement/replacement dates and times. EPA labs and contractors will analyze the detectors and provide homeowners with the results.
