The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this today at the Japanese Foreign Ministry. In the words of a member of the disarmament section at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, diplomats from Tokyo are conducting talks in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to decide what share each of the three republic is to receive of the $100 million Japan allocated to the CIS in April 1993 to facilitate the scrapping of nuclear weapons and the utilization of radioactive waste. The Japanese assistance is to be directed toward facilitating International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections at military and civilian nuclear facilities in these countries, and toward ensuring the safe storage of fissile materials. Specific programs will also envisage sending to the spot Japanese specialists from nuclear power stations and nuclear waste depositories, as well as teaching Japanese experience to local staff. Tokyo has decided to expedite the process of drafting outline agreements in view of the fact that Ukraine and Kazakhstan have recently adopted a constructive stand concerning accession to the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that Kiev has guaranteed the withdrawal of this type of weapons from its territory.
