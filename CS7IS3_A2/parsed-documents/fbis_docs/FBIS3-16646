In his opinion, the published ratings of politicians in which Luzhkov ranks third as a possible contender for the post of head of state "get on my nerves. At the same time, after 50 years everyone knows their own worth, and so do I. My philosophy, my goal, and the meaning of my career is to do something useful for Moscow and win people's respect in my job," the mayor of the capital said. Yu. Luzhkov makes no secret of his concern over the recent political amnesty, which, in his opinion, if it had to be carried out at all, should not have happened before 9 May, since the opposition's love of red-letter days is well-known. And he is alarmed not so much by the release of the 10 main organizers of the October bloodshed in Moscow as by the amnesty for the "20,000 to 100,000 other criminals." Luzhkov believes that a considerable number of them will head for the capital. And he does not rule out the possibility that the former Lefortovo inmates and amnestied criminals "have common interests which money could help to bring closer together." Luzhkov has no doubt that the opposition is well backed up by interested structures. "On 3-4 October the White House was being supported by gunmen and the members of fascist organizations. Big money was at work," he stated, referring to information from the special services. In order to ensure that the "victims" do not join forces to organize new unrest, the mayor intends to develop necessary measures at a session of the Moscow Anticrisis Committee. Luzhkov is also disappointed about the fact that the political amnesty has sown dissension and confusion among law-enforcement workers. "MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] staffers' ability to counteract the opposition is even weaker today than it was 3-4 October," he believes. The fall in morale is explained, in his opinion, by the fact that a considerable number of militia workers now doubt whether it was right for them to side with the president and the government. "It is as if we are numbering law-enforcement staffers among the analytical public. Yet these are people of direct action. Now they are saying among themselves that there was no point in their swimming against the tide, since nothing came of it -- either with the State Committee for the State of Emergency or with the organizers of the October coup." The fact that the militia is taking the same approach to the relationship between the presidential and opposition sides as it does to mafia investigations is even worse. The militia, the mayor said, sometimes deliberately delays such investigations by 15-20 minutes to allow criminal groupings the time to finish each other off, so that the militiamen can pick up the pieces on the battlefield later. The political consequences of the amnesty have thereby, in the mayor's opinion, been directly counter to the deputies' good intentions of bringing harmony to society. A destabilizing factor, Yuriy Luzhkov believes, is the smoldering polemic on the timing of the next presidential elections. He rebukes the press for, in his view, being excessively and prematurely interested in the subject: "Understand that it will not be any individual but the economic situation in the country that will predetermine the outcome of these elections," he exclaimed. Like Viktor Chernomyrdin, who believes that it would be "unethical" under the current president to be talking about the next election, Yuriy Luzhkov considers such talk "unpresidential and undermining the head of state's authority." "Let's put this subject to one side until 1996," was his appeal to the press. The mayor of Moscow refuted the numerous press claims that he had set up the Party of the Majority for his own future election campaign. "I have nothing to do with it, apart from the fact that, at the request of one of my friends, I signed a greetings message to the constituent congress of the Party of the Majority, since its aim of supporting the formation of a class of entrepreneurs does not run counter to my views," the mayor explained. According to him, of all our parties he has most sympathy for the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, whose leaders -- Gavriil Popov and Anatoliy Sobchak -- have the "most sensible ideas." But when asked if he agreed with Gavriil Popov's claim that the political amnesty was thought up by Boris Yeltsin himself to rally the democrats around the president, Luzhkov laughed: "The press sometimes flatters politicians by ascribing a farsignted strategy to them. Sometimes after such articles you start to respect yourself. In actual fact decisions are most often made without any particular plan in mind." And that is a pity. Incidentally, in Luzhkov's opinion the economic and social situation in Moscow at the moment is far more stable than in other parts of Russia. "For this reason not one of the 15 candidates from Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party who ran in Moscow made it to the State Duma," the mayor believes. At the same time, he is by no means complacent about the state of affairs in the capital, where the implementation of social programs is being held up owing to a lack of funds. Nor can you envy Sergey Dubinin, Russian Federation acting finance minister, about whom Yuriy Luzhkov was justifiably angry: "Last year alone Moscow paid 27 trillion rubles into the federal budget. Yet you can't get anything about of state coffers for the capital's needs. Dubinin states: `Subsidies? You won't get any!' And I ask him: How are we supposed to solve urgent problems and, in addition, maintain this huge machinery of the state organs located in Moscow? "Nobody is working on tax reform," Luzhkov continued. "Chaos reigns in the tax collection system. Yet the Russian Government has introduced a 3-percent tax to support high-tech enterprises. And this is a turnover tax, which in monetary terms is many times greater than any profits tax. And nobody explains how the state is spending value-added tax and other revenue -- otherwise they would have to admit the irrational spending of budget funds." This kind of tax policy, in Yuriy Luzhkov's opinion, "stifles enterprises and prevents them from expanding production." One other "headache" for the mayor is the import duties that have been introduced by the Russian Government: "I recently visited the food fair at the Izmaylovo complex. Trade was brisk and Moscow enterprises were actively concluding contracts with food suppliers from the provinces. The same day Central TV showed an interview with Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who stated: `We in the government are examining the question of raising the duty on imported foodstuffs by 20-30 percent.' The next day agrarians at the fair stopped signing contracts, referring to the fact that they would need to revise their prices -- in what direction is obvious. Nonetheless, the government carried out its intention. I am sure that import duties were raised to satisfy the agricultural lobby, and this decision will lead to a sharp increase in the prices not only of imported foodstuffs, but of Russian food too. First and foremost, it will have an impact on the cost of the basket of consumer goods for residents of large cities. And it is not clear why it is necessary to slow the influx of foreign food into the country. Have we really achieved surpluses? Disagreeing with this measure, the mayors of three major cities -- Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Yekaterinburg -- intend to send a protest to the government. "I am convinced that the state should be concerned about the unity of its goals rather than about resolving local tasks. As regards the agrarian sector we need to improve production forces and production relations, as the classics of Marxism-Leninism taught us, rather than trying to ensure that Russian foodstuffs are competitive by cranking up the prices of imports. Otherwise the countryside's problems will again be resolved at the cities' expense." Luzhkov has been arguing about tax policy not only with the acting finance minister but with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin too. According to the mayor, he tried to persuade the premier that there is no point in increasing duties on foreign cars imported into the country. As was the case with duty on food imports, this measure, he believes, will only serve to boost car prices, but without in any way improving Russian car manufacture. "Duty should be increased on right-hand drive cars and cars more than 10 years old to prevent pollution and to stop Russia's car scrap heaps filling up" -- that was the argument he put to Chernomyrdin. When asked how the prime minister reacted, Yuriy Luzhkov countered with disarming frankness: "He adopted the previously planned decision of raising import duties." As we can see, the mayor of Moscow is fully immersed in economic concerns. He made a point of stressing his reluctance to play politics. "We need to get creative processes going and start work. Then the opposition will retreat," Luzhkov said.
