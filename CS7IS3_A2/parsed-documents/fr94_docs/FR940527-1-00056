FR940527-1-00056 FR940527-1-00014 Hospital-Specific Alternatives 10 Nearest Neighbors_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of its 10 nearest neighbors, or all hospitals within a distance of 50 miles, if there are fewer than 10 other hospitals within 50 miles. One hundred ninety-five hospitals had no neighbor within 50 miles. These hospitals were assigned their own relative wage level, which is computed by comparing its own wages to the national average hourly wage. The same 195 hospitals also were assigned their ``own wage index'' for the 15 Nearest Neighbors and 20 Nearest Neighbors wage indexes. 10 Nearest Neighbors/Minimum of 2_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of its 10 nearest neighbors within 20 miles (with a minimum of at least 2 nearest neighbors within 20 miles or all hospitals within 35 miles). 15 Nearest Neighbors_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of its 15 nearest neighbors, or all hospitals within a distance of 50 miles if there are fewer than 15 other hospitals within 50 miles. 15 Nearest Neighbors/Minimum of 2_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of its 15 nearest neighbors within 20 miles (with a minimum of at least 2 nearest neighbors within 20 miles or all hospitals within 35 miles). 20 Nearest Neighbors_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of its 20 nearest neighbors, or all hospitals within 50 miles if there are fewer than 20 other hospitals within 50 miles. 20-Mile Radius_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of all its neighbors within a 20-mile radius. The 887 hospitals having no neighbor within 20 miles were assigned their own relative wage level. 25-Mile Radius_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of all its neighbors within a 25-mile radius. The 522 hospitals having no neighbor within 25 miles were assigned their own relative wage level. 30-Mile Radius_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of all its neighbors within a 30-mile radius. The 391 hospitals having no neighbor within 30 miles were assigned their own relative wage level. 35-Mile Radius_A wage index based on each hospital's own wage data and that of all its neighbors within a 35-mile radius. The 301 hospitals having no neighbor within 35 miles were assigned their own relative wage level. MSA-Based Alternatives These alternatives represent various subdivisions (by counties) of the current MSA/rural labor market area definitions. As such, all counties in each subdivided category need not be contiguous. Central-Outlying_A wage index in which each MSA is divided into 2 areas based on its central and outlying counties. Rural-Population_A wage index in which each Statewide rural area is divided into 2 distinct labor market areas, one including all counties with populations greater than 25,000 and one made up of counties with populations less than 25,000. Rural-Density_A wage index in which each Statewide rural area is divided into 2 areas if it contains counties with population densities greater and less than 35 persons per square mile. Rural-Population/Density_A wage index in which each Statewide rural area is divided into as many as 4 areas depending on whether populations are greater or less than 25,000 person and population densities are greater or less than 35 persons per square mile. Rural-Adjacent_A wage index in which each Statewide rural area is divided into 2 areas, one including all counties adjacent to an MSA and the other made up of counties not adjacent to an MSA. Rural-Population/Adjacent_A wage index in which each Statewide rural area is divided into as many as 4 areas depending on the adjacent/non-adjacent status of its non-MSA counties and whether county populations are greater or less than 25,000 persons.
