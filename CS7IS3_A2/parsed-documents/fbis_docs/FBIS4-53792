The plan calls for building an East-West express railway linking Seoul and Chongjin via Chongnyang-ri, Chunchon, Mt. Sorak, and Mt. Kumgang. The government reported this plan to the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] on 19 May. The "three-stage plan on building traffic networks in preparations for reunification" the government reported to the party that day calls for linking the severed roads and railways between Seoul and the DMZ in the first stage; building roads and railways in preparation for the North-South exchange of materials in the second stage; and building high-speed roads and railways after reunification in the third stage. The government and the DLP plan to hold joint meetings soon and discuss how to raise funds and other matters for building roads and railways linking the North and South. The first stage of this plan calls for renovating the National Road No. 1 linking Seoul and Panmunjom via Munsan as a preliminary step toward linking Seoul and Pyongyang. It also calls for expanding National Road No. 39 linking Seoul and Panmunjom via Pyokche, as a detour to Panmunjom. As a preliminary step toward building a Seoul-Wonsan line, it calls for expanding National Road No. 3 linking Seoul and Chorwon via Tongduchon and Yonchon and National Road No. 43 linking Seoul and Kimhwa via Pochon and Chorwon from two-lane roads to four-lane roads. As for the railway system, the plan calls for restoring the Munsan-Panmunjom line to link Seoul and Sinuiju. The second stage of the plan on building Seoul-Pyongyang links calls for expanding the Seoul-Kaesong road to a six-lane expressway and link this road to Seoul's outer beltway. It also calls for extending the Freedom Road to link Seoul and Pyongyang via Koyang, Munsan, and Kaesong. As for the Seoul-Wonsan road line, the plan calls for linking Seoul and Wonsan via Tongduchon, Yonchon, Chorwon, and Pyonggang. It also calls for extending National Road No. 43 to link Seoul and Pyonggang via Pochon, Chorwon, and Kimhwa. As for the railway system for the second stage, the plan calls for expanding the Seoul-Sinuiju Line to a double-track line or a quadruple-track line. The first two-track line for an electric train will link Seoul and Panmunjom via Munsan, and the second two-track line for an ordinary train will link Seoul and Pyongyang via Munsan, Panmunjom, and Kaesong. The plan also calls for expanding the Seoul-Wonsan railway line to a double-track line or a quadruple-track line. The first two-track line for an electric train will link Seoul and Chorwon via Uijongbu, and the second two-track line for an ordinary train will link Seoul and Pyonggang via Uijongbu and Panmunjom. The plan also calls for building an East-West electric railway line for tourists. This line will link Seoul and Mt. Kumgang via Chunchon and Mt. Sorak. The third stage of the plan calls for building a six-lane expressway linking Seoul and Nampo via Kimpo, Kanghwa, and Haeju. It also calls for expanding the four-lane National Road No. 3 to a six-lane expressway to link Seoul and Chongjin via Tongduchon, Yonchon, Chorwon, and Wonsan. As for the railway system, the plan calls for renovating the Seoul-Sinuiju railway line into a high-speed railway line and connect it to the Seoul-Pusan high-speed rail system. Then, Pusan and Sinuiju will be linked via Taegu, Taejon, Seoul, Pulgwang, Munsan, Kaesong, and Pyongyang. The Seoul-Wonsan railway line will link Seoul and Wonsan via Uijongbu, Panmunjom, and Pyonggang. And the East-West high-speed railway line will link Seoul and Chongjin via Chongnyang-ri, Chunchon, Mt. Sorak, Mt. Paektu, and Wonsan.
