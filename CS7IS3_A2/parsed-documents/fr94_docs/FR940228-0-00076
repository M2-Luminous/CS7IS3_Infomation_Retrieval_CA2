FR940228-0-00076 FR940228-0-00017 B. Implementation of Final Rule EPA intends to promulgate regulations that pose the least burden to the affected regulated community while protecting human health and the environment. Therefore, no change in reporting requirements or recordkeeping procedures from the October 26, 1988 rule is incorporated into this rule. The August 17, 1993 proposed rule included a requirement that UST owners self-certify for an extension and keep a record of the proposed compliance checklist on file for enforcement purposes. Based on a review of the comments and the rest of the administrative record for the proposal, the Agency has decided that this self-certification is unnecessary for implementing this rule and has therefore decided to delete the self-certification and recordkeeping requirement. C. Discussion of Options Proposed But Not Finalized for Petroleum Marketers and Local Governments As noted above, EPA received 58 comments on the August, 1993 proposed rule. Of the 34 comments received in support of a 1998 compliance deadline, 17 specifically supported an extension only for petroleum marketers. An additional seven comments were received in support of local governments, four for non-marketers (such as rental car companies, etc.), and one for Indian tribes. Five commenters supported an extension for all Category IV firms and local governments regardless of criteria, or not at all, concluding that a limited extension would be unfair to the entities not included in the 1998 compliance group. Twenty-one commenters were against any additional extension to 1998. Of the 21 comments which disagreed with the proposed extension, eight were provided by state agencies that administer UST regulatory or state fund programs. One commenter was neutral, neither agreeing or disagreeing with the proposed compliance date, and two additional comments addressed only the definition of rural. Commenters arguing for a 1998 compliance date for certain petroleum marketers and local governments stated that the additional time was needed to keep small businesses open. Several commenters said that compliance with financial responsibility was difficult in states without state assurance funds. In fact, of the commenters supporting a 1998 compliance date for one or more groups, 12 out of 35 were received from a state without a state assurance fund. In addition, some commenters said that insurance was not affordable, particularly when tanks have not been upgraded. Two commenters urged an extended compliance date in two states that plan to adopt a state assurance fund or loan program. One of those commenters felt that a 1996 compliance date would be acceptable since it would correspond to the date the state loan program plans to be operational. Another commenter noted that not all local governments can pass one of the four additional self-insurance mechanisms promulgated in February, 1993, and one additional commenter urged EPA to extend the financial responsibility compliance date for hospitals that use their tanks to fuel emergency generators. Several commenters arguing against an additional extension to 1998 for local governments and petroleum marketers stated that most of these owners were already in compliance due to state assurance funds. Several commenters also stated that an extension would not be fair to those owners already in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements. Others felt an extended compliance group to 1998 would incorrectly imply that the remaining technical compliance dates would be extended by EPA as well. Other commenters noted that the criteria included in the proposed rule were difficult to implement and would prove burdensome to states with regard to enforcement since different petroleum marketers and local governments would have different compliance dates. Other commenters feared that adoption of a 1998 deadline for certain gas stations and local governments would hurt the environment, since the requirement was necessary to ensure that money would be available to pay for cleanups. One commenter stated that previous compliance date extensions reduced the volume of business available to private insurers trying to create a market for UST insurance, thereby increasing the price. Another commenter echoed that sentiment, saying that previous extensions had stopped private mechanisms, such as insurance, from developing fully. Finally, several commenters state that it was appropriate to exclude non-marketers from any additional extension since sales of petroleum were not crucial to their operations.
