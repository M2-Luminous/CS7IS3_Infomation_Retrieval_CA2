The Distributor, a registered broker-dealer, serves as principal underwriter of the shares of each Applicant Fund. 3. Applicants seek relief to permit the Funds to offer multiple classes of shares that would differ only as set forth in condition 1 below. The additional classes may be subject to a FESC, a CDSC, a combination of both, or neither, and also may be subject to Plan Fees. The Funds will not impose FESCs, CDSCs, or Plan Fees in excess of amounts permitted by article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the ``NASD''), as they may be amended from time to time. 4. Under the requested order, the Applicant Funds' currently outstanding shares will be designated ``Class A'' shares. Applicants contemplate selling a new class of shares (``Class B shares'') at net asset value without the imposition of a FESC at the time of purchase. Under the applicable rule 12b&hyph;1 plan, Class B shareholders initially will pay a shareholder services fee at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets attributable to Class B shares. The Class B shares would be subject to a CDSC, as further described below. Class B shares would not be issued in connection with investments of $1,000,000 or more, but rather such investors would be permitted to invest in Class A shares, which would not be subject to a CDSC. 5. Applicants contemplate that the Class B shares purchased by a shareholder automatically will convert to Class A shares of the same Fund after a certain holding period. Class B shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions will be considered held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares purchased by a shareholder converts to Class A shares, a pro rata share of the Class B shares in the sub-account also will convert to Class A shares. Applicants may suspend such conversion if an expert's opinion or Internal Revenue Service ruling that such conversion does not constitute a taxable event under Federal income tax law is not available. The conversion feature would benefit long-term Class B shareholders by relieving them of most of the burden of distribution expenses after the Distributor has been compensated. 6. Each service rendered to a specific class of shares will augment or replace, and not be duplicative of, any other service rendered to the class, or to the Fund. Expenses specific to a particular class of shares may be calculated and charged to the respective class. All other expenses incurred by a Fund will be allocated between the various classes based on the percentage of net assets of the class at the beginning of the day after adjusting for the prior day's capital share activity. Because of the differing class expenses and Plan Fees, the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on one class of shares of a Fund may be higher or lower than those of the other classes of shares of the same Fund. To the extent that a Fund has undistributed net income, the net asset value of the various classes of shares of the Fund may differ. 7. Applicants contemplate that any class of shares of a Fund may be exchanged for shares of the corresponding class of other Funds. Exchanges also are permitted into money market Funds managed by the Adviser. All exchanges will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. 8. Applicants also seek exemptive relief to permit the Funds to impose a CDSC on redemptions of Class B shares, and possibly other future classes of shares. The period during which the CDSC will apply (the ``CDSC period'') and the CDSC percentage will vary with the amount of the investment, and is expected to vary in the future depending on any Plan Fees, if any, imposed by a Fund with respect to the shares subject to the CDSC. The CDSC only would be imposed on shares issued on or after the date that the requested order is granted. In addition, any amendments to the CDSC will apply only when they are reflected in an amended and supplemented prospectus, and no such amendments adversely would affect shares issued prior to the effective date of such amendment. 9. The applicable CDSC will be calculated on the lesser of the net asset value at the time the shares were issued or redeemed. No CDSC will be imposed on amounts representing capital appreciation, shares or amounts representing shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions, or shares held for longer than the CDSC period. It will be assumed that redemptions will be made first of shares not subject to a CDSC in the order purchased, and then of shares subject to a CDSC in the order purchased. If a shareholder owns more than one class of shares and does not specify which shares are to be redeemed, shares not subject to a CDSC with the highest Plan Fees will be redeemed in full prior to any redemptions of shares not subject to a CDSC with lower Plan Fees. 10. Applicants intend to waive the CDSC on redemptions of shares (a) resulting from the exercise of a Fund's right to liquidate a shareholder's account whose aggregate net asset value is less than the effective minimum size set forth in the Fund's then-current prospectus, and (b) in the event of the death or disability of a shareholder within the meaning of section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provided that the shareholder held the shares at the time of death or initial determination of disability, and provided that the shareholder owned the shares as an individual or as a joint tenant with the right of survivorship or as a tenant-in-common.
