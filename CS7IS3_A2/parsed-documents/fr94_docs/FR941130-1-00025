FR941130-1-00025 FR941130-1-00005 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39&hyph;8630, (58 FR 53120, October 14, 1993) and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters Inc.: Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;02&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;8630. Applicability: Model 269A, 269A&hyph;1, 269B, 269C, and TH&hyph;55A series helicopters, with main rotor (M/R) drive shafts, part numbers (P/N) 269A5305&hyph;3 and 269A5305&hyph;11, except those M/R drive shafts having a serial number with a prefix of ``SZ'' or ``ZS'', installed, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent structural failure of the M/R drive shaft, separation of the M/R from the helicopter, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Inspect the M/R drive shaft for cracks, distortion, corrosion, or other surface damage, using either the radiographic inspection procedure or the non-destructive inspection procedure in accordance with Part I of Schweizer Service Bulletin B&hyph;255.1 (SB), dated February 1, 1993. Conduct this inspection at the time intervals and under the conditions stated in the following: (1) Inspect M/R drive shafts with serial numbers (S/N) S0001 through S1111, and any drive shaft without an ``S'' prefix on the S/N, having less than 1,100 hours time-in-service (TIS) on the effective date of this AD_ (i) At the next removal of the drive shaft; (ii) Within the next 600 hours TIS; (iii) Prior to attaining 1,200 hours total TIS; or (iv) Within 1 year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. (2) Inspect M/R drive shafts with S/N S0001 through S1111, and any drive shaft without an ``S'' prefix on the S/N with 1,100 hours or more TIS on the effective date of this AD_ (i) Within the next 100 hours TIS; or (ii) At the next removal of the drive shaft; or (iii) Within 1 year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. (3) Inspect M/R drive shafts with S/N S1112 and higher, regardless of the number of the total hours TIS on the effective date of this AD_ (i) Within the next 25 hours TIS; (ii) At the next removal of the drive shaft; or (iii) Within 1 year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. (4) Inspect the M/R drive shaft before further flight if M/R vibrations occur that cannot be corrected with track and balance procedures, or if M/R track and balance procedures are required more than once within a 25-hour TIS interval. (b) Inspect any replacement M/R drive shaft, except those that have a serial number with a prefix of ``SZ'' or ``ZS'', prior to installation in accordance with the procedures in Part I of the SB, dated February 1, 1993. (c) Replace any unairworthy M/R drive shaft with an airworthy M/R drive shaft before further flight. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York Aircraft Certification Office. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) only for those helicopters that do not exhibit M/R vibrations due to uncorrected out-of-track or out-of-balance conditions specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this AD. The special flight permit allows flight of the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on November 23, 1994. James D. Erickson, Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25912 Filed 11&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;P
