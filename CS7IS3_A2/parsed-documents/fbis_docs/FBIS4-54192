The poll, conducted nationwide by the YOMIURI SHIMBUN on Saturday and Sunday, showed 59 percent of respondents said there is no need to rush to dissolve the lower house to call a general election, while 31 percent wanted a lower house dissolution for a general election immediately after passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget. Asked which party they will vote for if a general election is held, 29 percent said they will vote for the LDP [Liberal democratic Party], 13 percent cited Shinseito, 8 percent preferred the Social Democratic Party [SDPJ], 5 percent supported New Party Sakigake and the Japan New Party [JNP], while 3 percent said they will vote for Komeito. The YOMIURI found a moderate recovery in the support rate for the LDP, which was 31 percent in June last year, while support for both the SDPJ and the JNP dropped by about half compared with figures registered last June. The respondents were equally divided over the issue of whether the next general election should be held under the current multiseat constituency system or the new election system approved under the package of political reform passed by the Diet. A new electoral map for single-seat constituencies has not been drawn up yet. The survey covered 2,091 people aged 20 and older.
