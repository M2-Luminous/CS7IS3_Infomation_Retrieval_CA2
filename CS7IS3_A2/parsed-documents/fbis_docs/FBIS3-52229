During his meetings in Tunis, he said, discussions will be held on the memorandum which some Palestinian personalities submitted to the Palestinian leadership on recent developments in the Palestinian arena. [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Shafi, in progress] ... the memorandum. President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] asked for a meeting with representatives of those who signed this memorandum to discuss it with them. [Jordan Television correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab] What are the outlines of this memorandum? ['Abd-al-Shafi] In fact, the memorandum is concerned with the situation which resulted from the Declaration of Principles. This situation poses serious threats to the Palestinians. This requires several things. It requires good readiness and preparation for the negotiations that will be held to interpret and implement the agreement and also for decisionmaking. In this context, we want to expand the basis of decisionmaking. [Dhiyab] Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, you were one of those who advocated Jordanian-Palestinian-Arab coordination. Are you now satisfied with the level of current coordination? ['Abd-al-Shafi] The principle of coordination was approved by everyone. All parties acknowledge that Middle East peace is an indivisible issue, and that there should be a unified Arab position. These are agreed issues. The foreign ministers' meetings which preceded each round of negotiations were held out of [Arab] coordination. It is true that the declaration of principles was reached away from the Arab brothers, which actually violated the principle of coordination. However, I hope that matters will proceed in the direction of coordination. This is an extremely important matter. [end recording]
