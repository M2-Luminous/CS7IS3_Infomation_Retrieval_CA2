Tokyo has no time to waste in settling growing economic frictions with the U.S., International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Kumagai said the basic framework of the Japan-U.S. ties as "a mutually important partner" remains unchanged. The only change is that the alliance has become "symmetrical" after the end of the Cold War structure, the trade minister said. The two countries have come to regard each other as "a competitor" as economic issues were brought under a spotlight in the absence of military and political issues as seen during the Cold War era, he explained. Under this relationship, "adjustment of economic interests" by both parties naturally gets "more conflicting and intense," Kumagai said. Kumagai confirmed that Japan-U.S. economic ties have become worst amid slow progress in opening Japan's markets and the unabated trade imbalance lopsidedly in favor of Tokyo. In order to mend the soured ties that got more conspicuous following the aborted trade "framework" talks in February, Tokyo should urgently devise a way to "assuage the U.S. frustration and the uneasiness," Kumagai said. But he said Japan should not seek a breakthrough via such ways as accepting a numerical target to gauge imports, noting the step is unacceptable in terms of principle. Kumagai said that for Japan to leave unattended its "strikingly big" current account surplus would not be in the interest of the U.S. and the global economy. He said the situation cannot be explained just by the widely used argument that the U.S. trade imbalance was attributed more to problems involved in its investment and savings balance. The biggest task facing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa after its first cabinet shakeup expected shortly is to formulate viable and effective plans both in macroeconomic and microeconomic fields, Kumagai said. Tokyo, if it fails to handle the trade issue with the U.S. properly, would most likely face "a barrage of sanctions," undermining the basic framework of the bilateral ties, Kumagai said. But he added Tokyo should not accept numerical targets by succumbing to "threat of sanctions" used by some advisers within the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton who believe in the "heterogeneity" of Japan from other major countries. "Both parties have already confirmed where the summit of the mountain is," he said. "Where to start climbing is what Japan and the U.S. are groping for at present." As one approach to break through what he terms "the deadlocked ties," the trade minister endorsed the recent proposal by the Foreign Ministry for setting nonbinding "effort goals" in macroeconomic fields. The proposal calls for reducing the ratio of Japan's current account surplus against gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.8 percent for fiscal 1994 from 3.1 percent estimated in the previous year. Kumagai said Tokyo should clarify its stance that the 2.8 percent figure is not anything like ones subject to sanctions in the event of the goal's failure to meet. On auto trade issues, one of the most contentious and thorniest points under the framework talks, Kumagai renewed a call for the Japanese auto industry to compile a voluntary plan to expand purchases of U.S.-made auto components and automobiles. The trade minister said he understands that the auto industry has reasons to reject unreasonable requests from U.S. and other foreign countries. But this does not mean the industry should always keep a posture of not listening to them from the beginning, he said. The private sector "grows old enough" to work out ways to settle trade problems on their own, he said. The positive stance shown on this point by the auto industry last week represents "a step forward" toward the ideal situation, he said. Kumagai said the trade ministry will also step up efforts to improve a situation in government procurement, citing the area as where the government has reach. On possible U.S. sanctions against Tokyo over cellular phone trade, Kumagai said Washington must be receiving "some signals" from Japan indicating its willingness to solve the problem. But he declined to comment on what kind of reaction the U.S. is showing to Japan in response to its signals ahead of the March 17 deadline for listing sanctions. Kumagai said the Hosokawa administration was able to "honor three of four bills" drawn by the previous government of Kiichi Miyazawa--the Uruguay Round, rice market opening and political reforms. The other issue of ways to spur the economy is what Hosokawa should do urgently now, he said. Formulation of economy-boosting measures containing the politically sensitive tax cuts and hikes is beyond control of bureaucrats, the trade minister said. These issues are exactly what would require a political decision, he added, indicating the government should map out a comprehensive tax reform within this year in line with the coalition accord.
