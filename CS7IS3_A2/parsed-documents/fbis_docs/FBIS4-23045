Simakov [deceased]; UDC678.724.32:678.046.32:536.6] [Abstract] During pressure casting of filled polymeric compositions at high temperatures and mechanical stress, physical chemical processes may take place which could alter the properties of the end product. The degree of change to the end product is directly proportional to the intensity of the above processes. In order to obtain filled materials having optimum characteristics, such as anti-friction, for example, it is necessary to determine the amount of filler needed to provide the given properties to the material, taking to account the mutual effects of the system components during handling. In the present work a study was made of the effects of molybdenum sulfide content on the characteristics of polyarylate DV compositions (copolymer of diphenylolpropane and a mixture of iso- and terephthalic acids in the ratio 1:0.5:0.5). It was demonstrated that the thermal properties of pressure cast samples of polyarylate DV filled with MoS[.sub]2[/] vary with the filler content. Materials containing 15 percent MoS[.sub]2[/] have optimum properties as manifested in higher heat resistance of the ester bond in the polymer owing to the formation of a coordination bond between the carbonyl group and the MoS[.sub]2[/], and an increase in the thermo-oxidative stability of the filler. Increasing the MoS[.sub]2[/] content to 25 percent or more activates the decomposition of the isopropylydine groups, making it possible to form grafted branched polymer structures.
