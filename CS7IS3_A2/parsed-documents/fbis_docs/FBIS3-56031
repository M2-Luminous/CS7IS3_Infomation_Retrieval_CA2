We hope that our proposal referring to the setting up of a confederation of republics in the Republic of Moldova will be received with understanding, a special appeal adopted by the most recent session of the Tiraspol Supreme Soviet says. The Dniester deputies are complaining about the fact that the Chisinau authorities do not wish to agree to settle the conflict in a mutually acceptable way, INFO-TASS mentions. The document also asks the Russian parliamentarians to recognize, under such circumstances, the Moldovan Dniester Republic as an independent and sovereign state that is a friend of Russia. Victor Puscasu, the deputy speaker of Moldova's Parliament, assessed that the text of the aforementioned appeal expresses a lack of willingness and the inability of the Tiraspol leaders to settle the Dniester problem at the negotiating table. The setting up of a federation or a confederation of states on the territory of the republic of Moldova is totally out of the question, Puscasu asserted. The Dniester problem can and has to be settled by keeping Moldova united, by granting a special juridical status to the rayons on the left bank of the Dniester River, Puscasu emphasized adding that this position is also supported by the UN, CSCE, and the leadership of Russia and other states. Today Mr. Slavomir Dabrova, the head of the CSCE mission to the Republic Moldova, taking the floor during the meeting of the Unified Control Commission that had been set up for the Dniester security zone, presented the final decision of the recent Rome meeting of the ministerial council of the CSCE member countries. The document recommends that the Dniester region should be granted a special juridical status, but remain a constituent part of the Republic of Moldova. The Tiraspol members of the unified commission reacted to Dabrova's statement with aloofness saying that the decisions of the CSCE missions are not mandatory for them, MOLDOVA-PRES news agency informs adding that by recent orders of the so-called Dniester Ministry of Interior, the representatives of the CSCE mission are prohibited to travel freely on the territory of the Dniester Republic, including the security zone instated on both banks of the Dniester River.
