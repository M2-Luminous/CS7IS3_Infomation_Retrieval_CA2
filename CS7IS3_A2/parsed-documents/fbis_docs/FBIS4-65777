In 1993, Netherlands companies invested a record amount of $754 million in the former east bloc countries. That is twice as much as in 1992 ($373 million) and substantially more than was invested in 1991 ($155 million) and 1990 ($7 million). These figures were released on Thursday [19 May] by accountants and consultants in Amsterdam. They were contained in a study carried out by KPMG Corporate Finance and its European desk regarding the attractiveness of Central and East Europe for Netherlands companies. Now, together with France, Netherlands is the fifth-ranking investor in the area. In all, Netherlands companies invested $1.3 billion in East Europe during the period 1990-1993. The biggest investor during this period was the United States, with $7.8 billion, followed by Germany ($7.2 billion), Italy ($3.4 billion), the United Kingdom ($1.9 billion), and both France and the Netherlands ($1.3 billion each). Together, over the period 1990-1993, foreign companies invested $26 billion in the East European countries. The lion's share of Netherlands investments was made by multinationals headquartered in the Netherlands. According to J.A.W.M. van Rooijen of KPMG Corporate Finance, their investment behaviour was shaped primarily by the race to beat the competition and profit from the low production costs and the new sales possibilities. For companies like Heineken, Unilever, and various supermarket chains, it was the latter argument that was decisive, van Rooijen believes. "Moreover, the study shows that consolidating market share was considered to be more important than generating quick profits," he said. Netherlands companies appear to have invested for the most part in Hungary and the Czech Republic. Of the total amount of $1.3 billion invested since 1990, $449 million was invested in the Czech Republic (and Slovakia, which until recently was united with it), and $317 million was pumped into Hungary. During the same period, Netherlanders invested $183 million in Poland and $340 million in the other East European countries, including Russia and Kazakhstan. [passage omitted]
