FBIS3-6789 "dreas055_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-055 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Mar 1994 South Korea U.S. Draft Resolution `Moderate' SK2203063294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0505 GMT 22 Mar 94 SK2203063294 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] New York, March 21 (YONHAP) -- The United Nations Security Council on Monday held permanent members' and informal general meetings to discuss how to handle the North Korean nuclear dispute. The United States presented a draft resolution on the issue to the council's other permanent member nations -- Britain, France, Russia and China. The draft resolution was relatively moderate, simply urging Pyongyang to accept additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), sources here said. The 15 members of the council were briefed on a resolution by the IAEA board of governors and decided to ask Hans Blix, director- general of the agency, to verbally report to the council this Thursday before he answers questions from council members. The IAEA board of governors decided Monday to refer the North Korean nuclear problem to the Security Council, which is empowered to impose sanctions. The Security Council is expected to adopt a resolution early next week, according to the sources. The Chinese did not show any reaction to the draft resolution presented by the United States, saying that the home government in Beijing must first be consulted. Since the draft resolution does not impose sanctions on North Korea but gives it the opportunity to avoid such action, the council is likely to adopt it, the sources said. The United States consulted the South Korean mission to the United Nations before drawing up the resolution, they noted. The United States decided to draft a rather moderate resolution to acknowledge that North Korea had honored at least part of an earlier agreement with Washington, an official at the South Korean mission said. "It is also designed to give North Korea time to reconsider (its decision)," he said. He added, "now is too early to discuss imposing sanctions on North Korea." North Korea refused to let IAEA experts conduct full checks at all seven declared nuclear sites earlier this month, and the IAEA on Monday asked the UN Security Council to intervene in the inspection dispute.
