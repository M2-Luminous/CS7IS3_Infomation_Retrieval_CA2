An official message released by the Social Communications Directorate of the Nicaraguan Presidency said that "actions like these, in addition to being strongly rejected by the Nicaraguan Government, constitute a flagrant violation of the basic principle of the right to life." Meanwhile, Tomas Borge, a member of the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) directorate, described the murder as "abominable," adding that Colosio was "a man with progressive views who stressed the need for profound democratic changes in Mexico." Bayardo Arce, another FSLN leader, also condemned Colosio's death, characterizing it as a loss for Mexico and the entire world. The tragic event has been widely covered by Nicaraguan newspapers.

Endara also issued a statement to ACAN-EFE which read: "May this painful incident in Mexico serve as a lesson to every nation, in the sense that the ballot is the only valid means of settling political differences." (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1500 GMT 24 Mar 94) Today, Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate of Panama's Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), rejected Colosio's assassination and said it may be part of a plan to destabilize the Mexican state. Perez, a personal friend of Colosio's, said that unless the law is changed, the PRI may be without a candidate which is absurd because PRI has won every election. The PRD candidate said Mexico may be on the path to destabilization following the assassination of "an extraordinary man who would definitely have been an excellent president for the Mexican people."
