This decision was made by the Russian-Japanese commission working in Vladivostok and Maritime Kray, which for 18 months has been closely involved in looking for ways to resolve the problems of the fleet's liquid radioactive waste. IZVESTIYA has already reported (11 May 1994) that two options were examined at previous stages of the commission's work. Apart from the barge, the possibility of constructing a shore-based reprocessing complex was also entertained. But independent experts from the British consulting firm Crown Enterprises have calculated that the "floating" option is both cheaper and more practical. It is well known that a number of bases on the coast of Maritime Kray are associated with the so-called waste disposal ship division of the Pacific Fleet. It is these ships which the barge will "service." Another reason why the floating complex was chosen to recycle liquid radioactive waste was the clear displeasure of the inhabitants of the city of Bolshoy Kamen, where the main base for breaking up nuclear submarines is located -- the "Zvezda" defense plant. This was the planned site of the shore-based complex. For the same reason of local discontent the tanker TNT-5 with hundreds of cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste on board was relocated at the end of May from Bolshoy Kamen to Pavlovskogo Bay, where it stands to this day. The skill with which military men have been able to move around a ship that was written off long ago and is overloaded with a politically dangerous cargo is amazing. After all, back in spring Maritime Kray Administration announced there was a danger of the old tanker sinking spontaneously and liquid radioactive waste discharging accidentally into the bay. Now however, after another stage of work by the Russian-Japanese commission, Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the kray committee for natural resources, announced that this notorious liquid radioactive waste is a very insignificant part of the radiation danger that actually exists on the kray's territory at the present time. And in announcing this, he cited the existing ban on shipping solid radioactive waste out of Maritime Kray via the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Nevertheless, despite all this, environmentally concerned Japan is still prepared to donate some of the money earmarked by its government for Russian disarmament to the plan for constructing a complex to process liquid radioactive waste. The commission calculates that three-four weeks will be spent finalizing the documentation and conditions of tender -- an international auction-cum-investors' meeting which will specify a firm that is capable of implementing the plan to construct the floating complex at a realistically low price and taking into account all Russian and international environmental safety requirements. Applications to participate in the tender have already been received from 20 firms and companies, mainly from Japan and the United States. Not one of these firms is Russian, unfortunately.
