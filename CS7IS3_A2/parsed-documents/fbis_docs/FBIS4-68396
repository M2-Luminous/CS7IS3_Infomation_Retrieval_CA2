Special exporters received their list yesterday, and they are supposed to select their financial agent by 10 April of this year. Otherwise, their export certificates could be suspended. [begin box] List of Authorized Banks 1) Alpha-Bank, 2) Vozrozhdeniye [Revival], 3) Inkombank [Foreign Commercial Bank], 4) Kredobank [Credit Bank], 5) Mezhkombank [Intercommercial Bank], 6) Mosbiznesbank [Moscow Business Bank], 7) MEHATEP [Interbranch and Scientific-Technical Program], 8) Mosstroybank [Moscow Construction Bank], 9) International Financial Company, 10) Nezavisimost [Independence], 11) United Export-Import Bank, 12) Stroyinvest [Building Invest], 13) Stolichnyy [Capital], 14) TOKOBANK, 15) Moscow City Commercial Bank of Industrial Construction Materials [end box] MFER justifies its decision with the need to strengthen and streamline control over the custody of the receipts of special exporters (only oil and oil products for the time being). For example, Vladimir Koshel, chief of the main administration for the protection of state interests of the MFER, declared that to control special exporters through a large number of banks was for him personally "a task beyond my strength," and, therefore, only several representatives among the major banks were assigned. The "fact of the concurrence of the banks to sign an agreement with the MFER was the criterion for selection." Of course, as it turned out, only these same 15 banks were acquainted with the text of the MFER agreement, which, as a result, ended up on the announced list. But, at the very least, this looks strange. For example, several major banks that specialize in servicing enterprises of the raw materials branches were not acquainted with MFER's intentions (and, consequently, they did not get on the cherished list) (among these are the Promstroybank [Industrial Construction Bank], International Moscow Bank, Imperial, Yugorskiy, Russian Credit, Surgutneftegaz [Surgut Oil and Gas], Yurga, Neftekhimbank [Oil and Chemical Bank], Zapsikombank [West Siberian Commercial Bank], and Tyumenpromstroybank [Tyumen Industrial Construction Bank]. Also absent from the list is the Vneshtorgbank [Foreign Trade Bank], which handles the accounts of almost 30 percent of the special exporters. At the same time, the little-known Nezavisimost Bank, which was only registered on 2 March of last year, was among the authorized banks, and also the Moscow Alpha Bank, which has a rather remote relationship to servicing special exporters (if, of course, it is not taken into account that Petr Aven, the chairman of the bank board, headed the MFER at one time). However, as Mr. Koshel assured a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the list of authorized banks is not final in nature. Thus, at the present time, allegedly, the Vneshtorgbank, the International Moscow Bank, and Imperial have already been added. Nevertheless, the exporters who are supposed to determine the selection of a financial agent do not know about this. There is also another problem. In the course of the next day or two, the clients that are "moving" are supposed to notify their partners about new payment requisitions and also pay off credit indebtedness to the banks that service them. The process of the shift of clients to other banks can also be complicated by the fact that frequently the following item is included in contracts on account servicing: The transfer is possible only after the complete payment of debt to the previous financing agent. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that the newly-fledged banks will not be able to observe one of the main normatives--sufficiency of capital. It is possible that it was this fact that troubled the Central Bank, with whom the announced list was not coordinated. In an interview with KOMMERSANT-DAILY, representatives of the bank, in particular, declared that, if the MFER decision will not be revised, "they will publicize facts on some of their so-called authorized banks." To which Mr. Koshel responded that Dmitriy Tulin, a deputy chairman of the Central Bank, who led the discussions with the MFER, "either did not understand the employees of the ministry, or he is doing the bidding of banks that are not among those that are authorized." However, as became known, the Central Bank in principle is not against the idea of limiting the circle of banks that work with special exporters. Moreover, according to some information, the Central Bank is actively working on the compilation of its own list of their financial agents. There is no doubt that differences exist among the departments, and also that the negligent attitude of the controlling structures toward legislation is stimulating yet another wave of bank wars for the right to service such a profitable clientele. In addition, there are a lot of volunteers for taking part in it and, probably, among the Russian officials, more and more of those will be found who give preference to one or another successful commercial structure. Understandably, the MFER made its decision under pressure no less than that which, in the words of Mr. Koshel, is being experienced today by Dmitriy Tulin. It is also understandable that lobbyist efforts of some banks will negate their appeals for a banking fraternity. [begin box] In the opinion of a high-ranking MFER employee, whom the KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent was able to contact, the adopted decision will not cause any serious damage to the development of exports and banking activity in Russia. All of the special exporters were notified ahead of time about the possibility of such a step by the government. As for the list of banks with whom the special exporters were authorized to interact, it, in the opinion of the MFER representative, is quite broad. Moreover, if any bank from among those that did not get on the list submits an application on the conduct of operations as a special exporter, the MFER will examine it without fail. The MFER representative also noted that the initiative for the adoption of the document did not come from the ministry, but from First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Oleg Soskovets. [end box] Commentary A reduction in the authorized banks that service the currency accounts of special exporters constitutes a long-standing dream of Russian currency controllers--everyone is trying to make life easier for himself. On 30 March at the last meeting of the governmental commission on current questions, Viktor Kunya, the head of the Federal Currency and Export Control Service, complained that the special exporters of oil each have several currency accounts even in Russian banks. But the MFER, cherishing a unified automated currency control system, at one time nurtured the idea of reducing the number of authorized bank holders of accounts of special exporters to 10, and a pertinent draft even existed of an MFER agreement with selected banks. Later, it is true, the necessity for such an agreement disappeared, inasmuch as special exporters now, "at their own desire" submit information to the MFER concerning the movement of currency in their own currency accounts (which allows the ministry to get the right that is not given it by the law on currency regulation and currency control). However, considering the decision of the aforementioned meeting of the commission on current questions, which recommended to the Central Bank to establish by 1 May the authorized banks that will be granted the exclusive right to conduct currency operations associated with the export of oil and oil products, the MFER, apparently, decided to return to its old "compilation" and submit to the Central Bank an already preliminarily worked out list of banks. The final decision, of course, rests with the Central Bank. In principle, the reduction in the number of authorized banks permitted to have the accounts of special exporters should be looked at in the overall context of reinforced currency control, which has been transformed, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has repeatedly written, into a key element of foreign economic regulation. In addition, the administrative pressure that Russian exporters have long since felt on themselves, is now also being applied to commercial banks as well. [Signed] Economic Policy Department
