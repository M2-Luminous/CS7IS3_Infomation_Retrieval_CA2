During this meeting, Jiang emphatically repeated: "Even if China continues to grow and becomes powerful in the future, it will never become a military threat." He thus refuted growing warnings by China's neighbors, who are now alarmed by its sharp increase in military spending, that the country will become a threat to them. Jiang also indicated he was looking forward to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China starting on 19 March, and said: "I want to discuss various issues with Prime Minister Hosokawa, too."
