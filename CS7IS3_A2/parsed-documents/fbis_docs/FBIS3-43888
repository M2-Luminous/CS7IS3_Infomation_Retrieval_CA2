FBIS3-43888 "drafr012_a_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-012 Document Type:Daily Report 19 January 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Political Parties on President's 15 Jan Message EA1901122094 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise in French 0430 GMT 19 Jan 94 EA1901122094 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise Language: French Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] The Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], Liberal Party [PL], Social Democrat Party [PSD], and Christian Democratic Party [PDC] political parties held a news conference at Umubano Meridien Hotel in Kigali yesterday. The news conference focused on the head of state's 15 January speech and also gave suggestions on preparations for the swearing in ceremony of members of parliament and members of the broad-based transitional government. In a press release, the political parties expressed satisfaction with the president of the Republic's decision to give a specific date for the swearing in of MP's and ministers. They requested that the protocol of the ceremonies must be agreed jointly between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and that the UN secretary general's special representative to Rwanda should be kept informed of it. The rest of the communique is read to us by Landuald Ndasingwa, first deputy chairman of the PL: [Begin recording] The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties state that the program of the swearing-in ceremony must be agreed between the Rwandan Government and the RPF and that the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda should be notified of it. The president of the Republic, for his part, should not intervene in the ceremonies. He should only intervene on a symbolic basis in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Arusha peace accord. The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties call once again on the president of the Republic to stop interfering in the selection of ministers of the broad-based transitional government. In fact, this prerogative is that of the prime minister designate in accordance with Article 18, Paragraph Two, and Article 52 of the protocol on power-sharing. It is therefore clear that the president of the Republic is not empowered to approve or reject names of ministers submitted to him by the prime minister for appointment after having selected them in consultation with the relevant authorities. On the establishment of the Transitional National Assembly, the MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties call on the president of the Republic to respect scrupulously the principle which he himself evoked in his 15 January message, and we quote him: The peace accord does not empower a person or body to remove from political bodies the prerogatives given to them by the same accord, end of quote. The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties hope that this time the president of the Republic will respect the program of the ceremony establishing the remaining transitional institutions. [passage omitted] The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties remind the president of the Republic that from the date he was sworn in on 5 January, he is expected to respect the provisions of Articles Four and 12 of the protocol on power-sharing which says that he no longer has the capacity to make decisions outside the broad-based transitional government and that the content of messages he addresses to the nation must first be approved by the Council of Ministers. [passage omitted] [end recording]
