Weizman's trip, which can be considered the first official trip by the head of the usurping Jerusalem regime to Turkey, follows trips by the Turkish foreign minister and the tourism minister to occupied Palestine. The desire for such frequent visits at this level was not confined to Turkish echelons; Tel Aviv officials also insist on such meetings and exchanges. But both sides seem to have their own reasons and justifications for such visits. Most political experts believe that in view of the trend of current events and efforts by most Arab governments to forge relations with the Zionist regime, Ankara seeks to accelerate the improvement of its relations with that regime and to exploit the trend of regional developments for its own good. Ever since rounds of talks have paved the way for a compromise between the regional governments and the Zionist regime, Turkey has sought to become a link. This is what Ankara's officials hope for and the more their relations with the Zionists improve, the more this hope is boosted. So, acquiring a false sense of popularity among the Arab governments involved in these talks has always been a reason for broadening its political relations with Tel Aviv's officials. Among the other reasons Turkish officials insist on expanding relations with the occupying Zionist regime is to elicit greater economic and political support from the West. This economic support is needed to solve Turkey's problems such as its rising budget deficit, the daily depreciation of its currency, and the proliferating losses by Turkish economic institutions. Lobbying for such support in the political arena is necessary to pander to the European government to end opposition to Ankara's wish to enter the EC's common market. Long have the Turks been groveling before various governments on the continent to enter the EC's common market. But because the entire Turkish population is Muslim, there has been opposition to this Turkish aspiration each time. So, Turkish officials now sense that broadening relations with Israel might be a major step toward creating change in the stances of European governments in this regard. Strengthening and broadening Turkey's relations with the Zionist regime--as was stated earlier--is also a Zionist wish. For quite some time, the wave of Islamism has proliferated in the region and perturbed the Zionists. Their officials have expressed their apprehension at this mounting trend of Islamism in the region and have initiated efforts to combat it. The intelligentsia believe that because of the presence of strong anti-Zionist sentiment among the Muslim nations in the region, especially among the Turkish Muslims, the despots of Jerusalem have, for quite some time, taken steps to mitigate such sensitivity. They feel that every development in expanding relations with Turkey or with any government in the Middle East will be construed as a step on the path toward achieving this objective. According to experts in regional affairs, using Turkey as a bridge for an effective presence in these strategic and geopolitical [preceding word in English] regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus is another reason for Tel Aviv's objective of expanding ties with Ankara. The Zionists are pursuing this particular strategy unilaterally with regard to Turkey. Informed observers say that there are 4,000 experts from the Zionist regime in the Central Asian republics engaged in economic, political, security, and propaganda activity. Naturally, expanding their activities demands that the Zionists have more extensive relations with the region's governments. Most experts in regional affairs believe that broadening Ankara-Tel Aviv relations will benefit the usurping Zionist regime more. They believe that by broadening relations, greater benefits will accrue more quickly to the Zionist regime and that what is being given to Ankara are empty promises in the form of probable economic assistance or the creation of an atmosphere conducive to gaining some eventual benefits from regional circumstances. All the Arab governments involved in talks with the occupying Jerusalem regime have constantly received similar promises from the Western countries to motivate them to expand relations with Tel Aviv. But at least the experience of the past few months of the PLO-Israel compromise and the way in which 'Arafat and his associates have been deceived by this accord should prove an instructive experience for those who, in the Islamic region of the Middle East, are being drawn to soar on their wing toward the despots of holy Jerusalem.
