Radioactive Mixed Waste Radioactive mixed wastes are those wastes that satisfy the definition of radioactive waste subject to the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) that also contain waste that is either listed as a hazardous waste in Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 261, or that exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics identified in subpart C of 40 CFR Part 261. Since the hazardous portions of the mixed waste are subject to RCRA, the land disposal restrictions apply. This means that the RCRA hazardous portion of all mixed waste must meet the appropriate treatment standards for all applicable waste codes before land disposal. Therefore, any radioactive waste mixed with organic TC wastes that are managed in non-CWA/non-CWA-equivalent/non-Class I SDWA facilities must meet the treatment standards being promulgated today for the TC wastes. The standards that were proposed for the TC wastes were also proposed for TC radioactive mixed wastes. Prior to this proposal, however, the Department of Energy (DOE) had expressed some concerns about meeting certain treatment standards and stated that they were collecting data from their facilities on mixed TC wastes. EPA stated in the proposed rule that, for the most part, the low concentrations of radioactive compounds should not interfere with the treatability of the hazardous constituents in the waste, and requested data on instances when the radioactivity prevented the waste from meeting the LDR treatment standard. One commenter suggested that EPA postpone its decision on appropriate methods for treating mixed waste until information currently being collected profiling commercially generated low- level radioactive mixed waste has been submitted and reviewed by EPA. This commenter claimed that the results of this profile contradict EPA's statement that radioactive material concentrations in mixed waste are low and should not interfere with the treatment of the mixed waste. Another commenter expressed the belief that the presence of radioactive components within the limits of operator exposure and safety should not interfere with the treatment of hazardous constituents in waste. Neither commenter submitted any data or other supporting information to substantiate their assertions regarding the treatability of radioactive mixed waste; therefore, EPA has decided to promulgate the standards for newly identified TC radioactive mixed wastes as proposed. However, if data is submitted to EPA indicating that the presence of radioactive components prevents a waste from meeting the LDR treatment standards, the Agency will evaluate the data and amend the standards as appropriate. The Agency's variance provisions of 40 CFR 268.44 can also be used to obtain alternate limits in the meantime. D.
