This was stated by Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the information and press department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a briefing today in connection with President Boris Yeltsin's edict to carry out measures to mark Russia's state border on its Estonian section before the Russian-Estonian treaty on the border is concluded. The edict by the Russian president, he noted, is aimed at creating conditions for applying the law on the border and defending Russia's political and economic interests. The lack of a physical marking of Russia's state border impedes the application of Russian legislative acts that deal with halting and punishing violations of the border and with the unsanctioned movement of various raw materials, including smuggling, across it, the Foreign Ministry representative said. The marking by the Russian side of the border, which already exists, does not contradict either the Helsinki Final Act, or the treaty on the fundamentals of inter-state relations between Russia and Estonia of 1991, Karasin stressed. He also expressed the hope that at the talks between the state delegations on border issues the Estonian side will occupy a more constructive position, which would open the way to concluding a treaty on the Russian-Estonian border.
