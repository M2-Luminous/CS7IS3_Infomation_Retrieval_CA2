He believes he has to learn a great deal and accumulate experience before becoming ready for nomination. Sakhray said this in an exclusive interview to Stavropol radio. A number of problems regarding the improvement of the economic, social and political situation in the multi-ethnic region on the northern Caucasus was raised in the interview. The settlement of the drawn-out Ingush-Ossetian conflict is quite realistic on a basis of agreements signed last year by plenipotentiary Ingush and Ossetian delegations, Shakhray believes. However, practical implementaion of these fundamental thoroughly-considered documents is yet far off. The Ministries of Defence and Interior of the Russian Federation have not yet fulfilled the provisions of the Russian president's decrees and Kislovodsk agreements regarding disarmament of unlawful units and confiscation of arms from both conflicting sides. At least armoured equipment should be urgently withdrawn from the zone of the conflict, Shakhray said. Sakhray also toughed upon Chechen problem. He said the experience on the development and signing of a treaty between Moscow and Tatarstan should be used for this.
