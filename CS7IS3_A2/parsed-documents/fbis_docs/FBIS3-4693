Since Prime Minister Hosokawa has stated the issue has now been taken back to the drawing board, he will not take the trouble to start a new cabinet." The SDPJ leader thus stated that an early cabinet reshuffle prior to the Diet approving the fiscal 1994 national budget bill has become difficult." Citing the reason, he said: "If the fiscal 1994 national budget bill is presented to the Diet on 4 March, policy speeches will be delivered on 7 March. It would be physically difficult to change cabinet members at that time. The cabinet reshuffle is a different argument." He added: "Representatives from three parties and one parliamentary group told the prime minister this was not the time to reshuffle the cabinet. It might be appropriate for a cabinet reshuffle to take place following passage of the budget bill or after the current ordinary Diet session closes." The SDPJ leader stressed that an agreement has not been reached among the ruling parties on the necessity of a cabinet reshuffle. Chairmen of the SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party, as well as a representative of the Democratic Reform Party, met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on 24 February to ask him to cautiously deal with the issue of an early cabinet reshuffle. They expressed growing opposition to prime minister's idea of forming a large, unified parliamentary group as well as to a cabinet reshuffle. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also attended the meeting. There is an intensifying confrontation among the ruling parties over the issue of a cabinet reshuffle. The SDPJ leader indicated it has become objectively difficult for the prime minister to carry out a cabinet reshuffle, probably because the leader judges the handling of the issue of ousting Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from the cabinet has now become more difficult under these circumstances.
