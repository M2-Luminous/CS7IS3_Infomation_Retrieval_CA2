"We are not demanding compensation, but effective international protection," the official news agency said. The offer was "an admission of complicity" on the part of Israeli officials in the February 25 massacre, in which a Jewish settler gunned down dozens of Arab worshippers in a mosque, the agency said. However, the PLO did not reject the compensation outright. Israeli officials said Monday the victims of the Hebron mosque massacre or their relatives would receive up to 70,000 dollars in compensation. The military administration would make the payments based on a sliding scale worked out by the Finance Ministry, starting at 8,500 dollars for a lightly wounded bachelor. Relatives of the 30 Palestinians killed, according to the army's toll, would receive the same amount as survivors who were seriously hurt in the attack. "The financial compensation...cannot settle the matter," WAFA said, adding that money "can never, no matter how large the amount, wipe away the blood, heal the wounds or conceal the tragedy." PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat returned to the PLO's Tunis headquarters from Cairo Monday, following talks with Egyptian officials and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's political advisor Jacques Neriya. Israeli diplomats in Cairo said Neria presented proposals aimed at clearing the way for resuming talks on implementing the September 13 accord on Palestinian self-rule. The PLO suspended the talks after the Hebron massacre. Palestinian sources in Tunis said 'Arafat was due to call a continuous session of his main Fatah faction to discuss progress made in the PLO's drive to secure international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. The PLO has also demanded the disarming of Jewish settlers and the dismantling of certain settlements. 'Arafat said Monday that negotiations could only resume once the UN Security Council had passed a resolution stipulating international protection for the Palestinians and the disarming of settlers.
