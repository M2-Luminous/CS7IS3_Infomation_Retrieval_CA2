The opening State Duma meeting will be held in the same premises on Tuesday. Taking part in today's session are 32 of the 35 deputies, elected by Muscovites on December 12, 1993. In his opening address, 61-year-old Vladimir Plotnikov, the Duma's elder, said that the main task today was to adopt a statute of Moscow, which will become "a constitution for Moscow as a constituent part of the Federation." He also voiced hope that the relatively small membership of the Duma would guarantee its cohesion. On Monday, deputies will discuss procedural matters, elect a speaker, and hear a speech by Konstantin Buravlev, the first vice-premier of Moscow's Government, who will discuss social and economic development and the budget for Moscow this year, report about temporary working groups, and announce an agenda for the next Duma session, scheduled for January 19.
