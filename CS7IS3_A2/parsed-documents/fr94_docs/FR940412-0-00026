SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 9, 1993, the Access Board published a notice in the Federal Register announcing that it planned to conduct research during fiscal year 1994 on whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas and their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians. 1 58 FR 37058. On the same day, the Access Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation (hereinafter referred to as ``the agencies'') published a joint notice of the proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register to suspend temporarily the requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools in the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) pending the research. 58 FR 37052. In issuing the NPRM, the agencies noted that blind persons and their organizations had taken differing positions regarding whether detectable warnings are needed at these locations; that persons with mobility impairments had expressed concern that installing detectable warnings on the entire length of curb ramps would adversely affect their ability to safely negotiate the sloped surfaces; and that a national association of retail stores had asserted that installing detectable warnings on curb ramps and curbless entranceways to the stores would pose a tripping hazard for their customers. The agencies stated in the NPRM that because of these potential safety issues they believed that it would be in the public interest to suspend temporarily the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at the locations noted above until the research provides additional information to address the issues. 1 Detectable warnings are a pattern of closely spaced, small truncated domes that are built in or applied to a walking surface to alert persons who are blind or who have low vision of hazards on a circulation path. 36 CFR Part 1191, Appendix A, Section 4.29.2. Research has shown that the truncated dome pattern is highly detectable both by cane and under foot. The truncated dome pattern has been used as a detectable warning along transit platform edges for over five years by the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in California and by the Metro-Dade Transit Agency in Florida. The truncated dome pattern has also been used in Great Britain, Japan, and other countries as a detectable warning.
