Cho Kun-hae, his wife and four others killed in a helicopter crash on Thursday lay in state, offering condolences to their bereaved families. He was accompanied by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong. Kim told Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Choe Tong-hwan and other Air Force leaders to make thorough preparations for the victims' funerals, which the government will hold as an Air Force rite. The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs has decided to pay the victims' bereaved families compensation totaling 280 million won (350,000 U.S. dollars). Gen. Cho's family will receive 109 million won, Maj. Kang Song-yun's (pilot) 51 million won, Capt. Yu Yong-chae's (co-pilot) 34 million won, Capt. Yi Sang-hun's (Gen. Cho's aide) 40 million won and Msgt. Chon Hae-won's (navigator) 46 million won. The government will honor them all, providing a decoration for Gen. Cho and special promotions for the other. Meanwhile, an Air Force team investigating the crash found the helicopter's voice recorder late Thursday night and turned it over to the National Scientific Investigation Institute for closer examination. Partially damaged, the recorder contains taped communications between the pilot and the flight control officer, which is expected to reveal the cause of the crash. The Air Force is considering two reasons for the crash: Engine failure due to poor maintenance and the pilot's failure to cope with a sudden weather change.
