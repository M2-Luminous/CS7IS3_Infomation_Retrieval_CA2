The majority of them have emerged in recent years. "Practice" requires the improvement of "theory": Lacunae in the legal base for the activity of parties, movements, associations, and such are obvious today. This is the subject of an article by Asylbek Abeldinov, member of the Central Election Commission of Kazakhstan and candidate of legal sciences. A most important sphere of public relations connected with realization of the right of the citizens to association is regulated by the Law "On Public Associations in the Kazakh SSR," which was adopted on 27 June 1991. But very appreciable changes have occurred in the recent period. A new statehood is taking shape, and the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan has been adopted, which, in turn, requires current legislation to be brought into line with the provisions of the constitution and the development and detailing of constitutional provisions with regard to the requirements of current social practice. A public-law mechanism of the realization of constitutional formulas should be created in order that on the one hand it really secure the rights and liberties of the citizen and, on the other, that the rights and liberties be realized inseparably from the obligations of the citizen, whose discharge is essential for the assurance of personal, public, and state interests. In the context of what has been set forth there should, it would seem, be work done on the preparation of revisions and addenda to the legislation regulating the activity of public associations. It should be specified here that we are not talking only about the specific above-mentioned law. The problem, I believe, encompasses quite a wide range of legislative instruments. We have to raise the question of civil and economic and administrative and criminal legislation also. A public association is an association of specific individuals which has arisen as the result of the voluntary, free, and conscious expression of the wishes of the citizens and which operates on the basis of the equality of its members, self-administration, legality, and glasnost. It should be added to this that an association is created on the basis of a community of interests of different individuals for the realization of their rights and liberties. The legal capacity of the public association as a legal entity arises only after the registration of its charter by an authorized official body in the procedure determined by legislation. In other words, a salient feature of the institution in question is that it is uniquely "impregnated" with the ideas of legality, is based on the rights of man and citizen, and should constantly ensure observance of the obligations of both the public association and its members. None of these components should either fall by the wayside or be broken in the overall "chain" of activity of both the public association and each of its members in the composition of the latter. But let us ponder: Are all these and other aspects connected with the functioning of the public associations regulated legislatively this scrupulously and in such broad envelopment. Perhaps not. Nor is this easy. Account should be taken of the following aspects. If a public association is a voluntary formation that has arisen as the result of the free expression of the wishes of the citizens united on the basis of a community of interests, then, logically, the citizens that are members of it delegate to the public association the right to control their behavior and actions in the name of the achievement of common goals and interests. Consequently, the purpose of the public association in this case is to ensure the formulation and determination of collective thought and collective actions within the framework of legality. It is this "status" that should be stimulated by the official structures. I consider essential in this connection the development in current legislation of the provision enshrined in Article 53 of the constitution, according to which "the state ensures observance of the rights and legitimate interests of public associations." But, as a study of the opinion of members of public associations shows, they do not always have a clear idea of what rights are accorded the public associations. According to Article 18 (it is called "Rights of public associations") of the law on public associations, their rights are enshrined in their charters. At the same time, on the other hand, this cannot be understood in the literal meaning of the word. In other words, the charters should enshrine only rights clearly defined by the legislator. Which precisely? In accordance with the said article of the law (I quote verbatim): "For realization of the purposes and tasks determined in the charters, program documents, and other acts the public associations shall freely disseminate information concerning their purposes and activity and, in the instances and in the procedure specified by legislation, enjoy also the following rights: "exercise legislative initiative in the person of their republic authorities (this right has become invalid inasmuch as it was not enshrined in the new constitution); "represent and defend the legitimate interests of their members (participants) in state and public bodies; "exercise other authority not conflicting with current legislation." But other articles of the said law contain different rights also. Thus Article 19 specifies the right of public associations to create in the procedure established by law for the purpose of achievement of the statutory tasks enterprises and financially autonomous organizations possessing the rights of legal entity. Article 20 lists in detail what the public associations may own. Article 21 enshrines their right to establish press organs and engage in publishing activity in accordance with legislation of the republic. Article 26 establishes the right of public associations to maintain international relations. The law lacks a precise definition of the obligations of public associations. I believe it would be expedient in the interests of the unambiguous understanding and application of the enshrined provisions to unite all that has been enumerated above, say, within the framework of one article entitled "Rights and obligations of public associations." Certain provisions of Article 11 of the law on public associations (it is called "Membership of (participation in) public associations") require the corresponding amplification or adjustment. Specifically, the provision of this article to the effect that collective members (the work force of enterprises, institutions, and organizations and citizens' associations) may, in addition to political parties and trade unions, take part in the activity of public associations would seem contentious, in my view. This provision is contrary, in my opinion, to the very essence of the public association inasmuch as it is created on the basis of the conscious expression of the wishes of specific individuals personally undertaking to comply with the requirements of the charter. The principle of the equality of the members of the association is violated also (what kind of equality can there be, you will agree, between the individual and the collective member). I cannot imagine what kind of "general" community of interests as a whole of the work force of this enterprise or institution or the other there could be. Especially if these are not political purposes and not professional interests (as we have already said, political parties and trade unions cannot by law have collective members). One public association's collective membership of another gives rise to questions also. In this case, logically, the members and organs of administration of the first association should be guided in their activity by both their own charter and the charter of the association they have joined as a collective member. It transpires here that for some individual members there will be "dual" requirements, rights and obligations, and so forth, so to speak, for others, not. There is formally once again a violation of the principle of the equality of individual members. In addition, the constitutional principle of the equality of the legal possibilities of public associations is violated also. But, as an analysis shows, there are many examples of public associations which have, indeed, registered in the procedure established by law uniting on a voluntary basis in unions of public associations. This is characteristic particularly of cultural and educational and artistic public associations. This right of the public associations is specified by Article 9 of the law. But clarification is required here, in my view. Inasmuch as the citizens' associations creating the union have their own registered charters, they should unite in a union as subjects of the latter. In other words, a union (new formation) should not interfere in the intra-statutory activity of its subjects, should not decide questions of membership in them, and so forth inasmuch as it is not individual members of different public associations that are uniting in a new one but associations of citizens as a whole that are uniting for the joint achievement of the common purposes of different associations. A union of associations does not have individual members directly: each association independently determines the procedure and conditions of membership in it and the rights and obligations of its members, that is, its "internal life." These clarifications should be made to the current law. It has to be acknowledged that our legislation absolutely does not regulate the procedure or conditions of the formation and functioning on the territory of the republic of structural subdivisions of international public (nongovernment) associations and the public associations of other states. I would like to share my thoughts in this connection. First. The head associations should be registered according to the whereabouts of their headquarters and, consequently, present to the authorized official body of Kazakhstan a copy of evidence (certificate) of registration of the charter (regulations) and the actual charter of this association certified in the established procedure. Second. The purposes and tasks of the activity of this association must not conflict with the constitution or legislation of our state. Third. An undertaking by the head of the diplomatic representation of the specific state to the effect that the activity of the structural subdivision of a public associations of this state will not be exercised to the detriment of the interests of the Republic of Kazakhstan is essential. Fourth. A structural subdivision of such associations should have its own charter adopted and registered in our state in accordance with the legislation of the latter. Fifth. Supervision of the activity of the structural subdivisions of such public associations should be exercised in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan. But the main condition I consider the following: The sponsors of the formation and leaders of the organs of administration of such structural subdivisions should be only citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the right of citizens of other states to participate in the work of such organizations not being excluded here. And how to determine the status of a public association: Will it be an international, republic, regional, or local association? Things are today reaching the point of absurdity. If the sponsors of the creation of a public association want to register its charter with a declaration of its republic status, the statutory activity of the citizens' association must, as Article 7 of the law declares, extend even prior to registration of its charter to the territory of all or a majority of oblasts of the republic. And according to Article 13, what is more, it is necessary within one month from the day that the charter is adopted (and the association is formed, consequently) to have submitted a declaration to the appropriate authorized official body with the enclosure of material confirming the territory of dissemination of the activity of the association and other material necessary for registration of the charter. This "severity" of legislative prescription hardly corresponds to the interests of the cause or a strengthening of legality in the activity of the public associations. Which is what I would like to propose. The authorized official body registering the charter of a public association should, evidently, determine the specific timeframe within which the association, after registration of its charter, is required to present to this body documents on the creation of its structural subdivisions on the territory of the corresponding oblasts and their registration in the procedure established by law. In the event of noncompliance with this condition, the same official body should cancel its decision on registration of the charter. The soundness of the current practice, when one and the same body, the Ministry of Justice, for example, undertakes the preliminary consultation on questions of the formation of public associations and itself performs the registration, would seem contentious, in my view. It would be more expedient for these to be different bodies. Some should hold the consultations, say, others, undertake the official registration of the charters of public associations. A practice has taken shape currently whereby the same specialists render advisory assistance and present the findings in respect to the documents for registration of the charters prepared on the basis of their advice. It would be expedient for the activity of political parties to be regulated by a special law. The point being that the current law on public associations determines merely the procedure and conditions of formation and also membership of political parties. I believe that this is insufficient inasmuch as the law should not only prohibit or authorize but regulate specific activity and adjust particular legal relationships. I would believe expedient in this connection the adoption of a public associations code with the inclusion in it of the laws on public associations, on freedom of religion and religious associations, and on the trade unions, which have already been adopted and which are operating, and also the proposed new law on political parties.
