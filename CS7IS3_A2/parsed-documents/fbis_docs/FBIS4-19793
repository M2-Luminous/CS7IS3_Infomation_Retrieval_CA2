[Vranitzky] Hello, Mr. Oberhauser. [Oberhauser] I begin with something that you have just experienced. Mr. Chancellor, what was the talk with President Clinton like, from your point of view? [Vranitzky] From my point of view and, I think, also from his point of view, it was a very good talk. We not only talked about Bosnia, we not only talked about Bosnia's reconstruction after the end of the disastrous war but we expressed common views and will also prepare something for this purpose. We talked about Partnership for Peace as a next step in Europe and noted that Austria has already tackled a number of activities before this idea came about. I told him that yesterday we were in close contact with Congress in order to discuss the problem of financing nuclear power plants in neighboring states once more and we moved on with a message that was not bad at all. In short, I also gave him advance notice of an invitation to make a stopover in Vienna on his way to the CSCE summit in Budapest at the end of the year. [Oberhauser] Have you already received an answer to that? [Vranitzky] Well, he said that he would like to accept this invitation if political developments in the United States permit it. This is an answer that one probably has to accept. [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, we are waiting here in suspense for his television speech on Bosnia. What is his attitude on this matter at the moment? [Vranitzky] Within the next hour -- if it takes that long at all -- you will hear his statements, and I would be grateful to you if you concentrated on Clinton's original statements and did not expect me to give you some sort of summary before the speech is actually made. [Oberhauser] After this talk, do you see any chance that progress will be made, that there is indeed a path toward peace in Bosnia? [Vranitzky] Mr. Oberhauser, I see such a chance, but I would have seen it also without this talk. However, my talk with Clinton has confirmed my view, because it is inconceivable that the international community ceases its efforts in view of Gorazde. He told me that he had talked to Mitterand and Chretien and with other NATO leaders and that he will continue to do so. This means, he will develop a large-scale diplomatic and political initiative. This is certainly indispensable and correct and necessary. [Oberhauser] How was your suggestion accepted to convene a conference for the reconstruction of Bosnia in Vienna? [Vranitzky] Positively. [Oberhauser] With approval? [Vranitzky] Yes, it was accepted with approval. [passage omitted]
