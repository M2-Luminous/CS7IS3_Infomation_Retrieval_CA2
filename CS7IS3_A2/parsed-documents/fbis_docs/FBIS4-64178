FBIS4-64178 "drsov104_u_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 Latvia Budget Deficit 12.88 Million Lats in First 4 Months Budget Deficit 12.88 Million Lats in First 4 Months WS3005122694 Tallinn BNS in English 1242 GMT 28 May 94 WS3005122694 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, May 28, BNS -- The national budget shortfall hit 12.88 million lats in the first four months of this year, Budget Minister Janis Platais told reporters Friday [27 May]. Between January and April, the budget earned 164.634 million lats, or 29.6 percent of the year's planned revenues, and spent 174.672 million lats, or 29.4 percent of the year's planned expenditure. The spendings exceeded incomes 10.04 million lats and the state treasury working capital increased 2.84 million lats. The consequent deficit is covered with 11.68 million lats in state treasury borrowings and 1.2 million lats in the Bank of Latvia credits. In April, incomes exceeded spendings 2.183 million lats what resulted in the reduction of the budget deficit from 12.22 million lats to 10.04 million lats, Platais said. The most successfull is the collection of sales, customs, income and social taxes. The collection of profit taxes takes place with difficulties, Platais noted. The debts for payments to the state budget have remained large because the majority of state-run enterprises faces economic hardships and their financial problems are unlikely to be resolved in the near future, the minister said. On May 1, taxpayers owed 27.288 million lats to the state budget. Compared with April, the amount of the debts increased 582,000 lats. From the total, 13,666,400 lats are debts for failed sales tax payments, 11,295,200 lats -- for unpaid profit taxes and 1,092,600 lats -- excise tax arrears. Platais mentioned JS Dauteks, state-operated RER enterprise and JS Recept-Holding as the largest debtors to the state budget. These enterprises blame their problems on their debtors and the problematic sales of products. The fluctuation of the unconvertible currency rates against the lat cause additional problems because the bulk of these enterprise's products are sold on the Eastern market. Platais also informed reporters that the wages of state budget employees would be raised to 28 lats per month in October.
