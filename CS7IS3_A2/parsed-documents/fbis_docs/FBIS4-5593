As of Monday only nine, or 25 percent, of the 38 ministries and agencies subject to downsizing had completed their plans. Among them were the Foreign Ministry and five other ministries whose reorganization plans were approved by the cabinet on Monday. The completed plans of the nine ministries and agencies call for a combined staff reduction of 301: Two by the prime minister's office, 15 by the Economic Planning Board, 52 by the Foreign Ministry, 33 by the Home Ministry, 43 by the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, nine by the Health and Social Affairs Ministry, four by the Labor Ministry, 28 by the Government Administration Ministry and 115 by the Korean National Railroad. Of the remaining 29 ministries and agencies, the Finance Ministry and 15 others have submitted their plans while the rest, including the Defense Ministry, have yet to do so. The National Unification Board, the Legislation Ministry, the National Statistical Office, the Patriots and Veterans Affairs Ministry, the Military Manpower Administration and the Korean Customs Administration have not yet prepared their plans, whereas the Environment Ministry, the National Tax Administration and the Korean Industrial Property Office submitted plans calling for a staff increase of 300 to 1,000 in spite of President Kim Yong-sam's streamlining policy. A Government Administration Ministry official said examination of the plans submitted by the ministries and agencies takes time. "But we're pressing them to complete their plans by the end of the month," he added.
