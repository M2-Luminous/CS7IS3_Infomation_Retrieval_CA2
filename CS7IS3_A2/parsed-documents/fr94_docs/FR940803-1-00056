FR940803-1-00056 FR940803-1-00011 A recent NTSB study, ``Heavy Vehicle Airbrake Performance,'' adopted April 29, 1992, report NTSB/SS&hyph;92/01 (PB 92&hyph;917003), analyzed information gathered over a 17-month period from selected brake-related accidents involving heavy trucks and buses, as well as data collected by NTSB staff during roadside inspections in 5 States. The report's findings highlighted the role of brake system components in certain vehicle instability accidents, and pointed out that many brake out-of-adjustment problems were due both to the small tolerance range and to a lack of proper brake maintenance. The NTSB recommended that the DOT, among other things: (1) Require air-braked vehicles to be equipped with visible adjustment indicators that will allow one person to check the level of adjustment (Recommendation H&hyph;92&hyph;50); (2) require automatic adjusters on vehicles equipped with airbrake systems (Recommendation H&hyph;92&hyph;51); and (3) encourage the installation of visible brake adjustment indicators on all vehicles equipped with air brake systems for easy detection of adjustment levels (Recommendation H&hyph;92&hyph;57). D. NHTSA Requirement for ABAs and Automatic Adjustment Indicators The FHWA strives to maintain consistency between the manufacturing standards for commercial motor vehicles contained in the NHTSA's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs), and the operations and maintenance regulations contained in the FMCSRs. On October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47793), the NHTSA issued a final rule amending FMVSS No. 105, Hydraulic Brake Systems, to require ABAs on motor vehicles equipped with hydraulic brake systems. The NHTSA also amended FMVSS No. 121, Air Brake Systems, to require ABAs on all air-braked motor vehicles and adjustment indicators on air-braked vehicles with external adjustment mechanisms. The effective dates are October 20, 1993, for the amendments to FMVSS No. 105 and October 20, 1994, for the amendments to FMVSS No. 121. While the NHTSA rulemaking requires manufacturers to equip new vehicles with ABAs in order to ensure brakes are in proper adjustment, it does not affect the readjustment limits used by the States in roadside inspections nor those required by the FHWA for periodic inspections (contained in Appendix G to the FMCSRs, ``Minimum Periodic Inspection Standards''). The reach of the NHTSA's regulatory authority extends only to vehicle manufacturers. The FMCSRs apply to employers, employees, and commercial motor vehicles which transport property or passengers in interstate commerce. E. Brake Adjustment Criteria The North American Uniform Driver-Vehicle Inspection Procedure (NAUDVIP) provides a standardized procedure used by States and local governments to inspect in-service CMVs. The NAUDVIP was developed by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA). The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance is an association of Federal, State, and Provincial officials responsible for the administration and enforcement of motor carrier safety laws in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, who work together to enhance commercial motor vehicle safety. As a part of the NAUDVIP, the CVSA specifies certain limits for pushrod travel. These limits, which are identical to the limits contained in Appendix G to the FMCSRs, ``Minimum Periodic Inspection Standards,'' have been set in consultation with motor carrier safety enforcement officials and brake manufacturers. Brakes at or beyond these limits are considered to be out of adjustment. The origin of the CVSA out-of-adjustment criteria can be traced back to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) inspection criteria established in the 1960's. The CHP readjustment limits were based on brake adjustment limits developed by the former Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (now the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, which no longer deals with heavy truck issues). These limits are approximately 80 percent of full brake chamber stroke. This is generally the point on the force versus stroke curve for a typical brake chamber where the brake force starts decreasing rapidly with increasing stroke. CVSA criteria regarding brake adjustment limits specify that a vehicle is to be placed out of service if 20 percent or more of its brakes are defective. A brake is considered defective if its adjustment is 1/4 inch (6.5 mm) or more beyond the readjustment limit. Two brakes at the readjustment limit or less than 1/4 inch beyond the readjustment limit are also considered one defective brake. For example, on a 5-axle combination vehicle with 10 brakes, 4 brakes at the readjustment limit would be considered as 2 defective brakes, and would also result in an out-of-service condition. Since the readjustment limits are based upon the characteristics of the brake chamber, the use of ABAs would not affect the brake chamber output force. Therefore, the FHWA believes that the current readjustment limits are appropriate for CMVs equipped with ABAs, as well as those currently equipped with MBAs. When properly installed and maintained, ABAs can thus help prevent sudden and unexpected loss of braking ability due to a loss of brake force resulting from excessive pushrod stroke. F. ABA Installation and Reliability As noted in the NHTSA's final rule, ABAs are currently being installed on a large percentage of newly-manufactured medium- and heavy-duty air-braked vehicles. Some fleets have been specifying ABAs for their vehicles for a number of years. However, NHTSA also noted that one major manufacturer and several smaller ones did not provide ABAs as standard equipment, and many purchasers did not order them as optional equipment. In addition, the majority of CMVs currently in operation are not equipped with ABAs.
