Podkolozin said that the 1,500-strong Russian contingent in the former Yugoslavia will be replaced by a new one in October. Under the contract, soldiers can stay in the war zone not longer than six months, officers -- a year. They may prolong their contracts for another six months if they wish so. Podkolozin also said that Russia paid off its 1.5 billion U.S. dollar debt to the United Nations by participating in U.N. peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. Russian peace-keepers oversee cease-fire, prevent illegal arms exports and control troop movement. Over two years of participation in the U.N. contingent in the former Yugoslavia five Russian soldiers were killed and 17 wounded. Russian soldiers in Yugoslavia receive 833 dollars a month, warrant officers 874-877 dollars and officers 915-1,008 dollars.
