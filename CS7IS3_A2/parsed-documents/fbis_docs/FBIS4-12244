In a statement after the meeting Musa said: Things are moving slowly; we hope progress will be achieved in the next few days. Musa explained that the slow pace is a result of some of the demands and the insistence on some points. The two sides, the Israelis and the Palestinians, are having difficulty agreeing on those things, he said. The foreign minister stressed that Egypt is ready to assist the two sides and do its best. We are closely watching the talks, he said. On today's explosion in an Israeli vehicle, where some people were killed, Musa said these incidents further complicate the current situation. He expressed the hope that all these things will be solved through negotiations and the signing of an agreement between the two sides. Musa hopes the Palestinians and the Israelis will sign the agreement before 13 April. Answering a question, the foreign minister stressed that the Palestinians are well organized, their positions on the disputed points are very clear, and they are ready to go forward and sign the agreement on 12 April if possible. Asked what he thinks of the entry of Palestinian police [to Gaza and Jericho] before the signing of the agreement, Musa said: If there is an agreement and an understanding between the parties, then why not? The foreign minister stressed the importance of continuous the negotiations, not breaking them off today and then resuming them tomorrow. He said the Israeli delegation must continue the negotiations. Its departure today, even if for specific reasons, is a kind of postponement. Musa said he believes the negotiations should be given precedence over any other commitments.
