Later, Khuri made a statement to the Syrian Arab News Agency correspondent on the topics which were studied by the committee. He said: At its previous meeting in Beirut on 3 February 1994, which was devoted to studying the subject of building a dam on the Orontes River, the Joint Water Committee set up a joint technical committee to explore the river course from the source to Lake Qattinah in order to inspect the existing gauge station, determine the new stations required, and study the flow of water both at the surface and underground levels for the longest period possible. Khuri added: "The joint technical committee had carried out its exploration of the Orontes River course, held several meetings to review its findings, and submitted its report to the main committee." Khuri said: "Yesterday's meeting was devoted to studying the facts contained in this report. It was agreed to adopt the technical committee's recommendations on gauging the annual average flow, revamping and operating the existing gauge station on the Lebanese side, and studying the building of a hydraulic station on the same side. This is in addition to the adoption of several other recommendations." The secretary general explained that the Joint Water Committee decided to devote its next meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Beirut on 20 June, to studying the question of current and future water needs to be supplied by the Orontes River course and to begin accumulating data on the needs to be supplied by the southern al-Kabir River. Khuri expressed the hope that all studies on the Orontes River would be completed prior to proposing future solutions concerning the exploitation of the river and consequently the signing of a Syrian-Lebanese agreement on whatever is reached in this regard.
