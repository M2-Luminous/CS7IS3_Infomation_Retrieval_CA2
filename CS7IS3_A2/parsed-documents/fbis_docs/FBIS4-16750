The Question Is, How They Will Look in Practice"] [Text] How many times have we, after the latest meeting of the CIS heads of state, received with ineradicable hope the agreements reached. True, we have just as often found that, as a rule, they do not work out as planned, or else actually sink without trace. It is no accident that the question of guarantees of the fulfillment of adopted decisions was persistently raised at the summit's concluding press conference, held on Friday [15 April]. It cannot be said that Boris Yeltsin's reply sounded very optimistic; he said that the Council of Heads of State is "not a plant administration in which hard-and-fast decisions are adopted"; rather the heads of state outline a general framework of joint intentions. All the same, the heads of state agreed to monitor the discipline of the fulfillment of decisions adopted since the formation of the CIS. Better than nothing, as they say... Marked dissatisfaction with the efficiency of the Commonwealth's functioning had been expressed in the proposal to create a Eurasian union recently put forward by [Kazakhstan President] Nursultan Nazarbayev. This idea was expected to receive some kind of development at the Moscow summit, but this did not happen. The Kazakhstani president himself did not come to the meeting, and his fellow heads of state did not discuss the proposal. Judging by the contacts which journalists have had with them in the lobbies, the idea has so far been cooly received. [Uzbekistan President] Islam Karimov, for example, said that it is devoid of practical content and the CIS should not be abandoned in midstream. Nevertheless, the Kazakhstani representative stated that the republic would present a comprehensive program for a new alliance at the next summit meeting. However, the CIS' reserves of strength are not yet exhausted, as the Moscow meeting showed. Above all, a number of questions aimed at the practical realization of the treaty of economic union were examined. Ukraine acceded to it as an associate member. An Economic Union Commission was set up -- true, so far just as an expert working organ. No less important is the agreement on the creation of a free trade zone, in line with which customs duties, taxes, and nontariff restrictions in mutual trade between the CIS countries will be gradually lifted. If this accord proves not to have been a waste of time, it could have significant impact. This is effectively the beginning of the juridical formulation of a single trading area, which will also be more attractive for our "more distant" foreign partners, who will accept the CIS free trade zone as a single international economic subject. At the meeting in Moscow the issue of securing the CIS' external borders, which had been under examination for several months, was successfully resolved. A joint memorandum on the participation of CIS member countries in guarding external borders in the Central Asian region has now been signed, as has a similar memorandum involving Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus]. Moldavia [Moldova] is also to accede to this memorandum. In this way the unified system of border security is being restored. In the bilateral meetings which took place during the Moscow summit let us note the accord between Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk on the future of the Black Sea Fleet, which they decided to share in the proportions of 15-20 percent for Ukraine, and the rest for Russia. But this is only a framework decision. An agreement on the parameters of this distribution has still to be prepared. Judging by the first reactions and by how it is being interpreted by some people in Ukraine, everything will not be so straightforward. The Moscow summit saw Moldavia's full inclusion in the work of the CIS, which now embraces 12 states -- the whole of the former Union except for the Baltic countries. Boris Yeltsin assessed its prospects as follows: "Despite the difficulties encountered in the formation of the Commonwealth, it can be firmly stated that we are now going ahead on the road of developing and intensifying integration processes."
