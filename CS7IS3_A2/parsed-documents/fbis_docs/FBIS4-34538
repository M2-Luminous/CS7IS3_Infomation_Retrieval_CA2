Having secured responses to the initial questionnaire and then to some additional questions, SEMANA's editorial board decided to publish them since Castano offers many revelations about some of the biggest crimes in recent years. [SEMANA] Your hatred for the guerrillas reportedly stems from the murder of your father, whom the subversives executed after kidnapping him and after you paid a ransom. How did that story go? [Castano] My father was kidnapped in 1981 from an estate he owned in the municipality of Segovia (Antioquia) by the Fourth Front of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia], which demanded 100 million pesos for his release. It was impossible to raise that amount of money at the time, inasmuch as our total wealth was not even half that much. Nevertheless, with the help of several local ranchers and a loan that the Amalfi Agricultural Credit Bank gave us under the Estate Law, we got together 30 million pesos and paid them. They then told me that 70 million was missing. I told them that I did not have that kind of money and that if I ever did, I would use it for nothing else but to combat them. My defiant reply was the reason they killed him. [SEMANA] Did you start forming the paramilitary groups in Cordova after this episode? [Castano] The group was actually created many years later. What I did right after my father's murder was to offer myself as a volunteer guide to the army, specifically to the Bombona Battalion in Puerto Berrio and the military base of the same battalion in Segovia. For two years, thanks to my help, as I told them the location of guerrilla camps and pointed out members of the FARC and the ELN [National Liberation Army], that battalion achieved excellent results in its operations. Concurrently, I received counterinsurgency training. After that I began to realize that the methods that the army was using could counter the actions of the guerrilla groups but never exterminate them. So I decided to create my own group and began operating in northeastern Antioquia, the Middle Magdalena, as far as the department of Cordova. [SEMANA] What was the purpose of these groups? Who financed them and how? [Castano] At first the groups were small, just a few peasants who were being harmed by the guerrillas and who saw self-defense as a way of defending their lands from the abuses and atrocities committed against them and their families. In other words, we began our activities as self-defense and we later learned that the guerrillas had neither the courage nor the military and logistic capacity that was being attributed to them, inasmuch as they always avoided a direct confrontation with our people. It was really then that we started to deploy our forces and went on the offensive to cover other areas and, at the same time, mold our deployment to the guerrillas' area of influence. [SEMANA] But who financed them? [Castano] As for their financing, the self-defense groups have always been financed by the people who have economic interests in the zones in which these groups operate. [SEMANA] These paramilitary groups reportedly sowed terror in Cordova, and the authorities point to you and these groups as the perpetrators of the massacres in Las Tangas, La Negra, and Punta Coquitos. The Supreme Court recently upheld a 20-year sentence against you in connection with these incidents. What actually happened? [Castano] I must regrettably acknowledge that any armed group in an area of conflict of one sort or another terrifies the civilian population. Now then, the Supreme Court upheld a 20-year sentence against me, but not for those massacres. On the contrary, I was acquitted in connection with them. I was convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime because I publicly admitted having had a self-defense group at the time of the demobilization, and we surrendered our weapons to the government. What really happened was that back then there were various independent, uncontrolled self-defense groups, but the public seemed to think there was only one, mine, which they blamed for everything that happened in that region of the country. [SEMANA] What did you achieve with the paramilitary groups in Cordova? [Castano] During the time that my self-defense groups were in the Upper Sinu, there were no kidnappings by the guerrillas; land values rose; the ranchers were not paying protection money, and all of the cattlemen could calmly visit their ranches. In other words, the guerrillas were eradicated. [SEMANA] You are said to be a man of the world who travels constantly and is a major art connoisseur. Is this true? [Castano] I lived for three years in Paris, where I was in the artworks business. Before that, when circumstances allowed, I traveled through several countries like any other person who can afford to and has some taste. I do not have as much money as my friends have always thought; I consider myself an average person, a hard worker who struggles through life and is immersed in countless problems. But I am content and I am still alive. [SEMANA] Let's move on to another subject. Did you ever work with Escobar? How did you meet him? How was your relationship with him at the outset? Did you two ever do business? [Castano] I met Pablo Escobar in the late 1970's in Medellin; at the time I bought and sold cars on commission. I met him when I sold him several trucks, and we remained friends. We had certain things in common, and although it may seem odd, we had enormous sympathy for leftist ideology, so much so that on one occasion we tried to contact one of the guerrilla groups that existed at the time. But those leanings disappeared in him later when he started making a lot of money and in me when that guerrilla group kidnapped and later killed my father. It is incomprehensible to me that my eternal enemies once had my support. There are times when I think that if I had not had reason to become a counterinsurgent, I would have been a guerrilla. I have to admit that I held Pablo in esteem back then, but not as greatly as I came to despise him because I never imagined that one day, in his obsession with money and power, he would become the most despicable and bloodthirsty man ever born in Colombia. [SEMANA] The authorities have fingered you as one of the chiefs of the military wing of the Medellin Cartel. Is this true? [Castano] I have never worked for anyone, and much less have I had bosses. I have not been a mercenary either. I have been independent and I take responsibility for my actions. [SEMANA] Because of that link to Escobar you have been cited as one of the masterminds behind the blowing up of the Avianca jet. The Prosecutor General's Office linked you and Escobar to that case and recently ordered your arrest. Were you involved in that bombing? [Castano] My war has been only with everything that smacks to me of the guerrillas. I do not blow up planes. I do not need to blow up a plane to kill someone famous. That reflects a lack of military resources. When you go into battle convinced that you are in the right and are acting with justice, you do not need to kill 107 people to achieve a goal. [SEMANA] What arguments do you have to counter the charges that the Prosecutor General's Office has leveled at you? Do you have information about the person or persons who ordered the bombing, who carried it out, and what their reasons were to kill 107 passengers? [Castano] It is a secret to no one that Pablo Escobar was the mastermind of that awful bombing. He was the only one who could have thought of such an insane terrorist act. As for who carried it out, his deputies who are now fortunately behind bars in La Picota Prison in Bogota can answer that. [SEMANA] Another of the crimes that the Prosecutor's Office has linked you to is the assassination of the former candidate of Patriotic Union, Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa. Last February an arrest warrant was issued for you, and your two brothers, Vicente and Carlos Castano, were also linked to the case. [Castano] I had a role in that, but I was not the mastermind, much less the perpetrator. My brothers Carlos and Vicente had absoluetly nothing to do with the incident or with any of my activities outside the law. If I had been involved in any way in any other activity, I would also say so, because my goal is to have everyone pay for what he has done. [SEMANA] You say that you did not kill Jaramillo. So who is to blame for his murder? [Castano] It was ordered by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, alias "El Mexicano," and directed by Ariel Otero and men working for Jaime Eduardo Rueda Rocha. [SEMANA] But how were you involved? [Castano] At a meeting that "El Mexicano" organized I was asked for my opinion, and I agreed with the order that he had given to execute the operation, the details of which I did not know. [SEMANA] The courts also link you to the assassinations of Senator Alfonso Ospina Ospina and Father Sergio Restrepo. [Castano] As for the murder of Father Sergio Restrepo, I can tell you that I have never had confrontations with the Church or with any of its members, and if there is anything that I am going to fight for, it is to show that I was not aware of anything that happened during the time that Dr. Alfonso Ospina was being held prisoner. I lent armed personnel to retired Army Captain Elkin Henao for some operations in the Middle Magdalena, and he used them behind my back to look after Dr. Alfonso Ospina during his captivity, all this in association with Pablo Escobar. I am absolutely certain that the Prosecutor's Office will acquit me of these charges. Why should I deny this, given the police record I have? [SEMANA] What were the causes of your breakup with Escobar and more or less when did it happen? [Castano] About 15 months before he was imprisoned in La Catedral, Pablo gave the ELN a lot of weapons, and this upset me greatly. We even had a bitter argument, and I never spoke to him again. I felt like going after him, but the truth is that he scared me. During the time that he was in La Catedral, in fact, the Moncadas and Fernando Galeano were murdered, and those of us who stayed alive felt obliged to fight against him because we had no other choice. [SEMANA] Were you the founder of "Los Pepes"? [Castano] On 21 February 1994 I sent the prosecutor general of the nation a memo saying: "I would like to clarify to you, Mr. Prosecutor General of the Nation, that in order to combat the despicable Pablo Escobar and his Medellin Cartel and to prevent them from continuing to attack the Colombian people and us, whom he persecuted tirelessly, I was the founder of the group that called itself `Los Pepes' and, at the same time, its military chief. In this and in my other activities outside the law, my brothers were not at all involved, as my enemies would have people believe." [SEMANA] Why were "Los Pepes" established? [Castano] It is my understanding that "Los Pepes" were not established. One day, 30 million Colombians persecuted by Pablo Escobar simply got fed up and banded together against him as society's response to the absolute power acquired by Escobar and his deputies, whom the State has now either killed or put behind bars. The city of Medellin was in the hands of a bunch of criminals, not common criminals but insane ones who killed and kidnapped innocent people like never before. So, there had to be a strong reaction, fighting fire with fire, or else we were lost. I think that Medellin and the entire country are breathing easier now that this thousand-headed monster and his famous cartel are gone. [SEMANA] How were they organized? [Castano] Everybody soon realized that the prison called La Catedral, where Pablo Escobar and his people were being held, had become a bunker in which murders were being committed and from which orders were given to kidnap, kill, and blackmail industrialists, businessmen, ranchers, and affluent people. Several distinguished persons sought me out and asked me to head up a self-defense group against Pablo Escobar. I thought up the name "Those persecuted by Pablo Escobar." [SEMANA] How did "Los Pepes" operate? [Castano] "Los Pepes" operated on two fronts. The first, called intelligence, was in charge of gathering all sorts of information on the structure of Pablo's organization. After the information had been gathered, it was conveyed by telephone or other channels to the appropriate authorities so that they could take advantage of it. The other front was called the action front; it was an armed group that I personally headed and that acted on the information to neutralize and destroy the enemy. [SEMANA] How was the group financed? [Castano] There was no problem with that. Industrialists, politicians, and cattlemen contributed money. We also raised money and earmarked it for this cause. [SEMANA] Who else was part of the top brass in "Los Pepes"? [Castano] That is for the Prosecutor's Office to find out. I cannot be disloyal on this point. [SEMANA] "Los Pepes" claimed responsibility for a number of attacks, including the murder of Omar Canas, who played for the Atletico Nacional soccer team, and announced that other members of the team would meet the same fate. Why? [Castano] I am not going to be the one who tarnishes the image of players on that team. We have all made mistakes in life, and anyway they are all adults. [SEMANA] Why did you set fire to Pablo Escobar's homes, blow up his properties, and destroy his collection of automobiles? [Castano] At some point someone had to battle Pablo by using his own methods. Pablo planted bombs, kidnapped, and then murdered his friends, but not before taking away all their money and property. He tortured and killed hundreds of people. So we were not going to combat someone as insane as him by dropping hints. The people wanted us to destroy Pablo without resorting to violence, but that was not possible. If things had been done that way, today all of us and the government itself would once again be on our knees at the feet of that monster. [SEMANA] Why did you kill Guido Parra? [Castano] The Guido Parra affair was indeed a regrettable mistake. The operation was a hasty one. One sector of the organization did not handle the matter with the proper restraint. Unfortunately, I was away, though I am not trying to dodge my responsibility by saying this. But, excesses are committed in war too. You have to understand, though, that this was not done gratuitously. The operational command of "Los Pepes" received information that Guido Parra was in direct contact with Pablo Escobar and that he served as his liaison for intelligence work and as an adviser on hide-outs and other operations. We know today that Pablo Escobar himself misinformed us and also that Dr. Guido Parra was no longer even his lawyer and that they had their differences because Escobar owed him a lot of money in fees. So, we were victims of Escobar's ploy to make us look like common murderers of innocent people. This was another of his wartime strategies. [SEMANA] Why did you kill other attorneys for Escobar and his organization, like Salomon Lozano and Raul Zapata? [Castano] In the case of Salomon Lozano, the legal adviser to Carlos Mario Urquijo, alias "Arete," we found that he was no longer his defense attorney. Instead, he served him as a courier, carrying letters with false accusations and conveying Pablo Escobar's instructions to attack "Los Pepes" in a bid to wage what they called "the legal war," so that they could use the military, in other words, government security forces, against me and the organization. The same was the case with Raul Zapata. In short, these individuals strayed beyond the bounds of their profession and became common criminals in service to the people who were behind bars, not to solve their problems but to misinform. [SEMANA] How did you collaborate with the Search Bloc in harassing Pablo Escobar? [Castano] We never had direct contact with the Search Bloc. We gave it a lot of information through various channels that did not identify us. [SEMANA] Is it true that you were involved in the operation in which Escobar died? In what other operations did you take part? [Castano] No. I repeat: we never had any joint operations with the Search Bloc. The operation in which Escobar died was conducted exclusively by the police, as is public knowledge. [SEMANA] What happened to "Los Pepes" after Escobar's death? Did they demobilize? [Castano] After Escobar's death there was no reason for our organization to continue. Since that glorious 2 December no more people are being persecuted by Pablo Escobar in Colombia. [SEMANA] Intelligence agencies report that after Escobar's death you had contacts with his family. Did you sign some sort of truce with his relatives? What are its terms? [Castano] I spoke with Hermilda and told her that we had absolutely nothing against them, and I said the same thing to Maria Victoria in a letter. We never regarded Pablo's family or the families of the other cartel members as enemies. [SEMANA] You demanded that Escobar's deputies who are in maximum-security prisons confess to all their crimes. Was there some sort of pact? [Castano] I do not consider it a pact. I simply thought that the members of the cartel were making a mockery of the Prosecutor's Office. They turned themselves in and confessed to a minor crime, thus eluding us and hoping to go free in one year. At that point we demanded that each and every one of them confess to all their crimes, which would guarantee them at least 10 years in prison. That way we would not have to go after them again, because the Prosecutor's Office would finally be punishing them for their crimes. [SEMANA] What happened to the Medellin Cartel after Escobar's death? Did you take over as its leader? [Castano] Drug trafficking has never attracted me. My businesses have always revolved around ranching and art. How am I supposed to head up a cartel that no longer exists? How am I supposed to spearhead a cause that was involved in drug trafficking, with which I have never agreed? I must admit that I was a friend of drug traffickers, but only because of my financial dealings. The Medellin Cartel died with Pablo Escobar. So, there is nothing to head up in Medellin. The only thing I want in my future is to live in the countryside, thus assuring the government that I, Fidel Castano, will never again break the peace in Colombia. [SEMANA] What is your relationship with the Cali Cartel? Escobar always said that the Cali people and you were the heads of "Los Pepes." How was Cali involved in that organization? [Castano] I have no relationship with what you call the Cali Cartel. I do not think that the cartel exists as such. I do have good friends in the Cauca Valley and I am grateful to them because they were the ones who provided the authorities with the most information about Pablo Escobar's narcoterrorists. [SEMANA] Have you thought about turning yourself in to the authorities? [Castano] I have thought about it repeatedly. But the outlook would be bleak for me because I know that it would take longer to get me into prison than to get myself killed there. I have a lot of enemies in jail, and they would not waste this unique opportunity to murder me. I think that all things considered, I will try to stay alive in the countryside. I would rather die there than give my enemies a chance to achieve their goal. So, I have promised myself that I will never allow myself to be taken to jail. I swear it. [SEMANA] Is your paramilitary group still active? [Castano] No, I do not have a paramilitary group, but I do have armed personnel to protect me, because I still live in a mountainous area alongside the FARC, the ELN, and a hard core of cattle rustlers from the Popular Liberation Army who dream of seeing me dead. When all is said and done, as long as I am living in a guerrilla zone, I will never be able to let down my guard.
