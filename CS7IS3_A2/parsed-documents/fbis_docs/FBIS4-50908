A strike of 20,000 workers has shocked the mainland authorities. In an important speech, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin listed eight hidden perils on the mainland, the first of which was worker strikes. The eight hidden perils enumerated by Jiang Zemin were: 1) The serious decline in the business results of state-owned enterprises has resulted in unemployment among the workers and has led to strikes in Wuhan and Shenyang. 2) There were poor harvests of grain and cotton; a large area of farmland was left uncultivated; and many young peasants left the countryside. 3) Foreign trade was set back by several foreign countries' antidumping policies. 4) The inflow of large quantities of foreign goods caused domestic trade to shrink. 5) The masses are very unhappy about the corruption within the CPC. 6) The relationship between the central and local authorities is not harmonious. 7) The tense situation on the Korean Peninsula, which is on the verge of breaking out, is threatening China's security. 8) The United States and other western countries are using human rights to pressure the mainland authorities. As far as worker strikes are concerned, approximately 20,000 coal miners in Shuangyashan and Jiamusi of Heilongjiang have reportedly staged a strike. As instructed by the higher authorities, some large enterprises in Harbin set up special leading groups to prevent and deal with possible labor unrest, which could break out suddenly. In addition, more than 2,000 workers in a Zhuhai factory staged a three-day strike to protest against the management's attempt to lower their wages. In Dalian, more than 6,900 workers in a company went on strike for four to five days in a bid to obtain a pay rise and improved working conditions. Strikes occurred successively in state-owned enterprises in Shenyang and Wuhan and shocked Zhongnanhai, forcing the mainland authorities to adopt some emergency measures. In his speech, Jiang Zemin acknowledged that strikes had occurred in Wuhan and Shenyang. He reiterated the need to serve the working class wholeheartedly, called for prudent arrangements in the adoption of reform measures, and warned that "workers must not be driven to the streets." At the same time, Jiang Zemin also expressed concern over the failures of grain crops and cotton and the exodus of the rural population. The situation for workers in state-owned enterprises has been getting worse. More and more state-owned enterprises are going to be closed down or sold, and this will mean that workers will lose their jobs as well as their basic means of livelihood.
