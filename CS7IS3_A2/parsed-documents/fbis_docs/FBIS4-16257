Uzbek President Islam Karimov speaks about the prospects of the Republic's development and on its ties with Russia with Interfax special correspondent Vyacheslav Terekhov. IF: It seems that Uzbekistan is one of the former USSR republics which has not experienced a substantial industrial recession over the last period of time and witnessed even a kind of raising in several fields of industry. Does it mean that you have found a recipe to fight with economic misfortunes? I. KARIMOV: As a matter of fact, a 4.5 percent growth of industry was fixed in 1993 in Uzbekistan. By the way, according to Arkadiy Volskiy (President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs - INTERFAX), if we take 1989, when economic crisis started in the Soviet Union, as the basic point the recession in the sphere of GNP and industrial production was 2.5-times lower than in the former USSR in general and in several fields it was even three-four times less. I can tell those who want to understand the reasons of this phenomenon that this mechanism is rather simple -- it is the way which Uzbekistan has chosen to transfer to the market. Many people try to explain this by upward distortion of the results achieved. This is incorrect. By the way, the army of officials was reduced two times in our Republic, at the same time the former Union apparatus servicing the former USSR was preserved and even is being increased in Russia. Some time ago the Republic abolished the department guarding "the socialist property" (OBKhSS) and reduced the People's Control. There is no more apparatus of the state committee on prices which was controlling prices. It has been united with the Finance Ministry, a total of 20 people work there. There is no more Gosplan (state planning committee) and Gossnab (state supply committee) in Uzbekistan. We have practically abolished all organizations controlling economy. We act given the people's wisdom "Having not built a new house, do not destroy the old one." Nobody intended to immediately destroy the previous system towards which the new radical democrats feel hatred, the question concerns its gradual re-structuring because it is impossible to force this process. There is no other secret. I am convinced that all reforms should be implemented gradually and one should not blame the old system for all mortal sins. We went along a creative road but not along the way of destruction of everything what was created before. I believe that the decision of the Russian authorities to widely celebrate the 50th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet people over fascism is absolutely just. Now Russia cannot live without the Army, without the mighty military-industrial potential which gave the possibility to support the balance in this two-polar world. Those Republics, which primarily shipped raw materials in the former USSR, have suffered less after the destruction of economic ties within the collapsed Union than those which produced manufactured goods. For example, Belarus, which has no natural resources, entirely depended upon other Union Republics. Such a dependence is extremely dangerous. Over the last few years by means of barter, in exchange for cotton and other products, Tashkent managed to receive those industrial goods which help to maintain rather a high level of production. But the main thing is that nobody in Uzbekistan intends "to break the old world to the basis and then to build a new one." IF: What is the reason of these, say, relative success of Uzbekistan? I.KARIMOV: I believe that everything depends upon those who stand at the helm of this state. For example, "chiefs of laboratories and chief research employees who pretended to be leaders of this nation were illiterately fulfilling their duties. For example, what could understand a historian, Azerbaijan's former president Abulfaz Elchibey, in economy and policy? This man has worked all his life among dusty book shelves. An analogical situation was in Georgia as well; in this Republic a philologist Zviad Gamsakhurdia was heading the state. For example, I am not going to write poems and to play piano as, say, the former head of the Lithuanian parliament V.Landsbergis. When a professional politician Algirdas Brazauskas came to power the life in the Republic began to return to normal. There existed a threat that incompetent people would come to power in Uzbekistan in 1989-90 as it happened in the Caucasus. I must say with a great regret that such negative process is going on in Russia now; unwillingness of the people to participate in the elections testifies to this fact. And if the people do not trust the ideals then any reforms cannot be implemented. This is a sad fact because there cannot be Uzbekistan's flourishing without Russia's flourishing. I have said about this may times. IF: According to available information, about 40 percent of Uzbekistan's citizens do not know the Uzbek language which is the state one in this nation... I.KARIMOV: As many as 22 Mn people live in Uzbekistan, 77 percent being Uzbeks, Tatars, Kazakhs, Tajiks, Kyrgyzs, Turkmenians, and the so called Russia-speaking people representing about 10 percent of the total population represent other nationalities living in the Republic. The overwhelming majority know the Uzbek language, some of them do not speak fluently but there are such people who do not accept it at all. On the other hand, there are Russians in the Republic who brilliantly speak the Uzbek language, for example, Vitaliy Segedin, director of the Akmalyk mining-metallurgical plant. The Uzbek decree on the language is a liberal one -- the authorities do not demand that all people should freely possess the language but I believe that they should demonstrate respect to our language because this is a sign of respect towards the people. I think that the Republic's citizens should possess the language at least on the level of everyday association. By the way, almost 99 percent of Uzbeks know the Russian language whereas this percent is much lower in the Transcaucasian and Baltic states. Uzbekistan is an example of the respect towards the great Russian language. IF: Several sources in mass media assert that there are people in Uzbekistan's distant regions who hunger... I.KARIMOV: Several years ago I worked in the most distant mountainous kishlaks (villages) going on foot and mounted. I can say that I know how people live in "out-of-the-way places." There are regions where there are droughts and the lands are infertile but hunger is impossible in our Republic. I assert that "there are neither poor nor hungry people in Uzbekistan." The community style of Uzbeks' life does not allow this. If at least one hungry man appears in makhalla (a traditional community of Uzbeks) it would be shameful and disgraceful for everybody. I am proud of these people. IF: The previous party apparatus has preserved in Uzbekistan's leadership. Do you think that it will be difficult to implement reforms with these people or it is easier to rule the country? I.KARIMOV: The Uzbeks are very law-obedient people, this feature of the people was brought up in the course of centuries. In addition, we pursue our own way of democratic construction of the state and of market relations -- we do not divide people into communists, anti-communists, radicals and democrats in our country, we have only refused from Bolsheviks' slogans. One should not think that only former communists work in Uzbekistan's leadership. By the way, I myself did not study in a party school. Many of the Uzbek ministers and their deputies have nothing in common with the party apparatus -- these are people younger than 40 years old. One can say the same about the majority of the governors in the regions. There are no more ardent Bolsheviks in the Republic's leadership and many former secretaries of the regional party committees correctly understand today's demands. Changing in people's thinking in Uzbekistan is going on dynamically and I am proud of this. IF: What is the situation in the field of the Republic's foreign economic relations? I.KARIMOV: The interest of the foreign capital in Uzbekistan is great and it seems to me that Russian leadership perceives this with some jealousy. More than 1200 joint ventures function in the Republic now, largest international corporations participate in their work. There are branches of six prestigious foreign banks in the Republic, several reputable firms have opened their missions in the Republic. I believe that Uzbekistan could teach Russia in some spheres, for example, in the field of infrastructure creation, in the sphere of foreign economic policy and transfer to market relations. By the way, I have written a book devoted to this problem. At present Tashkent has currency deposits in the best world banks totalling more than $700 Mn. What CIS state can boast with such a reserve in hard currency created within one-two years? It's my secret how Uzbekistan has managed to achieve this. Achievement of a trade parity with Russia is on today's agenda. Unfortunately, Tashkent buys practically everything in Russia without selling anything to it. At the same time one should not perceive Russia as "a milking cow" -- it is the richest power and Russians can be proud of its potential. IF: What is your assessment of the case on corruption in Uzbekistan's supreme echelons of power investigated by the USSR General prosecutor's office and Sh.Rashidov's role (the late first secretary of Uzbekistan's communist party -- INTERFAX)? According to the investigation, the greatest number of millionaires lived in the Republic. Where is their money? I.KARIMOV: You are right, there was corruption in the Republic. Upward distortion of the results achieved in the production of cotton which were later on transferred into money by Uzbekistan's leaders who were gaining great profits is the main reason of corruption. However, I believe that the Union authorities were fighting with these illegal actions by vicious methods, they did not observe laws themselves. Nobody took into account that the Republic had its own Constitution, its own Supreme Soviet, its own legislature. They arrested deputies of the Union parliament violating their status. The suspected ones were hunted by dogs, they were handcuffed without any sanctions of the attorney general. I believe that the methods used by the investigators of the General prosecutor's office Mr Telman Gdlyan and Mr Nikolay Ivanov personified complete lawlessness. Such ignorance of the national dignity of the Republic's citizens led to the bloodshed in the course of inter-ethnic clashes in the Fergana valley. In my opinion, the whole Uzbekistan and, probably, the whole Middle Asia could have exploded as a result of this. The Republic could not control Gdlyan and Ivanov. They were acting on the order of the CPSU Central Committee. I believe that an additional investigation of this case should be instituted in the near future. The thing is that funds earned honestly were confiscated from the people accused of corruption at that time. Women were deprived of wedding-rings and jewelry received from their ancestors. This was a pure humiliation. Where have all confiscated jewelry's disappeared? How much has remained in Mr Gdlyan's pockets and in the pockets of other investigators? They have not handed over anything into Uzbekistan's treasury. I think that Tashkent can raise this issue today. Though we do not want to trouble people in this difficult time... IF: Are there opposition parties in Uzbekistan and will they participate in the elections? I.KARIMOV: We should start with the clarification of an issue what a political party is. This is a movement having its own program and its own perception of the state's development. After the collapse of the USSR several tens of parties immediately appeared in the Republic which announced themselves "parties." This testifies to the fact that these are not parties but just groupings with definite political ambitions pursuing their own goals. As far as the opposition is concerned, it must be constructive and act within the Constitution. When a party proclaims itself an opposition one but it has the aim to destroy public system then, I believe, it cannot be called an opposition. IF: Have you ever thought that you would become leader of a state? I.KARIMOV: Never in my life I thought that I would be a leader of such a scale and carry a colossal responsibility for the fate of the whole country. For a long time I worked in planning and financial organizations, I was deputy chairman of the government and headed the Republic's State Planning Committee. After the discussion of my candidacy in the Political Bureau of the CPSU Central Committee and at the plenum of the Central Committee I was confirmed on the post of the first secretary of Uzbekistan's communist party. It happened just after the tragic events in Fergana. At the same time I believe that I am an accidental man in the party. I am convinced that any society, even the most democratic one, is not barred from sins. Now, Uzbekistan is accumulating experience while building its statehood. I think that elements of authoritarian system are needed during the transition period. If the people elected me to the post of the president, it means that they are confident in my program and see that it will bring stability and peace to this nation. I believe that I must fulfill my duty in the face of the people, that is, I must fulfill my program. I must admit that I have never resorted to volitional methods. However, I think that sometimes they are necessary. IF: The thing is that you yourself create an economic system in this country which cannot be subordinated to strong-willed decisions... I.KARIMOV: We are forced to resort to volitional methods at a definite state in order the objective economic laws could triumph. Somebody must take the responsibility and prepare the ground in order these laws could work tomorrow. IF: Over the last period of time mass media often reports about the growth of anti-Russian moods in Uzbekistan... I.KARIMOV: I do not want to use passionate words but I'd like to underline that Uzbekistan always treated Russia with great respect and gratitude. This is a sincere feeling. A word expression "near abroad countries" is widely used now. Frankly speaking, I do not understand what it means. I think that such terms artificially separate us with the Russian Federation. As for me, authors of this term do not understand themselves what is hidden under this word combination. Russia has a great future. After the collapse of the USSR, independent young states experienced a kind of euphoria. In some of the republics this independence turned into a fetish. But the life has proved that sovereignty is not just loud statements and declarations. Now many people understand that Russia should be the guarantor of peace and stability in the Middle Asia. Not long ago in Davos, Pakistani Prime Minister Mrs Bhutto declared that today when there is no more iron curtain and the republics of the Central Asia are open for the outside world, it's high time to start integration process in this region by creating an association in which Pakistan will be the leader. I categorically oppose this point of view. I believe that the Commonwealth of Independent States is a serious organization and one cannot but take it into consideration.
