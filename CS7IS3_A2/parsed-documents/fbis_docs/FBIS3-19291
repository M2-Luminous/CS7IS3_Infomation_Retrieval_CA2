These reinforcements, drawn mainly from the 9th Marine Infantry Division (2d RIMa [marine regiment], RICM [expansion not given], 6th Engineers Regiment), will form a third French battalion in Sarajevo. For a long time Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has opposed these reinforcements. He only recently consented to the dispatch of the addtional troops after three vital preconditions were met: The arrival on the spot of other UN contingents; the return to France by 15 June of the battalion deployed in Krajina; and better protection for the French blue helmets. Originally, the prime minister's surprise visit on Sunday [13 March] was intended to provide support and encouragement to the French battalion stationed in Bihac, one of whose soldiers was killed on Friday by a Serb or Bosnian marksman. Indeed it primarily enabled Edouard Balladur to convey a message: Paris expects the United Nations to show a more vigorous reaction when French blue helmets suffer a deliberate attack, as was the case on Saturday evening. "The Serbs began to attack French elements at 1830. The decision to respond by air fire was not made until 2335. Much too late, especially because it was night." Colonel Chanier, deputy chief of the SIRPA [Armed Forces Information and Public Relations Service], said yesterday that the reaction time should be reduced to less than one hour. Once you go beyond that, efficacy is no longer guaranteed and the response tends to become a reprisal action, which the UN resolutions would not authorize. How is it possible to move more quickly? On Saturday, the procedure was as follows: The blue helmets attacked in the city of Bihac reported the incident to their command posts which requested air intervention at 1900, reporting the matter to the military chief of the Bihac pocket, who alerted General Rose. At 2030, the chief of the blue helmets in Bosnia reported the matter to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] Chief General Cot. There were then requests for explanations by the forces on the spot. At 2150 General Cot telephoned Mr. Akashi, Butrus Butrus-Ghali's personal representative, and then sent him the official request for an air intervention at 2240. The matter was then referred to New York, before coming back to Zagreb, where permission to intervene was given by Mr. Akashi at 2335. During a private conversation, the prime minister informed Mr. Akashi that it was "imperative" to rapidly review this procedure. Gen. Joel Marchand, coordinator of French resources in the former Yugoslavia, was instructed to ask UNPROFOR to establish a rapid and effective decisionmaking process. At the same time, Mr. Merimee, the French ambassador to the United Nations, is to request that the delegation of powers, currently entrusted to the UN secretary general's representative, be given to members of the military. Or, at the very least, that it be in the hands of authorities who are permanently reachable. These provisions are of a technical nature. They will be adopted if there is a real political will within the United Nations. Hence the political pressure which Edouard Balladur's visit to Bihac represented.
