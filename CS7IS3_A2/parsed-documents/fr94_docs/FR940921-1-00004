ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. The revision concerns the control of oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) from industrial boilers, steam generators, and process heaters in Santa Barbara County. The rule limits NO x and carbon monoxide emissions from these sources. The intended effect of proposing approval of this rule is to regulate emissions of NO x in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated this rule and is proposing to approve it under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA actions on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing on or before October 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A. Meer, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO x emissions through reasonably available control technology (RACT) are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November 25, 1992, EPA published a NPRM entitled ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO x Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, document should be referred to for further information on the NO x requirements and is incorporated into this document by reference. Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO x (``major'' as defined in sections 302 and 182(c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas. Santa Barbara County is classified as a moderate nonattainment area for ozone; 1 therefore the Santa Barbara County area is subject to the RACT requirements of section 182(b)(2), cited above. 1 Santa Barbara County was designated nonattainment and classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by a pre-enactment control technologies guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document) by November 15, 1992. There were no NO x CTGs issued before enactment and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO x category since enactment of the CAA. The RACT rules covering NO x sources and submitted as SIP revisions are expected to require final installation of the actual NO x controls by May 31, 1995 for those sources where installation by that date is practicable. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD) Rule 342, Control of NO x from Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters. The rule was adopted by the SBCAPCD on March 10, 1992 and submitted by the State of California on June 19, 1992. Submitted Rule 342 was found to be complete on August 27, 1992 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V 2 and is being proposed for approval into the SIP. 2 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216). NO x emissions contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. Rule 342 controls emissions of NO x and carbon monoxide from commercial and industrial boilers, steam generators, and process heaters which are used in a wide variety of applications providing steam, heat, and hot water for industrial, institutional, and commercial operations. Rule 342 was adopted as part of SBCAPCD's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to the CAA requirements cited above. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for Rule 342. EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action In determining the approvability of a NO x rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110, and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for this action, appears in the NO x Supplement and various EPA policy guidance documents. 3 Among these provisions is the requirement that a NO x rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of NO x emissions. 3 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post&hyph;1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988). For the purposes of assisting state and local agencies in developing NO x RACT rules, EPA prepared the NO x Supplement to the General Preamble, cited above (57 FR 55620). In the NO x Supplement, EPA provides guidance on how RACT will be determined for stationary sources of NO x emissions. While most of the guidance issued by EPA on what constitutes RACT for stationary sources has been directed towards application for VOC sources, much of the guidance is also applicable to RACT for stationary sources of NO x (see section 4.5 of the NO x Supplement). In addition, pursuant to section 183(c), EPA is issuing alternative control technique documents (ACTs) that identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources of NO x . The ACT documents will provide information on control technology for stationary sources that emit or have the potential to emit 25 tons per year or more of NO x . However, the ACTs will not establish a presumptive norm for what is considered RACT for stationary sources of NO x . In general, the guidance documents cited above, as well as other relevant and applicable guidance documents, have been set forth to ensure that submitted NO x RACT rules meet Federal RACT requirements and are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. Rule 342 applies to all boilers, steam generators, and process heaters with rated heat inputs greater than or equal to 5 million British Thermal Units per hour (MMBtu/hr) used in industrial, institutional, and commercial operations. The rule limits NO x emissions from units with rated heat inputs greater than or equal to 5 MMBtu/hr and with annual heat input greater than or equal to 9 billion Btu to 30 parts per million (ppm) or 0.036 pound per million BTU (lb/MMBtu) when operated on gas. For the same size units with annual heat inputs of the same level, which are operated on nongaseous fuel, the rule limits NO x emissions to 40ppm or 0.052 lb/MMBtu of heat input. The same size units operating with annual heat inputs of less than 9 billion Btu are required to maintain stack-gas oxygen concentrations at less than 3 percent or perform annual tune-ups. Final compliance with these limits is required by March 10, 1996. The RACT limits specified in the California Air Resources Board's (CARB's) reasonably available control technology/best available retrofit control technology (RACT/BARCT) determination for these types of units are 70 ppm (0.084 lb/MMBtu) and 115 ppm (0.150 lb/MMBtu) for units fired with gas and nongaseous fuels while those for BARCT are 30 ppm and 40 ppm, respectively. Although Rule 342's BARCT limits (30ppm/40ppm) are more stringent than what EPA would consider as RACT (70ppm/115ppm) for these sources, the additional reductions obtained beyond those attributable to RACT are assumed necessary for SBCAPCD's attainment planning purposes. In evaluating the rule, EPA must also determine whether the CAA requirement for RACT implementation by May 31, 1995 is met. The rule was written such that final compliance is not required until 4 years after the date of adoption. Since the rule was adopted in March 1992, final compliance is not required until March 1996. Under certain circumstances, the determination of what constitutes RACT could include consideration of advanced control technologies, i.e., California's requirement for BARCT. In these cases, the CAA's May 1995 date for RACT implementation may be satisfied in BARCT rules that establish ``interim RACT'' by May 1995, and require emission limitations based on advanced control technologies (BARCT) be met after May 1995. Rule 342 requires that interim control measures be met to ensure progress toward final compliance. The interim control measures include applying for a permit to operate and authority to construct and the development and submission of a compliance plan. A more detailed discussion of the sources controlled, the controls required, and the justification for why these controls represent RACT can be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for Rule 342, dated May 1994. EPA has evaluated the submitted rule and has determined that it is consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations and EPA policy. Therefore, SBCAPCD Rule 342, Control of NO x from Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters is being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on affected small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).
