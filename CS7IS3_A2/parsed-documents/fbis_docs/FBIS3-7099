I am making official visits to Japan and China for a week beginning today in my capacity as a state guest for the first time since I took office as president. At a news conference with reporters earlier this year, I said that I would not hesitate in going anywhere in the world to be a salesperson for our national interests. My visits to Japan and China this time are to put such will into practice. For the past year since I took on the presidency, I have met over 20 heads of state, and found them all to share one common factor--that they all were pursuing their respective national interests. Our closest neighbors historically and geographically, Japan and China, are our partners in leading the Asia-Pacific era. I will reconfirm this on this visit. At the same time, I will relay the impressive efforts during the past year of our fellow countrymen for reforms and for building a new state, to the people of these two countries. The globalization trend is increasing in the international community daily. Distances between countries are shrinking, and relations of mutual reliance are deepening. In particular, a new world trade order of indefinite competition has emerged in the wake of the Uruguay Round. In order for the ROK, China, and Japan to mutually enjoy political stability and economic prosperity in such an era of rapid change, it is very important for close cooperation to take place. Japan and China are our second and third largest trade partners. Most of our foreign investment has been in China. Amid such a trend in the world economy, cooperation is ever increasing among the three countries, all with different industrial structures and developing rates. Mutually complementary cooperation and partnership will enable all three countries to strengthen each's competitiveness. Fellow countrymen: During my visit, I will hold deep consultations with Japan and China on how the three countries can cooperate for Asia's security and peace. In particular, the North Korean nuclear issue is not only a grave issue for us, but is also closely related to the security of Northeast Asia and world peace. North Korea has refused to sincerely receive the inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and has even unilaterally broken off the North-South dialogue, thus creating a crisis on the Korean peninsula. It even threatens our people with severe words that state that it is ready for war. We will resolutely defeat any kind of provocation by North Korea with the firm security cooperative system of the ROK and the United States. During the security-related ministers' meeting on 21 March which I chaired, I reconfirmed our flawless security posture and consolidated a firm will to deal with whatever situation we may come to face. U.S. President Clinton sent me a personal letter promising that the United States will sincerely abide by its security pledge toward the ROK, whatever the situation. We will by no means yield to North Korea's threats. We will keep the doors open so that dialogue can begin as soon as they change their attitude. I will ask for Japan and China's cooperation during my visit to the two countries to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and call for North Korea's reform and openness, as it is now isolated internationally. The three countries of the ROK, China, and Japan each has its share of work in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. I intend to explain to the leaders of the two countries that true reconciliation and peace are not only crucial to the prosperity of East Asia but also to the Asian-Pacific region, and ask for their cooperation. Fellow countrymen: During my visit to Japan, I am scheduled to meet Emperor Akihito and hold two summits with Prime Minister Hosokawa. I will also make a speech before the Diet and reveal how I envision ROK-Japanese relations in the 21st century. In addition, I will meet the leaders of Japan's political and economic circles to exchange views on worthwhile mutual exchanges. At Waseda University, I will talk about the future role of youth in the ROK and Japan. As for the summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, since I held exclusive talks with him in Seattle last year, this will be our second summit meeting. In the upcoming summit, we will contemplate our relations which have been maintained for a long time. I am also scheduled to meet Premier Li Peng. I will observe economic developments in Shanghai and Tianjin and will visit the site of our former provisional government in Shanghai. I also intend to convey the warm greetings of our people to fellow countrymen living in Japan and China. Fellow countrymen: The ROK is no longer on the periphery of the earth. Having opened an era of civilian government and being third in economic rank in the world [segye chesamwiui kyongjeryog], the ROK is emerging as a core country in the 21st century. The ROK is actively participating in and contributing to setting up a new order in the Pacific era. This is not just our opinion but how the world sees us. Let us all have pride and a sense of mission! Let us all realize our ambition with reforms and internationalization! Let us all turn this country into a country that contributes to creating a new civilization. Even though I briefly depart, fellow countrymen, I will remain with you always. Fellow countrymen, I will return soon.
