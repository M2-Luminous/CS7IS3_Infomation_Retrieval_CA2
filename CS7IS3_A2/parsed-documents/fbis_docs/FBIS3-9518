Though it is possible to glean a lot from the dry words of a message of congratulations about the attitude of another country's representative toward an up-and-coming politician, it is not customary for the one who congratulates to also assume a stand on domestic political developments and to lean toward one side in the struggle between two opinions. President Clinton did that. We still remember well the words of former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, in which he called President Michal Kovac's activity during the meeting with Bill Clinton in Prague a "wasted opportunity," with reference, among other things, to negative reactions of the U.S. side. President Clinton did not have to use the expression "successful meeting in Prague" in his congratulatory message. Nonetheless, he did, thereby entering, apparently consciously, into the Kovac-Meciar conflict. The course of action by the Slovak delegation during this meeting was not necessarily flawless, yet the President of the United States wants it to be considered successful, which he made publicly known. President Clinton thus sent a clear and easily understandable signal to Slovakia--a signal for the new government and also for the opposition.
