The procession was led by a number of general secretaries of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, led by Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC]; Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa Muraghah], Central Committee secretary of the Palestine National Liberation Movement [PNLM]-Fatah; Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine; Talal Naji, assistant secretary general of the PFLP-GC; Abu-Khalid al-'Amlah, assistant secretary of PNLM- Fatah; Muhammad Abu-Musa, command member of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas; and Abu-Istayf [not further identified], Central Committee member of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front; and other alliance leaders. Mohammad Shari'ti, cultural counselor at the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus and an Iranian delegation were also in the forefront of the procession. Our correspondent in Damascus said that since the early morning hours, the masses of our people gathered in the streets of al-Sayyidah Zaynab camp, then headed for al-Sayyidah Zaynab tomb where Ahmad Jibril delivered a speech. He said: Today we stand here on the occasion of world Jerusalem day--this day which Imam Khomeyni, may God have mercy on him, made an international day. This was decided immediately after the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran. Imam Khomeyni said Israel is a cancerous growth that should be removed, and Jerusalem should have an international day. With this, Imam Khomeyni drew a link between Jerusalem day and the blessed month of Ramadan, and the last Friday of that month in particular. The Islamic conquests and the Muslims' battles against heretics were carried out in this blessed month. Ahmad Jibril recalled what Imam Khomeyni said--that Islam without Palestine and without Jerusalem is an incomplete Islam, and Muslims throughout the world should work for the restoration of Jerusalem and Palestine. Jibril added: We meet today on world Jerusalem day at a time when the whole of Palestine suffers from massacres and repression of children, woman, and the elderly. These Jews, who killed prophets and messengers, have never hesitated to commit more massacres. You recall, o brothers, the massacre at the holy al-Aqsa Mosque and how they kill the worshipers who were prostrate before Almighty God. This took place on Friday. Two week ago, you heard how the Jews killed or injured hundreds of worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque. This also took place on Friday. The history of our people in Palestine is full of massacres, from Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, Sabra and Shatila, and 'Uyun Qarah, until the latest massacre. The Zionist leaders arrogantly denounced the massacre of al-Ibrahimi Mosque, saying that its perpetrator was mad and deranged. We ask terrorist Rabin: Who committed the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dayr Yasin massacres? Was it not the Zionist army? Jibril went on to say: These lies and tricks do not deceive anyone. Today, the capitulationist leadership, which signed an agreement with the Zionists and relinquished everything, agreed to sell the homeland and the blood of martyrs to the enemies of God and humanity. We say to all these defeatists that the Palestinian people--their women, youths, and elderly--have not calmed down and have not become tired. Haven't they seen the children chasing the Zionist soldiers and throwing stones at them? Haven't they seen the women taking kitchen knives and stabbing the enemy's soldiers before being martyred? Haven't they seen how the mujahidin in Palestine fight the enemies of God? We say to these people: Do whatever you want, but God's will shall prevail. Jibril concluded his speech by addressing Muslims all over the world and said: Do not despair of Gods' mercy because God told the faithful that they will attain victory. If you aid (the cause of) God, He will aid you. [Koranic verse] Mohammad Shari'ti, cultural counselor at the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus, read a statement in which he condemned the massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, and all the massacres the enemy has committed in Palestine and the occupied Arab territories. He hailed the Palestinian people and urged Muslims to support the Muslims in Palestine and to carry out jihad for the restoration of Jerusalem and Palestine.
