After the first reform phase, which was aimed at rationalizing and normalizing the political, social and economic sectors, O said South Korea must boost its competitive strength through internationalization. Speaking at a meeting of heads of South Korean overseas information services in the United States, O said, "We have to awaken the potential capacity and possibility of every field and deploy all our energy so that we can mount a challenge on the world stage." "Heightening the image of our country by letting the world know about the dynamic reforms of our civilian government and cultural tradition is the way to raise the status of the country and strengthen competitiveness," he said. In order to achieve this goal, O said the government plans to build up a joint official and private promotion system, partly by channeling publicity functions that are scattered among various ministries. The heads of the overseas information services heard reports on internationalization and the country's competitiveness, and exchanged views at the meeting. Prior to coming to Washington, O presided over similar meetings in Tokyo and Paris. He is scheduled to return home via New York on Sunday.
