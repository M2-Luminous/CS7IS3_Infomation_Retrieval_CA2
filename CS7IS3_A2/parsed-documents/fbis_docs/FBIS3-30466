In an interview for CTK, however, he said that his statement "does not have to correspond completely to reality," but added that the ministry had decided to make such a statement in its foreign policy report to parliament only after much consideration. "The ministry has analysed several specific statements by the chairman of the (Hungarian) Egyutteles movement, Miklos Duray and come to the conclusion that they contain elements of irredentism," Moravcik said. He added that some of these statements led to the holding of the January 8 meeting in Komarno, Southern Slovakia, where members of the country's Hungarian minority were to discuss the creation of an autonomous Hungarian "province" in the region, but eventually dropped the issue. Moravcik reiterated his opposition to the idea that granting rights to minorities should create artificial borders between various ethnic groups. He said that a situation where the granting of one demand only leads to the raising of another is intolerable. The Slovak-Hungarian friendship treaty under preparation is a "basic pillar" of cooperation between the two countries, he said, adding that Slovakia saw no reason to delay signing it soon.
