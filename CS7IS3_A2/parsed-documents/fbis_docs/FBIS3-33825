This came in a letter in Arabic sent to Brig. Gen. al-Mutawakkil by Yemeni Jews and signed in Hebrew by nine of their dignitaries, protesting against the Zionist campaign which exploits the "poor financial situation" in Yemen to make them emigrate to Israel "with financial enticements." It is worth noting that an American Jew of Yemeni origin by the name of Moshe Yarimi and a Jewish Swiss journalist by the name of Oneger are currently in Yemen. The latter is accompanied on his tour of the cities of Sa'dah and Raydah by Muhammad al-Juraydi, an employee of the Yemeni Information Ministry, which helps him move around and which also arouses fears among Yemeni Jews about their continuing to live in Yemen and encouragement to emigrate to Israel. While Yemeni Jews welcome religious groups of their faith who visit them and bring books and educational literature such as Naturi Carta, known as Guards of the City, which help them within their community, they express surprise at the Yemeni authorities' lack of response so far to their requests for protection from "foreign corruption," in the form sometimes of enticement and sometimes threats. Joseph Kaplan and Yosef Amar, two American Jewish assistants of Shlomo Grafi, representative of the Jewish Agency which actively works for the emigration of Jews to Israel, visited Yemen last month and distributed sums of money to Yemeni Jews. Kaplan succeeded in leaving with a Yemeni Jewish woman whom he married on the way to Israel via European capitals or New York. Yosef Amar remained [in Yemen] after that for two weeks, during which he worked for the emigration of a Yemeni Jew by the name of Harun Murji to Israel to join one of his two wives who preceded him there without the knowledge of his other wife, whom he intended to leave behind in Yemen to join him later. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Moshe Yarimi managed to get close to a tribal chief in the area of Sa'dah and persuaded him to threaten one of the Jews opposed to emigration to Israel. It reached a point where that chief pointed his gun at the Jew and threatened that "he would kill him if he continued to instigate others against the Americans." The letter addressed to the Yemeni interior minister mentioned that and said "we wish to inform you that we have received ultimatums and threats that they will make some corrupt people harm us unless we give in to them." Observers believe that the Zionist groups, whose work in Yemen is coordinated by a special committee directly attached to the Israeli prime minister's office, use American and European Jews to fulfill their mission and they exploit the current liberal atmosphere in Yemen and the weak government presence in the northern areas, a matter which facilitates their task.
