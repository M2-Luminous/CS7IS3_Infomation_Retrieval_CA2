FBIS4-53647 "dreas099_c_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 North Korea Japan Called `Hypocrite' for Plutonium `Concealment' Japan Called `Hypocrite' for Plutonium `Concealment' SK2105111294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1056 GMT 21 May 94 SK2105111294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Hypocrite Unmasked" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The recently exposed concealment of 70 kilograms of undeclared pure-powder plutonium in Japan has brought into a glaring light the true color of Japan as a hypocrite trying to deliberately fool the world, while producing and stockpiling a large quantity of plutonium, says MINJU CHOSON today. The analyst continues: The Japanese reactionaries, captive to the desire to convert Japan into a nuclear power, have promoted the introduction, deployment and stockpile of nuclear weapons behind the spurious curtain of "three non-nuclear principles." They are now stepping up nuclear armament, raising a hue and cry over "the nuclear suspicion" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its "nuclear issue." It was the first time that undeclared plutonium was discovered in Japan. But nobody can tell how much plutonium is concealed in Japan. The recently exposed concealment of plutonium makes us cast doubt on the impartiality of the International Atomic Energy Agency in its inspections. The IAEA arbitrarily branded the fledgling peaceful nuclear activities of such small countries as ours as "nuclear development", while conniving at the dangerous nuclear activities of Japan. This is obviously an undisguised application of a double standard. The Japanese reactionaries must stop the despicable nuclear gamble, open to the public the quantity of the concealed plutonium and behave themselves. The United States and the IAEA would be well advised to pay due attention to Japan's nuclear armament, adhering to the principle of impartiality.
