If the HA fails to submit any of items 4&hyph;12 listed in Section III.A of this NOFA, or the application contains a technical mistake, such as an incorrect signatory, the Field Office will immediately notify the HA that it has 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's written notification to submit or correct the specified items. If any of items 4&hyph;12 are missing and the HA does not submit them within the 14-day cure period, the application will be ineligible for further processing. V. Other Matters A. Environmental Review A finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The finding of no significant impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500. B. Federalism Executive Order The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the Order. The NOFA merely sets forth funding availability for HAs to conduct, at their discretion, risk assessments for lead paint hazards. C. Family Executive Order The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this notice will likely have a beneficial impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. Families could benefit from this funding action as a result of the identification of immediate and potential lead-based paint hazards; that identification will ultimately lead to a safer environment. However, since the impact on the family is not necessarily significant and is beneficial, no further review is considered necessary. D. Section 102 of the HUD Reform Act; Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient Disclosures Disclosures. HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period generally less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR part 12, subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.)
