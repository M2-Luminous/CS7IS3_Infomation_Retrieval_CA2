On behalf of the ministry's leadership, the meeting was attended by Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila and Lieutenant General George Ioan Danescu, secretary of state and first deputy interior minister. The report presented by Unit Commander Major General Dan Gheorghe and speeches made by subordinate cadres emphasized that the concerns and efforts of the unit were directed toward ensuring the intelligence protection of the cadres, units, and missions of the Interior Ministry and preventing and uncovering violations -- particularly in the spheres of economy, organized crime, and violent acts -- as well as other deeds affecting law and order and national security. The speakers pointed out that, in actions taken to fulfill its tasks and missions, the unit did not exceed its prerogatives and did not infringe upon citizens' basic rights and freedoms. In his speech, Senator Radu Alexandru Timofte first said that the activity of the unit is being carried out legally and that, contrary to some ill-intentioned allegations, the Intelligence Protection Service of the Interior Ministry has well-defined duties that do not overlap those of other intelligence structures of the state. In another point, the speaker criticized the damaging and even inadmissible behavior of certain employees of the unit, who, for dubious reasons, are passing on secret data and information to the press, something that harms both the efficiency of the unit and its actual image. In his turn, Deputy Petre Roman expressed the conviction that the allegations that UM 0215 was involved in political activities are not true. Actually, he said, the unit is carrying out its activity within the limits of legal provisions. The presidents of the two commissions expressed the backing, understanding, and support of their commissions in solving the problems faced by this unit, including legislative and logistical assistance. In conclusion, Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila praised the seriousness of the inquiry he attended and the professionalism of the members of the Intelligence Protection Service. He emphasized that the activity of the aforementioned unit, as well as that of the entire ministry, will continue to be carried out in accordance with the law, as in the past -- a communique released by the press service of the Ministry of Interior reads.
