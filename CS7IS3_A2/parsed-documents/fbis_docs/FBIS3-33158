FBIS3-33158 "drlat034bb_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-034 Document Type:Daily Report 18 February 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS Old Border Posts, Bureaucracy Hinder Central American Trade PA1702195194 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1513 GMT 13 Feb 94 PA1702195194 Panama City ACAN Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [All figures as received] [Text] Guatemala City, 12 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- One of the main regional integration organizations maintains that the 25 border posts along the Central American isthmus constitute an obstacle for free trade and movement of people and that some $42 million needs to be invested to improve this situation. The Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration (SIECA) reached this conclusion in a report on the situation at 18 of the 24 border posts between the Mexican-Guatemalan border and the Costa Rican-Panamanian border. SIECA pointed out that the trade and transportation obstacles begin with the numerous bureaucratic procedures needed to cross resulting from a paucity of human resources, infrastructure, and guidelines, and from the lack of common schedules. For example, the regular working day in Guatemala, which has five border posts, begins at 0800 (1400 GMT) and ends at 1630 (2230 GMT), while the working day in El Salvador begins at 0600 (1200 GMT) and ends at 2200 (0400 GMT). SIECA admits that the customs offices could hardly work 24 hours a day due to the lack of security; it recommends, instead, standardizing services and scheduling a regular working day that begins at 0800 (1400 GMT) and ends at 2200 (0400 GMT). The report also suggests the complete standardization of in-transit fees, as is the case in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This is not the case, however, in Guatemala and Panama because additional charges affect the competitiveness of products. As for the facilities, of the 18 offices visited, none is in good condition, except the "El Guasaule" office at the Honduran-Nicaraguan border. All of the others pose problems in the layout out of quarters, offices, warehouses, and stores. Some countries have already begun to channel funds to improve these "ports of entry." The Nicaraguan Government, for example, is investing $14.3 million, donated by the Central American Bank of Economic Integration, to modernize such facilities. The Costa Rican government, meanwhile, is planning to invest some $100,000 for the same purpose. About 5 million people and almost 1.5 million tonnes of merchandise go through the Central American border posts each year, enduring the bad condition of border infrastructures. The poor "surface" of the highways worsens this situation. Very few stretches of road near border posts are in good condition. The Central American Commission to Facilitate Transportation [Comision Centroamericana de Facilitacion de Transporte -- Cocafatra] is considering the possibility of carrying out a plan, in the mid term, to refurbish the 24 border posts so that they can handle 10 million people and 3 million tonnes of merchandise by the year 2000. According to preliminary estimates, repairing the existing facilities and building new ones will require some $42 million, 80 percent of which the countries expect to get from international aid. Cocafatra officials are also analyzing the creation of posts with common facilities, which the two bordering countries will manage and where all procedures can be accomplished. Cocafatra is recommending that a post of this type be in operation by June 1994, but it did not disclose which two countries would participate in this pilot project. The existing facilities would reportedly be used in the model plan: one facility would house the two countries' customs offices, and the other would house immigration. These two offices could be combined into a single facility if a binational body of trained officers can be formed to minimize bureaucracy. There are five border posts in Guatemala, six in El Salvador, six in Honduras, four in Nicaragua, two in Costa Rica, and two in Panama.
