What obtains all over the world is true here as well: there is no wise conquering army. And an army that is not intelligent seizes upon the unfortunate guard at the gate as upon a life preserver. There is no alternative, it is necessary to return to the basic truth, that so many in Israeli society have been trying for years to repress: the seeds of the violence were sown on the seventh day of the Six-Day War. That was the beginning of the dunghill of the conquest. The caravan of the conquest galloped forwards, with arrogance and hutzpa, first under the leadership of the Labor Movement, and afterwards by the crushing steamroller of the Likud. One of the rotten fruits of the conquest is the settlements. They were and remain the watershed that separates the solution of the conflict and its perpetuation. That which occurred in the State of Israel during 27 years of conquest is a known process, which was diagnosed among the German people in the transition period from the democratic Weimar Republic to the tyranny of the Third Reich. Professor 'Amos Funkstein, who holds the chair for the History and Philosophy of the Sciences and Ideas at Tel Aviv University, said in a newspaper interview: "Between 1933 and 1937, up to Kristallnacht, the situation of the German Jews was better, from several aspects, than that of the Arabs of the territories...legal approaches were more open to the German Jews than to the residents of the territories" (HA'ARETZ, 9 December 1988). The reference, of course, is to the first stages of the Third Reich, in the 1930's, long before the outbreak of the war and the establishing of the extermination camps. That was the stage in which good persons, who were not Nazis, acquiesced in a reality of racism and violation of human rights, became accustomed to it, and found themselves serving it, some out of loyalty "to the people and to the state," some out of conformism, some out of fear and calculation. From here, it was a short road to animalization and insensibility of writers, musicians, academics, judges, attorneys, actors, and others. The poison was absorbed in all systems of the society. That is what happened in Israel, as well, "the only democracy in the Middle East." But in Israel, in contrast to the first stages of Germany in the 1930's, the blade of massive and arbitrary arrests was not placed on the neck of the citizens and there was no fear of a secret police that was liable to burst into homes at midnight. The collaboration with the conquest was generally done voluntarily in Israel. The willingness of most of the Israeli elite to cooperate with the conquest over time created a conceptual confusion, the apartheid reality, the acquiescence in the evil. It is expressed in the professors at the Hebrew University continuing with their researches and their academic lives as usual, at the same time that at a distance of five minutes from them they closed universities, sent professors and students to administrative detention and shot at them with live ammunition. It happened to attorneys who agreed to serve as judges in military courts and in that way turned overnight from defenders of the rights of the accused into abusers of human rights and servants of an oppressive system. It happened to physicians who forgot their oaths and gave daily approvals, either by closing their eyes or by direct support, to a terrible system of tortures. Many harsh testimonies about cooperation with the conquest authorities by Israeli physicians, who served in the conquered territories on reserve and regular duty, were uncovered at an international convention that was held in ZOA House in Tel Aviv under the auspices of the association of Israeli-Palestinians Physicians for Human Rights (It seems to me that DAVAR was the newspaper that first revealed the existence of that IDF [Israel Defense Forces] form in which a doctor confirms the ability of an interogatee to undergo torture). It is self-evident that this happened to reserve soldiers, who in crossing the Green Line became conquerors harassing a civilian population, sometimes maliciously and with astonishing cruelty. Given all this, there is no reason to be amazed at orders on opening fire that discriminate between rulers and ruled. Barukh Goldstein is not a sole lunatic, and it is impossible to define him as a wild outgrowth of a Jewish Hamas. Barukh Goldstein lived in Qiryat Arba, with the support of the secular State of Israel. All the military might of the Israeli conquest power was spread over him. He was part of the conquest army, received uniforms and weapons from the secular military establishment, was not denounced and was not expelled from the system when he refused, during the Lebanon War, to treat a wounded Arab. He enjoyed full backing from the governments of Israel over the years. If we adopt the principles of the Cohen Committee about indirect responsibility, then many of the "leaders" in Israeli society--in politics, in academe, in arts, in all of the intellectual frameworks--bear indirect responsibility for the atrocities of the conquest. The decision of the Israeli government to forbid the political activities of the Kahanist movements, and the administrative detention of several of the activists, not only are inconsistent with proper administration of a democratic state, but it is also doubtful whether they are especially effective. As long as they are surrounded by a sympathetic political environment in the form of the settlements, Gush Emunim, parties such as "Tsomet", "Moledet", and the militant parts of the Likud, the Kahanist cancer will continue to send out its satellites to additional parts of the body. It must be admitted that there is no essential difference between a "legitimate" racist such as MK [member of Knesset] Yehosu'a Matz'a, for example, or the former MK Ge'ula Cohen, and the "new" terrorists Tiran Polak or No'am Federman. As it is no coincidence that the administrative detainee for several days, the president of the State of Judaea, Ben Horin, was previously an active member of "Kach" and today he is a member of "Tsomet". It is a natural transition within the family. These words have very practical implications. Whoever supported at one level or another the conquest and the settlements may say today: I thought that conqueror and conquered can live in harmony. I found that this is not feasible. Therefore, in order to break the bloody circle, I (please enter the appropriate name) support the removal of the settlements. It is not yet late.
