FBIS4-49700 "drchi090_n_94009" FBIS-CHI-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 Economic & Agricultural Industrial Growth `Steady' in April Industrial Growth `Steady' in April HK0905152094 Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in English 1357 GMT 9 May 94 HK0905152094 Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 9 (CNS) -- Statistics released by the State Statistical Bureau showed that industry maintained steady growth last April with state-owned industry stopping its slide and registering a rebound to some extent. The trend of stockpiling of products, worsening losses and acute shortage of capital still go upwards. The national industrial production was 20 percent up last April over the same period last year and 1.4 percentage points faster than the average growth in the previous three months. Of the gain, state-owned industry made up five percent, collective industry 31.4 percent and industry of other kinds 42.5 percent. The rebound for state-owned industry in recent times is mainly due to a slight lessening of short-term loans given to enterprises by banks since last March. They played a role to some extent in pushing forward enterprise production. Deep seated contradictions suffered by state-owned enterprises, however, still existed. As the market demand is relatively insufficient, sales of industrial products are far from ideal. The sales of industrial products last April was 2.2 percentage points lower than the growth in industrial production. The inventory of industrial products tended to go upwards month by month as a result. The value of stockpiled products by industry at the level of township and above showed a net gain of RMB [Renminbi] 20.6 billion late last March over late last February. The inventory of oil-bearing items, steel materials, some industrial chemicals and electro-mechanical items registered a rise of 20 percent over earlier this year. Shortage of capital, slow sales and serious debt have not yet been alleviated. Losses suffered by some enterprises tended to grow worse mainly because of sluggish sales, stockpiling of products and shortage of capital. There are to date some 25.7 percent of enterprises running in the red with state-owned enterprises making up 45 percent. Losses made by medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises last March was put at RMB 16.6 billion, RMB 5.9 billion up from the previous two months. State-owned industry showed relatively slow growth when compared with the rapid gain of overall industry in spite of its rise to some extent last April. State-owned industry finds it difficult to stand stiff competition with some of them operating under capacity. The number of enterprises either stopping production or in a state of a semi-halt to production increased while some of enterprises failed to pay wages, affecting workers' living and doing harm to social stability.
