The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the signing of these documents represents an important step toward decisively involving all sides in the continuation and finalization of the negotiations aimed at a global settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. Emphasizing the decisive contribution made by the United States to the achievement of these accords, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assesses that, through the sustained efforts by the international community, one can achieve viable and realistic understandings that will contribute to solving a large-scale conflict in the heart of Europe by political means, a conflict that causes tremendous human suffering and great material damage. The communique reaffirms the Romanian Government's complete readiness to contribute, through its means, to supporting the current positive processes of reestablishing peace and settling problems in keeping with the major interests of the newly emerged states on the territory of former Yugoslavia and of their neighboring countries in the interests of security and peace.
