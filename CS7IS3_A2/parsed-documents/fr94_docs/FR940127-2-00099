FR940127-2-00099 FR940127-2-00068 The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS should not unduly impact the market for the underlying securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket. First, the underlying securities comprising the portfolio are either well-capitalized stocks, or in the case of ADRS, represent in dollar terms substantial market value. 32 Second, the all but one of the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket, are subject to reporting requirements under the Act, and a large percentage of the portfolio securities are either listed or traded on, or traded over the facilities of, U.S. securities markets. 33 Third, the Exchange has surveillance agreements in place for a large percentage of the securities in the Telecommunications Basket for the sharing of market information. 34 This in addition to the Amex's surveillance procedures will serve to deter as well as detect any potential manipulation. Fourth, Lehman Brothers will not include quotations made by or through Lehman Brothers or its affiliates when calculating the value of the Telecommunications Basket. 35 Lastly, the Pricing Agent will agree to restrict information with respect to all calculations of portfolio securities so that individuals trading such securities on behalf of the Pricing Agent will only be able to receive such information through public means and not prior to its release to the public. 36 32 See supra notes 8&hyph;14 and accompanying test. 33 The Commission notes that 17 of the 24 component securities are traded on the NYSE, Amex, or through NASDAQ/NMS. 34 The Amex has information sharing agreements with the home markets for all the non-U.S. components included in the Basket except for Advanced Info. Services (Thailand); Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (Philippines); STET (Italy); and Telefonos de Mexico, S.Z. de C.V. (Mexico). See October 25 Letter, supra note 30. 35 January 6 Letter, supra note 6. 36 See January 13 Letter, supra note 17. The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register . The Commission finds that the proposal, as amended, is substantially similar to the MITTS products which were previously approved by the Commission for listing and trading on the NYSE. Furthermore, this proposal was published in the Federal Register for the full 21-day comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. Therefore, the Commission believes it is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex&hyph;93-40 and should be submitted by February 17, 1994. It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 37 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-93&hyph;40) is approved. 37 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 38 38 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
