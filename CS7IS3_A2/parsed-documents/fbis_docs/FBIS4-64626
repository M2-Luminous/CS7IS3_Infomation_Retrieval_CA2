When UN pressure became too strong in Gorazde, the Serbs shifted their troops again -- this time to the north of the country. Whereas the Serbs and Muslims are now concentrating their troops around Brcko, the United Nations is preparing the deployment of 12 unarmed military observers. Thus, nobody should be surprised if the Serbs play cat and mouse with the United Nations. We interviewed Defense Minister Volker Ruehe on this issue in our studio in Bonn shortly before this program. Good evening, Mr. Ruehe. [Ruehe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. [Wickert] Mr. Ruehe, is the credibility of NATO suffering if the Serbs withdraw their troops from one area -- from Gorazde, for example -- upon NATO pressure, but use them again in another place -- in Brcko, for example. [Ruehe] You are quite right. First of all, the credibility of the United Nations, under whose auspices the whole operation is being carried out, is being damaged. Yet NATO is also affected. We have seen that after the ultimatum for Sarajevo, things calmed down there. The Serbs then shifted their military actions to Gorazde. A resolution has now been adopted that covers all six safety zones. However, there are signs that the Serbs might again circumvent the decision. Precautionary measures have to be adopted to deter them because the international community, the United Nations, and NATO cannot allow the Serbs to lead them up the garden path. [Wickert] You discussed this issue in a five-hour meeting with the U.S. defense secretary on what could be done to improve deterrence. What was the result? [Ruehe] Well, we discussed other topics, too. I also visited the State Department. There have also been statements in Paris. I believe that a solution must be found to prevent what happened in Gorazde from being repeated. [Wickert] What solution do you consider conceivable? [Ruehe] International measures might be adopted with the United Nations. The safety zones might be enlarged on the basis of the existing formula to ensure that additional military action does not develop in other areas. We finally need a cease-fire and a situation in which violence is reduced so that the peace process can be advanced. In spite of all the ultimatums, one must never forget that a lasting solution is only possible if a peace agreement is concluded. However, it must be just so that it is not doomed to lead to another war. [Wickert] Why is the West not yet ready to accept Yeltsin's proposal for an international peace conference? [Ruehe] This is one possibility. But it will only be successful if violence can be stopped in Bosnia. Nothing would be worse than a peace conference that would be reduced to absurdity by military actions on the part of the Serbs. Thus, both things belong together: The implementation of a cease-fire everywhere in Bosnia and preparations for diplomatic efforts. The Russian proposal is quite interesting in this respect. A peace conference would then lead to a political solution. Yet, I would like to stress once more that the approval of the Serbian side is required. If one forces a completely unjust solution on the Muslims, this would be the beginning of the next war. Monitoring the implementation of such a peace agreement would be terrible for the United Nations and for NATO. [Wickert] The United States believes that lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia would be useful. You also support this measure. When will it be possible? [Ruehe] Well, we have endorsed such a move for a long time. However, one must also bear in mind that the number of soldiers on the ground who have saved the lives of tens of thousands of people -- particularly British, French, Danish, and Dutch soldiers -- has increased. They might be endangered. We are facing a dilemma and a conflict here. What I told the Americans is that we supported them on this issue in the past, but that it is now important to avoid a unilateral U.S. decision -- by Congress or by the President. Future decisions should be adopted jointly by Europe and the United States so that the situation does not become even more complicated. [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe. [Ruehe] You are welcome.
