According to plans, on 10 January a wall across the Atlantic should have fallen finally and German Lufthansa (LH) should now be serving the Transatlantic routes along with its American partner, United Airlines. The LH passenger arriving at New York should no longer be forced to wait for hours for his domestic connection in America, but be ready to change to United Airlines aircraft that are ready to depart. Similarly, LH flights to New York, for example, and then to Seattle with United, should be operated under the same flight number. Through this so-called code-sharing, LH flights would have been regarded as direct connections and thus be catapulted by the software to the top of the display in computer reservation systems. The Spurned Bride Is Slowing Things Down However, for the time being all that remains a vision, even though a breakthrough seemed so close last fall. Federal Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann and his U.S. counterpart, Frederico Pena, agreed on a new aviation treaty, while shortly afterwards Lufthansa and United agreed on cooperation. Nevertheless, the treaty has not been signed formally yet. The English version was accepted by Bonn in late October in time and sent back to Washington with comments; yet, there it is mainly United's competitors that are slowing things down. There is the spurned bride, American Airlines, which Lufthansa would have liked to have as its European partner. Then there is Delta, which, as an heir and purchaser of Pan Am's former European connections sees its current competitive edge dwindling. Although a spokesman for the U.S. Transport Department has now emphasized that one has acted according to the agreement and is currently treating it as if it has gone into effect. However, so long as there are still complaints from U.S. carriers about the agreement and the cooperation between Lufthansa and United, which has not been licensed yet, code-sharing has to be ruled out. In such a situation both sides do not hesitate to come up with mutual recrimination. There is the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] opposition in Bonn, which suggests that the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] transport minister concluded an agreement that was not legally watertight. Still, sources in Bonn are blaming Lufthansa and United for the dilemma. As a result of its unclear ownership situation -- the work force wants to take over 53 percent of the stock capital -- United is unable currently to stand up to the other American mega-carriers as far as lobbying is concerned. Moreover, Lufthansa was clearly slightly overeager and too optimistic when it announced the agreement would be implemented on 10 January. On the other hand, it was the Bonn government itself that created the impression in the fall that everything had been settled with the Americans. Only now does one begin to realize that, for example, the code-sharing rights are unclear as far as East Europe is concerned. And who would blame Lufthansa -- in the euphoria of the moment -- for releasing to its clients a concrete date for the coveted improvements on the trans-Atlantic route? What Is the Position of Secretary Pena? Such ups and downs actually miss the essence of the problem, which seems to lie with the U.S. Administration. There, Secretary Pena obviously is far from having the same position his German counterpart has meanwhile acquired in Bonn. After all, the negotiations certainly were not made any easier by the fact that they involved not only the Transport Department but also the State Department. Bonn currently is pinning its hopes on the fact that the Americans have to stick to the aviation agreement because they have enough problems of a similar nature with Japan, Holland, France, and England. Further talks between the two administrations obviously have been scheduled for the end of the month. Should the drumming on the American side only serve the purpose of getting as much out of it as possible, it would be a bad service to Lufthansa and United -- and, in particular, to their customers.
