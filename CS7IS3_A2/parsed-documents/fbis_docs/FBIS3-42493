Balyura, chairman of its Trade Union Committee, made an appeal to the editor's office of FLAG RODINY. The text of a document containing an appeal by the plant's blue and white collar workers to the Black Sea Fleet Military Council was forwarded by him for publication. It states in particular: It is with pain in our hearts that we appeal to you, as the element of collective leadership of the Black Sea Fleet, to help one of the oldest labor collectives of the Black Sea Fleet to survive and to preserve this unique plant carrying out comprehensive repairs on warships and vessels. An extremely serious, critical situation has evolved at the plant; specialists are being forced to work in an atmosphere of constant political and financial pressure. One of the main causes of the present situation is the absence of any progress in the 2-year negotiations on problems of the Black Sea Fleet, including on the status of ship repair plants. All of this has of course affected our productive and economic life. The plant's work has not been financed since 1993. The amount the fleet owes for work done now exceeds 5 billion karbovantsy. Promises of the command to pay its debts, and equally so the promises of the financial services of the Russian Navy regarding replenishment of the plant's working capital are not being kept. The enterprise's administration is unable to pay wages to the labor collective. Blue and white collar workers are no longer able to feed their families, while some are simply starving. Being a cost-accounting enterprise, the plant is forced to provide for its productive activity and for social protection of the collective at the expense of wages, and in order to survive, it is forced to accept vessels for repair from all organizations, from commercial to private, which are doing everything they can to get the plant to work for them. Moreover they have everything--licenses, financing, materials, deliveries. It should be kept in mind here that if this tendency continues to increase, this naval plant will lose its identity and its qualifications. The impression is created that it is to someone's advantage to destroy the plant, to destroy the structure of the fleet, and consequently its fighting capability. Everyone knows, after all, that respecializing the plant would mean losing a unique ship repair base, and losing qualified personnel that it has taken years to accumulate in ship repair. The critical financial situation also requires immediate adoption of a decision by the Military Council to pay the debt to the plant in full and to determine a procedure for financing ship repair. We see one solution here--providing financing through central financial bodies of the Russian Ministry of Defense. In behalf of our Black Sea Fleet we appeal to the Military Council to take all steps to save this oldest ship building enterprise, to immediately restore financing to programs in place, and to solve the problems of material and technical support. The plant collective awaits decisive actions that meet the requirements of the current situation.
