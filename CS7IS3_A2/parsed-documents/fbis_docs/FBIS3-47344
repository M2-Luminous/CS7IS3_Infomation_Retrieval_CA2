Vice trade ministers of the two countries kicked off three days of talks on auto trade, one of the industrial sectors covered by the bilateral "framework" trade negotiations agreed on last July. Sources close to the negotiators said Japan adamantly rejected the U.S. request, reiterating that too much government intervention in the private sector results in managed trade. The U.S. side showed some understanding toward the Japanese position, but asserted that the government has a role to play in making it easier for U.S. cars to enter the Japanese market, the sources said. They said the discrepancy will delay an agreement on the talks to next week or after. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of commerce for international economic affairs, met personally with Japanese makers to persuade them to agree to help increase sales of U.S. finished cars in Japan and entry by U.S. firms into the country's parts repair industry. A senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said later in the day that the bilateral talks will not be settled unless the U.S. drops its demand that Japan set numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japan's auto market. He noted there were no prospects of growth in the domestic demand for motor vehicles. "Under such circumstances, we can't urge domestic automakers to buy more parts from U.S. parts suppliers because they have shut down some of their factories and imposed tough demands on their subcontractors," said the official, who declined to be identified.
