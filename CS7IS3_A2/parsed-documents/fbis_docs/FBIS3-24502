P. Markova; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] Based on the methods of parallel microprogramming, a method is proposed for transformation of a two-dimensional structure into a three-dimensional. Two options are described here of the proposed multiplication algorithm of two integer n-digit numbers with a fixed comma. Using these algorithms, structural multiplier circuits on electrooptical programmable logic array (PLA) are designed with a different number of layers k> 2p, where p is the number of logic layers, and the complexity of their implementation are estimated. The fundamental concepts of parallel microprogramming and the basic multiplication algorithm of integer n-dimensional numbers are described. Single layer electrooptical models of the proposed and the developed multipliers are discussed. Different stratification options of the multipliers and the difficulties involving their realization with electrooptical programmable logic arrays are also discussed.
