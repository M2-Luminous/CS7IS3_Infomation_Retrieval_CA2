The newspaper reports that the faction opposing [Shining Path leader] Guzman held a meeting in March in the Huanta Province mountains in southern Peru. During the meeting this faction agreed to disregard Guzman's peace proposal. The report also indicates that during this meeting a new Shining Path "central committee" was formed, and that this "central committee" expelled from the party the leaders who remain loyal to Guzman and who support peace, describing them as "traitors, infiltrated people, capitulators, and old revisionists." According to the report the new "committee" is headed by Shining Path leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade Feliciano," one of the Shining Path founders. Former Deputy Carlos Tapia, another expert in Shining Path activities, stressed today that "Shining Path no longer represents a threat, and in a way we may coexist with this type of violence as is the case with the IRA [Irish Republican Army] in Ireland and the ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] in Spain." Nevertheless, Tapia ruled out the possibility of the terrorist organization's immediate disappearance, "as the social processes that have been brewing for so long may not end overnight, and some time is required for their extinction."
