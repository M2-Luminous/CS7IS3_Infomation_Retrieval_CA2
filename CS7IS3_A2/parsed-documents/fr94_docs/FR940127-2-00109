FR940127-2-00109 FR940127-2-00071 Comments on Specific Provisions of the Proposed Rule Change Commentators offered several specific suggestions and sought guidance from the Board in a number of areas of the proposed rule change. Customer Account Data and Suitability Determinations The proposed rule change includes an amendment to rule G&hyph;19(b) which states that, for retail customers, prior to making a recommendation a dealer must ``make reasonable effort to obtain information concerning: (i) The customer's financial status; (ii) the customer's tax status; (iii) the customer's investment objectives; and (iv) such other information used or considered to be reasonable and necessary by such broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer in making recommendations to the customer.'' Two commentators were concerned as to what would happen if all such information could not be obtained. As indicated in the Request for Comments, the language of the proposed rule change does not necessarily preclude a dealer from making a recommendation if all items of information enumerated in the proposed amendment to rule G&hyph;19(b) cannot be obtained. Given the nature of the transaction ( e.g., the nature of the security and the known items of information about the customer), the dealer may have enough customer data to make a specific, affirmative suitability determination for the recommendation, even if the customer refuses to provide some of the requested information. However, reasonable efforts must be made to obtain all customer information listed in the proposed amendment to rule G&hyph;19(b), in any event. As noted above, the amount of customer information that is required to make a suitability determination depends in part upon the nature of the transaction recommended. With respect to some types of transactions_for example, those in more speculative securities_the amount of information needed to make a suitability determination will be greater than if a more conservative recommendation is being made. One commentator requested that the Board provide guidance on this subject by specifying ``core'' suitability information that must be obtained from a customer even when making a ``conservative'' recommendation. That commentator also requested that the Board provide specific guidance on what would be considered ``more speculative'' securities for which more detailed customer account data would be needed. The proposed rule change to rule G&hyph;19(b) states that dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain certain ``core'' customer suitability data for recommendations to non-institutional customers including: (i) The customer's financial status; (ii) the customer's tax status; (iii) the customer's investment objectives; and (iv) such other information used or considered to be reasonable and necessary by such broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer in making recommendations to the customer. The Board notes that if, after reasonable efforts, a dealer cannot obtain all such information regarding a customer, but nevertheless desires to proceed with a ``conservative'' transaction, the dealer must exercise its judgment, based on known information about the customer and the security, as to whether a suitability determination can be made. Furthermore, all information about the customer that is used in making this determination must be recorded in the customer account record under rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi)(F). The Board also believes it to be inadvisable to attempt to provide detailed guidance on whether a particular security or proposed transaction is more ``conservative'' or more ``speculative.'' The Board notes that dealers will have to make such decisions based on their knowledge of the security and the risks involved in the transaction. Attempts to state a universally applicable formula for such considerations could encourage the substitution of simplistic guidelines for the broader judgment that is sometimes required to determine whether a proposed municipal securities transaction includes a relatively low or high degree of risk. Unsolicited Transactions Several commentators requested that the Board provide guidance on how to identify and document ``unsolicited'' transactions, i.e., transactions that are not recommended. Neither the current version of rule G&hyph;19 nor the proposed rule change precludes dealers from executing specific transactions at the request of customers, where no recommendation is made. Thus, the suitability requirements of the proposed rule change would not apply to such ``unsolicited'' transactions. The Board notes, however, that most municipal securities transactions are made in connection with recommendations. Because of its concern with customer protection and in recognition of the special characteristics of the municipal securities market, the Board views the term ``recommendation'' (and the application of the Board's suitability requirement) broadly. For example, with respect to transactions occurring after investment seminars and in response to a dealer's advertisements, the Board has indicated that the suitability requirements of G&hyph;19 apply ``in the same way they apply to all other recommendations made to customers.'' Thus, although transactions may, in some instances, be ``unsolicited'' if a customer places an order for a specific security, transactions cannot be considered unsolicited if the order occurs after a dealer has mentioned a specific security to a customer ( e.g., in a listing of offerings, an advertisement or in any other communication by the dealer to the customer).
