FBIS4-57137 "drlat093_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-093 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Peru `Red Path' Seeks To Gain `Strategic Balance' `Red Path' Seeks To Gain `Strategic Balance' PY1205013594 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 4 May 94 p A2 PY1205013594 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Text] Following orders given about a month ago by Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, now known by his followers as "President Feliciano," members of the self-styled "Red Path" dissident Shining Path faction have implemented a plan that seeks to recover their strategic balance. As is well known, this strategic balance was lost with Abimael Guzman's fall and with the disruption of the leaderships of the central, permanent, and political committees that were in charge of leading the subversive war. This is the conclusion of a report drafted by intelligence analysts and strategists after talking with Shining Path members at the grassroots and leadership levels, who availed themselves of the Repentance Law and who are now important collaborators in the struggle against narcoterrorism. Opposed to Gonzalo's [Abimael Guzman's] leadership, "Red Path" is made up of groups that have been acting independently for several years with the support of narcotraffickers located in the coca-growing corridor established in the jungle area going from Amazonas to La Convencion (Cusco), and more recently part of Madre de Dios (Manu). Based on confessions made by repentant Shining Path members, it has been established that the "Red Path" is striving to reactivate seven areas in the outskirts of Lima that before Guzman's fall were controlled by Shining Path and were considered red areas. Area residents were constantly harassed and did not dare to erase the so-called "people's bulletin boards" (subversive graffiti). And even less to report them, despite knowing who they were. These areas were El Carmen, Collique, and Ano Nuevo (Comas); the former Bocanegra ranch (Callao); the San Cosme, El Pino, El Agustino (La Victoria), and Canto Grande (San Juan de Lurigancho) hills; Sectors 1 and 4 (Villa El Salvador); Huachipa, Ate-Vitarte (Central Highway); and Villa Maria del Triunfo and San Juan de Miraflores, which form a single bloc. This is where the Red Path faction members want to return. Repentant Shining Path leaders, who have presented themselves at the 303d Battalion at the Huallaga Front and at other barracks throughout the country, have reported that Ramirez Durand, taking partial advantage of the campaign against the Army in view of alleged human rights violations, is trying to prevent a vast sector of Lima shantytown residents and some peasant communities from identifying themselves with the democratic system of government and the democratic state. To do that, an effort would be made in those sectors -- called the masses by Ramirez Durand -- to create a generalized environment of insecurity and fear of the Armed Forces. Therefore, distorted cases of human rights violations have been reported, such as the report that the Army was bombing towns which were in reality a few shacks used by coca growers and drug traffickers as refuge. He also ordered -- we saw that in the last few weeks, the repentant subversives said -- the intimidation and murder of popular leaders in the settlements to gradually take over the positions of leadership so as to be able to take control over the population. He also wants to get a number of rural settlements in the Lima area to passively accept the now-called "Red Path," as happened in the past with the Shining Path. The repentant subversives said Ramirez Durand's recommendations include the reactivation of popular theaters and folk music groups, and the infiltration of work centers, especially in the factories located on the central highway where a few years ago, on orders from Abimael Guzman, anti-Shining Path union leaders and executives were murdered. In this regard, intelligence sources indicated that the Shining Path members who had infiltrated some factories, and who after Abimael Guzman was captured, have been keeping a low profile, would again become active in planning to take over the unions and create chaos. According to political analysts, what Ramirez Durand does not seem to understand is that it is only possible to reach a strategic equilibrium before the turning point of the war, and never after. In other words, when the struggle is on its way to victory, and never, as it is happening with the Shining Path, when it is obviously on its way to defeat. The experts say that no matter how many attacks are carried out by terrorism, they will not frighten the population and will under no circumstances win their support, as, according to the latest surveys made by intelligence circles, the people who migrated from the subversive areas reject the subversive ideology. For example, the recent murder of boxer Carlos Lavalle Gonzales and other leaders has only created greater repudiation of the Shining Path. In view of a new offensive, intelligence strategists recommend the reinforcement of the self-defense committees in the outskirts of Lima, with the support of the Armed Forces. The analysts believe that the reinforcement of the urban defense patrols and night watches, and a better rapprochement with political and military authorities, will help reject any maneuver aimed against the democratic system. Now, in contrast with the past, the state and society have shown they are capable of defeating subversion.
