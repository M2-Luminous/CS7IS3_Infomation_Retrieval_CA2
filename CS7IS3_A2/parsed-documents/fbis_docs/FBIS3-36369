As we reported earlier, the post of this newspaper's director-general is occupied by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's former press secretary and advisor Pavel Gurin. The government's spokesman told our correspondent, who was denied access to the presidium's first official meeting, like his colleagues from ITAR-TASS, RIA and other news agencies, that this instruction had been issued by Chief of the government's Staff Vladimir Kvasov. He added that the results of the Cabinet's meetings would be highlighted during briefings to which reporters would be invited. Our correspondent also reports that over the past two years this was the first time when the press was denied access to a Cabinet's meeting which did not deal with "closed" issues.
