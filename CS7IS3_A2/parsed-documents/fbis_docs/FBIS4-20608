It has current capacity of 2,500 amperes, the highest for an oxide superconductor, and the amount of heat penetration into helium is .412 watts per kiloampere. It can be used as current lead wires for superconductive magnetic energy storage (SMES) devices and other equipment that apply superconductivity, and its performance does not degrade in magnetic fields. Two types of lead wire were developed; one has 500 ampere capacity and the other 2,500 amperes. In the 500 ampere lead wire, a silver-clad, bismuth-based oxide semiconducting wire 3.5 millimeters (mm) wide and 0.15mm thick has been laminated. As for the 2,500 ampere lead, a modified version of the 500 ampere wire is the standard unit, and 4 of them are set side by side. Total length of the wire is 560mm, and it is fixed in an epoxy resin support material to increase mechanical strength. Generally, copper has been used for current lead wire for superconductive equipment, but the wire has to be thicker for stronger current and the generation of joule heat caused by the resistance of the material itself also is a problem. That is why hopes have been pinned on oxide superconductors, which have superior heat penetration. Until now, however, maximum capacity achieved with a yttrium-base wire was 1,800 amperes.
