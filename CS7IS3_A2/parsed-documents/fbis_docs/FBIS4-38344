This was disclosed to the press by the leader of the Crimean Tartar Mejlis Mustafa Jamilev who met Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in Kiev on Monday. According to Jamilev, Ukraine has made much greater concessions to Crimean separatists than it should have. He was satisfied with the fact that now Kiev holds a tougher, principled approach to Crimea. The head of the Mejlis called Crimea an illegal republic of colonists. He said that the future course of development in Crimea depends on how much Russia and other neighbors are going to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Jamilev said there are signs today that Russia will continue interfering in the situation. In his opinion, the pressure of the world community could have a certain effect keeping Russia from actions that destabilize the situation in the Crimea. Jamilev said the Turkish president promised to finance the construction of about 1000 apartments for Crimean Tatars.
