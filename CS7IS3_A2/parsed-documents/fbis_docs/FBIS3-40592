Some of you are followers, and some of you who oppose it are also readers of the daily MUSAWAT. Therefore, an issue that requires a lot of contemplation is being presented to you all men and women. You will remember that until the fall of the Nawaz Sharif government, for about 14 years, the late Mr. Bhutto's son, Murtaza Bhutto, was declared responsible for about 90 percent of all terrorist activities, as the founder and leader of the al-Zulfiqar organization. All efforts were made to accuse Murtaza Bhutto and the al-Zulfiqar organization of every political assassination, relentless firing incident, and bomb blast. In this context, the so-called independent communications media also played a condemnable role, and declared Murtaza Bhutto, the founder of a terrorist organization, al-Zulfiqar, a dangerous traitor and enemy of society. Some of them tried to prove all this, and, at times, they accused Madam Benazir Bhutto of protecting al-Zulfiqar. Madam Bhutto has always denied this, and has expressed her contempt for violence in politics. The communications media always presented the activities of the so-called al-Zulfiqar with large headings and in several columns. When news about the denial of such efforts was made available, and those PPP members were honorably acquitted by the court, they were published in the newspaper in an obscure manner. Now this same communications media and bureaucracy are going through a revolutionary change. The communications media that was always in the forefront for assassinating Murtaza Bhutto's character is publishing news even when Murtaza Bhutto sneezes, as if it has been a heavy blow to the nation. After all, Murtaza Bhutto is the son of the martyred Bhutto. He is also Nusrat Bhutto's son and Madam Benazir Bhutto's brother. Now, even news about the laughing and crying of his wife, Ghanui Murtaza, and his son, Zulfiqar Murtaza, are being printed on the front page. We can say to the media about this sudden change: "Oh, camel, do you have any part of your body straight?" However, just presenting this proverb is not enough. This is a very deep and dangerous game, and many masked players are involved in it. These are the same elements that have always tried to destroy the PPP and have wanted to topple its national position, so that they could gain their group and personal interests. They wanted to destroy this party totally. At first, they targeted this party and its leaders using al-Zulfiqar, and when all their illegal efforts failed to end the party's unity and national status, they declared the party to be controlled by a dynasty. They still failed. They then declared this a party of Sindh and the Sindhi people. The unity of the party workers all over the country did not allow them to succeed in their efforts. Those same faces want to play the same dangerous game in the name of Murtaza Bhutto. The readers must remember that Nawaz Sharif used to target Murtaza Bhutto in his meetings in Punjab. He used to repeat the accusations levied against him, and try to prove that Benazir Bhutto was politically associated with Murtaza Bhutto, in order to hurt Benazir's position in Punjab. He also declared Murtaza Bhutto an enemy of the country. At the same time, when he would go to Sindh, he asked Murtaza Bhutto's uncle, Mumtaz Bhutto, for cooperation and agreement. He also announced starting of Murtaza Bhutto's election campaign. Even before the government had taken back its accusations against Mumtaz Bhutto, his identity card was issued, and at the same time, his nomination papers were approved. The late Mr. Bhutto's election symbol, "a fist," was also given to him. Dear readers, we do not mind Murtaza Bhutto's return to the country, his running for election, or the fact that he has formed a separate committee with a separate symbol. These are all good things. Murtaza Bhutto has the right to return to Pakistan, and as a Pakistani, he has the right to run for election. He also has the right to form a separate organization. However, Murtaza Bhutto has not decided how to use all these rights, and who will cooperate with him now. Have not these people opposed his father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, in the past? Have not they been involved in a dangerous conspiracy against Benazir Bhutto and his father's party? We are sure that this has happened continuously, and this is evident from Murtaza Bhutto's actions. For example, Mumtaz Bhutto has separated from his supporter, Sabak Majid, and entered the political arena. Sabak Majid was a spokesperson for the party's bitter enemy, Jam-i Sadiq Ali and was almost a "martyr" in his anti-Benazir efforts. He did not even get a taste of a false case against him, as Benazir Bhutto, her associates and supporters, and her husband, Aasif Zardari, did. Some of them had to suffer in jails and be separated from their children and wives. All these are important instruments for strengthening a nation's foundation. Let us think for a second. Mir Murtaza Bhutto is elected from two National Assembly election districts and six or seven state election districts. (This is not possible, though.) The first thing to note here is that he will have to give up either the national or the state assembly membership. He will have to resign from all the state assemblies he is elected to and keep one National Assembly seat. This way, by representing Murtaza, he will not only act against Benazir, but also fulfill his efforts of 14 years against Murtaza's late father's party. Second, Mumtaz Bhutto is a non-political person, whose non-political and irresponsible actions made the citizens of Sindh hate the PPP. Because of his non-political actions, the PNA [Pakistan National Alliance] campaign in Sindh emerged against the late Mr. Bhutto. In addition, after having Mr. Bhutto hanged, Mumtaz Bhutto showed his deplorable and condemnable cowardice by becoming quiet. In other words, he established a front to sabotage Bhuttoism. Finally, we would like to request that Mir Murtaza Bhutto, if he is elected or loses the election in his political effort, through the people's support or lack thereof, must do his political duty. Dear readers, you and I know that Murtaza Bhutto is the son of the late Mr. Bhutto and Mrs. Nusrat Bhutto, and is Benazir Bhutto's brother. He had been leading a life of self-imposed exile for a long time. His politics have been the politics of crooks. Therefore, instead of popular support, he has the support of a group only. Second, the former governments had always given him bad publicity. Therefore, he failed to get popular support. He had not done any public service. All he did was impose exile on himself, and had one member or another of his Shaheed Committee run for the National Assembly. In this situation, Murtaza Bhutto should consider that if he wins two seats, then he will either be a rolling stone in the National Assembly, will play the role of a second-class politician, or will become the victim of horse-trading. He will be unable to form an important role for himself. He will always have the opposition of the members of his late father's party, because he will be running against them. The second fact is that if he gives up his seat in the National Assembly and maintains a seat in the state assembly, even if six or seven other seats remain with his supporters, then Mir Murtaza Bhutto should ask himself: "In this large house, if the other party has the majority, will I sit with the opposition party?" Just like other pro-MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] people, where every party has two or four members, will he also become a toy in the hands of the MQM or the Nawaz group with his seven members? That is what happened to Jam-i Sadiq, Muzaffer Shah, and the Jatoi groups in the past. He must think about all the facts and find out if he would be able to play a clear and important political role in this situation. In our opinion, first of all, whether or not he runs for election, and whether he wins or loses, he should request that the courts pardon all the cases against him. After he is excused from all these accusations, he should then come to the people. He should work toward providing stability to the government, and should serve the nation and the people, as his martyred father wanted. He should cooperate with his sister, Benazir Bhutto. He should free himself from such nonpolitical people as Mumtaz Bhutto and corrupt people like Sabaq Majid. If, after Benazir relinquishes politics, he wants to lead the party in the future, then he should first work as a party member. He should establish his place in the party. He should get out of corrupt politics, and should think about the nation, the people, and the world. He should adopt moderation and prudence in his politics. All this can be attained. He should attain it when he gives up the Shaheed Committee and joins the party of the martyr. He should give up the symbol of "fist" and take up the symbol of the "arrow," because an arrow has a much farther reach than a fist.
