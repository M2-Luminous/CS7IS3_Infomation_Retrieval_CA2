FR940527-1-00084 FR940527-1-00014 We now have limited, but significant, data available on the impact of the obligated capital provisions. Since the beginning of the capital prospective payment system, the Medicare intermediaries have compiled a special data set to monitor the implementation of the system. These intermediary data have provided us with information concerning virtually all hospitals that have requested recognition of obligated capital and the amount, if any, of the obligated capital approved by the intermediary. Using this data, we have been able to develop some relevant comparisons. The data show, for example, that nationally 42.9 percent (2,281 out of 5,316) of all hospitals requested recognition of obligated capital. A total of $21.2 billion in obligated capital has been recognized by the intermediaries. The average amount of obligated capital recognized is $9.3 million per requesting hospital. Since most of the comments concerning the effects of the CON provision have come from a small group of hospitals in one particular State with a lengthy CON process, we compared the data for that group of hospitals, and the hospitals in that State as a whole, with the national average and the averages for similar States. We found that the group of hospitals that has recommended revisions to the current rule had an average approved amount of obligated capital far above the national average approved amount per requesting hospital. All of the 21 hospitals in the group in question requested recognition of obligated capital. Furthermore, 17 of those hospitals (81 percent) received at least partial approval of that request. The average amount of obligated capital approved was $139.5 million. Since 1 of these 21 hospitals received approval for an extraordinarily large obligated capital project, we also computed the average amount of obligated capital approved for the other 20 hospitals. Even excluding the hospital with the extraordinarily large project, the average amount of obligated capital approved in the group in question is $67.5 million. This group of 21 hospitals, in fact, accounted for 13.8 percent of all the obligated capital recognized in the country (6.4 percent for 20 hospitals, excluding the hospital with the extraordinarily large project). This group of hospitals also has averages of obligated capital approved that are significantly above the average for the State in which they are located. In turn, the averages for the State in which they are located are significantly higher than the averages for similar States (that is, States with large populations, CON processes, and/or large urban areas). Although the fiscal intermediary data base contains data on the amount of obligated capital approved for each hospital, it does not include data on the amount of obligated capital requested by each hospital. We are therefore unable to develop ratios of obligated capital approved to obligated capital requested for specific hospitals and groups of hospitals in order to determine whether that ratio is lower for this group of hospitals than the average for any regional or other groups of hospitals. However, we believe that the large amounts of obligated capital approved for the hospitals that have requested revision of the current rules indicate that the current rules do not disadvantage hospitals subject to lengthy CON processes. In addition, our current data also cannot show how much of the obligated capital tentatively approved by the intermediaries will eventually meet the deadlines imposed under the general rule for obligated capital and each of the special rules for putting assets into use for patient care. Under the general rule, the asset must be put in use for patient care no later than October 1, 1994 (which is 45 months after the latest date by which the asset must have been obligated under the general rule). In cases of extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control, that deadline can be extended to no later than September 30, 1996. For hospitals in CON states, the deadline for putting the asset into use for patient care is the earlier of September 30, 1996 or 4 years from the date of CON approval (ยง412.302(c)(2)(D)). Thus, under current regulations, hospitals that receive CON approval after September 30, 1992 may have less than 4 years to complete the project in order to meet the deadline. In the interests of maintaining an equal playing field for those hospitals, we are proposing to change the deadline for putting assets into use for patient care to the later of September 30, 1996 or 4 years from the date of CON approval. We believe that establishing any later deadline for hospitals in CON states would violate the principle of equal treatment by giving those hospitals an advantage over hospitals that must satisfy the upcoming deadline established in the general rule for obligated capital. On the basis of the available data, it appears that the existing CON provision has otherwise given this group of hospitals fair access to the special protection for obligated capital. The amounts of obligated capital approved for the affected hospitals simply do not support the need for more extensive relief to these hospitals in the context of the obligated capital provisions. Revision of practically every element of the obligated capital provision would be required to accommodate all the requests of the affected hospitals. Since it appears the CON rules have provided fair access to obligated capital protections, we do not believe that it would be appropriate to propose significant changes. We are therefore proposing no other revisions to the obligated capital rules at this time. However, this does not mean that revisions to other provisions of the capital prospective payment system, such as the exceptions process, are also unwarranted. The same hospitals that have recommended changes in the obligated capital rules have also recommended policy measures in connection with exceptions payments under the prospective payment system for capital-related costs. Specifically, these hospitals have asked that the present 80 percent minimum payment level for urban hospitals with at least 100 beds and a disproportionate share percentage of at least 20.2 percent be guaranteed through the rest of the transition and extended for at least 10 years after the transition. While we do not propose to adopt those precise recommendations, we have tried to address the legitimate concerns of these hospitals in developing the revisions which we are proposing to exceptions payment policy below in section V.C. of this preamble.
