His interview with President Vaclav Havel, recorded at the beginning of May 1994, is being prepared for the Saralian magazine B-H DANI. Igor Blazevic offered the Czech version of the transcript to LIDOVE NOVINY and the English version to the INDEX ON CENSORSHIP magazine. [Blazevic] Mr. President, despite the political risk, you have many times expressed an opinion on the Bosnian issue. You have made repeated calls for a more resolute stance by the international community toward Bosnia. Can you tell us why? [Havel] There are three basic reasons that I air my views on this issue. I am firmly convinced that, in today's so manifoldly interconnected world, it is necessary to strengthen and systematically expand the feeling of universal responsibility. The fact that we are all actually responsible for the whole world applies not only in the case of military conflicts but also in ecology and many other spheres. I feel somewhat that the existence of an attitude of global responsibility is lacking in world politics. That is a kind of politico-philosophical reason. There is another more specific reason: The Czech Republic has had its own rather unfortunate historical experience of democracy's diminished ability to commit itself on behalf of the values that are intrinsic to it and upon which it is based. We saw this most explicitly in Munich. After the Munich diktat, Chamberlain said that he did not see why English boys should risk their lives for a far away country of which they knew little. We know the repercussions. The hope that human lives would be saved and the view that it is necessary to sacrifice some values in the name of peace turned out to be a sheer illusion. The result was the exact opposite. No lives were saved. In the end, many more were sacrificed. We can see certain parallels today, when the reluctance of the international community to enter more decisively into the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and throughout the former Yugoslavia may again have suicidal consequences, especially for Europe. The integrating Europe is founded on the principle of civic coexistence, the coexistence of different peoples, cultures, and religions. If, within an area that is an impermeable element of Europe's political actuality, these very values are in a brutal fashion being denied, trampled upon, and flouted in the name of nationalism and the principle of ethnic purity, this presents a direct threat to the values upon which Europe itself is based and upon which it is becoming integrated. The issue here does not involve mere solidarity with the suffering. It involves solidarity with one another because the principles for a secure life are endangered by indecision. The other reason lies, perhaps, in my character. I am simply one who gets angry about indifference to violence and lawlessness. If I sometimes air my views on this issue, I have to say that it is always accompanied by a certain shamefacedness that I am not one who can enter more forcibly into the situation and, even less so, one who will risk his life; it is accompanied by the shamefacedness that I am not the one making the decisions, but that this role falls to the international community--the North Atlantic Alliance, the European Union, and the United Nations. It is a little peculiar if the person giving the advice is not the one to bear the consequences of his decisions. Of course, if we envisage an international operation with the involvement of many states, it is possible to consider a form of participation by a Czech unit. Nevertheless, it is easier for a person not directly involved in decisionmaking to give advice on something than it is for the person who will bear the consequences of that decision to decide. However, it is true that, despite these moments of indecision, for some time now I have been pointing out, during various occasions on international forums, that the issue in Bosnia involves more than a local squabble, that it indeed involves the elementary values upon which not only European integration is based but upon which coexistence among people on the planet should be based in the future. Given the constantly increasing number of people on the planet, conflicts between nations or communities that feel their differentness with regard to others present a major threat, and that very differentness is the reason for conflicts. [Blazevic] You have criticized the Geneva talks. In a joint statement with Slovene President Kucan, you said that it is necessary for the international community to redefine its political aim in Bosnia. Do you think there is still a requirement and opportunity to change this aim? [Havel] I was made uneasy by the course of the Geneva talks. This unease grew with the impression that various uncontrollable warriors were capturing all sorts of territory and drawing different maps and that the Geneva conference was accepting their drawings, adopting them, and supplying and looking for maps of ethnic division that would suit all of the warring sides. I consider this to be a typical example of surrendering the defense of the values that should be the issue here. It created the impression that Karadzic was, in fact, suggesting to the Geneva negotiators the agenda for the negotiations. Therefore, I was quite skeptical; I was aware of a certain hypocrisy. It was as if the Geneva talks were held merely so it could not be said that nothing was being done. At the same time, they were based on the very logical and fundamental argument that the warring sides must sit down at the negotiating table and that it is necessary to agree upon a truce and ultimately peace by peaceful means. Moreover, in fact, the negotiators acceded to something that should be intrinsically alien to the institutions at such negotiations. What I mean is that borders cannot be changed and states cannot be divided by force. In this case, it even involved an internationally recognized state. At the same time, it is impossible to recognize a state within its existing borders and also conduct negotiations with uncontrollable armies on how it will be turned into several other states. Nevertheless, it seems that, since then, the situation has moved forward a little. The concept of a Muslim-Croatian federation, which would enjoy a kind of confederal relationship with Croatia, is, it seems, accepted as a solution by the citizens. If it were possible to eventually involve the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina in this federation as a recognized state and to restructure it on the federal principle--and I have grave doubts about this--this could be a way forward. We ourselves know what it is like to be two nations that sense their individuality and try to express it in a specific constitutional and legal manner. We tried to establish a just federation, which, as you know, did not succeed. So, we decided to separate by peaceful means. I understand that peoples here and there want to have their own state; I am not so lacking in understanding. There is a great deal of intermingling and affinity among the communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The network of coexistence here was so rich that division on the ethnic principle would never end. Each home, each family, and each village could draw a border. This is simply dragging things out ad absurdum. [Blazevic] Following your meeting with Lord Owen, you said that your views were not entirely harmonious. I would rather say that your views are entirely unharmonious. For many Bosnians, Lord Owen has become the symbol of a hesitant and pragmatic policy without vision. On the other hand, you, Mr. President, have become the symbol of a politician who insists on values but seems a little like a dissident who can raise his voice repeatedly but cannot fundamentally influence the decisions on "major" policy. Would you comment on this? [Havel] First of all, let me speak about Lord Owen. We indeed agreed that we have a somewhat different view. This does not mean that I do not respect him. This is a man who has good intentions and who has expended a great deal of energy. Nevertheless, I have very grave doubts about the road he is following. When he was here, we had a very friendly conversation. He said that he was going to Belgrade, where he wanted to meet President Milosevic, Karadzic, and others and that he wanted to conduct another dialogue with them from which something could be expected. This reminded me a little of the illusion that it is possible to convince a nondemocrat of something by charm alone. This is what Munich and Lord Runciman remind us of. The latter also had good intentions and came here to see how he could reconcile us with Hitler. This does not mean I am placing an equal sign between anyone and Hitler, of which, as I read, I am suspected of doing. I have even been suspected of being an enemy of the Serbian people. That is absolute nonsense. The very opposite is true: I disapprove of any kind of collective condemnation of nations, and I cannot be, from my very marrow, an enemy of any nation. I am the enemy of certain policies and certain actions taken by the Serbian leadership, especially Karadzic's Bosnian-Serb leadership. I condemn violence, fanaticism, and brutality. I do not condemn any nation, however. As far as my position is concerned, of course, I am not the one who will make the decisions. Nevertheless, I think that each voice has its own significance. When a person is a president, albeit of a small state that does not make decisions, his voice may perhaps be listened to more than if he were a private individual. And it makes sense to repeat certain things. I was criticized a year ago for recommending a more emphatic approach by the international community; it ultimately adopted this approach. It may have been a year later and, again, it was a little inconsequential, imperfect, and befuddled; nevertheless, it happened. I do not think this was because I made a statement a year ago. However, many people referred to this situation, and newspapers throughout Europe and America again and again subjected the indecisive and befuddled policy to critical reflection. This, undoubtedly, had an influence on the decision to issue threats of an air strike, whether in Sarajevo or later around Gorazde. In this instance, it was, of course, a little ambiguous. [Blazevic] The democratically oriented people in Bosnia-Herzegovina who were in favor of a multi-ethnic state now feel defeated by the nationalists and fascists. At the same time, they feel betrayed by the Western democracies. [Havel] I absolutely understand these feelings, and I know that, apart from the three warring sides, there is a powerful fourth side here--the side that does not want a war and that does not feel the need for confrontation among the individual ethnic groups. I am on the side of these people. However, whenever we say that someone has betrayed us, and when we are angry at someone, we have to associate this with certain self-reflection. After all, the leaders of the current conflict were once elected by someone. Karadzic was elected as the representative of a certain side in elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Society must reflect on its own mistakes or breakdowns and not only shoulder all the responsibility onto others. [Blazevic] When you speak about Bosnia--now, however, we are speaking not only about Bosnia--do you perceive a conflict between Havel the intellectual and Havel the politician? [Havel] I admit that this issue perhaps bothers certain commentators more than it bothers me. I do not feel that it is such a major problem. Fate has placed me in a role in which I must express my views--which I would have even if I were not president--in a manner corresponding to the responsibility arising from my position. I often have to choose other words, perhaps more diplomatic or cautious words, but I have to remain true to myself and say what I really think. I accept this as a new challenge and as a task that I am faced with, a task with which I have to come to terms. This is nothing new because life and fate have always confronted me with all sorts of strange tasks. And, perhaps, their novelty will, to a certain extent, encourage and provoke me into performing them.
