Wangchuck, 43, had been detained by the Taoyuan District Court since last Sept. 18 on charges of smuggling endangered species products and violating the wildlife conservation laws. Although Wangchuck holds a diplomatic passport, the prosecutors said the case was handled according to ordinary criminal procedures to demonstrate the government's determination in cracking down on smuggling and illegal trade in endangered species and related products. Taiwan and Bhutan do not have formal diplomatic ties. Police seized the 22 rhino horns, weighing 14.8 kilograms and nine bear gall bladders, reportedly worth U.S.$300,000 on the Taiwan market, when Wangchuck arrived at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport from Hong Kong Sept. 17, 1993.
