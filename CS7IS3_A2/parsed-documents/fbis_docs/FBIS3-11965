According to TSE President Luis Arturo Zaldivar, the results widely favored the governing Nationalist Republican Alliance Party, which obtained 35,081 valid votes. The leftist coalition of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, Democratic Convergence, and the National Revolutionary Movement obtained 12,409 votes, and the Christian Democratic Party obtained 12,557. The remaining political organizations obtained the following votes: Authentic Christian Movement, 462 votes; Unity Movement, 1,505 votes; National Conciliation Party, 5,820 votes; and the National Solidarity Movement, 542 votes. According to the report provided by the departmental boards, the total number of votes contested was 256; 4,280 were annulled for several reasons; and 1,903 voters abstained. The TSE president said those were the first official results he could provide because the departmental boards discuss every case to reach an agreement. He said, however, he had personally asked the board members to speed up the counting process so as to give the people the final results of the presidential election this afternoon. He added once the vote-counting process ends and the TSE reports those results, the tribunal will immediately proceed to make the legal call for the second round of the presidential election, in accordance with the Constitution and electoral law.
