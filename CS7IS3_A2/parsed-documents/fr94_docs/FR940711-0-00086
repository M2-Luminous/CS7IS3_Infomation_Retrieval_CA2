ACTION: Temporary regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains temporary regulations relating to the deposit of taxes by electronic funds transfer. The temporary regulations describe the taxpayers that must make deposits by means of electronic funds transfer, the types of taxes that must be so deposited, and when the deposits must commence. The temporary regulations reflect changes to the Internal Revenue Code made by section 523 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (NAFTA). The text of the temporary regulations also serves as the text of the cross-reference notice of proposed rulemaking on this subject in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register . DATES: These temporary regulations are effective July 11, 1994. For dates of applicability, see §31.6302&hyph;1T(h) of these regulations. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vincent G. Surabian, 202&hyph;622&hyph;6232 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 523 of NAFTA amended section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) by enacting a new subsection (h) authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the development and implementation of an electronic funds transfer (EFT) system to be used for the collection of depository taxes. The depository taxes are the taxes required to be deposited with an authorized financial institution or Federal Reserve bank pursuant to any regulations prescribed by the Secretary (generally FICA and railroad retirement taxes, income tax withheld, corporate income and estimated taxes, and various Federal excise taxes). The new system will be designed to ensure that the depository taxes are credited to the Treasury's general account by the due date of the deposit. Explanation of Provisions A. Current Tax Deposit System At present, taxpayers are required to deposit taxes with an authorized government depository (generally, a commercial bank or savings institution or a Federal Reserve bank) by various dates specified in regulations. Each deposit must be accompanied by Form 8109, Federal Tax Deposit Coupon, which contains the taxpayer's name, identification number, the amount and type of tax being deposited, and the tax period for which the deposit is being made. The government depository forwards the coupon to the appropriate IRS Service Center. The Service Center compares the information entered on the coupon with the liabilities reported by the taxpayer on the return for the applicable tax period. The funds are transferred by the depository to the Treasury on the business date following the date of the deposit. B. An Electronic Tax Deposit System Section 6302(h) of the Code authorizes a new system which will allow for the transfer of tax deposit amounts electronically from taxpayer accounts to the Treasury's general account. The new system will be phased in over a period of several fiscal years, beginning with fiscal year 1994 (October 1, 1993, to September 30, 1994), by gradually increasing the percentage of the total depository taxes required to be collected by EFT. The temporary regulations implement this phase-in by gradually increasing the number of taxpayers that must deposit all of their depository taxes by EFT. The requirement to deposit by EFT under these temporary regulations applies only to those taxpayers required to make deposits pursuant to regulations under section 6302 of the Code, and only for those taxes required to be deposited. At present, many small taxpayers are excluded from the various deposit requirements imposed by regulations under section 6302. For example, filers of Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, are not required to make deposits for any calendar quarter in which the net tax liability reported on the Form 720 does not exceed $2,000. Similarly, filers of Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, are not required to make deposits for any calendar quarter in which the liability reported on the Form 941 is less than $500. The temporary regulations, with one exception, do not apply to taxes with respect to wages for domestic service in the private home of an employer because these taxes are not required to be deposited but are remitted quarterly with Form 942, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return for Household Employees. The sole exception is if the employer is a sole proprietor filing Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, who chooses to report wages to household employees on that form. In order to achieve an expedited and orderly conversion to an EFT system, NAFTA prescribed a schedule of minimum percentages of taxes that must be deposited by EFT during a phase-in period. These percentages depend in part on whether the taxes are: (a) The taxes imposed by chapters 21 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), 22 (Railroad Retirement Tax Act), and 24 (Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages) of the Code, or (b) ``other'' depository taxes (generally corporate income taxes and various excise taxes). The statutorily prescribed minimum percentages for each year are as follows: ␣ 1Fiscal year 1Chapter 21, 22, & 24 taxes (percent) 1Other taxes (percent) 1994 3 3 1995 16.9 20 1996 20.1 30 1997 & 1998 58.3 60 1999 and later 94 94
