Only four days before crucial elections for the government, Cavallo harshly reacted to the pressure being exerted by Washington for the approval of this controversial draft bill. Cavallo said: "Since it is so important to them, let us use the patents law as a negotiating tool to obtain better terms for our exports." Among other things, the current patents law allows pharmaceutical laboratories to freely use formulas that do not belong to them, which has generated serious criticism and pressure by the U.S. Government. For more than a year now the official intellectual property draft bill has been blocked in Congress by government and opposition legislators who are against it. This is not the first time Cavallo has voiced doubts about the simple approval of the draft bill. What is more, during a recent economic team meeting, Cavallo and Economic Programming Secretary Juan Jose Llach agreed on the disproportionate U.S. interest in the draft bill's approval and what they are willing to grant in exchange. Cavallo now has asserted: "We will approve the patents law when we, in exchange, can join NAFTA or obtain greater facilities for the entry of our exports."
