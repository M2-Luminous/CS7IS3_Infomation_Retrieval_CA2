Vice Minister Song said that as long as North Korea fails to show its clear attitude toward our three-point demands, the South side will not go to dialogue. [Reporter] What were the results of today's talks? [Song Yong-tae] In a keynote speech, our side expressed regret for the fact that North Korea refused to allow the inspection of the radiochemical laboratory, which has been suspected of being a nuclear reprocessing facility, not keeping its pledge made with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], and that the international situation surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue has reached a serious phase. To this, the North Korean side again raised its four-point demands, and even demanded that our side clearly express its attitude regarding these demands. Moreover, the North Korean side demanded that we admit the fact that we used the working-level contact for rupturing North Korea-U.S. talks and that we apologize for this. Besides, the North side said that it regards as grave the the South side's act of leading North-South relations to a phase of confrontation, and unhesitatingly made radical remarks that it is ready to respond to dialogue with dialogue and to war with war. Our side strongly called on the North side to take practical steps to respond to our three-point demands, including immediate discontinuation of slander and defamation of our side's person in highest authority, in order to smoothly realize the exchange of special envoys and to improve North-South relations. A very vehement debate took place between us in the contact over our side's three-point demands and the North side's four-point demands, and the talk was finally ruptured. Moreover, the North side refused to agree on the date of next contact, and simply walked out of the room without shaking hands with us. [Reporter] Do you think that the exchange of the special envoy is completely nullified? [Song] There is no change in our basic position that we resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. We will keep the door open for dialogue. However, we will come to the table of dialogue with firm principles and with a dignified attitude, not in haste. We will watch the special meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. We believe that our efforts for the international cooperative system are more important than ever before. [Reporter] What are the countermeasures of the government at present? [Song] The government is reviewing all possible, many-sided measures to cope with all predictable situations. [Reporter] We heard that the North side made remarks about war and so forth during the talks. [Song] When the issue of international sanctions was put forward, the North side unhesitatingly made such provocative and radical remarks as "Seoul is not far from here," "Seoul will become a sea of fire," and so forth. We need to prepare ourselves for any situation that may possibly occur before us in the future. [Reporter] What was the North side's reaction to the proposal for designating the date of next contact? [Song] The North side claimed that if their demands are not met, the talks are unnecessary. [Reporter] Would the view that the talks will not be held for a considerable period of time be right? [Song] As the situation changes every day, we will watch the developments for the time being. [Reporter] What do you think the true intention of the North side in rupturing the talks is? [Song] It is not appropriate for me, a delegate to the talks, to comment on this. What I can say at this point is that when the nuclear inspection is incomplete, the North side seems to barely expect that a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks will be held, and that under the situation in which the effectiveness of its nuclear card, which is related to the survival of its system, is being gradually weakened, North Korea is trying to prevent such a situation.
