FR940819-2-00002 FR940819-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Farmers Home Administration Submission of Information Collection to OMB (Under Paperwork Reduction Act and 5 CFR Part 1320) AGENCY: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The information collection requirement described below has been submitted to OMB for expedited clearance under 5 CFR 1320.18. The Agency solicits comments on subject submission. This action is necessary in order for the Agency to amend its Farmer Programs servicing regulations to add the Disaster Set-aside (DSA) Program. This program will be made available to Farmer Program borrowers who operated a farm or ranch in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993 and was declared/designated a disaster area in accordance with FmHA regulations. Under this program, distressed borrowers will have the opportunity to move their next scheduled FmHA annual installment to the end of the loan term. The intended effect is to service disaster victims in an efficient and timely manner while keeping them in business. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding this submission. Comments should refer to the proposal by name and should be sent to: Lisa Grove, USDA Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kimberly R. Laris, Loan Officer, Farmer Programs Loan Servicing and Property Management Division, USDA, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., South Building, Washington, DC 20250, Telephone (202) 720&hyph;4572. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agency has submitted the proposal for collection of information as described below, to OMB for clearance as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). It is requested that OMB approve this submission within 10 days. The supporting statement attached explains the need for adding FmHA Regulation 1951&hyph;T, Disaster Set-Aside Program. Authority: Section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507. Supporting Statement 7 CFR 1951&hyph;T, Disaster Set-Aside Program 1. Explanation of the circumstances that make the collection of information necessary. The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) is requesting expedited clearance of the paperwork burden for this regulation. Approval is requested in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act and 5 CFR 1320. Eighty percent of the 3,151 counties serviced by FmHA were declared disaster areas in 1993. Due to heavy flooding in the midwest and extreme droughts in the South, considerably more borrowers were affected by disasters in 1993 than in any of the previous five years. Although this program was initially begun for the borrowers who were affected by the 1993 disasters, it will also help those who are affected by the 1994 flood disaster in the South if they were also affected by the previous disasters in 1993. It will also be possible to consider extension of this program to assist borrowers affected only by the 1994 disaster. This consideration will be given prior to issuance of the final rule. In order to prevent massive delinquencies and farm failures, it is imperative that borrowers in a crisis situation receive immediate financial assistance. It is for this purpose and by the authority granted the Secretary under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (CONACT), Section 331A (7 U.S.C. 1981a), FmHA has made available the Disaster Set-aside Program. As provided in Section 331A, the Secretary has the authority to defer principal and interest at the request of the borrower on any outstanding loan made, insured, or held by the Secretary under the CONACT, subject to the borrower showing that due to circumstances beyond his/her control, he/she is temporarily unable to continue making payments when due without unduly impairing his/her standard of living. The set-aside program is designed to assist borrowers in financial distress who operated a farm or ranch in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993 and was declared/designated a disaster area as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter.
