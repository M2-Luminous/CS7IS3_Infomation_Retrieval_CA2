At present, this offensive seems to be centered on the government-held southern [as heard] city of Kuito, which is surrounded by UNITA forces. But to try and get a clearer picture of what's happening throughout the country, Emily Kasrils called the deputy foreign minister of the ruling MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government, Jorge Chikoty. On the line to Luanda last night, she started by asking him about the latest situation in Kuito: [Begin recording] [Chikoty] Well, the latest situation we have on Kuito is very, very bad. There are about six UNITA divisions that have been shelling the city of Kuito for the past few weeks [indistinct words] as many as eight people dead and 20 people wounded including a number of children. There is still a lot of fighting around the city of Kuito, and we are rather concerned about this situation. We think that UNITA's strategy is to take over the city of Kuito before major steps in the negotiations taking place in Lusaka are (?taken). [Kasrils] There also appears to be fighting in the oil enclave of Cabinda, where UNITA has reportedly made an alliance with the FLEC [Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave] group. Now, this is going to have serious implications for your funding of your military campaign in Angola, isn't it? [Chikoty] No. What I think is that in Cabinda we do not have major military movements from UNITA, but we know that there is in fact some kind of a link between UNITA and the FLEC-FAC [Cabinda Armed Forces], which is quite an old alliance. But we do not think that UNITA has the capacity of taking over the (?fields) of Cabinda. [Kasrils] But most of your revenue that you are using to fight the war with UNITA is derived from Cabinda and, therefore, anything that happens to those oil fields will have implications to your ability to fight. [Chikoty] Oil plays an important part in our budget for everything -- not only for the war, but also for all the other social and economic responsibilities that the government has. We are not surprised. This is not a new tendency in the Angolan war, but what we can say is that we do not think that UNITA has this capacity of taking over Cabinda. We are also hoping that there will be peace. The government's global strategy is not to go on fighting, but is to find a negotiable solution to the Angolan crisis. That is why we have been negotiating for eight months with UNITA. [Kasrils] But if things carry on like they are doing at the moment, it is just going to be that the killing is going to continue. The talks in Lusaka haven't reached any conclusion after eight months, and the people in Angola are going to continue dying because neither of you are able to come to an agreement. [Chikoty] We are saying is that UNITA is fighting for no reason. What I am trying to tell you is that UNITA has got to stop fighting against the legitimate government. What would you expect from us? Do you want us to abdicate from our responsibilities? It's not the government that has gone into fighting. It's UNITA that went into fighting. So, you cannot put UNITA and the government on the same table -- I mean on the same level. [end recording]
