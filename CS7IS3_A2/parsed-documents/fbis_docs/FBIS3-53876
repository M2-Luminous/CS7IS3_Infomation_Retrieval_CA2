The bases have been used for over a year as centers for social and medical services. A spokesman for the PFLP-GC has made the following statement: At exactly 1415 today, a formation of Zionist warplanes raided al-Na'imah region targeting a dispensary that belongs to the PFLP-GC and firing several missiles. Two workers in the dispensary sustained various injuries. Also, the dispensary building, in addition to several cars and surrounding buildings, sustained material damage. One of the two workers was died from his injury. Until the early hours of the evening, the Zionist enemy planes conducted reconnaissance missions over the region. Boat lights were also spotted off the al-Damur and al-Na'imah coasts. The spokesman added that the PFLP-GC, which was targeted by Zionist shelling for the second time in two weeks, declares that these strikes will only increase its resolve and strengthen its refusal to make peace with or recognize the Zionist enemy. It will continue to support the popular intifadah in Palestine until the defeat of the treasonous Gaza-Jericho agreement. The PFLP-GC reasserts that it will continue to adhere to armed struggle and jihad, in addition to national and Islamic resistance in southern Lebanon and Palestine, until the liberation of Palestine and all of the occupied Arab territories. It is a revolution until the liberation of man and land.
