Reports that Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, a PKK agent in south Cyprus who was recently murdered, was shot and killed by PKK militants and not by the Turkish Intelligence Organization have prompted Greek officials to change the direction of their investigation. It is believed that Yeoryiadhis, who described himself as an enemy of the Turks and has acted as the PKK contact in south Cyprus since 1979, split from that organization two months ago. He was killed by PKK militants, who secretly arrived in south Cyprus, for failing to heed the PKK's threats. Meanwhile, the PKK reportedly sabotaged the tourist ship Athina-Palace in the Port of Piraievs last week. The ship was destroyed by fire. The cause of the incident has not yet been established. The ship was scheduled to leave Greece for Izmir and Kusadasi after calling at several Greek islands in the Aegean Sea the day after it was destroyed by fire. It has been claimed that the PKK decided to prevent Greek passenger ships from visiting Turkey and placed an incendiary bomb in the Athina-Palace. The explosive was to detonate when the ship entered the Port of Izmir. However, it detonated prematurely and the ship was destroyed by fire in Greece.
