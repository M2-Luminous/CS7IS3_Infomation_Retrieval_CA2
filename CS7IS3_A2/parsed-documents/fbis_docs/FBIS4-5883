At a news conference, Ozawa said, "there are opinions urging enactment of the budget but it is much more important to establish a stable political structure through necessary discussions." Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], has urged other coalition components to cement agreement on such key issues as tax reform and the stance toward North Korea's suspected nuclear program before picking a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who on April 8 said he will step down. Meanwhile, Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member, said Friday that agreement on tax reform is the minimum requirement for policy discussions that start Saturday among deputy heads of coalition parties. Speaking at a ceremony to commemorate the establishment of the party's chapter in Ustunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, Funada also said that Shinseito will play a key role in selecting a successor to Hosokawa.
