This transpires from a public opinion poll conducted on 16 January by the Nabulus-based Palestinian Research Center. The poll included 1,607 interviewees from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This research center started to conduct monthly polls after the signing of the agreement in order to assess the public mood among the Palestinian population and its possible voting patterns in the framework of democratic elections. According to the agreement of principles, the elections for the autonomy council are slated to be held in July 1994 and the research center intends to continue conducting the polls until elections are held. Recently it was proposed that municipal elections be held in order to gauge the mood of the Palestinian voters in the territories. It has also been reported that the PLO leadership is even considering delaying the elections for the autonomy council. According to the poll, support for Fatah has declined from approximately 42 percent in December to 35 percent in January. During this period support for the opposition organizations has not increased but remained stable. Support for Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] stands at 14.7 percent, whereas support for the Popular Front is 8.4 percent. At the same time the poll indicates that the coalition of the agreement's supporters made up of Fatah, FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Federation], and the Palestinian People's Party, is still stronger than the rejectionist coalition of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front, and the Democratic Front. The agreement's supporters garnered approximately 39 percent, whereas the opposition accrued some 29 percent. The findings indicate that the contribution of FIDA and the People's Party to the supporters' camp is marginal and amounts to only a few percent. The researchers assess that the voices lost to Fatah went to those supporting the "independents," especially the "national independents." According to the poll, support for the "independents" has gone up to 32 percent. The conductors of the poll estimate that some Fatah supporters preferred to define themselves as "national independents" or to abstain. They also assessed that some other independents are leaning toward the Muslim organizations or other organizations which have not defined their positions. The poll shows that the lowest support for Fatah is to be found in Hebron, where only 24.6 percent support this organization. Had elections been carried out in Hebron on the day of the poll, the opposition organizations would have easily defeated the agreement's supporters. The greatest support for Fatah is to be found in Nabulus and Jericho (42.2 percent in both areas). The greatest support for the "independents" is to be found in East Jerusalem: 46.2 percent. The researchers estimate that several factors contributed to the drop in support for Fatah. The main factors are the frustration and despair felt by the Palestinian population in view of the slow progress made in the negotiations; the absence of practical moves for implementing the agreement; the ongoing violence in the territories, for example, the killing of the four Hamas activists in Hebron two days prior to the poll; and the proliferation of arms in the Gaza Strip. The inter-Fatah arguments over appointments and democratic reforms also made a bad impression on the public. The researchers believe that all these factors have increased the Palestinian public's doubts over Israel's intentions and the ability of the Palestinian delegation to convince Israel to accept the Palestinian positions.
