They were to promote denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula and to safeguard peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula. China considered these two targets were in conformity with the fundamental interests of all countries in northeast Asia. Mr Qian said facing the current difficulties, those sides concerned should particularly keep calm and remain restrained, and should not shut the door of negotiations. China appealed to the sides concerned to continue making efforts to restart talks so as to leave room and possibility for settlement of the issue. Mr Qian also said to impose sanctions would not help solve the problem. On the contrary, it might lead to consequences which no one wished to see.
