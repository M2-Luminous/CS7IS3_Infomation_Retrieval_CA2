From the beginning Sweden has accepted all the EU's fundamental rules. Therefore Sweden neither requested guarantees for our freedom from alliances nor asked for an exemption from the EU's plans for a common currency. In addition the Swedish public access principle has been dropped and our restrictive alcohol policy has been abandoned. That is what 13 opinion formers and debaters from the chairman of the Left Party to moderate economics Professor Johan Lybeck write in a joint article. The whole point of departure for the Swedish membership negotiations has been Sweden's acceptance of all the EU's fundamental rules. Almost all the "exemptions" that are now being presented are simply transition rules of various kinds. The most important parts of EU law, such as the Maastricht treaty, have not been seriously mentioned in the negotiations; Sweden has not requested any special rules there. The Swedish negotiators have not requested or received any guarantees concerning our freedom from alliances. On the contrary, our negotiators have clearly emphasized that our freedom from alliances is not permanent and that we view the EU's development toward a joint defense policy positively. And things have gone farther than that. There are plans to merge the military alliance, the Western European Union (WEU), with the EU in 1996. Then we will have an EU defense system in practice. At that time our formal freedom from alliances will be eliminated. Neutrality policy is already precluded if a country joins under the current rules. Ulf Dinkelspiel made this clear in his opening address when the negotiations began: "At the same time we realize that the long-term formulation of a joint defense policy that could lead in time to a joint defense system is a goal for the common foreign and security policy that will be discussed further within the framework of the 1996 review conference. We do not intend to hinder the European Union's progress toward this goal." It could hardly be expressed more clearly; Sweden has in practice already waived the formal veto right we should have had at the summit meeting in 1996 when a joint defense will be established. If we join the union, Sweden is already totally committed to pursuing the EU's foreign and security policy and refraining from any action that is contrary to the interests of the union. Sweden has also approved the special declaration found in the treaty under which member countries waive their formal veto rights on foreign policy matters. Sweden has not asked for any exemptions from the EU's much-discussed and criticized plans for a joint economic policy and a common currency, the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This means that Sweden is legally committed to all the steps in the creation of the monetary union. This also means that Sweden has no possibility of rejecting the last step of the EMU in which our national monetary unit, the krona, will be eliminated in favor of a common currency and a common central bank. Broadly speaking the monetary union will preclude a national economic policy and put us entirely at the mercy of the policies the union dictates in the economic area. By means of borrowing requirements the union will control the size of our national budget, our interest rates and our exchange rate. This policy, which is secured by treaty and gives low inflation a higher priority than fighting unemployment, is currently driving up unemployment to dangerous levels in the entire EU. The direction of the policy will be guided by the treaty and later also by the politically independent central bank and thus cannot be changed via democratic decisions. Sweden has committed itself to a strict austerity policy and a return to a fixed exchange rate in relation to the European Currency Unit (ECU) as a step toward a common currency. At a time of internalization and changes in the economy, we are giving up the possibility of adapting our economy and our conditions to the national and international situation. This could be devastating for the Swedish economy and for employment. The Swedish negotiators have not requested and thus have not obtained any legally binding safeguard for the Swedish principle of free access to public records. To the extent the issue has been mentioned in the negotiations it has had the nature of unilateral Swedish declarations that totally lack legal value in future conflicts with EU law. The principle of public access is threatened from several sides. A proposed new EU directive on access to computer files also involves a direct restriction of the public access principle. The so-called breakthrough in the negotiations came on 21 December of last year. But aside from the snuff provision, the agreement does not contain any permanent exemptions where Sweden is concerned. The media portrayed the whole thing as a big success, but if one looks more closely at the substance, the package from the EU was mainly empty. Several important environmental issues were decided in the "package." The most important result is that Sweden has accepted a reform moratorium under which we cannot freely increase our environmental requirements on products. In addition Sweden has been forced to make changes that are actually for the worse in automobile emission requirements. Sweden has a four-year transition period in several important areas -- cadmium, tin organic compounds, arsenic, PCP, batteries, and the labeling and classification of chemicals. Sweden wanted a guarantee that would make it quite clear that the requirements will not have to be lowered in the future; no such guarantee was given. In some areas it was noted that Swedish rules are not in conflict with the EU's present rules, this applies to mercury, asbestos and chlorine organic solutions. This means that we can keep the rules today but that they may very well end up in conflict with EU law in the future if the EU adopts new rules in these areas or as a result of the so-called Cassis de Dijon principle. Sweden has not obtained solid guarantees for a restrictive alcohol policy. On the contrary, several of the foundation blocks have already been abandoned. Sweden has obtained a two-year transition rule for the quantity of alcohol that can be brought into the country. But it is clear that border checks within the EU will be phased out in a few more years, which will make a functioning supervision of imports impossible. This means that alcohol prices will have to be cut drastically in the long run. All alcohol monopolies except the sales monopoly have been abandoned. And there is no guarantee that the state company for the sale of wine and spirits can continue to have a monopoly on sales. The removal of border checks will probably also lead to an increased influx of drugs into Sweden. Another kind letter from an EU commissioner is said to be a safeguard for Swedish collective contracts. But the letter has no legal status that implies such a guarantee. It is impossible to rule out future conflicts in which, for example, foreign contractors can claim that they are not compelled to respect agreements in Swedish collective contracts. Sweden has committed itself to full participation in the union's common trade policy. This mean increased tariffs and more quotas for Sweden's trade with the rest of the world. There is a risk that several product groups will be made more expensive for Swedish consumers, especially in the clothing area. Nor can the issues that were "resolved" in the final phase of the negotiations be said to represent a Swedish success. That Sweden will take part in the EU's regional policy subsidies is a matter of course; all EU countries receive subsidies from the EU funds. What is more surprising is how little Sweden will get. The thousand kronor per person that goal-6 subsidies should involve for inland Norrland has turned out to be considerably less. Even if all the subsidies from the EU's various regional funds are included, the inhabitants of sparely populated areas of Sweden will get back less than the approximately 2,000 kronor that every Swede will have to contribute to the EU budget. The Swedish negotiators had demanded subsidies from the most advantageous fund, goal 1, but this was denied. This could be important, especially with regard to how long goal 6 support will remain in existence, it will be renegotiated in 1999. As expected, Sweden will immediately adopt the EU's agricultural policy. This means that Swedish agricultural policy will be bureaucratized and regulated in detail. Sweden will be allowed to phase in the membership fee for several years. Over a somewhat longer time period this phasing in lacks any great importance. Actually the membership fee will become increasingly expensive in the future; it is estimated that it will amount to 25 billion kronor a year in 1999. Now we know what terms will apply if Sweden joins the union. No decisive exemptions or guarantees have been given that could inspire a more positive response in anyone who was skeptical about union membership. For opponents the negotiating results mean that we will now step up the pressure in our efforts against Swedish membership in the union. We are united in our defense of Swedish democracy, national autonomy, and worldwide international cooperation as the alternative to union membership.
