FR941206-1-00049 FR941206-1-00007 An owner or operator of an existing affected source can comply with this limit by: 1. Limiting the average HAP content across all finishing operations to 1.0 kilogram of volatile HAP per kilogram of solids (kg VHAP/kg solids) (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; 2. Limiting the HAP content of (i) each stain, each sealer, and each topcoat, to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; (ii) limiting the HAP content of thinners used for stains, sealers, and topcoats to no more than 10.0 percent HAP by weight; and (iii) using washcoats, basecoats, and enamels that are formulated at the facility with coatings containing no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) and thinners containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight or using washcoats, basecoats, and enamels that have a HAP content of no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, and thinners that have a HAP content of no more than 10.0 percent by weight; 3. Using a control device to limit emissions from finishing operations to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids); or 4. A combination of (2) and (3). As indicated in Table 3, the proposed standards would limit HAP emissions from finishing operations at new sources to 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied. Owners or operators of new sources can comply with the proposed standards by: 1. Limiting the average HAP content across all finishing operations to no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; or 2. Limiting the HAP content of (1) each stain to no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; (2) each sealer and topcoat to no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; (3) each thinner used for stains, sealers, and topcoats to no more than 10.0 percent HAP by weight; and (4) using washcoats, basecoats, and enamels that are formulated at the facility with coatings containing no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids) and thinners containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight or using washcoats, basecoats, and enamels that have a HAP content of no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, and thinners that have a HAP content of no more than 10.0 percent by weight; 3. Using a control device to limit emissions from finishing operations to 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids); or 4. A combination of (2) and (3). If owners or operators comply with the proposed standards through the use of a control device, the overall control efficiency that is equivalent to the proposed standards for existing sources is that which results in 1.0 kilogram of VHAP being emitted per kilogram of solids used. For new sources, the control efficiency that is equivalent to the proposed standards is that which results in 0.8 kilogram of VHAP being emitted per kilogram of solids used. This control efficiency will be source-specific, depending on the HAP content and percent solids of the finishing materials used at baseline conditions. Baseline conditions are those conditions that exist at a plant prior to installing and operating the control device. The HAP emissions from cleaning operations are controlled by limiting the VOC content of the strippable booth coating that is applied to spray booths; this material is used to reduce the need to clean spray booth walls with organic solvent. Gluing operations are controlled through the proposed rule by limiting the HAP content of contact adhesives to the levels identified in Table 3. The HAP emissions from contact adhesives can also be controlled through the use of a control device. In addition to numerical emission limits, the proposed rule limits HAP emissions from existing and new sources through the work practices identified in Table 4. These work practices cover finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations. The owner or operator subject to this rule is also required to develop a Work Practice Implementation Plan that demonstrates how the work practice standards will be executed.
