Currently, China's notary service covers economic, civil and business affairs, and helps prevent disputes and stabilize social, civil and commercial relations. Deputy Justice Minister Zhang Geng told CHINA DAILY in an interview that the planned measures include enlarging the service scope and speeding up reforms in notary management. He added that his ministry has finished a draft Notarization Law and is expected to submit it to the country's legislature for examination this year. He said these measures were mapped out to keep pace with the growing role of notarial services in China. Since 1980, when notary work started up again, the number of notary institutions has increased from 1,150 to the current 3,049. More than 16,170 notary public are providing notarization for common items, such as contracts, establishment of corporations, birth dates, marriage status, education, inheritance rights and wills. Both Chinese and foreigners can use the service by paying a service fee. Foreigners pay a higher fee. Adjustment of the service fees charged to foreigners are still to be decided in line with the newly-adopted single floating exchange rate. Last year these institutions handled more than 9 million cases of notarization, among which 800,000 were concerned with real estate and 600,000 with bank loans. Every year, 98 percent of the notary items show legal effect. But, he added, foreigners still are not allowed to conduct notary service in China, even though branch law offices have been set by foreigners in the country. According to the deputy minister, to strengthen the legal status of notary work, the State is to require important economic, civil and commercial activities to undergo notarization. In helping establish the modern enterprise system in China, important notary work must be done involving the charters and establishment of corporations transfer of property rights, the auction and leasing of enterprises and the qualification of representatives of legal persons. Notary service will be provided in the transfer of bills, the development of real estate, the transfer and mortgage of loans and also foreign-oriented economic activities, he added. Zhang also emphasized the need to speed up reforms in managing notary institutions. All of these institutions will be gradually changed from administrative organs to self-funded institutions without governmental interference. And to meet international norms, notary institutions will be upgraded to "notary offices," he concluded.
