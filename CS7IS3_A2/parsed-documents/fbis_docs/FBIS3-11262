Reporter Rey Rodriguez of the information services of Cuban Television has more details: [Rodriguez] In a news conference held after Cuba's entry into the SITTDEC, Robaina underscored the importance that Cuba's entry represents. [Begin Robaina recording] We already had an idea of the possibilities offered by the center. That is why we came here to the institution's headquarters, after Cuba's official incorporation. We have had the privilege of becoming the 15th member country, since until recently there were only 14 member countries. In a modest way Cuba has much to offer in many areas such as the medical field, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, sugar, tobacco, coffee, rum, nickel, and in many things that from an economic standpoint could be useful to several countries. [end recording] [Rodriguez] Tomorrow, the Cuban delegation is scheduled to meet with Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi, and the minister of primary industries, as well as a meeting in the Ministry of Youth and Sports due to Malaysia's interest in obtaining Cuban training in that area. The delegation will also meet with a group of businessmen. On 21 March, the delegation will depart for Vietnam, the final stop of a tour through the Asian Continent.
