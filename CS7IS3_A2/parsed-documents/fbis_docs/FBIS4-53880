The Laotian Ambassador to Thailand, Bounkeut Sangsomsak, said the meeting would examine ways to meet the deadline of the UNHCR- sponsored repatriation and what could be done if the refugees remained after 1994. Speaking on Thursday at a seminar on Thai-Laotian Relations, organized by Chulalongkon University's International Understanding Program, Bounkeut said there should be no mandatory repatriation for the sake of meeting the deadline. "This will be against the agreement reached by the three parties," the ambassador said. In 1991, Thailand, Laos and the UNHCR agreed during their first meeting in Luang Prabang, Laos, to a speedy three-year repatriation program of the refugees as Thailand had given an ultimatum to close its last refugee camp at Ban Na Pho, in Nong Khai province, by the end of this year. Deputy Secretary-General of the National Security Council (NSC) Khachatphai Burutphat, who joined the panel, has reaffirmed the government's decision to close Ban Na Pho. Khachatphai contended that at present there were many refugees willing to return home. "There is a need to convince the refugees that their homeland had changed for the better under the new economic mechanism and that they should return to help develop their country," he said. He also urged the UNHCR to help in the quick return of the remaining refugees. At the third tripartite meeting in Savannakhet, Laos, last year, Thailand, in order to accelerate the repatriation program, proposed that the UNHCR expand their present overcrowded reception centres in Laos to accommodate more returnees in transition. According to the Foreign Ministry's press statement, only 8,619 refugees have returned home since the implementation of the three-year program in 1991. This includes the latest batch of 405 Hmong last month. Of the remaining 25,000 refugees there are about 22,000 Hmongs.
