FBIS4-13538 "drnes077_c_94010" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Egypt Writer Views al-Azhar Control Over Art, Thought Writer Views al-Azhar Control Over Art, Thought NC1504151894 NC1504151894 BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic on 8 April publishes on pages 34-36 an approximately 3,000-word article by Dr. Muhammad Nur Farhat under the headline "Al-Azhar and Control on Thought." The author discusses al-Azhar's authority to license or reject artistic, literary, and intellectual works dealing with Islamic affairs against the backdrop of a ruling on the subject issued by the State Council's General Assembly for Fatwa and Legislation. He expresses fear that this may lead to "an institutionalized religious authority imposing hegemony over thought." The writer notes that the ruling was issued amid "a noticeable rise in the voice of the political Islam trend in all its factions." He says: "While representatives of the Islamic trend claimed trusteeship over us in our religious affairs, accusing whoever they wanted of blasphemy and depriving whoever they wanted of God's mercy, the official religious establishment, represented by al-Azhar, recently stepped forward to announce its right to impose this trusteeship by virtue of, first, its legitimacy, and second, its religious knowledge and competence." Refuting the legal justification on which the State Council based its ruling--namely, protection of society's general order of which Islam is a pillar--the writer says: "Our society, although Islam is the official religion of the state, is actually based on religious pluralism and its Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and creed." He adds: "The first article of the civil law made Islamic shari'ah a source of law after two other sources--legislation and tradition." He says explanations and comments from the legal community made it clear that "the principles of Islamic shari'ah meant as a source of law are those comprehensive principles that fit the social and cultural bases of Egyptian society throughout its development." The writer argues that giving al-Azhar exclusive authority to pass official rulings concerning the concept of general order when it comes to Islamic affairs "will lead to extremely serious legal consequences if this logic is stretched to its limits." He explains: "For example, since Article Two of the Constitution states that Islamic shari'ah is the main source of legislation, and since al-Azhar, as the State Council's ruling contended, is the only party that shall give binding opinions on Islamic affairs, it becomes constitutionally necessary to take al-Azhar's opinion on all our legislations before they are passed. This will turn al-Azhar, thanks to the State Council's fatwa [ruling], from a deep-seated religious institute and a great establishment for preserving shari'ah into a controller of legislative authority in the country." According to this logic, the writer adds: "Al-Azhar may also control the judicial authority because the idea of general order, on which the fatwa was based, is penetrating most of our judicial system." The writer concludes: "If al-Azhar, according to this fatwa, takes over the authorities of legislation and the judiciary, the thing feared by all nationalists concerned about Egypt's future and democracy, even some supporters of the Islamic trend themselves, will happen--Egypt, with its executive, legislative, and judicial authorities, will turn into a religious state. Its decisionmaking will be in the hands of a religious establishment with indisputable rulings--something that neither Egypt nor any other Islamic country has known throughout its history, except during the Ottoman era." Finally, the writer says: "The nature of the binding religious control the fatwa is giving to al-Azhar must lead to a society closing its doors to culture, thought, and creativity." He wonders: "If creative people, under the valid law, can complain about the decisions of the [administrative] control, how can they complain about decisions on which al-Azhar has given a binding opinion? Will complaints in this case mean religious disobedience and heresy?"
