Speaking to MAGYAR NEMZET, the SZDSZ politician said that the new government's foreign policy ideas will already emerge at the meeting of the eight Eastern-Central European foreign ministers and the U.S. secretary of state in Warsaw on 7-8 July, although Hungary will probably still be represented by Geza Jeszenszky. Istvan Szent-Ivanyi told us that efficient and correct working relations had developed in the past four years between him and Laszlo Kovacs, the foreign minister-designate. It also transpired from Istvan Szent-Ivanyi's words that he was preparing for the tasks of state secretary with great expectations, because this position has the advantage of providing a genuine role in direct foreign affairs activity and in shaping foreign policy. Therefore, it was only natural that he considered everything thoroughly before deciding to accept the position. As for the immediate tasks, he spoke about the handing over of the ministry and various important international events, like the foreign ministers meeting with Warren Christopher in Warsaw. Istvan Szent-Ivanyi pointed out that they would prefer to see the views of the new government gain ground. In his view, he thinks it is legally acceptable to have Geza Jeszenszky still represent Hungary at the aforementioned meeting. At the same time, it is also important that a close coordination precede all this, with the participation of Geza Jeszenszky, Laszlo Kovacs, and himself, as well as the professional diplomats. Another urgent task is the upcoming conference in the framework of the Central European Initiative, also at the foreign ministerial level. The most important international event to be directed by the Hungarian Foreign Ministry is the CSCE summit to be held in Budapest in the autumn. In connection with the Hungarian minorities living beyond our borders, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi confirmed that the two-party coalition committee has already formulated the major principles in this area. They want to preserve the current level of support by any means, but this support must be open, public, and controllable through parliamentary means. Support for the educational, cultural, and mass communication needs of the minorities will receive priority. Answering a question, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi said he did not know whether the current Hungarian ambassador in Bucharest, Erno Rudas, will head the office of ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders and of national minorities living in Hungary. The Socialists will decide on this state secretary position affiliated to the office of the prime minister. In conclusion, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi expressed his satisfaction that, according to the coalition agreement, the SZDSZ can hold the position of chairman of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee and, according to the plans, the concrete personnel decision will be made at the meeting of the SZDSZ group in Parliament on 27 June. Matyas Eorsi and Istvan Musto are mentioned as prospective candidates.
