The sentence passed on Francisco Torres is believed to be the heaviest handed down by a Scottish court for a drugs offence and was intended, the judge said, to "act as signal to others". Prison sentences totalling more than 100 years have now been given to smugglers and couriers involved in the drug-running operation which ended in Britain's largest-ever drugs seizure. Five Scots are in jail for their involvement, but a sixth, referred to as Mr X, is still being hunted. Torres, 28, ferried the cocaine across the Atlantic in January 1991. It was brought ashore by dinghy at a remote cove in Sutherland. The cocaine, which had an estimated street value of Â£100 million, was intercepted near Newtonmore in the Highlands. It was being driven south on the A9 disguised as waste from Dounreay power station. Torres, who was convicted of drug smuggling at the High Court in Glasgow last month after being extradited from Canada last July, attempted to commit suicide in prison while awaiting sentence. Yesterday Lord Weir told Torres: "You piloted this murderous cargo to our shores. It brings misery and death to its users. The sentence I have to pass is intended as a signal to others that it is folly to risk landing controlled drugs in Scotland." Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, said that Torres still vehemently protested his innocence, and wanted to challenge media reports--based on information from Customs officials in Britain and Canada--that he was a major drug runner. Mr Findlay said there was "not a single scrap of evidence" to justify the allegations, and argued that Christopher Howarth, of Ullapool in the West Highlands, who was jailed for 25 years for his part in the operation, was a major player but his client was simply a courier. He urged Lord Weir to draw a distinction between the sentence imposed on Howarth and that which should be passed on Torres. However Lord Weir said he had to consider the jail terms already imposed, and particularly that on Howarth.
