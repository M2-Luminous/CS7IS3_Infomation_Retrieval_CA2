FR940725-2-00044 FR940725-2-00034 Health Resources and Services Administration Program Announcement and Grant Orientation Conferences for the Health Careers Opportunity Program The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications for fiscal year (FY) 1995 Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP) grants will be accepted under the authority of Section 740 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Pub. L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Section 740 authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and enter into contracts with schools of allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, public health, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, allied health, chiropractic and podiatric medicine and public and nonprofit private schools which offer graduate programs in clinical psychology and other public or private nonprofit health or educational entities to carry out programs which assist individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter and graduate from such schools. The assistance authorized by the section may be used to: (1) Identify, recruit, and select individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds for education and training in a health profession; (2) provide for a period prior to the entry of such individuals into the regular course of education of such a school, preliminary education designed to assist them to complete successfully such regular course of education at such a school or referring such individuals to institutions providing such preliminary education; (3) facilitate the entry and retention of such individuals in health and allied health professions schools; and (4) provide counseling and advice on financial aid to assist such individuals to complete successfully their education at such schools. The Administration's FY 1995 budget request for this program is $30.7 million. The statute requires that, of the amount appropriated for any fiscal year, 20 percent ($6.1 million) must be obligated for stipends to disadvantaged individuals of exceptional financial need who are students at schools of allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, or dentistry. Of the remaining balance, $20.8 million will be used to continue support of 107 multi-year projects previously approved and funded. It is estimated that $3.7 million will be available to fund approximately 22 competing projects averaging $168,000 each. In addition, the statute requires that, of the amounts appropriated for any fiscal year, 10 percent must be obligated to community-based programs and 70 percent must be obligated for grants or contracts to institutions of higher education. Not more than 5 percent of such funds may be obligated for grants and contracts having the primary purpose of informing individuals about the existence and general nature of health careers. The legislative authority for this program was extended through FY 1994. This program announcement is subject to the extension of this authority and to the appropriation of funds. Applicants are advised that this application announcement is a contingency action being taken to assure that should the authority be extended and funds become available for this purpose, they can be awarded in a timely fashion consistent with the needs of the program as well as to provide for an even distribution of funds throughout the fiscal year. Previous Funding Experience Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions regarding submission of an application for this program. In FY 1994, HRSA reviewed 200 applications for HCOP Grants. Of those applications, 88 percent were approved and 12 percent were disapproved. Thirty-five projects, or 20 percent of the approved applications, were funded. In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 248 applications for HCOP Grants. Of those applications, 86 percent were approved and 14 percent were disapproved. Seventy-two projects, or 35 percent of the approved applications, were funded.
