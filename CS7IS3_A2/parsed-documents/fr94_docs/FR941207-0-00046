FR941207-0-00046 FR941207-0-00008 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;199&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9086; AD 94&hyph;25&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model ATP Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. This action requires inspections to detect cracking in certain oil coolers, and replacement of cracked coolers with serviceable coolers. The amendment also provides for termination of the inspections by installing certain reworked and re-identified oil coolers. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracking in the welded seams of certain oil coolers. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent loss of engine oil due to cracking in the oil cooler, which may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine. DATES: Effective December 22, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 22, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before February 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;199&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Inc., P.O. Box 16029, Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received reports of cracking in the welded seams of certain engine oil coolers that are cooled by ram air. Investigation revealed that these oil coolers were welded incorrectly during the manufacturing process. These defective welds have been isolated to oil coolers manufactured by Normalair-Garrett Limited and having part numbers (P/N) 8248C000, 8439C000, and 8714C000. Such cracking, if not corrected, could result in loss of engine oil, which may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine. Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;79&hyph;23, dated August 26, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking in certain engine oil coolers that are cooled by ram air. This service bulletin also describes procedures for replacement of cracked oil coolers with serviceable oil coolers. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;79&hyph;24&hyph;10360A, dated September 4, 1994, which describes procedures for rework and re-identification of oil coolers having P/N's 8248C000, 8439C000, and 8714C000, that are manufactured by Normalair-Garrett Limited. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent loss of engine oil that may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine. This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking in oil coolers having P/N 8248C000, 8439C000, or 8714C000, and replacement of cracked oil coolers with serviceable oil coolers. Installation of oil coolers that have been reworked and re-identified terminates the requirement for repetitive detailed visual inspections. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this final rule to clarify this requirement.
