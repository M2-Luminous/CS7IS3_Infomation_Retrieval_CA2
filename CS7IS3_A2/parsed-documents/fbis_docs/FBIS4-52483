The three Japanese, a tourist from Fukuroi in Shizuoka Prefecture and an embassy personnel stationed in the former southern capital and his wife, are on their way across the Gulf of Aden to Djibouti. Northern forces were reported to have almost overrun Aden on Monday. In northern Yemen, another 68 Japanese citizens were flown out from the capital of Sanaa aboard German and Italian military aircraft Monday, following advice from the Japanese Embassy to leave as soon as possible. Their arrival in Djibouti could not yet be confirmed. Tokyo is still trying to have the remaining 21 Japanese residents and tourists evacuated quickly, as hostilities continue to grow between rival southern and northern army units. They will likely be evacuated by emergency aircraft of other nations, government sources said. A total of 16 Japanese, including embassy-related personnel, are reportedly in Sanaa with five Japanese in the northern city of Mafraq.
