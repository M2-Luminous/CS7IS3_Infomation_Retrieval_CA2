Ingots weighing 35 kg were smelted in an induction furnace and and forged into 35-mm-thick flatbars that were then subjected to thermomechanical treatment to the point where a perlite structure was produced. The flatbars were rolled in six passes to a thickness of 12 mm with a total relative reduction of about 66 percent. The flatbars were subjected to thermomechanical treatment in one of two versions. In the first version the flatbars were heated to 1,200�C and held in the furnace, deformed in rolling cages until they had reached a temperature of 780�C, and then annealed in a heat-treating furnace to a temperature of 600�C (duration, 1.5 hours). In the second regimen the flatbars were heated to 1,000�C, deformed in rolling cages until they had reached a temperature of 650�C, and annealed in a heat-treating furnace at 650�C for 2 hours. In both cases the flatbars developed a perlite microstructure with globular carbides that possessed increased ductility. The structure of the globular carbides produced is optimum for steels subjected to cold deformation during the manufacturing process; however, its machineability is not as good as that achieved by other methods. The flatbars produced by the second regimen were more ductile than those produced by the first regimen. The second regimen resulted in steels with an evenly distributed granular perlite, whereas the first regimen resulted in perlite that had only been 80-90 percent spheroidized (thus resulting in free ferrite in the steel's microstructure). Further studies were conducted to clarify the effect that the microstructure formed during the thermomechanical treatment to the perlite stage has on the mechanical properties of steel after additional hardening heat treatment (hardening with high-temperature tempering). Specimens of 38KhGNM and 40KhN2MA steel were subjected to thermomechanical treatment in the perlite range followed by hardening heat treatment under commercial conditions (halting rolling at 800�C, after which the billets were cooled down in air to 650�C before being put into the furnace for the perlite transformation). The specimens subjected to preliminary thermomechanical treatment in the perlite range proved more resistant to impact bending failure in both hardened and tempered states.
