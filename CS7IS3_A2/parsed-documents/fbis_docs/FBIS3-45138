The message said: Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, we Hunan people, together with the people of all nationalities in the country, enter the new year with confidence and hopes of speeding up reform and development. The past year has seen us building up socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the guidance of the important talks of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We have achieved considerable results in all our undertakings. In economy we maintained a relatively good momentum of development. The provincial GNP reached 114 billion yuan, up 12.6 percent over the previous year. The 15 years between the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and the end of last year has been a period of great reform, opening up, and development for Hunan, and a period which witnessed the fast growth of Hunan's economic strength, the biggest changes in the urban and rural outlook, and the greatest practical benefits for the general public, since the founding of New China. The brilliant achievements we have scored are a sound foundation on which we can continue our pursuit in triumph. In the new year, we must hold high the great theoretical banner of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the party's basic line, implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and that of the sixth enlarged plenary session of the sixth provincial CPC committee, further emancipate the mind, seize the opportunity, work with less constraint on speeding up reform and development, and make more good results and create more brilliant records.
