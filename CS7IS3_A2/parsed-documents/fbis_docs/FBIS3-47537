FBIS3-47537 "dreas010__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-010-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 January 1994 ANNEX January Source: No Proposal To Extend Washington Summit OW1401105094 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 Jan 94 Evening Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1401105094 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] With regard to the Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled in Washington in February, U.S. Under Secretary of State Wirth stated on 11 Janaury that "the summit talks would be held on both 11 and 12 February," and that "the talks would probably be also held in the late hours of 10 February." According to the accord reached last July, the summit talks would be held on 11 February only. A Japanese Foreign Ministry source has stated that "no proposal has been made for extending the schedule for the talks." However, it is observed that due to the rough going at the Japan-U.S. new economic consultations, the U.S. Government has strengthened its position of "arranging sufficient time for the summit talks so as to bring the consultations to a conclusion." At the news conference held on 11 January, Under Secretary Wirth stated: "Our most urgent objective is arranging the Clinton-Hosokawa talks on 11 and 12 February so that they may discuss the economic consultations currently under way between Japan and the United States. We hope that the results of these consultations will be announced on these two days. (Depending on the political itinerary of the Japanese side,) the summit talks may even start in the late hours of 10 February." It is observed that the U.S. side intends to extend the summit talks, which were orignally scheduled for only one day, to over two days so that the summit talks themselves -- rather than prior talks at the vice ministerial level as originally scheduled -- would become the final stage for consultations.
