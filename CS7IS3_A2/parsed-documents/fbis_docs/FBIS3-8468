After welcoming them, Dr. Ganic explained the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Russian UNPROFOR soldiers and emphasized that the Serbs are not the only ones to have the exclusive privilege of cooperation with Russia. The legal Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities want this cooperation, too. However, as Dr. Ganic said, very little is known in Russia about the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian media do not have the correct information about the events on these territories. When the war is over, Ganic said, some politicians will perhaps have to answer for concealing war crimes committed on the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The reason for today's meeting with the representative of the Russian UN Battalion was also the mistrust of citizens toward these soldiers, especially after seeing the television footage of their arrival in Pale. However, it does not seem that there will be any major problems. The representatives of the Russian forces -- Assistant Commander of the Sector South (Aleksandar Mihaylovic) [word indistinct] and Commander of the Russian Battalion in Bosnia-Herzegovina Victor (?Vorodilov) -- emphasized that they are merely a part of UNPROFOR and only accountable to the UN Secretary General and the UN Security Council.
