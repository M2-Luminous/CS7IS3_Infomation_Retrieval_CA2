Only the second, because the motor vehicle giant delayed the start for a whole month. This was a mild shock to the country. But what about the plant? In general, what awaits it, its motor vehicles and our motor vehicle fans? Our TRUD correspondent interviews Mikhail Dobyndo, deputy director of body-assembly production of the Volga Passenger Vehicle Production Association. [Bystrov] Mikhail Nikolayevich, the future of AvtoVAZ is, after all, the future of all our passenger vehicle building as well. We suddenly learn that our motor vehicle giant, perhaps even as a surprise to itself, is begining to stumble. What has happened to it? [Dobyndo] As the person responsible for the direct finished output of motor vehicles, and as deputy production director, I would in this situation still single VAZ out from the complex of problems which exist around us as a whole today. We stood idle for a month, fearing that complications might arise with the start-up of the equipment, because the conveyor had never before been shut down for such a long time. For planned repair work, for two to three days -- of course. But this was for a month. The conveyor came to a standstill. Large-scale repair work on it was in full swing -- it was being modernized. Naturally, we feared for the control system: it was easy to disturb it and hard to put it right, and we also feared some sort of unexpected losses. This does happen. Nevertheless, we started it up successfully and did the entire program for a whole week. I don't remember having done a program for a whole week running like that in the last five or six years. Last Saturday, we even had to shut down the conveyor 45 minutes early, so that we would not put out superfluous motor vehicles. This indicates that the plant has lost nothing on the organizational-technical plane. It has not lost its traditions or its stability, and most important -- has not lost its people. The plant will operate -- we have no doubt of that. As for matters linked with price formation, with product sales and with non-payment problems -- they are very critical for us even today, and they are holding us back. In the first week we assembled 12,500 cars, and sold 7,000 at best. Not only do we now have finished vehicles parked in fenced-off areas, we have gone out beyond them. This is because we don't have the proper sales. Before the new year we had uncompleted cars standing in the same place, but now they are marketable ones. It is already a bit easier. True, even now we have some things not completed, but that is all right: for example, there is no upholstery in the trunk compartment, nor cigarette lighters. Money is coming in with paralyzing slowness, however, even for the goods that have been sold. This year we began to receive payments only after 25 January. After all, the supplier plants have no money either, and cannot get started without it. But the money was late coming to us, and it is late getting to them. We had to seek internal reserves. On 4 February, a trilateral agreement on delaying wage payments was signed between the administration, in the person of our president, the production council and the trade-union committee. Wages for our plant now constitute about 25 billion rubles [R]. We have not paid wages for January to those who were working, and we did not pay for December. We paid only monetary allowances. It was decided in February to pay half of the wage for December and January. This will give us a saving in the order of R15 billion, which can be thrown in to help the suppliers. In March, however, we will try to pay the rest. Our people were understanding about this. [Bystrov] It is clear that your main problem is creating normal conditions for conveyor operation. When these conditions do not exist, it causes great difficulties for the plant. Can it be that some sort of basic changes are needed? And moreover, quickly, while work is going on? Let us say, with that very non-liquidity of the product? [Dobyndo] How did our plant's non-liquidity form? Primarily because we have lost the market of the former Union. It used to be that only about 40 percent of our motor vehicle sales were made in Russia. Last year we sold 97 percent of all the sales on the territory of the former USSR in the Russian Federation. We have completely lost Ukraine and all the southern republics, including Kazakhstan. Why? It is the same problem of non-payment. The problem of unstable currency. There is no clear-cut mechanism for clearing operations between the former republics. Even though we receive from Ukraine, let us say, a lot of completing items (all the wiring for the motor vehicles and the zinc-plating for the gas tanks come from there), we get it for payments. We generally settle accounts with the neighboring countries in full, mainly with commodities. Today this is not very profitable, because this does not allow our sales offices to develop normally or study the market. We are forced to be attached to monopolists, who hold us back. The Russian motor vehicle market for us today is almost saturated. I don't think that our motor vehicles are too expensive right now. They were expensive when, beginning on 1 November last year, we very sharply raised the price level, thereby virtually suspending shipments and sales for two months. In the past we would follow inflation, but still lagging behind it, we raised the prices by 15-20 percent almost every two months. For us this process delayed sales by about a week or two. In November, however, not counting on the stabilization of the ruble exchange rate, we decided to create for ourselves the conditions for stable work, at least for one quarter. Our desires, however, were not realized. Still, we can see that everything around us is in much worse shape than our motor vehicle plant. [Bystrov] Will you perhaps now have to take special care of your independence in all your relations? After all, it is to be hoped that the economy surrounding the plant will stabilize quickly? [Dobyndo] Formally, we now have enough independence. We have the independence to make all our decisions. If, however, by this you mean economic self-provision, it cannot help but depend on the situation in Russia in general. In any developed country, the motor vehicle industry is an indicator of the state of the entire economy and the state of industry. Our country, it seems to me, does not want to think about this. Any motor vehicle industry, in the time of its crisis, enjoys powerful financial support from the state. Right now Chrysler and Ford are working on the creation of a motor vehicle for the next century. They have powerful support from the state. This does not happen in our country. Apparently, it feels: whoever comes to the surface will swim out. Very serious destruction of industry continues. After all, while VAZ once provided 1 percent of the gross national income, today, together with our subcontractors, we provide 10 percent of Russia's gross national income. Even under these conditions, they don't show all that much concern for us, and it is difficult to survive. What funds did we have for development up to now? We had enough from what was sold on the domestic market for our internal consumption and development without reproduction. (After all, we are left 18 kopecks from the ruble, and the other 82 kopecks go for taxes, for inordinately high taxes. When we ask the state for help, we are merely asking it to return part of what it took from us.) We obtained the funds for reproduction from export sales. Because reproduction is primarily the reproduction of technology -- and you need currency here. But while the state formerly took almost all the profits from us, one could "break loose" money from it, and quite a lot, for the development of any sort of programs. To be sure, when readying the VAZ 2110 model, we counted on the appropriate help. According to all the schedules, the motor vehicle should already have come off the main conveyor, and this year we planned on coming out with the planned output of the "Ten." We had bought virtually all the equipment, and moreover, a long time ago. It has been lying around our plant for over 18 months now, that is, the equipment manufacturer's warranty period has already passed. There were no funds. When we start pinching from the cash boxes, we don't know what will happen. In general, though, we have no funds at all for development. For the first time we have begun to sell currency, in order to ensure normal production. With any foreign partner, a contract is concluded when deferred payments are stipulated. Moreover, they are solid. It is normal practice throughout the world. In Russia, however, there is pre-payment everywhere. Where can we get it? Who will give it to us? I realize that from the monetary standpoint, any state infusion today causes some additional percentage of inflation. Without it, though, industry cannot develop. Where, when, which belt should be shut down, which one intensified -- this is the art of those who are responsible for reform in the country. [Bystrov] I understand that the plant's future rests on the "Ten," and that without this step, the next ones are almost impossible? [Dobyndo] The "Ten" is not the future of the plant, but a necessary step, without which we will lose the sales market. This year Russia seems to be protected from the influx of foreign makes. Our future is the next motor vehicle and extensive modernization of the plant and the assembly conveyor, at least the second belt, where the "Five" and the "Seven" are assembled. It is still hard to say, though, when this future will be traced out. The second future is connected with the production of the "Niva." At this production site, modernization will begin in literally two or three years, in order to produce the lengthened "Niva" in accordance with the standard for normal modern "jeeps." And with a new engine, up to two liters, etc. At the same time, a separate assembly plant should continue to produce 100,000 "Sixes" for the domestic market, so that we have money. We have the capacities for this. These are the prospects, although the situation may change at any moment. The "Ten" has already been created, it has only to be launched on the flowline. The quicker that happens, the more profitable for the plant, the consumer and the country. [Bystrov] The most important question for VAZ right now is the transition to new technology, for after all, the basis of the existing technology has its roots in the late 1960's. Modern technology, though means cutting back the number of people in the production process. This is a good thing, as long as people don't suffer. What awaits the plant here? [Dobyndo] Yes, the fewer people employed in production, the more improved the technology. We will have no superfluous people. It is enough to remember that the AVVA program requires a huge number of specialists. This means we must fight resolutely to cut back the number of workers in the shops. Where do we see reserves? In the first place, welding. Today, we have about 800 people working in the shop producing the "Six," but for the same program for the "Eight" and the "Ten" we have half the number of people working in the shop. True, there are more mechanics here, and very highly skilled ones. In the new, modern shops, however, if we succeed in stocking them up, the program for 200,000 motor vehicles a year can be ensured with only about 100 people. In the second place, painting. Today Chrysler, it is true, has just a little less than our capacity, and employs 56 people, but in our plant -- there are almost 800. In the third place, assembly. All modern motor vehicle plants today operate translifts -- self-powered electric bogies, which run on monorails according to their own program. There are none of these pusher conveyors, no weighting of structures and no interweaving of conveyors aloft or unnecessary service personnel. There must be translifts, because one can't manage without them, even though the principle of the conveyor remains the same as in our plant, for even in the West they have not been able to think up anything better. On the other hand, though, "wheeled technology" has long been in existence there. That is, there are no warehouse facilities. The transport unit which delivered the completing items to the conveyor is the warehouse. [Bystrov] There was a time when you delivered completing items by air. This kind of "wheeled technology," however, is a very expensive pleasure. [Dobyndo] Right now, unfortunately, the situation is the same. We use planes and helicopters. This is where the expense lies, and we should by all means eliminate it. [Bystrov] The problem of supplies of completing items is in general a sore point for any plant. As far as we can see, mass losses of suppliers are taking place these days. Won't you also have to lose them or change them? [Dobyndo] It is not that easy to change suppliers today, even if you feel like it. Those same bundles of electric wires from Kamenets-Podolskiy. The motor vehicle plant's currency funds were invested there, and all the cooperation ensuring the output of these bundles is directed there today. What does it mean to organize this type of production all over again today, let us say, in Russia? A lot of time and capital. Is it necessary? International cooperation is branching out all over the world. I do not think that we have to take a different path. Our plant always had the policy: develop our own suppliers, in order to raise the level of the motor vehicle as a whole. It is simply senseless to lose what we have invested now. On the contrary, we are striving to help our suppliers, we are now tracing the entire chain of suppliers from the ore to the finished item which comes to us, in order to ensure uninterrupted supply. It is a very difficult matter, but we are forced to deal with it. At the same time, of course, we are gradually developing a network of suppliers, and are also using defense enterprises for this. We have set up Lada-Konversiya, a joint venture, with headquarters in Moscow, which deals with working out a program of interaction. Possibly, in time, we will revise something somewhere, but it is simply impossible and purposeless to change mass supply immediately. After all, cooperation unites not only our economy, but also our people, so that supply volumes, including those with former socialist countries, even with the former Yugoslavia, are not cut down anywhere. [Bystrov] Will it be somewhat easier for the All-Russian Motor Vehicle Alliance than for you? [Dobyndo] If they manage to put the business on a normal market basis, then it will, of course, be considerably easier for them. Their starting point is different from that of the plant. The plant has piled up its losses in the last few years. The president signed an edict on the AVVA and on the motor vehicle plant, which removes the excise tax and all taxes on products made for development of the AVVA. Loans are provided for.... In the last few years we have long been trying to find some sort of foreign partner for normal investment and development. It seemed that we were just on the point of signing an agreement with Fiat -- it did not happen, and then we were close to signing a contract with West German firms. Why? The motor vehicle plant still seemed to them an unreliable structure, even after it became a joint-stock company, because as before, state psychology was still retained there. The AVVA, however, is a completely new psychology, a new level of relations, virtually that very capitalization which organizes them. Our technical level is no lower than that at foreign plants, and the level of our specialists is quite high. Foreign firms are now after contacts, on their initiative, because they can see: this is precisely the form of ownership which the AVVA will have, which guarantees the investment of capital. There is a military-industrial complex with its own assets, there is the plant with its own assets.... This is an absolutely denationalized structure. [Bystrov] Everyone hopes that the All-Russian Motor Vehicle Alliance will, all the same, produce vehicles that the people can afford. There are few people who can afford yours at this time. [Dobyndo] Inflation will do its job, and our motor vehicle will again become affordable for the buyer. Even before, however, our vehicle was not affordable for the population masses. [Bystrov] Even recently, though, almost every worker would put his name down on the waiting list for a Zhigul. [Dobyndo] Yes, he put his name down because they were selling in a different way. At that time a motor vehicle, under the conditions of its scarcity, had two prices: the state price and the market price. The latter was sometimes three-fold higher. One out of a thousand, however, had the chance of buying a new vehicle at the state price. Even at the state price, many people acquired a car on borrowed money, to part with their purchase at a profit later, thereby putting his material situation in order. In general, however, we always delayed in establishing prices for our motor vehicle, so that its wholesale factory price would constantly be lower than the market price. Only last year did we anticipate the market with respect to prices and we therefore slowed down sales. The plant is not free to dictate prices, though. There is a lower limit, which production expenses restrict, and there is an upper limit, restricted by buyer capability. This interval is very narrow, and we must not only be able to survive within it, but also to expand it, for freer maneuvering. The country needs our motor vehicle. Without it Russia will never be truly independent. It is not an easy task. But what is easy today?
