So far, more than four billion U.S. dollars from abroad has been put into or has been promised to 15 ongoing projects. A 120-km expressway costing 1.2 billion U.S. dollars will link this capital of the province with the boom town of Shenzhen. The project has already received 1.56 billion Hong Kong dollars from the Hong Kong-based Hopewell Holdings Ltd and a loan of 800 million U.S. dollars from international consortiums. Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong tycoon, has injected 100 million U.S. Dollars into the building of a freeway from Shenzhen to Shantou, which will need 2.5 billion yuan in total. Two Malaysian companies, the Ho Hup Construction Company Berhad and United Engineers Berhad, have poured 6.6 billion yuan into the building of a 188-km expressway from Yangjiang to Zhanjiang. Li Shaofeng, general manager of the province's expressway construction company, said that the market outlook is good as the number of vehicles has been soaring in Guangdong in recent years. The province had 3.27 million vehicles in 1993, compared with only 747,000 in 1985. Low risks and high returns in the projects have also enticed overseas investors, he said. An expressway running from Guangzhou to Foshan, the province's first foreign-financed road, has a daily income of 300,000 yuan, tenfold the figure four years ago. Meanwhile, the province is to raise foreign capital through new measures. For instance, foreigners will be allowed to operate freeways for limited periods. By the end of this century the province is expected to have over 1,300 km of expressways.
