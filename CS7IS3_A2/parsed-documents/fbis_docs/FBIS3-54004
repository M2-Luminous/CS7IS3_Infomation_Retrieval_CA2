Investigations have revealed that a Palestinian spy network worked for the Israeli intelligence service Mosad in Gaza. Palestinian security services inside discovered during their two-month investigations that this network received orders from Mosad to begin the assassination scheme. The security services managed to unravel the clues and enticed one of those implicated to go to Tunis at the end of last week. This Palestinian is named as Ahmad Abu-'Awf, a resident of Khan Yunus. He is 24. He was enticed to go Tunis after visiting his brother in London. Palestinian security services kept silent about this case to ensure that other members of the network would not escape. According to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's information, a committee has been formed from the inside and outside to follow up this delicate case.
