RP92&hyph;73&hyph;000 and RP91&hyph;68&hyph;000, et al. The proposed rates are based on a test year cost-of-service for the 12 months ended June 30, 1994, as adjusted for known and measurable changes through March 31, 1995. National also states that its filing provides increased revenues which are required to permit National to adjust its rates to account for plant additions, tax rate changes (including Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109), increased operation and maintenance expenses (including increases in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 costs), and other changes. In addition, National proposes to roll-in the rates for services formerly provided by the Penn-York Energy Corporation. National also proposes to design its rate for IT service based on its system-wide load factor. With respect to the rate design issues, National requests the Commission sever the rate design issues for an expedited hearing and decision prior to the end of the suspension period. National further states that copies of this filing were served upon the company's jurisdictional customers and the Regulatory Commission's of the States of New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C., 20426, in accordance with Rules 214 or 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All such motions to intervene or protest should be filed on or before October 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
