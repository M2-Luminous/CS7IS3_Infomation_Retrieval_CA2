FR940627-0-00006 FR940627-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;60&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8951; AD 94&hyph;13&hyph;10] Airworthiness Directives: Piper Aircraft Corporation PA24, PA30, and PA39 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 74&hyph;13&hyph;01, which currently requires inspecting (one-time) the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings for looseness on certain Piper Aircraft Corporation (Piper) PA24, PA30, and PA39 series airplanes, and, if looseness is found, incorporating Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit). This action retains the initial inspection of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, and makes these inspections repetitive unless the above referenced service kit is incorporated. Incidents of looseness of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings on several of the affected airplanes in compliance with the current AD prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of pitch control because of looseness of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Piper Aircraft Corporation, Customer Services, 2926 Piper Drive, Vero Beach, Florida 32960. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christina Marsh, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;2910; facsimile (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain PA24, PA30, and PA39 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on Februrary 1, 1994 (59 FR 4605). The action proposed to supsersede AD 74&hyph;13&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1870, with a new AD that would retain the initial inspection of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, and make these inspections repetitive unless Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) is incorporated. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. The FAA estimates that 4,409 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $242,495. This figure does not account for any repetitive inspections that would be required by this AD. However, incorporating Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings eliminates the need for the repetitive inspection requirement of this AD. In addition, this kit may have been incorporated through compliance with AD 75&hyph;27&hyph;08, Amendment 39&hyph;2624. This AD requires inspecting the rivets of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, and incorporating the referenced kit if any rivets are found misaligned. The cost figure presented above is based on the assumption that none of the owners/operators affected by this AD have incorporated Piper Part No. 760 835. The FAA anticipates that numerous owners/operators have incorporated this kit, thereby reducing the cost impact of the required action.
