[sentence as received] "Lifting of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia should be preceeded by a ceasefire from all the conflicting sides (in Bosnia)," he told TASS on Wednesday. "Russia stood and stands on one position -- all settlement problems in Bosnia can be solved only at the negotiating table. Nothing can be done by military force," he said and added that Russia does not accept "power methods." The prime minister stressed that in general Russia stands for the lifting of sanctions againt Yugoslavia. "I do not understand why peoples have to suffer, and not those forces which profit from the conflict." However, he added that for the time being it is impossible to lift the sanctions completely. "Foreign economic relations will be impeded by combat activities," according to the prime minister. The situation in former Yugoslavia will most evidently be discussed at the CIS summit in Moscow on Friday. "The example of former Yugoslavia makes us see what a split of the country can result in. The example shows what we can get on the territory of the former USSR," Chernomyrdin stressed.
