A record of the results of each preshift examination including a record of hazardous conditions and their locations found by the examiner during each examination and of the results and locations of air and methane measurements shall be made in a book provided for that purpose on the surface before any persons other than certified persons conducting examinations required by this subpart enter any underground area of the mine. The results of methane tests shall be recorded as the percentage of methane measured by the examiner. The record shall be made by the certified person who made the examination or by a person designated by the operator. If the record is made by someone other than the examiner, the examiner shall verify the record by initials and date by or at the end of the shift for which the examination was made. A record shall also be made by a certified person of the action taken to correct hazardous conditions found during the preshift examination. Records shall be countersigned by the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift. Within 2 scheduled production days thereafter, the record shall also be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The record shall be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. * * * * * 22. Section 75.362 is amended by removing paragraph (h); redesignating paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) as (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii); revising paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (c)(1), newly redesignated (d)(1)(iii), (d)(2) and (g); and by adding new paragraph (d)(1)(i) to read as follows: §75.362 On-shift examination. (a)(1) At least once during each shift, or more often if necessary for safety, a certified person designated by the operator shall conduct an on-shift examination of each section where anyone is assigned to work during the shift and any area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed during the shift. The certified person shall check for hazardous conditions, test for methane and oxygen deficiency, and determine if the air is moving in its proper direction. (2) At or near the beginning of any coal-producing shift, before production begins on a section, a certified person designated by the operator shall conduct an examination to assure compliance with the respirable dust control parameters specified in the mine ventilation plan. Deficiencies shall be corrected immediately. The examination shall include air quantities and velocities, water pressures and flow rates, water spray numbers and orientations, section ventilation and control device placement, and any other dust suppression measures required by the ventilation plan. Physical measurements of the air velocity and quantity, water pressure and flow rates shall not be required if continuous monitoring of these parameters is used and indicates that the dust control parameters are functioning properly. * * * * * (c) * * * (1) The volume of air in the last open crosscut of each set of entries or rooms on each section and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. The last open crosscut is the crosscut in the line of pillars containing the permanent stoppings that separate the intake air courses and the return air courses. * * * * * (d)(1) * * * (i) At the start of each shift at each working place before electrically operated equipment is energized; and *␣*␣* (iii) At 20-minute intervals, or more often if required in the approved ventilation plan at specific locations, during the operation of equipment in the working place. (2) These methane tests shall be made at the face from under permanent roof support, using extendable probes or other acceptable means. When longwall or shortwall mining systems are used, these methane tests shall be made at the shearer, the plow, or the cutting head. When mining has been stopped for more than 20 minutes, methane tests shall be conducted prior to the start up of equipment. * * * * * (g) Certification. The person making the on-shift examination in belt haulage entries shall certify by initials, date, and time that the examination was made. The certified person shall certify by initials, date, and the time at enough locations to show that the entire area has been examined. * * * * * 23. The Agency is asking for comments on paragraph (c)(2) of §75.362 which is identical to the text published in the Federal Register on May 15, 1992 (57 FR 20923). This paragraph is being reproposed and republished for the convenience of the readers to read as follows: §75.362 On-shift examination. * * * * * (c)(2) The volume of air on a longwall or shortwall, including areas where longwall or shortwall equipment is being installed or removed, in the intake entry or entries at the intake end of the longwall or shortwall. * * * * * 24. Section 75.363 is added to read as follows: §75.363 Hazardous conditions; posting, correcting and recording. (a) Any hazardous condition found by or reported to the mine foreman, assistants to the mine foreman, or other certified persons designated by the operator for the purposes of conducting examinations under this subpart D, shall be posted with a conspicuous danger sign where anyone entering the areas would pass. Hazardous conditions shall be corrected immediately and the area shall remain posted until the hazardous conditions are corrected. If these conditions create an imminent danger, everyone except those persons referred to in section 104(c) of the Act shall be withdrawn from the area affected to a safe area until the hazardous condition is corrected. Only persons designated by the operator to correct or evaluate the conditions may enter the posted area. (b) A record shall be made of these hazardous conditions. This record shall be kept in a book maintained for this purpose on the surface at the mine. The record shall be made by the completion of the shift on which the hazardous condition is found and shall include the nature and location of the hazardous condition and the corrective action taken. This record shall not be required for shifts when no hazardous conditions are found or for hazardous conditions found during the preshift or weekly examinations inasmuch as these examinations have separate recordkeeping requirements. (c) The record shall be made by the certified person or a person designated by the operator. If made by a person other than the certified person, the certified person shall verify the record by initials and date by or at the end of the shift for which the examination was made. The record shall be countersigned by the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift. Within 2 scheduled production days thereafter, the record shall also be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The record shall be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. (d) Retention period. Records shall be retained for at least 1 year at a surface location at the mine and made available for inspection by an authorized representative of the Secretary and representative of miners. * * * * * 25. Section 75.364 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), the introductory text of paragraph (b) and paragraph (h) to read as follows: §75.364 Weekly examination. (a) Worked-out areas. (1) At least every 7 days, a certified person shall examine unsealed worked-out areas where no pillars have been recovered by traveling to the area of deepest penetration; measuring methane and oxygen concentrations and air quantities and making tests to determine if the air is moving in its proper direction in the area. Air quantity measurements shall be made where the air enters and leaves the worked-out area. Sufficient methane and oxygen measurements shall be made so as to assure the air quality in the worked-out area. An alternative method of evaluating the ventilation of the area may be approved in the ventilation plan.
