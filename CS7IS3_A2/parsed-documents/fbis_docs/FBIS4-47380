V. Litinetskiy, V. V. Volkov, Yu. A Seregin, Central Aerological Observatory; UDC 551.509.617:551.507.35] [Abstract] This article describes the capabilities of the Tsiklon-1 and Tsiklon-2-S measurement and computing complexes for aircraft used for meteorological research and cloud seeding. The equipment is installed on An-26 and YaK-40 aircraft. The types of equipment included in both systems are described and specifications are listed. In general, the equipment may be divided into navigation instruments, measurement devices, and recording and imaging devices. The AgI dispensers used for cloud seeding are described. The Tsiklon-1 system features a Doppler velocity measurement device, an inertial navigation system, and Orbita-20 and Orbita-701 on-board computers. The Tsiklon-2-S system features a gyrocompass system. The systems take meterological readings to determine the feasibility of cloud seeding. Results of seeding may also be tracked. The systems include an aircraft position monitoring device. This makes it possible to coordinate actions in multi-aircraft cloud seeding operations. The Tsiklon-2-S system is more sophisticated in that it uses an IBM AT PC and a satellite navigational system (TRANSPAK). Information is stored on diskette. Schematics of both systems are provided.
