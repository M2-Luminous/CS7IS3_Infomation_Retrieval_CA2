Both Krajina and Croatia lodged guarantees to this effect with the mediators: Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin; U.S. Ambassador in Zagreb Peter Galbraith; and Kai Aide and Geert Ahrens, cochairmen of the Conference on Former Yugoslavia. Jarcevic said that there was a possibility that next Tuesday, 29 March, an agreement would be signed, but only on an end to clashes and hostilities. He described this as the main goal of the negotiations. All other issues of common interest will be put on the agenda later. He said that no pressure was put on either of the sides during the negotiations and that the mediators were there to help, but with a clear message that the world had had enough of war and bloodshed. The mediators stressed that it was up to the opposing sides to decide on how to regulate their future relations, but this is an issue for political negotiations and was not mentioned in Zagreb, Jarcevic said.
