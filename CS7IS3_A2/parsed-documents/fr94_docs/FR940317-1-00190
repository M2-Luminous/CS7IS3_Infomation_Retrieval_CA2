FR940317-1-00190 FR940317-1-00016 ( 2 ) Non-payment related defaults; ( 3 ) Unscheduled draws on debt service reserves reflecting financial difficulties; ( 4 ) Unscheduled draws on credit enhancements reflecting financial difficulties; ( 5 ) Substitution of credit or liquidity providers, or their failure to perform; ( 6 ) Adverse tax opinions or events affecting the tax-exempt status of the security; ( 7 ) Modifications to rights of security holders; ( 8 ) Bond calls; ( 9 ) Defeasances; ( 10 ) Matters affecting collateral; and ( 11 ) Rating changes. This portion of the proposed amendment, like that addressing annual financial information, is intended to provide guidance to issuers and other participants in the municipal securities market regarding the dissemination of notices of material events. As discussed in the Companion Release, 17 this list consists of recognized material events that reflect on the creditworthiness of the issuer of the municipal security or any significant obligor, as well as on the terms of the securities they issue. The issuer must determine whether information needs to be disseminated about a listed event in any particular situation, and if so, when the information dissemination should occur in order to be ``timely.'' For example, an issuer would be free to determine that a de minimis draw on a reserve fund by an issuer financing agency resulting from a delay by the obligor in transmitting a payment, where the draw is replaced immediately and is not the result of the obligor's financial difficulties, is not a material event requiring notice to the market. 17 Companion Release, supra note 5, at Section IV.B.2. Comment is requested as to whether the listed items of material events should be expanded. Comment also is requested on whether timing, for example, within a certain number of days, for the dissemination of notice of these events should be specified as part of the undertaking. B. Recommendations Without Specified Information As proposed, a new paragraph (c) would be added to the rule, which would prohibit any broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending the purchase or sale of a municipal security unless such broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer has reviewed the information the issuer of such municipal security has undertaken to provide pursuant to paragraph (b)(5). As noted above, broker-dealers imply by recommending securities that they have a reasonable basis for making such recommendations. In the Commission's view, most situations in which a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer brings a municipal security to the attention of a customer involve an implicit recommendation of the security to the customer. The proposed amendment neither specifies the form in which information must be reviewed, nor specifies which documents must be obtained. 18 Rather, it requires brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers to review the information that the issuer of the municipal security has agreed to provide. The proposed amendment is intended to allow this information to be obtained and reviewed through any means of dissemination used by participants in the municipal securities market. 19 While the information may be available from documents placed in a NRMSIR, this may not be the only source of information. Thus, to satisfy the requirements of the rule, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers may obtain this information directly from the issuer, from professionals such as attorneys, accountants, or other municipal securities dealers, or from any other reliable source. If, in reviewing this information, they discover any factors that suggest that disclosure is inaccurate or incomplete, or that signal the need for additional investigation, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers may need to obtain additional information, or seek to verify existing information. 20 If, however, the rating is known and information placed with a NRMSIR has been reviewed and raises no questions, a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer would need to look no further for information about the security recommended. Furthermore, a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer would not be prohibited from recommending the purchase or sale of a municipal security solely because of the existence of material events of which, after its review, it has no knowledge. This could occur if an issuer failed to disclose the occurrence of a material event to a NRMSIR or to disseminate notice of such an occurrence in any other manner. Under paragraph (c), if the specified information is not available, no recommendation may be made. 18 C.f. Rule 15c2&hyph;11, 17 CFR 270.15c2&hyph;11. Rule 15c2&hyph;11 requires that brokers and dealers, prior to entering quotations for securities in a ``quotation medium'', have in their records certain specific information, and, based on a review of this information, have a reasonable basis under the circumstances for believing that the information is accurate in all material respects, and that the sources of the information are reliable. Submissions of quotations respecting municipal securities are exempt from the application of Rule 15c2&hyph;11. Rule 15c2&hyph;11(f)(4). 19 Therefore, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers could review information received through electronic dissemination, in response to telephone inquiries, facsimile, by mail, or by messenger service, so long as the information is complete. 20 See M.G. Davis & Co., 44 SEC 153, 157&hyph;58 (1970)(broker-dealer registration revoked because ``representations and predictions'' made and, market letter relied on by registrant ``were without reasonable basis,'' and ``registrant could not reasonably accept all of the statements in the [market letter] without further investigation''), aff'd sub nom. Levine v. SEC, 436 F.2d 88 (2d Cir. 1971); Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 14149 (Nov. 9, 1977) (noting that if a broker-dealer lacks sufficient information to make a recommendation, the lack of information is material and should be disclosed). See also Companion Release, supra note 5 at Section V (discussing the obligations of brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers to investigate information in order to have a reasonable basis for making a recommendation). Comment is requested on the provisions of proposed paragraph (c). Specifically, comment is requested on the application of the term ``recommend,'' and whether the requirement to review information is burdensome, or requires further clarification.
