"Bellona" members Nils Bemer and Tomas Nilsen [both names as transliterated] have gained access to Northern Fleet documents which state that in accordance with the START II treaty within the next few years Russia must destroy 150 nuclear submarines with 278 reactors on board. The authors of the report assert that so far only two submarines have been dismantled in the Northern Fleet but that nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactors of 34 ships. The main part of the submarines will be dismantled in Severodvinsk: There they will extract 206 reactors and 45,000 used fuel elements from the submarines' bellies. The Norwegians claim that new dry docks and storage facilities for radioactive waste, and moorings for the submarines which have been written off are to be constructed on the Kola peninsula. The construction should have begun already but so far the majority of establishments are at the planning stage, the report says. Of course, some of the fuel elements, the "Bellona" experts estimate, could be sent to the "Mayak" storage facility in Siberia. But what is to be done with the other fuel elements, the reactors themselves, and their reactor rooms? In this connection Bemer and Nilsen have the following to say: "Of the documents we have read and the talks we have had with knowledgeable people it has become clear to us that the Russian authorities have two possible courses of action. The first is to return to the practice of submerging radioactive waste, including reactors, in the Kara Sea, which Russian renounced a few years ago. The second is to construct a major new storage facility somewhere in the Northwest of Russia. "However," the report's authors continue, "it is known that the storage facilities existing on the Kola peninsula are already full and there is no money to construct new ones. So we believe that the most feasible option is connected with burying the waste at sea. Perhaps that is why Russia is not signing the London convention which bans the discharge of waste into the seas and oceans...."
