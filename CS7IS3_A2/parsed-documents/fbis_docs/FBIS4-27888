FBIS4-27888 "dreas107_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 North Korea Atomic Energy Department Issues Statement Atomic Energy Department Issues Statement SK0306024294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2210 GMT 2 Jun 94 SK0306024294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2210 GMT 2 Jun 94 Korean BFN ["Press Statement [tamhwa]" by a spokesman of the DPRK Atomic Energy General Department on 2 June -- read by announcer] [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK General Department of the Atomic Energy issued a press statement yesterday [2 June] denouncing the unjust pressure commotion [pudanghan amnyok sodongul kyutanhaeso] by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and some member nations of the UN Security Council over our core refueling operations [nosim yollyo kyoche]. The press statement reads: Recently, the IAEA Secretariat submitted to the UN Security Council a wrong report related to the core refueling operations at the five megawatt experimental nuclear power plant in the DPRK, misrepresenting facts as if our method of the core refueling operations would make the technical possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods difficult. Accordingly, the UN Security Council hastily adopted a so-called presidential statement. As is known, our five megawatt experimental nuclear power plant had no other choice but to begin the core refueling operations from early May for technical or safety reasons. Since we are in a special status [tuksu chiwi] following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we are not under obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] under the safeguards agreement but are obligated only to ensure inspection in the scope for the continuity of safeguards [tamboui yonsoksong pojange piryohan pomwiui sacharul pojanghamyon toenda]. The selection and securing [sontaek pogwan] of some fuel rods requested by the IAEA with regard to the core refueling operations is activities for the verification of the completeness of the initial report. In the long run, this activity falls under the category of ad hoc inspection. Therefore, the selection and securing of some fuel rods can never be allowed before our special status is dissolved [haesodoegi chonenun]. But, we are doing the core refueling operations in such a manner to fully guarantee [chungbunhi pojonhanun pangboburo] the technical possibility for later measurement of such fuel rods as requested by the agency in token of good faith [sonuijok chochie ttara], anticipating a dissolution of our special status. At present, the operations of the core refueling and all the fuel in the transfer channel, spent fuel tub [pyeyollyo sujo] and damaged fuel dry storage [pason yollyo konsik pogwango] are under strict containment [pongswae] and surveillance by the agency. Two surveillance cameras installed by the agency at the reactor hall, where refueling is going on, are monitoring the core area [nosim kuyok], fuel channels, equipment hatch, and movements of the refueling machines. The agency's spent fuel rod counter system [pyeyollyo kyesugi] with a silicon semi-conductor detector [kyuso pandoche komchulgi], a fission chamber [punyolham], an ionization chamber, and a position sensor has been installed in the spent fuel discharge channel to constantly measure and count the spent fuel being discharged into baskets. The agency has installed thermoluminescence detectors and sealing devices in all the channels which may be considered to be diversion paths and two surveillance cameras in the building of the spent fuel tub to monitor and control the flow of nuclear material. Notably, at the time of the inspection in May, in order to increase efficiency of the surveillance devices of the IAEA during the refueling, we provided all the conditions requested by the agency, such as the replacement of computers and their parts in the spent fuel rod counter [pyeyollyo kyesugi], the installation of uninterruptable power [mujongjon chonwon] supply to the IAEA surveillance devices and a lighting system for the spent fuel tub building. Thus, the non-diversion of nuclear material during the refueling is firmly guaranteed. This is admitted by the inspectors of the agency now observing the whole procedure of refueling. Our core refueling operations are being done in such a manner to guarantee the technical possibility of later measurement. The fuel rods have been unloaded from the reactor core by the refueling machine channel by channel, area by area [kuyokpyollo] in sequence in the reactor hall, and all the spent fuel rods from four channels have been discharged into one basket. Baskets of spent fuel are placed in their own positions of the spent fuel tub. All the refueling operations, including recording the basket identification number, the channel identification number, the sequence of fuel rods in channels, and the position of baskets in the tub, are being correctly recorded in accounting and operating books [hoegye mit unyong mungon]. Also the identification number of baskets and their positions in the tub are being strictly ascertained by the agency's inspectors now present during the refueling operations. This shows that the refueling operations are now being conducted in the presence of IAEA inspectors in such a manner to guarantee technical possibilities of their future measurement. So, it is possible to reconstruct the channels of the fuel rods in baskets and the sequence of rods in the channels in any time if necessary. The channels of fuel rods and the sequence of fuel rods in them can be identified by means of the measured value of the gamma rays for the fuel rods and the calculated value of the distribution of neutron flux along the channels. This method has been fully proven through experiment under wet and dry conditions. When this method is applied, the working amount of measurement may be slightly larger than that by the method of selecting fuel rods in the reactor core. But it is the only rational method [yuirhagye hamnijogin pangbop] in our present situation. It is a scientific method proposed by the operators in the spirit of cooperation, out of the sincere desire to demonstrate the transparency of our nuclear activities even in the special status. At the consultation held in Pyongyang a few days ago as regards the refueling, the head of the IAEA delegation also said that the method we proposed was theoretically reasonable [ironjoguro tadanghadago hamyonso] and that he would study it back at the agency and inform us of the results. Nevertheless, some officials [kyechung] of agency's Secretariat hurriedly submitted to the UN Security Council a report based on their unilateral, unjust judgment [ilbangjogin pudanghan pyongga] that the technical possibility of a future measurement of the fuel rods is insufficient [pulchungbun], on May 27 when the negotiations were under way, before the consultation team arrived in Vienna, not waiting for the results. Since the agency promised us to study our proposal after going back to Vienna, it should have given us a scientific and technical clarification on it. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council did a very irresponsible and unfair thing [simhi muchaegimhagye pyongyonjoguro haengdong hayodda] according to a scenario written by some member nations beforehand, claiming that the core refueling operation must be made in accordance with the demand of the agency and, if not, the technical possibility of later measurement of the fuel rods might be lost. Such an unjustifiable behavior [pudanghan chosa] of the agency Secretariat and the UN Security Council was not merely by chance. The agency Secretariat deliberately avoided being present at the refueling, ignoring our just proposal for its presence from the beginning, and hindered [chijangul chuodda] the normal operation of our nuclear facilities. When we were compelled to start the refueling operation for technical or safety reasons, it charged [sibihae nasodda] that we started the refueling in the absence of the agency inspectors. The unjustifiable pressure campaign [pudanghan amnyok sodong] launched by the IAEA and some member nations of the UN Security Council with regard to our core refueling operation bears close resemblance to their previous pressure campaign based on the results of the inspection in March. It is their trite method to lay deliberately lay obstacles in the way of the solution to the nuclear problem by unreasonably [pudanghagye] taking the issue to the United Nations and internationalizing and politicizing it each time some progress has been made in its solution by our sincere efforts and flexible position [sinchuksong innun ipcang]. Facts clearly show that the agency Secretariat has pursued a sinister political purpose [pulsunhan chongchijok mokchogul chuguhago ittanungosul] of crushing [apsal] us from the beginning according to a ready-made scenario, far from taking a stand for a fair solution [kongjonghage haegyol hajanun ipchangiragi podanun] to our nuclear issue. If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods is gone, we cannot but take a decisive countermeasure [kue taeunghan kyolchongjogin chochirul chwihaji anunulsu opke doelgosida]. If the agency Secretariat truly wants a solution to our nuclear problem, it must not continue expanding its partiality [pulgongjongsong] with such unreasonable acts [pudanghan haengwi] as hurriedly submitting a report based on a wrong judgment [kuruttoen pyongga] to the UN Security Council as it did this time, but squarely look at the reality and return to its original, fair position befitting an international organization.
