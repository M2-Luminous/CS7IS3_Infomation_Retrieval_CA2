ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reports from UN Headquarters in New York that Butrus-Ghali's request to Vance is included in a two-page report the UN secretary general submitted to the Security Council. In his report, Butrus-Ghali underlines that Vance's mediating mission is not affected by the European Court case of the Greek countermeasures against Skopje. The UN secretary general notes that he will submit a new report to the Security Council after the 13 June meetings in New York between Vance and the representatives of Greece and Skopje. Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today described Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council on the issue of Skopje as brief, typical, and descriptive. Venizelos said he considers the secretary general's note that there is a need to continue the Vance initiative for solution of the issue as important.
