"The fact that the ban on arms sales was abolished proves that the policy of the Estonian government in enacting a demonstration breakthrough in obtaining arms from Israel was right," Helme said, recalling the Israeli-Estonian arms deal of $49 million, concluded last year. Helme stated that from now on it is possible that arms will be obtained from several NATO states, admitting, however, that there was no need for additional large arms deals between Estonia and foreign countries in the nearest future. MP Trivimi Velliste told ETA that Clinton's decision was a "serious step in strengthening the international position of the Baltic states", which could be connected with the active participation of the Baltic states in the Partnership for Peace programme.
