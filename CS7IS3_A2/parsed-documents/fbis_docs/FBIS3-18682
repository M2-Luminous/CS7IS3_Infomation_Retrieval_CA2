The North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Ministry in Duesseldorf confirmed a report in the NEUE RUHR/RHEIN ZEITUNG paper, (Saturday's edition), according to which they will be returned by aircraft via the Romanian town of Temesvar and thereafter proceed by bus to the Serbian border. Those involved numbered "probably a few thousand" refugees whose applications for asylum were rejected. People from rump Yugoslavia who were living in Germany illegally or who had committed criminal offenses were also likely to be deported, the report said.
