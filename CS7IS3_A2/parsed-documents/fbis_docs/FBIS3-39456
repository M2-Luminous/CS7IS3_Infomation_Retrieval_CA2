"In order to do justice to the different conditions in the individual sectors and regions, wages must be varied. Regions with weak infrastructures in both eastern and western Germany require a lower wage level than strong regions, not least because job opportunities must be improved," the Bundesbank's latest monthly report states. One of the reasons it considers such a variation in wages justifiable is "that the cost of living in the individual regions varies." Thus, housing costs -- be it for one's own or rented accommodation -- are "much lower in areas with a weak infrastructure than in prospering urban areas." Wages in eastern Germany are reported to have been 80 percent of the west German average at the end of 1993. "This means that the catching-up process should slowly be coming to an end." The Bundesbank is still very cautious about evaluating economic trends. "The basic trend of the west German economy continues to be in a trough; recession has not been completely overcome." The Bundesbank considers "mainly domestic factors responsible" for the continuing sluggishness. Thus, in private households, "higher incomes are more than used up by price increases and increases in taxes and contributions." There is, therefore, "no financial room" to fulfill any additional wishes consumers might have. The Bundesbank considers investment behavior still impaired by "declining business profits, a lack of positive future outlook, as well as a continuing low capacity utilization." Capacity utilization is so low at the moment that rationalization projects rather than investments seem to be the priority." In "the otherwise rather gloomy economic landscape," the guardians of the currency see rays of hope in the fields of housing construction and foreign demand. Even if the expected upswing were to take place, they do not expect the labor market to relax yet. "Companies' adjustment to the lower level of activity has not yet been completed." In December, 610,000 fewer people were in gainful employment in western Germany than the previous year; at a seasonally adjusted 2.5 million, the number of unemployed was some 480,000 above the 1992 figure. A positive development is the slowing-down of price increases, the Bundesbank says: Taking out the mineral oil tax increase, "seasonally adjusted consumer prices only went up at an annual 2.5 percent over the last six months." The monthly report notes a "continuing vigorous economic growth," in eastern Germany, which has also reached the processing industry. Although new products and improved production methods have made east German businesses more competitive in Germany, they have not yet been able to gain a sufficient foothold in foreign markets." The Bundesbank considers the level of economic activity in the new laender "still low." Yet, job cuts are coming to an end, it says.
