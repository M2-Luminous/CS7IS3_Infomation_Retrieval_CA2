The first item on the agenda of the Soskovets commission's session yesterday was worded in a fairly all-embracing manner: On the Development Prospects of Maritime Kray Taking Into Account Russia's Geostrategic and Economic Interests in the Asian-Pacific Region. The government reacted seriously to the threat of the Far East's economic split from European Russia. A central subject in the discussion of Far Eastern problems at the commission's session was the growing threat of Russia's economic disintegration. There are several reasons for such a threat. First of all Maritime Kray's remoteness. This results in sharp increases in transportation and energy costs for the local enterprises, so making them absolutely uncompetitive on the domestic market (even compared to enterprises located in European Russia). At the same time Far Eastern ports and railroad networks ensure 50 percent of Russia's export infrastructure. According to First Deputy Economy Minister Andrey Shapovalyants, keeping Maritime Kray basically viable calls for approximately $5 billion and 4.5 trillion rubles a year. Furthermore, the federal government is seriously worried about China's expansion in this region: At present there are approximately 150,000 Chinese citizens living in the region (many of them illegally). The half-hearted measures taken in the past (fixed coal prices, limited subsidies, and so forth) alleviated the region's economic burdens only to an extent, without resolving the problem in principle. Virtually all the speakers stressed that today there is a real threat of Maritime Kray's economy breaking away and integrating into the economic system of the Pacific Rim countries as a "junior brother" -- a supplier of raw materials. The gist of the government's reaction to this threat was summed up by Mr. Shapovalyants. In his opinion, it is necessary to talk about eventually establishing a "special economic regime" in the Far East. It is clear however that spelling out the specific content of this term is not a matter for the immediate future (a special working group will deal with this). Yet even now the main features of such a "special zone" can be outlined. According to First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, the government should create conditions for using the raw materials potential of the Russian Far East precisely in the Far East. The implementation of this concept could lead to the formation of a kind of economic enclave -- a part effectively independent from European Russia and oriented mainly toward the economically most promising region -- the Pacific Rim. In this event the main task for the federal government in this region will be to retain the military and export infrastructure as well as the local administration's political loyalty. Also noteworthy is the idea of establishing a "location rent" for the Russian/European enterprises, which, although not discussed at the session, is contained in a memorandum by the State Industry Committee. This means that the situation of Far Eastern enterprises is deemed "normal" for Russia's economy while the others have to pay a kind of tax compensating for their more favorable geographic position. True, as the session's results show, far less radical steps should be expected from the federal government in the near future. In all likelihood, preferential transport tariffs will be established for Maritime Kray (the participants were impressed with the experience of the tsarist government which used such measures to invigorate economic activity in areas far away from Moscow). It is also likely that the sum of budget subsidies for the Maritime region will also be revised.
