This, however, had no impact on the intention of deputies of various political orientations to play together the leading role as the primary legislative organ. Notably, a statement made by Vladimir Shumeyko, recently elected chairman of the Federation Council, about a possible shift in the lawmaking center of gravity to the upper chamber of the Russian parliament met with a negative assessment from Duma members of the most diverse party affiliations. Vladimir Shumeyko's aggressive position toward the Duma is caused by rather well-founded fears: the economic consequences of an active influence in the lower chamber by the left-wing populist forces may prove more appreciable than were the opposition moods of the Supreme Soviet that the president disbanded. On the other hand, Shumeyko's point of view was apparently corroborated by the expectation of serious opposition to the Duma's left wing by Russia's Choice supporters, something that could have dragged out work and given cause to accuse the chamber of inefficiency during the organizational stage (the elections for speaker, the formation of the committees leadership). Much as could have been expected, Shumeyko's statement was adamantly opposed by members of the Duma. Independent grouping leaders Irina Khakamada (the 12 December group) and Vladimir Medvedev (the "Independent Regional Policy" faction) noted that it held no water from the constitutional point of view. Yabloko's head Grigoriy Yavlinskiy called it "nonsense." Aleksandr Pochinok, a Russia's Choice supporter and more experienced in parliamentary ways, stressed that "Shumeyko is a strong guy, but bypassing the Duma at the time of forming the budget would not succeed at all." At the same time, the outcome of the elections for the heads of Duma committees showed that the positions of the democratic blocs are not all that weak -- the committee for budget, taxes, banks, and finances is lead by Mikhail Zadornov ("Yabloko") with Aleksandr Pochinok ("Russia's Choice") as his deputy, and Gennadiy Kulik, former vice premier of Russia, having been elected as his other deputy. Besides, representatives of the democratic wing have filled the deputy positions in the economic policy committee, the privatization committee, and the industrial committee, of which, however, Vladimir Gusev of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has become chairman. The opposition has also taken over the offices of the heads of committees for agrarian questions and for economic policy. As a result, the alignment of forces does not indicate a preponderance of supporters of one economic view or the other. The apparat experience of Duma members such as Anatoliy Lukyanov, however, around whom an informal center of opposition leadership is already taking shape, affords a supposition that the left-wing populists in the Duma may score a success in voting on fundamental economic questions. Attesting to this is also a higher level of organization of the opposition supporters that was already demonstrated during the struggle between factions last week.
