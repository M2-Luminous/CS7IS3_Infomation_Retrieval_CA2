FR941104-2-00004 FR941104-2-00002 Rural Telephone Bank Determination of the 1994 Fiscal Year Interest Rates on Rural Telephone Bank Loans AGENCY: Rural Telephone Bank, USDA. ACTION: Notice of 1994 fiscal year interest rates determination. SUMMARY: In accordance with 7 CFR 1610.10, the Rural Telephone Bank fiscal year 1994 cost of money rates have been established as follows: 6.15% and 6.40% for advances from the liquidating account and financing account, respectively (fiscal year is the period beginning October 1 and ending September 30). Except for loans approved from October 1, 1987 through December 21, 1987 where borrowers elected to remain at interest rates set at loan approval, all loan advances made during fiscal year 1994 under bank loans approved prior to fiscal year 1992 shall bear interest at the rate of 6.15% (the liquidating account rate). All loan advances made during fiscal year 1994 under bank loans approved during or after fiscal year 1992 shall bear interest at the rate of 6.40% (the financing account rate). The calculation of the Bank's cost of money rates for fiscal year 1994 for the liquidating account and the financing account are provided in Tables 1a and 1b. Since the calculated rates are greater than the minimum rate (5.00%) allowed under 7 U.S.C. 948(b)(3)(A), the cost of money rates for the liquidating account and financing account are set at 6.15% and 6.40%, respectively. The methodology required to calculate the cost of money rates is established in 7 CFR 1610.10(c). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Matthew P. Link, Director, Rural Telephone Bank Management Staff, Rural Electrification Administration, room 2832, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, telephone number (202) 720&hyph;0530. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (``Credit Reform'') (2 U.S.C. 661a, et seq. ) implemented a system to reform the budgetary accounting and management of Federal credit programs. Bank loans approved on or after October 1, 1991, are accounted for in a different manner than Bank loans approved prior to fiscal year 1992. As a result, the Bank must calculate two costs of money rates: (1) The cost of money rate for advances made from the liquidating account (advances made during fiscal year 1994 on loans approved prior to fiscal year 1992) and (2) the cost of money rate for advances made during fiscal year 1994 on loans approved on or after October 1, 1991 (otherwise referred to as loans from the financing account). The cost of money rate methodology is the same for both accounts. It develops a weighted average rate for the Bank's cost of money considering total fiscal year loan advances; the excess of fiscal year loan advances over amounts received in the fiscal year from the issuances of Class A, B, and C stocks, debentures and other obligations; and the costs to the Bank of obtaining funds from these sources. Sources and Costs of Funds_Liquidating Account During fiscal year 1994, the Bank was authorized to pay the following dividends: The dividend on Class A stock was 2.00% as established in amended section 406(c) of the Rural Electrification Act; no dividends were payable on Class B stock as specified in 7 CFR 1610.10(c); and the dividend on Class C stock was established by the Bank at 7.5%. In accordance with Section 406(a) of the RE Act, the Bank did not issue Class A stock in fiscal year 1994. Total advances for the purchase of Class B stock and cash purchases for Class B stock were $2,110,537. Rescissions of loan funds advanced for Class B stock amounted to $1,679,067. Thus, the amount received by the Bank from the issuance of Class B stock, per 7 CFR 1610.10(c), was $431,470 ($2,110,537&hyph;1,679,067). The total amount received by the Bank in fiscal year 1994 from the issuance of Class C stock was $16,590. The Bank did not issue debentures or any other obligations related to the liquidating account in fiscal year 1994. Consequently, no cost was incurred related to the issuance of debentures subject to 7 U.S.C. 948(b)(3)(D).
