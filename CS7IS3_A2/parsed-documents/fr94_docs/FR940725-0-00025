FR940725-0-00025 FR940725-0-00007 Section 1.985&hyph;1(b)(2)(ii)(B)( 1 ) clarifies the rule for determining the functional currency of a QBU branch of a foreign corporation when the foreign corporation has a non-dollar functional currency that is not hyperinflationary. If the QBU branch otherwise would have a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency, the branch's functional currency is the functional currency of the foreign corporation. The definition of hyperinflationary currency, now found in §1.985&hyph;1(b)(2)(ii)(D), has been revised to clarify that the cumulative inflation rate during the thirty-six month base period is based on compounded inflation rates for the base period, and not on the sum of annual inflation rates. This change conforms the definition of hyperinflationary currency more closely to that applicable under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Section 1.985&hyph;3(a) provides that, for all purposes of subtitle A, DASTM must be used to compute gross income, income or loss, or earnings and profits (or deficits in earnings and profits). This provision is intended to clarify that DASTM gain or loss is part of gross income for purposes of the de minimis and full inclusion rules of section 954(b)(3) (A) and (B), and that DASTM gain or loss must be taken into account in applying the related party interest rules of section 954(b)(5), among other computations. Section 1.985&hyph;3(a) further provides that, for open taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, but before the effective date of these regulations, the taxpayer has the option to elect DASTM for any open taxable year (and all subsequent taxable years). Taxpayers previously using the P&L method that wish to elect DASTM for prior open years may do so by amending their tax returns for the applicable years and complying with the applicable election procedures of §1.985&hyph;2, including the conformity requirements of §1.985&hyph;2(d)(3), if applicable. Taxpayers that have elected DASTM and applied the rules under prior §1.985&hyph;3 may elect to apply the rules under this revised §1.985&hyph;3 by amending their tax returns for the applicable years. In either case, the Commissioner is deemed to consent. If a taxpayer elects for prior years to change the functional currency of a QBU operating in a hyperinflationary environment to the dollar, it must make the adjustments described in §1.985&hyph;5 (or §1.985&hyph;5T, if applicable) if the year of change begins after 1987, or the adjustments described in §1.985&hyph;6 (or §1.985&hyph;6T, if applicable) if the year of change begins in 1987. The adjustments described in §1.985&hyph;5 (or §1.985&hyph;5T, if applicable) must be included in income in the taxable year prior to the year of change unless that prior taxable year is closed. In that case, the adjustments must be included in income in the year of change. Certain countries with hyperinflation require taxpayers to make adjustments to the balance sheet under a system of monetary correction with respect to fixed assets and capital, with corresponding adjustments to the profit and loss statement. Under U.S. GAAP, these adjustments are reversed. Section 1.985&hyph;3(b)(2) and §1.985&hyph;3(d)(2)(ii) have been clarified to require reversal of monetary correction adjustments required by local accounting principles. Taxpayers suggested that they should be permitted to translate certain financial assets and liabilities at the period-end exchange rate, rather than at the average exchange rate for the last translation period in order to conform the rules under §1.985&hyph;3 to GAAP. To make it clear that the period-end exchange rate may be used, §1.985&hyph;3(c)(6) has been amended to indicate that a spot exchange rate on the last day of the taxable period is a reasonable method, provided that it is consistently and used and conforms to the taxpayer's method of financial accounting. Taxpayers requested guidance with respect to transactions described in section 988(c)(1) (B) and (C) denominated in a currency other than a QBU's hyperinflationary currency or the dollar (third currency transaction). In order to parallel the financial accounting rules for the administrative ease of taxpayers and the Service, §1.985&hyph;3(c)(9) provides that taxpayers may use any reasonable method of accounting for third currency transactions so long as such method is consistent with their method of financial accounting.
