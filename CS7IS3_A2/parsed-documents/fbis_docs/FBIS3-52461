Despite all our steps on the ground that proceeded from the uniqueness of Jordanian-Palestinian relations and despite everything we took into consideration before taking any step toward maintaining this uniqueness, we found ourselves still facing suspicion, doubts, and questioning. Moreover, despite our concern not to waste time by refuting false accusations and our concern to work instead of getting angry, blaming, or turning our backs, our efforts continued to be futile and our stands continued to be the last to be trusted and treated clearly by some PLO leaders. The result was always a loss for us as a nation, a loss for us as one family, and a loss for us as the owners of a just cause in which the only requirement to achieve our rights is a sincere and faithful joint action that is far from any form of prevarication. Today, as Amman witnesses another Jordanian attempt to compensate for the past, correct matters, and place Jordanian-Palestinian coordination before any useless step taken with the enemy, we reaffirm the importance of proceeding from trust and from a feeling, as we sit at one table, that the cause is that of a generation that has suffered a lot and that of generations which we cannot allow to inherit disappointment. We also reaffirm that national and pan-Arab concern over our rights requires us to feel that we are sitting together as brothers and not as those lying in wait for each other. Indeed, it is ridiculous to believe that the Israeli is closer to the Palestinian than the Jordanian is to the Palestinian. It is also ridiculous to believe that the Jordanians can trust the Israeli side while there are continued doubts and suspicions between the Jordanians and the Palestinians. No one can tear apart the unity of or create a substitute for this one family that has been united by four decades of pain, hopes, steadfastness, perseverance, and many dreams. Those who do not fear God in what they think, do, seek, or imagine achieving, or think it is possible to side with the enemy at the expense of the brother will only reap disappointment and loss. Moreover, they will discover too late that it is hard to continue deceiving others by deceiving themselves. This tragedy has not just begun. What we are witnessing now is the natural result of all those years of such an attitude.
