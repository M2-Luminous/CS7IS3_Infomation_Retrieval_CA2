In short, it has the actual support of 52 percent of the house, a support different from the voting which took place a week before the 27 January general strike -- against that reform -- when 90 percent of the deputies rejected the amendments proposed to the bill as a whole by United Left-Initiative for Catalonia and the Canary Islands Coalition. The leading opposition group -- the People's Party -- abstained in the voting on the urgent job promotion measures bill, creating apprenticeship contracts, and supported only a part of the reform of the Workers' Statute. The alliances for approving the new trade union election regulations were different. Here the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] had to rely basically on the votes of United Left and the Canary Islands Coalition, in view of the all-out opposition of Convergence and Union [CiU] and the People's Party to the text agreed on by the government and the main trade unions, the Workers Commissions and the UGT [General Workers Union] -- the only agreement that they have reached in the past four years. The reform of the Workers' Statute and, within it, the new regulation of collective bargaining and dismissal had the support of the PSOE, CiU, and, in part, the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]. The People's Party asked for the voting on the articles to be broken down, and also supported one part of the bill and abstained on another. With the Socialist Party's support, CiU managed to get it deemed not a fraud in law to dismiss in successive three-month periods a number of workers below the threshold set by the bill -- 10 percent of staff -- if the causes cited are different in each 90-day period. In addition, dismissals affecting the entire staff of enterprises with five workers or less will not be deemed mass dismissals. For its part, the urgent employment promotion measures bill was finally approved following the setback which it suffered 10 March at the so-called scandalous plenary session, at which the People's Party reported irregularities in the voting. The bill was sent from the lower house to the Senate with 177 "yes" votes (the PSOE, CiU, and the PNV), 24 "no" votes (United Left, the Canary Islands Coalition, and the Republican Left), and 134 abstentions (the People's Party).
