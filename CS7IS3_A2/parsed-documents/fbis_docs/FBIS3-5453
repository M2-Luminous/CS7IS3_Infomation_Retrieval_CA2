A delegation led by U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade Representative Peter Collins met with Seoul officials for negotiations focusing on intellectual property and opening the South Korean market to American cars. The talks opened just weeks before a report will be submitted to the U.S. Congress on the status of South Korea's intellectual property rights protection. A final decision on whether to drop South Korea from the priority watch list or label it as a priority foreign country is due late next month. Washington is demanding that Seoul continue to crack down on violators and upgrade its laws to match those of the trade-related intellectual properties (TRIPs) of the Uruguay Round. For instance, a movie with an acknowledged copyright in one country automatically receives the same copyright protection in all other nations under the terms of TRIPs. South Korean law, however, only recognizes a movie copyright from after 1987. Seoul explained that it conducted a special crackdown on violators in the January-October period last year, which helped improve the situation. On another front, Washington took issue with various barriers in South Korea when buying U.S. cars such as high tariffs and the acquisition tax. U.S. officials also described what they saw as psychological barriers, such as worries about a tax audit when purchasing a foreign automobile. Seoul replied that it does not erect such barriers and that its current 10 percent tariff is not high compared with common international practice. It explained the rate has already been lowered from 15 percent and thus cannot be reduced further this year. The European union also levies a 10 percent tariff on imported cars, South Korea pointed out.
