[Salagean] Mr. Funar makes many affirmations and all of them in his characteristic style that he always uses in public. However, I believe that this time he has been misinformed. In any event, he cannot be correctly informed about my activity because he is in Cluj and I am in Bucharest. [Popescu] President Funar explains your statements by saying that you have been sick for a few months. [Salagean] We are not talking about statements that might be connected to a situation when I was allegedly annoyed for some reason. There is only one thing that really upsets me and that is stupidity. And when stupidity crosses my path and I cannot avoid it, then I try to push it forcefully aside. Let me explain this. There was no question of my being excluded from those negotiations. I must draw the attention of Mr. Funar and of those who believe in the words spread by him to the following: The first discussions that I held on the PUNR's participation in the government took place at the beginning of September 1993 and three people participated in them, namely, [PUNR Vice President] Ioan Gavra, [PUNR Deputy] Valeriu Tabara, and myself. The talks were held in the the prime minister's office. After we had presented him with certain aspects of our policy and also named a few ministries that we were interested in, he suggested that the discussions should not continue at that stage with the government but should rather be transferred to the two parties. Thus, the discussions continued with the FDSN [Democratic National Salvation Front, now the PDSN] leaders. Therefore, I participated in the initial stage of these negotiations. As far as my alleged annoyance about the nonparticipation in the Cotroceni talks is concerned, such rumors are no novelty. There was no question of annoyance whatsoever. I stated that I did not want to participate in those talks with the president in Mr. Funar's presence, because I do not want to blush when I hear original political fabrications uttered in front of the country's president. I have respect for that institution. [Popescu] As far as we know, until recently, even the Cotroceni itself imposed an embargo on PUNR President Funar. [Salagean] I do not know what his relations are with the Cotroceni. However I know that when I participate in negotiations, I do not want to blush in shame for statements that I hear uttered by my colleagues in the talks. This time the PUNR's Bureau probably took into consideration this past principle of mine to refuse to participate in PUNR meetings at the presidency when Mr. Funar is present. This is the true story. Certainly I would have liked, exceptionally, to participate in the latest meeting because I had something to say in front of the president, namely, to tell him not to commit the error that has already been circulated and that has started to take shape, that is, discussing PUNR participation in the government. Such a political act could disrupt all the political forces in our country in the present circumstances. I shared these thoughts with some of my colleagues and that may be the explanation of why I was not included in the talks. [Popescu] It seems that the PDSR and the PUNR have already established the latest details. [Salagean] Unfortunately, I notice with the greatest surprise that the discussions between the PDSR and the PUNR are being kept very secret, mainly from certain senators and deputies. However, they are not being kept secret from the press and other parties. I have learned from the press what the PUNR's demands are. They have named four or five ministries and I was surprised to see this, as I know that we have no adequate people for any of those ministries. Our offers -- and please do not ask me to name names because I will not do so -- were circulated in the press and I suppose that these are indeed the ones, but I do not want you to hear them from me. Those people are below the level of being able to compete with those who currently occupy these positions, that is, the ministerial portfolios. Thus, this is the major reason why I think that the offer of the PUNR is frail, very weak, and lacking in consistency. [Popescu] In this case, the PUNR's request to participate in the government was mainly based on vanity? [Salagean] I believe that currently -- to use the familiar phrases -- there are a few PUNR people who want to be in the government, having already entered the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, or becoming prefects, subprefects, or I do not even know what kind of important post, such as general directors in certain ministries or secretaries of state. They want by any means possible to see themselves, at least for a week or two, a month, or perhaps even a year as a minister. Certainly, we are talking here more about vanity than the desire or the power to do anything useful for the country. In addition, you should not forget that accepting the PUNR in government or establishing a biparty government structure -- I believe -- would be a real danger, a very bad signal sent toward Europe. No matter what we want to do, no matter how we want to change our image, for the time being the PUNR appears in the political arena to be an extremist party. However, I refuse to believe that the PUNR is in its structures an extremist party. But, through its leaders and through the attitude of those leaders -- and in this respect I am primarily thinking of Mr. Funar -- through many of his willful and irresponsible attitudes and hasty gestures and actions, the PUNR is burdened with this label of an extremist party. [Popescu] How representative is the current PUNR leadership? [Salagean] I would like to believe that for the spirit of the PUNR, Mr. Funar is not in the least representative. His declarations and actions, at least the most recent ones, are either made on his own behalf, or by a furious person, or they are those of the mayor of Cluj. Many senators whom I know very well distance themselves from those declarations as soon as they are uttered. It is absolutely necessary to make changes in the PUNR leadership. Otherwise, there is the danger that the PUNR will join and discredit this government, which can hardly stand upright. But, there is also the danger that the PUNR will be continuously discredited by Mr. Funar's willful attitude. I believe that we should not now unnecessarily stir up nationalism. [Popescu] What will you do if Mr. Funar's removal from the PUNR's leadership is not successful? Will you resign? [Salagean] I am not one to give up a fight. I feel capable of fighting, and I am not ill as Mr. Funar has implied with his characteristic cynicism. In any event, he may not know it, but a heart attack has nothing to do with mental disease, from which many of the current leaders of this party suffer. I believe that Mr. Funar will understand the current danger that faces the PUNR mainly because of his willful and hasty gestures and he himself will find the solutions. One of these would be to resign and to devote himself to his mayor's office in Cluj. Another might be to convene an extraordinary congress of the party and to discuss all the issues openly, without arrangements of the type made at the time when Mr. Radu Ceontea [former PUNR leader], who was one of the founders of the party -- and he certainly had his own failings -- was removed from the political scene of the PUNR and a person like Mr. Funar, who has brought much, very much disrepute onto the party, should be kept at the helm. Common sense would compel us to make a decision in this respect. [Popescu] According to your information, are there many members of your party who share your ideas? [Salagean] I have never carried out an opinion poll in this respect, but, knowing very many PUNR members, I believe that common sense will force them to move to my side and support the idea of changes within the PUNR. [Popescu] Recently we were informed that President Iliescu wants to use you to eliminate the PUNR from the negotiations. Similarly, it is known that the PDSR at one point set conditions for the continuation of the negotiations, namely the removal of Mr. Funar. [Salagean] This is an interesting interpretation; I have never thought of this. I would like to state very clearly that I have held no discussions whatsoever in the past year with any person connected with the Cotroceni. Such an interpretation would certainly be a forced one and I deny it because I had no contacts whatsoever, not even with Mr. Adrian Nastase. On the contrary, I would like to say that, the most violent attack on Mr. Nastase, when he made those statements about the behavior of certain PUNR leaders and suggested the need for a change of mentalities within the PUNR, which was aimed at controlling Mr. Funar, and even suggested his removal, may have been from me when I intervened most forcefully at the news conference, saying that we do not accept anybody interfering in our affairs. There I defended the idea of the independence of a party. We rejected the idea of making little signs to signal that "it is not good what you are doing." But it is certain that we basically agreed with Mr. Adrian Nastase! Changes can start within the PUNR only through an internal impetus, not an external one. I can state categorically that such an interpretation is completely erroneous. I also have many fundamental criticisms of President Iliescu. One of them is connected with current events. I have understood that President Iliescu is separating two elements that should complement each other concerning the negotiations at the Cotroceni, the move toward a political pact and the move toward a new government. These two things cannot be separated. Otherwise, it means nothing more than a dialogue between the deaf.
