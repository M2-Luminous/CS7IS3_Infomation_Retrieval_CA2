What To Do With Dollar Loans and Credits"] [Text] Almaty -- Vice Premier Akezhan Kazhegeldin has told journalists how many dollars foreign countries are promising Kazakhstan this year. The total is more than $1 billion. But the republic will need the same amount again to cover the expected budget deficit of 4 percent of GNP. "First and foremost there is the rehabilitation loan, whereby Austria gives us $5 million, Sweden and Turkey $2 million each, the United States $31 million, the European Union $60 million, the Asian Development Bank $34 million, international financial corporations $30 million, the World Bank $256 million, and Russia $20 million... In all we get $719.3 million." The vice premier began the meeting with these figures. Moreover, Kazakhstan is promised trade credits worth $296.9 million. Finally, there will also be technical aid, to get market structures operating in Kazakhstan. It will amount to more than $72 million. More than $40 million of this is grants, that is, they are nonrepayable. If you add all this up, it could mean that more than $1.344 billion will be injected into the economy this year. How does the republic intend to use these financial injections? Some $255 million from the IMF will go to the National Bank to support the tenge. Some $719 million will be used to keep the balance of payments deficit from exceeding 4 percent of GNP, which is an essential condition imposed by the creditors. How Kazakhstan intends to settle all these loans is another matter. Indeed, it is already committed to an outlay of $85 million this year to service credits. Russia's position is interesting in connection with the dollar euphoria in the republic. It is itself a donor to Kazakhstan. In the first place it actively interceded on Kazakhstan's behalf in the Paris Club, evidently reckoning that dollar injections there would support the reforms in Russia itself. Second, as in the past, it granted technical credit in rubles. Vice Premier Kazhegeldin believes that if it carries on like this, if the reforms are implemented "according to plan," then Kazakhstan itself will become a donor-country in five or six years' time and will help these countries with credits.
