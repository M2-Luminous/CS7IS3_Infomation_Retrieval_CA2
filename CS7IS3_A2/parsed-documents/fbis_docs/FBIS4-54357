The report, presented by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to the cabinet, appears certain to add fuel to calls from other Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations for action to trim Japan's trade surpluses ahead of the G-7 summit scheduled for July in Naples. The latest reporting year was the 12th straight year in which Japan's net overseas assets -- overseas assets minus foreign liabilities -- increased from the year-earlier level. Gross overseas assets rose 7.2 percent to 2,180.8 billion dollars, of which more than 80 percent were held in the private sector in the form of overseas lending, factory, stock and property. The growth in gross assets was fanned by a whopping 6.2 percent jump in assets held in stocks and bonds which Japanese investors purchased for long-term investment or a holding period of more than one year. Private direct foreign investment or purchases of real estate and construction of factories climbed 4.7 percent to 259.7 billion dollars, reflecting an unabated trend among Japanese firms to shift production abroad. In the public sector, foreign lending, such as Official Development Assistance (ODA), increased 17.4 percent to 103.6 billion dollars. By maturity, long-term assets rose 7.4 percent to 1,412.9 billion dollars, while short-term assets grew 6.7 percent to 767.9 billion dollars. Total liabilities edged up 3.2 percent to 1.57 trillion dollars for the first increase in two years as foreign investors boosted purchases of Japanese securities and Japanese firms increased loans in foreign currencies. According to the latest data available, Germany and Britain are the only other net creditor nations among the G-7 nations. Canada, France, Italy and the United States are all debtor nations. Germany had net foreign assets of 257.6 billion dollars at the end of June 1993, while Britain's net foreign assets totaled 521.3 billion dollars at the end of 1992.
