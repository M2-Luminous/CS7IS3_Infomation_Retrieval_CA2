Iran's permanent representative to the U.N. Kamal Kharrazi in a letter to the U.N. secretary general termed the June 4th infiltration of counter-revolutionary elements into the Iranian territory as explicit violation of the cease-fire between the two countries. According to the letter, a number of counter-revolutionary elements crossed the border and penetrated 4 kilometres inside the Iranian territory in Ilam Province and opened fire on the Iranian forces on Eyn-Ghazal and south Halaleh road. As a result, two Iranians were martyred and four others, including one sergeant and three soldiers, were captured by them.
