Monde points out that the lower chamber is sticking to the resolution passed on 3 March. Frantz Robert Monde had invited the U.S. ambassador to meet with him on Tuesday, 29 March, to inform the ambassador on the position of the Chamber of Deputies. Let us listen to Monde, interviewed after his meeting with U.S. Ambassador William Lacy Swing: [Begin recording] [Monde] I explained to the American ambassador that I was a legislator. I took a position on a crisis concerning my country, and it is out of the question for the Haitian parliament to submit to a plan presented by certain American lawmakers. The ambassador tried to explain to me that it is the concept of democracy in this country that prompted lawmakers to work on a plan. I gave him to understand that I too had worked on a plan, and the parliament will not accept any pressure from any other parliament or other legislators; we have learned that a country can not live in isolation, but I have also learned that a country's sovereignty can not be trampled underfoot, particularly the prestige and dignity of the Haitian parliament. As for another plan, it is a Black Caucus affair. It does not concern the Haitian legislators. I even told Senator Dodd yesterday that if Father Aristide elicits such admiration from so many great men within the U.S. Congress, they can just elect him to be the president of the U.S. Congress. [Unidentified reporter] This other plan is allegedly being prepared by the State Department? [Monde] That is the State Department's concern, not the Haitians' concern. The State Department has already conceived other plans for Haiti. The plans did not succeed. The [Haitian] legislators took the matter in hand. We prepared a plan; we are sticking to it, and this plan, its conception, was not influenced by either Aristide or the Army. This plan must be implemented, or what must be done will be done.
