In addition, the PP delegation also took the opportunity to meet with representatives of Cuba's domestic opposition. Guillermo Gortazar, PP deputy and party secretary, and Information Office Director Miguel Angel Rodriguez told EFE the visit was "a goodwill gesture by the PP, and it has been fully satisfactory and the objectives have been met." Gortazar stressed that they conveyed "a message of accord" to the Cuban authorities in the event of a change of government in Spain, but they also made it clear that the PP would suggest recommendations to initiate a process of political opening. He added that, so far, the PP has demanded improvements in the treatment of political prisoners, amnesty, and an acknowledgement of the right to association, just as the current Constitution envisions. "Economic changes must translate into genuine political changes to enable the people to voice protests that will stem from the required adjustment measures," the deputy pointed out after warning that some Cuban leaders recognize the risk of a "social explosion," particularly in Havana. "Deregulation and opening are a matter of common sense and political prudence, and it is up to the current leaders to equitably conduct this process from within the government," Gortazar stated. Miguel Angel Rodriguez insisted that the changes "must be carried out from within," and he pointed out that the term most used during his meetings was that of "reconciliation." Gortazar and Martinez who today, Sunday, ended a visit that began on Wednesday, met with Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice president of the Council of Ministers; Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]; and Jose Ramon Machado Ventura and Jose Ramon Balaguer, members of the Cuban Communist Party [PCC] Central Committee Politburo who are responsible for propaganda and ideology. "This is the first time," Martinez pointed out, "that a PP mission has been received by the Central Committee." The PP representatives, who stressed "the receptiveness" of the meetings, said their party will invite between eight and 10 Cuban officials to a seminar on "political transition" that will be held in Madrid in the autumn. Both PP leaders noted that Cuban authorities expressed great interest in establishing closer ties with the PP, as demonstrated by the fact that official interviews included on their itinerary were not canceled following their meeting with some members of Cuba's domestic opposition. "This establishes a precedence and is evidence that the Cuban authorities' interest in the PP is very high," Miguel Angel Martinez stated. Human rights activists Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz, Vladimiro Roca, Rene del Pozo, Jesus Yanes Pelletier, and Gustavo Arcos, as well as others, participated in meetings with the PP. According to Gortazar, they said, "the government is giving out false signals of change, while, at the same time, the human rights situation is deteriorating."
