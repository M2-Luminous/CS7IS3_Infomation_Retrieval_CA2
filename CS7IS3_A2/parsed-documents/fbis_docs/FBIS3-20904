The draft directive (European law) aims first of all to promote the competitiveness of EU science and industry in the field of biotechnology. "Because inventions could not be protected in Europe, recent years saw a European brain drain toward areas where their patents were better protected," Mr. Urbain pointed out. The draft directive makes it possible to patent therapeutic methods that modify the human genetic makeup, but it also establishes the basic principle that the human body cannot be patented. "We are not going to promote genetic engineering." According to an expert, the objective is to pave the way for methods which offer prospects of curing hundreds of diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. It is understood that modifications must be undertaken solely for therapeutic purposes and must be fully consistent with human dignity. According to a diplomatic source, Spain was opposed to all methods that would lead to a modification of the human genetic makeup. "But if such modifications are patentable, it does not follow that they will be allowed," the Belgian minister also pointed out. The draft directive must still be formally approved by a ministers council before coming into force, by 1996 at the latest.
