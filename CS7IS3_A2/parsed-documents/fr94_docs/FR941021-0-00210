FR941021-0-00210 FR941021-0-00024 (c) Withdrawal/expulsion. An inmate may withdraw voluntarily from the program. The drug abuse treatment coordinator may remove an inmate from the program based upon disruptive or negative behavior. Withdrawal or removal from the residential program may result in the inmate's being returned to his/her prior institution (when the inmate had been specifically transferred for the purpose of program participation) and/or return of tangible incentives previously achieved. §550.56 Incentives for residential drug abuse treatment program participation. (a) An inmate may receive incentives for his or her satisfactory involvement in the residential program. These incentives may include, but are not limited to, the following. (1) Limited financial awards, based upon the inmate's achievement/completion of program phases. (2) Consideration for the maximum period of time (currently 180 days) in a Community Corrections Center placement, provided the inmate is otherwise eligible for this designation. (3) Local institution incentives such as preferred living quarters or special recognition privileges. (b) An inmate must meet his/her financial program responsibility obligations (see 28 CFR part 545) prior to being able to receive an incentive for his/her residential program participation. §550.57 Non-residential drug abuse treatment program. Non-residential drug abuse treatment is provided at all institutions and ordinarily consists of individual and/or group counseling and self-help programming provided through the institution's Psychology Services department. (a) Eligibility. The following criteria must be met for an inmate to be recommended or approved for a non-residential drug abuse treatment program. (1) The inmate must have a documented drug abuse problem. (2) The inmate must have no serious mental impairment which would substantially interfere with or preclude full participation in the program. (3) The inmate must sign an agreement acknowledging his/her program responsibility. (b) Application/Referral/Placement. Participation in the non-residential drug abuse treatment program is voluntary. An inmate may be referred for treatment by unit and/or drug treatment staff or may apply for these programs by submitting a request to a staff member (ordinarily, a member of the inmate's unit team or the drug abuse treatment coordinator). The decision on placement is made by the drug abuse treatment coordinator. (c) Withdrawal/expulsion. An inmate may withdraw voluntarily from the program. The drug abuse treatment coordinator may remove an inmate from the program based upon disruptive or negative behavior. §550.58 Transitional services. (a) Transitional treatment programming is required for all inmates completing an institution's residential treatment program. Transitional treatment includes treatment provided to inmates who, upon completing the residential program, return to the general population of that or another institution. An inmate's refusal to participate in this program is considered a program failure and disqualifies the inmate for any additional incentives consideration, and may result in the inmate's redesignation. (b) An inmate who successfully completes a residential drug abuse program and who, based on eligibility, is transferred to a Community Corrections Center (CCC), is required to participate in a community-based treatment program each week, in addition to the required employment and other program activities of the CCC. The inmate's failure to meet the requirements of treatment may result in the inmate's being returned to the institution for refusing a program assignment. (c) Staff may offer an inmate who has not been involved in the institution's drug abuse treatment program the opportunity to become involved in the transitional drug treatment program as part of the inmate's CCC placement. In addition, with the drug abuse treatment coordinator's approval, an inmate may volunteer and be accepted for transitional drug treatment programming. 3.
