FR940325-2-00175 FR940325-2-00083 [Docket No. 72&hyph;10] Northern States Power Co.; Issuance of Amendment to Materials License SNM&hyph;2506 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 1 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2506 held by Northern States Power Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the Prairie Island independent spent fuel storage installation, located in Goodhue County, Minnesota. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance. The amendment corrects the license making administrative changes to correct an error which was made when the license was issued. These changes do not affect fuel receipt, handling, and storage safety. The amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Prior public notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(c)(11), an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection with issuance of the amendment. For further details with respect to this action, see (1) Amendment No. 1 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2506, and (2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated March 17, 1994. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room at the Technology & Science Department, Minneapolis Public Library, 300 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN 55401. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 17th day of March, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Charles J. Haughney, Chief, Storage and Transport Systems Branch, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NMSS.
