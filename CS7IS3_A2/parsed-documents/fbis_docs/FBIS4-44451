But while we may rejoice over the success, we cannot help but be somewhat concerned, what does the 15.4 billion yuan really tell us? A Series of Shocking Figures According to a report furnished by an authoritative source, analysis of the total monetary amount of tax and financial revenue violations uncovered in the 1993 inspection indicates that: -- By method of inspection, 6.57 billion yuan or 42.8 percent came from internal inspection by the enterprises and work units, and 8.79 billion yuan or 57.2 percent from outside inspection. The amounts of violations in the two categories are 2.39 billion yuan and 4.35 billion yuan respectively more than the amounts from the inspection the year before. -- By type of tax evasion, 8 billion yuan or 52 percent were violations of tax collection regulations; 4.15 billion yuan or 27 percent were violations of financial regulations; and 3.2 billion yuan or 21 percent were violations of commodity pricing and other regulations. -- By number of organizational units, 10,359 units had amounts of violations ranging between 50-100,000 yuan; 6,305 units between 100-500,000 yuan; 986 units between 500,000 and 1 million yuan; and 472 units in the range of 1 million yuan and over. -- By province or city, Liaoning had amounts of violations totaling over 800 million yuan; Sichuan and Shanghai municipality over 700 million yuan; Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong and Jiangsu over 600 million yuan; Hebei, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang and Henan over 500 million yuan; Guangxi over 400 million yuan; and other provinces and cities such as Anhui, Beijing, Jilin, Jiangxi, Shanxi and Heilongjiang over 300 million yuan. Key Objective of Violators of Law and Regulation: Tax Evasion In the series of nine annual inspections of tax and financial revenues and commodity prices, the monetary amount of violations uncovered each year reflects most clearly that the most serious violations are in tax collection area. Evasion and diversion of industrial, commercial and other taxes by enterprise units and the "two currencies" situation are particularly serious. If the total monetary amount of tax violations from the 1993 inspection were broken down by type, 6.183 billion yuan were industrial, commercial and other taxes; 1.85 billion yuan were income, regulatory and profits taxes; 1.187 billion yuan were diversion from active capital or reserves accounts of energy, transportation and key construction projects; the combined total of the above amounts to 9.22 billion yuan, 63.4 percent of the total monetary amount of violations. Taxes have become the target of attack by those who violate the laws and regulations. As shown by relevant statistics and investigation into special areas, among the enterprise units that have been inspected, problems of tax evasion still exist in over 50 percent of the cases; whenever inspections are carried out in many local enterprises, particularly individually owned and operated industrial and commercial enterprises, cases of violation and tax evasion would invariably be uncovered. There was the case of a subsidiary firm of a certain agricultural production material company which, from beginning 1992 to September 1993, arbitrarily treated 8.04 million yuan of unspent dock service fees returned by an import company as an account payable amount, did not calculate its profits in a timely way as required by regulations, and evaded 4,422,000 million yuan in income taxes and diverted 904,500 yuan in "two currencies" for a total of 5,326,500 yuan. In south China, there was the case of a certain provincial postal and telecommunications bureau's trade service company which, from 1992 through the first half of 1993, using various methods such as repeatedly depreciating its equipment, hiding income receipts and under-reporting profits, was able to evade enterprise, income, city construction taxes, as well as "two currencies" and education fees totaling 2,025,800 yuan. Looking at the situation revealed by the inspections, enterprises that evade or divert over 1 million yuan in taxes are no longer uncommon. The 1993 inspection revealed that the use of bogus invoices and real estate development and operations were the major sources of tax violations. A certain city in Fujian Province undertook a special audit of 349 real estate development companies in the city, and found that by resorting to various tactics of not recording offshore receipts, treating real estate down payments as income-expense transactions, under-reporting for tax purposes the full amounts of real estate sold, treating land-for-property exchanges as noncash exchanges and not recorded in their books, these companies were able to evade large amounts of taxes totaling 70.95 million yuan, averaging 203,000 yuan per company. One of these companies, by not recording offshore incomes of some 100 million yuan, evaded as much as 3.03 million yuan in taxes. In Guangxi, some real estate companies exploited the tax-free loophole by early closing of their accounts of capital and profits, exchanging property for land and building commercial property on it for another party without calculating the price, and recklessly organizing nominal subsidiary units; these companies, using such tactics and operating off the books, also evaded taxes by making long-term use of the monies they set aside to pay taxes as well as the monies collected from property purchasers as payment of taxes. A certain development company collected in advance 51.20 million yuan in down payments for property purchasers with the estimate that the project will be completed by 1994. But in order to qualify for the 1992 (income) tax exemption deadline, the company arbitrarily transferred 50.78 million yuan of down payments as receipts from sales, paid 2,507,000 yuan in advance for the enterprise tax, construction tax and education fees, and entered 23.8 million yuan of recovered capital and profits as "other accounts payable"; as a result, the company was able to evade 17,135,700 yuan in income taxes due in 1993-1994. The inspection discovered the rather serious problem of some real estate companies delaying tax payments for long periods of time. One company, since 1988, had collected 19,126,000 yuan of advance down payments from its customers, and although the properties had long since been turned over to the buyers, the company only recorded 5,36,3400 million as sales in 1990, paid a business tax of 168,700 yuan and put off paying the rest of the business tax, construction tax and "two currencies" totaling almost 3 million yuan. The phenomenon of using bogus invoices to evade taxes is also shocking. A certain city in Zhejiang Province, in the process of inspection, discovered that 799 companies had invoice violations amounting to a total of as much as 320 million yuan. In one district, nine labor service companies, which specialized in recruiting peasants to work as "clerks," peddled to various government departments and other enterprise employers a total of 1,918 invoices in January-September 1992, and out of a total of 130 million yuan of invoices they evaded 4.14 million yuan of taxes. Those who used the invoices could enter whatever monetary figures, including large sums, as desired. Shocking Diversions If evading and under-reporting taxes is the main objective of those who violate laws and regulations, then diverting national income to private use is undoubtedly their second objective. In Sichuan Province, from 1922 to September 1933, a supervisory department without authorization diverted various taxes it had collected for transmission to the Central Government to its own use as administrative expenses, fees for labor association and meal subsidies for staff employees, and as much as 4,508,000 million was so spent. A certain social welfare bureau in Hebei violated regulations by arbitrarily diverting 3.37 million yuan from the workers pension fund using it in other business investment activities. The agricultural committee in one district in the Guangxi autonomous region, from January 1990 to May 1993, violated government financial regulations by taking as much as 388,200 yuan of income received from sponsorship, labor services, operating its own enterprises and compensation for contract violations, and using the money off the books for business; the money created a "small treasury" which earned 162,300 yuan by May 1993, and the rest of the money was used for installing telephones, wining and dining and other social activities. A fuel supply company in a certain province privately set up a "small treasury" with 1,033,600 yuan. Since 1991, that company without authorization collected a total of 315,400 yuan in fees by issuing permits for shipping charcoal and coal not allocated for in the provincial plan; by using various tactics, the company went into joint operation with out-of-province enterprises and divided among them 302,600 yuan of profits; they acquired properties and fixed assets at negotiated prices and transferred a total of 1,033,600 yuan into the company's "small treasury." Up to the time of the inspection, transactions in the "small treasury" totaled 545,700 yuan, most of which are in the form of IOU's and are issued and used at random. And even worst, the general operations department of a certain railroad bureau diverted and hid profits from various operations totaling 10,326,000 yuan, a serious diversion of funds belong to the government. The 1993 inspection also revealed other phenomena and activities of violations of law and regulations that are shocking. The situation of government administrative units blindly collecting all kinds of fees is very serious. A municipal planning committee in Guangxi charged investors engineering consulting fees at the rate of 1 percent of the investment amounts, and collected a total of 2,524,400 yuan between 1992 and August 1993, which added additional burden on the enterprises and caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some people compared this to the saying of "building a nest to attract wind" before any investors show up and, when the "wind" comes, "climbing in the nest and plucking feathers," a bitter pill indeed for investors to swallow. The unauthorized issuance of various commodity certificates in lieu of cash is still going on. There was the case of nine large markets in a certain locality in Yunnan which, after the State Council issued the directive to stop issuance of such certificates in 1993, nevertheless and without authorization issued over 16.5 million yuan of such cash-substitute certificates. When a large quantity of such certificates were put in use, they became a kind of "cash substitutes" which wreck havoc in the normal financial order; at the same time, when goods are sold, it gave purchasing units the opportunity to use fake receipts for the "electronic products," "labor welfare service" and "office use equipment." Establishing and Perfecting a System of Strict Financial Supervision The fact that a total of 15.4 billion yuan in tax evasion was uncovered in the 1933 inspection of tax revenues, financial affairs and commodity prices leaves people with this thought: there is no time to lose to establish and perfect a system of strict financial supervision. We should recognize that China's current system of financial supervision is not well suited for economic reform and development of a market economy. On the one hand, violations in the financial area are quite serious, and constitute a sickness which in the long term will affect the economy; in the nine annual inspections, almost every one uncovered violations amounting to more than 10 billion yuan; on the other hand, because supervision and inspection of financial activities are inadequate and uncoordinated, the various relevant supervisory bodies are not enforcing policies and regulations in comparable degrees; in inspection, existing regulations have not strictly enforced and cases not forcefully executed, all of which are not conducive to maintaining strict financial supervision. Finally, it is clear that we urgently need to establish as soon as possible a system of properly coordinated financial supervision with a clear division of labor that will be highly effective in its execution.
