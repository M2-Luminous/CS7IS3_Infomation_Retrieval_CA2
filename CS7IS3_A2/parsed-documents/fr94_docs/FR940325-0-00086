FR940325-0-00086 FR940325-0-00016 Comment: There were a number of comments about whether restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources should include reestablishing baseline services provided by the injured resource to other resources (e.g., provision of a food source for fish or wildlife). Some commenters supported consideration of inter-resource services in order to ensure complete restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. Other commenters thought that trustee officials generally should not consider inter-resource services. These commenters stated that requiring restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent inter-resource services would amount to requiring replication of the exact natural resource that was injured. These commenters expressed concern that there is currently no way of accurately quantifying inter-resource service levels. Some of these commenters suggested that inter-resource services be considered only when they have value to humans. Response: Section 11.71(e), which was not affected by this rulemaking, allows trustee officials to consider inter-resource services when quantifying an injury. Since restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is designed to correct an injury, trustee officials have the discretion to consider inter-resource services when determining the necessary level of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. As was noted in the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule: *␣*␣* The non-human services may be more important [than services used by humans] in measuring changes in how well a wildlife habitat or marsh is supporting wildlife, controlling floods, assimilating wastes, and providing any other services that may be important. 51 FR 27687. Moreover, as discussed above, prohibiting trustee officials from considering inter-resource services could violate the Ohio v. Interior holding concerning committed use. J. Selection of a Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition Alternative Comment: There were numerous comments on the factors for consideration during selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. Several commenters thought that the proposed rule would afford trustee officials the appropriate degree of discretion by providing factors for consideration but leaving the question of how to weigh those factors up to the trustee officials. A number of other commenters thought that the proposed rule would provide trustee officials with too much discretion over selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. These commenters supported the Department's proposal to require trustee officials to consider all of the listed factors. However, these commenters stated that simply requiring consideration of the factors was inadequate. These commenters stated that the Department should provide guidance on how trustee officials should consider and weigh the factors in order to prevent abuses of discretion. A few commenters objected to the Department's statement that development of a post-award Restoration Plan would curb potential abuses of discretion by a trustee official in selecting a pre-award restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative to serve as the basis of the trustee official's claim. Response: Section 11.82(d) lists factors for trustee officials to consider when choosing a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. The language of the proposed rule has been revised to require trustee officials to consider all of the listed factors. However, in light of the wide range of possible natural resource damage cases, the Department believes that trustee officials must have flexibility when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. Therefore, the rule does not mandate how trustee officials should weigh the listed factors. The rule provides a number of protections against potential abuses of discretion by trustee officials. Trustee officials are required to document their rationale for selecting a particular alternative. This documentation is included both in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, which is subject to public review and comment, and in the Report of Assessment, which is reviewable in court. Finally, the rule provides that the Restoration Plan, which describes how the damages that are actually collected will be spent, is to be based on the alternatives selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. Although the Restoration Plan is developed after damages have been recovered, the Restoration Plan is subject to public review and comment. Therefore, trustee officials who propose restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives that differ from those used as a basis for damages will have to explain the reasons for the difference. Comment: Some commenters thought that trustee officials should be required to choose restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives that are technically feasible.
