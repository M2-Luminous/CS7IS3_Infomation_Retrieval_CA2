The group comprises missile command ship "Zhuhai", another missile command ship "Huainan" and rescuer "Changxingdao". At the approach to Vladivostok, the Chinese ships were met by three Pacific Fleet ships -- the big anti-submarine ship "Admiral Vinogradov", the big anti-submarine ship "Petropavlovsk" and cruiser "Bystry". A guard of honour was mustered on the pier. Pacific Fleet Acting Commander Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov and Chinese Vice Admiral Wan Jin exchanged greetings and the two national anthems were played. Both sides expressed the hope that friendly ties between Russian and Chinese seamen will strengthen and develop and cooperation in the military field will continue thanks to mutual familiarisation with each other's achievements in military theory and technology, organisation of command of naval forces and means. The Chinese sailors are touring the city's landmarks and memorial places. They will leave Vladivostok on May 20.
