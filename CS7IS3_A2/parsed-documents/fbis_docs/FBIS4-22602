Grachev, editor of the social policy and letters department: "Sociologists Maintain That Our Main Concern Is Crime"] [Text] Today, with the help of the Ecro Company, we will tell what St. Petersburg residents think of the work of the bodies of executive authority--the Russian Government and the St. Petersburg mayoralty. The figures (all are given as percents) tell us that we are becoming increasingly critical of the institutes of authority in general and executive authority in particular. In this respect, it would be instructive to compare the results of previous sociological surveys published in SANKT PETERSBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI with the results tabulated by the Ecro Company. Well, while in February 1993 only 38 percent of city residents did not believe that the authorities would be able to pull the country out of the crisis, in August 1993 this figure had already increased to 43 percent. Today, however, to the question "Do you believe that the existing executive authority in Russia is capable of pulling the country out of the crisis?" only 17 percent answered affirmatively, while 63 percent answered unequivocally negatively. Our compatriots are somewhat more charitable of the mayoralty actions. "Negative" was the reply of 35 percent and "somewhat negative"--of 19 percent. There are, however, also fewer unequivocally positive replies--6 percent. What does it all tell us? First and foremost, that the negative trends that manifest themselves sharply around the country, most often are contained in our city, thereby ensuring a relative social stability. At the same time, another research recently commissioned by the newspaper points at those spheres of the city life which increasingly often cause our dissatisfaction today and by which the people judge the mayoralty's work. The wording of the question was: "What are the problems the city authorities should pay the greatest attention to?" The response shows that the problem of combating crime by far leads the list--78 percent. The second is social security--43.5 percent, and the third, health care--43.3 percent; they are followed by transportation problems--31.7 percent, unemployment--26.5 percent, availability of housing--26 percent, supply of goods--25.3 percent, and education--18.4 percent. (Each respondent could select no more than three problems that are most important for him. Therefore the total exceeds 100 percent.) It is quite obvious that confidence in local authorities is determined to a great extent by how well it takes into account concerns and wishes of ordinary city residents. And they name first, let us repeat, suppression of crime and personal safety, social security, and operation of health care facilities and transportation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |What Is Your Appraisal of the Mayoralty's Work?
