A police source who declined to be identified has revealed the alleged guerrillas informed SAN personnel "if they continue to overfly those areas where they had their narcotics plantations, they would execute artillery attacks against their aircraft." The insurgents threatened to down every helicopter that overflew the region and gave a 48-hour deadline to cease those incursions. "The Colombian Army in the area where crops are located is warned, and so their lives would be endangered." During the past weeks, several SAN airplanes carrying filming equipment and Panamanian policemen have overflown the inhospitable jungle of Darien Province, where they have detected coca and poppy plantations extending over an immense number of hectares. Once the report about the alleged guerrillas was confirmed, Panamanian policemen made a new incursion with the aid of the U.S. Army, the result of which is unknown. It seems in the next few hours the air operations will be intensified in those regions to reach the sites where the rebel groups and drug traffickers are guarding the plantations. Until now and unofficially speaking, it is believed the guerrillas belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which protects the drug traffickers' million-dollar plantations for hefty sums of money. A report indicated that after announcing their intentions the FARC rebels may stage an attack against Panamanian aircraft, because the report stated the rebels are protected with sophisticated weapons of war. In February 1993 a contingent of Panamanian policemen, with the backing of the U.S. Army and DEA officials, destroyed coca and marijuana plantations on 90 hectares located in the remote Darien Jungle on the border with Colombia. The operation, called "Frontera Libre," was conducted to rescue three U.S. "New Tribe" missionaries whom the rebels had kidnapped. Several drug traffickers and undocumented aliens were arrested during that operation. According to preliminary reports by the Panamanian police, the new poppy and coca plantations are scattered in strategic jungle areas between Darien and Colombia, making access to them difficult. Opium is the plant from which heroin is extracted. It is one of the world's deadliest drugs and to date has killed thousands of people in the different countries where it is consumed.
