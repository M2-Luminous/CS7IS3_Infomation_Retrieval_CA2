FR940405-1-00094 FR940405-1-00013 OSHA classified employees according to whether or not they work primarily in indoor areas, e.g., areas with possible exposures, by developing percentages of employees in each occupational category who might be working indoors. For example, personnel in the transportation industries were apportioned according to those potentially exposed to indoor air pollution (office workers) and those who are not (truck drivers). Table VI&hyph;3 presents the distribution of the 70.7 million employees who work indoors. No data are available as to the number of employees exposed to poor indoor air quality. Based on OSHA's percentage of problem buildings (30 percent), OSHA assumed that 30 percent of employees working indoors are exposed to poor indoor air quality. Therefore, the number of employees potentially affected is 21 million. 8. Environmental Tobacco Smoke Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) represents one of the strongest sources of indoor air contaminants in buildings where smoking is permitted. ETS is a mixture of irritating gases and carcinogenic tar particles and is considered one of the most widespread and harmful indoor air pollutants. (a) Smoking ordinances 8 and policies. State and Local Governments have adopted an increasing number of ordinances and regulations limiting smoking in public and private worksites. The restrictiveness of these laws varies from simple, limited prohibitions to laws that ban smoking. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia restrict smoking in public workplaces and 19 states and the District of Columbia restrict smoking in private workplaces. 8 A smoking ordinance may mean any local law which addresses public smoking in some fashion to protect non-smokers. There are 397 city and county smoking ordinances covering 22 percent of the total population [Ex. 4&hyph;305]. A total of 297 cities and counties mandate the adoption of workplace smoking policies. Typically these provisions require employers (private and public) to maintain a written smoking policy. Ordinances range from requirements for written smoking policies to the total elimination of smoking in the workplace. A total of 505 cities and counties limit smoking, specifically in restaurants. The requirements range from a nonsmoking section of unspecified size to the banning of all smoking [Ex. 4&hyph;305]. A 1991 survey of company smoking policies shows that of the 85 percent of firms with smoking policies, 34 percent have complete bans and another 34 percent prohibit smoking in all open work areas. Over 90 percent of non-manufacturing establishments have smoking policies [H&hyph;030 Ex. 77]. Workplace smoking policies are more common in larger businesses. In a survey of personnel managers, 63 percent of those with 1,000 or more employees reported having a smoking policy compared with 52 percent of companies with fewer employees. In the same survey, smaller companies were half as likely as larger ones to have a policy under consideration. Similar findings were reported by the National Survey of Worksite Health Promotion Activities, in which larger worksites were more likely than smaller ones to report smoking control activities. In a survey of private New York city businesses, only 4 percent of companies with fewer than 100 employees had a written smoking policy [Ex. 3&hyph;1030Q]. (b) Number of nonsmokers working indoors. Based on the National Health Interview Survey, OSHA estimated that 74.2 million employees or 73.01 percent of the U.S. labor force covered by OSHA are nonsmokers. Table VI&hyph;4 presents the distribution of nonsmoking employees by two digit SIC. Results of population based surveys show that 88 percent of nonsmokers are aware of the negative health consequences of ETS. Despite this general awareness, exposure to ETS is pervasive [Ex. 4&hyph;98]. To determine the occupational exposure of nonsmoking employees to ETS, OSHA used the estimate provided by the 1991 National Health Interview Survey. The survey, requested information from employed individuals on whether during the past two weeks anyone smoked in their immediate work area. Based on results adjusted for non-response and weighted to reflect national estimates, 18.81 percent reported exposure to ETS. OSHA believes that the 18.8 percent is an underestimate since it is based solely on self reported information and the question was not very specific in defining ``immediate'' work area. A recent reanalysis of a study by Cummings et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;68] shows that 48.67 percent of currently employed nonsmokers reported ETS exposure at work and not at home [Ex. 3&hyph;442F].
