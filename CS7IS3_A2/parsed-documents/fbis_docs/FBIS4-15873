It will come out in Russia and have more than 400 pages with the text and 90 pages with illustrations. The book consists of 10 chapters: "A Normal Country. Russia in May to December 1990." "Independence. January 1991." "The Collapse of the Empire. September to December 1991." "After the Putsch." "Russia and the World. January to August 1992." "The Shock Therapy. September 1992 to March 1993." "Run of Bad Luck. April to July 1993." "The Dramatic Summer. August and September 1993." "The Dramatic Autumn." "Premature Results." The final chapters, which contain Yeltsin's story about how the plan for the neutralization of the White House was conceived and developed, are particularly interesting today. The author writes that Russian fascists idolizing Hitler and his idea, fought their first battle near the walls of the White House. "The White House sent out signals which were pushing people to the most horrible things: arsons, murder and plunder. Here in the White House, a Russian rebellion - senseless and merciless - was provoked, prepared and meticulously planned under the cover of the lofty title 'political opposition'." "No one was forcing officer Rutskoy, or Professor Khasbulatov, who consider themselves politicians with high moral principles, to use the neo-fascists' services," writes Yeltsin. The author also gives a detailed account of the conference in Staroye Ogaryovo (a village in a Moscow suburb) on September 12, 1993, during which Yeltsin informed his power ministers Grachev, Kozyrev, Golushko and Yerin of the draft decree on the dismissal of the congress and parliament, and on early parliamentary elections. The draft decree was approved, while Kozyrev remarked that such a decree should have appeared a long time ago. The foreign minister was sharply aware of the dangers posed by the parliament, of Russia's falling prestige and of growing mistrust in the world, writes Yeltsin. He also says that Viktor Chernomyrdin resolutely put his signature under the decree, already signed by the four ministers. The book also gives details of the conference on the eve of October 4, when Yeltsin instructed Pavel Grachev to run the military operation against the rebels.
