This helps to establish a closer relation among our peoples and I believe that the effort to hold the symposium in the municipality where tourism is actually carried out is an important thing. In this, we have a lot to learn and we have already begun. We believe that an event such as this helps us and our comrades to understand the importance of the development of municipal tourism so we can learn from the things done in these countries. [Garrido] This is the fourth symposium. What do you think have been the main results of the past three and what are the expectations for this meeting? [Cienfuegos] The main achievement is making sure this type of event continues to be held. I believe that is the most important thing. We must make sure the symposium is permanent. [Garrido] Are there expectations on the self-sufficiency of the tourism activities at the base level? Undoubtedly, this also has another purpose. What is your opinion on this? [Cienfuegos] If we do not achieve self-sufficiency at the base level, then it is not a base activity. [Garrido] We have heard that the goal is 1 million tourists for 1995. [Cienfuegos] There has been talk about 1 million tourists in 1995 and of 1 billion [currency not specified] in income. The goal of 1 million tourists in 1995 will not be met. We will reach the goal of 1 billion, however, which is probably the most important thing. We will reach 1 billion in 1995. [Garrido] Where would you place tourism regarding its importance in the Cuban economy? [Cienfuegos] Tourism is one of the main sources of income. That has been said before. Comrade Fidel himself said, during the meeting in Varadero, that tourism is destined to be the main source of income for Cuba. This year, it is likely to be the main source of income as a consequence of the small sugar harvest we had. [Garrido] Thank you very much. [end recording]
