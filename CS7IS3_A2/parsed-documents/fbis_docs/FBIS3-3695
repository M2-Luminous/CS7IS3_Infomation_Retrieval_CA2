Some of these deputies come from top levels of the autonomous region while others are from the basic levels; some are of serf origin and some are living Buddhas from the monasteries. They used facts to explain that the Tibetans are living in peace and tranquility and genuinely enjoy human rights and to refute the lies spread by certain "guardians of human rights" on Tibet's human rights. More than 40 years ago Tibet was like a state in the extremely backward Middle Ages and one of the regions in the world where human rights violation were very serious. Following the democratic reform and abolition of the extremely decadent and dark feudal serf system, the millions of serfs and slaves stood up. They were no longer the property of the serf owners who could be traded, transferred, exchanged, and used as payment of debt or who were subjected to the savage actions of eye gouging and cutting off of tongues, hands, and legs. Since then, they have enjoyed basic human rights and have become masters of their own affairs. Earthshaking changes have taken place in Tibet after more than 40 years of construction. The situation in Tibet is now characterized by political stability, economic development, social progress, national concord, and peace and tranquility. After giving an account of Tibet's rapid development in recent years, Re Di, who is responsible for the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, said: "With a brand new outlook, Tibet now stands firm on the roof of the world." Who says that human rights are being encroached upon in Tibet? These facts precisely prove that the Chinese Government most respects human rights in Tibet and that the Tibetan people have gained human rights to the greatest extent. This forms a sharp contrast to racial discrimination which still prevails in the United States today. It is the principle of the UN Charter to enhance and encourage respect for human rights and basic freedom of the whole of mankind, irrespective of race, sex, language, or religion. The United States, which talks volubly about human rights, should have observed this principle. For a long time, however, the laws in some southern states in the United States still regard certain racial discrimination systems as legal, such as schools which separate whites from other races, laws which oppose marriages between white and black, and different public utilities for whites and blacks. This makes it easy to understand why the United States has still not ratified implementation of the "Convention on Preventing and Punishing Genocide," "International Convention on Banning and Punishing the Crime of Apartheid," "International Convention on Abolishing All Forms of Racial Discrimination," and other international human rights treaties. There is no doubt that the people in Tibet have gained a wide range of unprecedented human rights. However, there are some people in the world who say that human rights are being violated in Tibet. These people apply the human rights concept of the West to view the reality in Tibet or they simply use concocted or seriously distorted facts to substitute Tibet's reality and befuddle world opinion. Last May, a Western organization spread the news that Tibet had arrested more than 100 Tibetans. The report was a pure fabrication. In fact, only three persons were tried at that time, of which one was immediately released and the other two had directly undermined state security. At the 50th meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee held in February this year, a representative of a nongovernmental organization went so far as to present a piece of news, which he himself did not verify, to attack the human rights situation in Tibet. The so-called list presented by Christopher of 105 "peaceful dissidents" jailed in Tibet was also fabricated. Re Di told reporters: According to an investigation, many people on the list do not even exist. Some of them are living in their own homes. We do not know where the list came from. What would be the reaction of Christopher to such an explanation? The Tibetans, who have personally experienced historic changes since Tibet's liberation over the past decades, rather than the people in the West, who are far away from the region and are ignorant of Tibet, are most qualified to speak on human rights in Tibet. Some of the 15 Tibetan deputies, who gave an account of Tibet's human rights to Chinese and foreign reporters a few days ago, were slaves in the past. They all had records of their human rights being trampled upon before the democratic reform and the wide range of human rights enjoyed after the democratic reform. Their appraisal of Tibet's human rights is genuine and fair. When a reporter asked about Tibet's human rights, Ruo Sang, director of a Lhasa neighborhood, said: I am most qualified to answer the question. We were slaves in the past without any human rights. Today, we have become masters and genuinely enjoy human rights. Even figures from abroad have acknowledged the development and progress in the region after their trips to Tibet. Those who were prejudiced toward Tibet in the past have also stated that it is unfair to view Tibet based on one-sided statements. Here, we would like to ask: Why are certain Western countries and organizations always trying to attack human rights in Tibet, regardless of the facts? Why have they thrown mud at the Tibetans, who have freed themselves from suffering and who have become masters of their own affairs, rather than condemning the darkness, brutality, and cruelty of the serf owners who deprived the Tibetans of their human rights? Why have they paid special attention to a handful of splittists while ignoring the efforts made by the Tibetans to boost construction and develop the economy? There is only one answer to these questions: They are making use of human rights in an attempt to support "Tibetan independence," stirred up by a tiny handful of splittists, and disrupt China's reunification. As stated by the Tibetan deputies, such a conspiracy will be resolutely opposed by the people of the whole country, including the Tibetans.
