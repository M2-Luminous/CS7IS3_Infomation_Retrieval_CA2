Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska, who met with the Russian diplomat, regards this step by Russia as a political ploy and maintains that such stance of the neighboring state is completely unacceptable to Lithuania, as it is contrary to the agreement between the governments of Lithuania and Russia and to the international archival principle that archives must be kept where they are compiled. According to Albinas Januska, Lithuania reserves the right to raise the issue of the return of the archives in negotiations with Russia.
