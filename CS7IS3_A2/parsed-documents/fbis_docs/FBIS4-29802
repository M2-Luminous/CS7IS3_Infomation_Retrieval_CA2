The people do not want any other people to become prime minister or deputy prime minister. Those people will be able to do so only after they stage a successful coup. The people are confident that only these two prime ministers are able to prevent the return of the genocidal regime because they know the true nature of the Khmer Rouge much better than the Khmer Rouge themselves. As for His Majesty the King, we would like him to abide by the nation's Constitution because deviating from it will only bring trouble. The Constitution does not allow Your Majesty to hold power. So, please just sit still. As king, you should not waver. KAOH SANTEPHEAP is still unconditionally sincere to the King and the Royal Government. But please stop negotiating with the Khmer Rouge. They are vanishing, are they not?
