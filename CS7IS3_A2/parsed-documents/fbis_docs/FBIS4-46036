Two variants for the utilization of liquid radioactive waste are being developed, and the final variant will be chosen in mid-May. Japan undertakes its financing. I met this week with Stanislav Nikolayevich Pechugin, chief engineer of the Murmansk repair and technological enterprise of the nuclear fleet, who was on a business trip in our city. This is the talk that we had: [begin recording] Pechugin: A convention forbidding the dumping of ZHRO into seas and oceans began to be implemented in 1986-87. According to this convention, the ice breaking nuclear fleet must stop its activity completely, or somehow find a solution for purifying liquid radioactive waste. There are technical service vessels in the fleet, among them tankers, where the ZHRO is accumulated. But it cannot be accumulated indefinitely, and the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Company decided -- our enterprise was a part of the steamship company at that time -- to deal with this problem itself. In other words, the problem was being solved at the state level. Money for planning and building a special water purification system at our enterprise was allocated. However, we were still at the planning stage at the time, and the end of construction was still far away. Our enterprise and the Murmansk Steamship Company invited three Moscow scientific research institutes to solve the problem. The problem cannot be called a new one because nuclear power stations have been working for a long time, and they were solving the problem of purifying their ZHRO. However, they have their own specific problems. There was still no solution to the question of processing the ZHRO of transportation nuclear reactors. Our enterprise has created an experimental industrial facility for purifying liquid radioactive waste. At present, this is a facility of small capacity of about 1,500 cubic meters a year. It needs further development. We have been purifying liquid nuclear waste produced at ice breakers and at our facility since 1988, and today neither the steamship company nor our facility has any liquid waste, and that being produced is immediately purified. Therefore, the accumulated waste in the tankers of the nuclear technological fleet has all been processed. Today, we need certain means to complete our facility. However, all our efforts were directed at purifying radionuclides, and problems of pure chemistry and the tail process, that is, of solidifying of the still residue [kubovyy ostatok] were not solved. Today, it is possible to complete it, but lack of funds prevents us from doing so. A conference initiated by heads of the Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Oblast administrations was held in February in Arkhangelsk. All specialists of transportation nuclear facilities were invited, and Nuclear Energy Minister Mikhaylov was present. Among other things, solutions for the ZHRO problem was discussed. A decision has been adopted that after the appropriate expertise and presentation of substantiations, the problem of northern basin ZHRO would be solved at our facility. In other words, we will become the main organization for purifying ZHRO of both the civil nuclear fleet and the Navy, and also of defense [word indistinct] enterprises. Kuvardin: Stanislav Nikolayevich, do Zvezda plant specialists know of your enterprise? Pechugin: I will not speak for them, but the general designer of the [word indistinct] knows it very well, since they designed some of our facilities. Kuvardin: Given time, they could adopt some of your experience. Pechugin: Yes, probably. I talked to the Zvezda plant KIP [monitoring and testing center] on the telephone before leaving for Vladivostok, and they asked me to accept their specialists to study our facility. We did not refuse, but these things are still not done free of charge today. I think that we will reach an agreement.
