I head straight for an unremarkable -- especially against the backdrop of a white-stone bank office -- small building. The door opens. They gaze at me suspiciously and, passing through another metal-bar door, I am escorted to the basement -- the headquarters of the Ukrainian National Assemble [UNA] and the Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNSO]. A tiny room. An ashtray with cigarette stubs stands on a table. A portrait of Stepan Bandera [leader of the Organizations of Ukrainian Nationalists during World War II], maps of Kiev and Abkhasia, and a picture of Hemingway toting a machine gun hang on the wall (the motto reads: "Hemingway would definitely be sentenced to 12 years in prison if he was a Ukrainian citizen, for participating in the Spanish Civil War") Somebody looks at me suspiciously, somebody is intimidated, the majority do not care at all. UNSO leader Dmytro Korchynskyy gives me a sign, and I turn on my tape recorder: [Markovskyy] The unforgettable Oscar Wilde used to say that although people do not like it when somebody speaks about them too much, they like it even less when somebody does not speak about them at all. Mr. Dmytro, although I am not sure about your influence, you are a well-known force in Ukraine's political arena. Nevertheless, I would like to hear directly from you: Who are you? [Korchynskyy] The UNSO was established on 19 August 1991 to sabotage a coup attempt in our country. At that time, the UNA initiated the first UNSO units that were already conducting appropriate work and training. Since then, the organization has been reinforced and has gained some combat experience. This is the only organization in Ukraine that has administrative, political, and military experience obtained under the conditions of destabilization and serious social conflicts. Participation in two wars, dozens of strikes, work in the Army, establishment of a servicemen's union, and social protection of workers are the results of our activities.... All the other so-called political parties deal with some shady business. [Markovskyy] Your are often deemed ultra-radicals, or just plain ultras. Moreover, your activities are basically illegal. What is your opinion on such attitudes expressed toward your organization, and what is UNSO's place in Ukraine's political arena? [Korchynskyy] Voltaire once noted that an adequate reaction to reality and telling the truth is always considered by society as extremism. The most extremist aspect of our activities is that we call things by their names and react adequately. A healthy reaction in unhealthy society is considered extremism. The UNSO reacts to current events. At the beginning we defend, and later we try to figure out what we have defended. There is solidarity among us. Our organization unites people who are convinced that the outmost houses burn first, and people who are nonconformists, tired of waiting for someone to spit in their face in their own country. They strike in response. I believe that this is quite normal. [Markovskyy] How many members does the UNSO have? [Korchynskyy] Not many. There are only several thousand people. However, we have the best capabilities to mobilize our members among all parties. All Ukrainian parties have relatively few members, but when there is a need, when a certain number of people is needed at a certain place, the UNSO is the best. [Markovskyy] We have seen everything in Ukraine, except for... war, and God forbid this happens. Many people link your organization with the avenging sword, military uniforms, and combat.... Are you a ceaselessly fighting force? War is not enough for you? [Korchynskyy] The point is that all of East Europe has ended up in a situation of instability and regional conflicts, whether we like it or not. These conflicts surround Ukraine, and unfortunately, government activities may lead to a situation when such conflicts erupt here as well. To prevent this from occurring, an extremely active policy is needed. For example, in case conflict erupts in the Crimea, the same military units that were sent to Abkhazia will be deployed there -- units of Russia's North Caucasian Military District and Black Sea Fleet (the latter was pretty active in Abkhazia, where its shells destroyed half of Sukhumi). These are the same mercenaries who will be deployed against the Crimea from bases which Moscow fought for in Georgia. If we want to have a smaller front in the Crimea in the future, we have to create a bigger front in Caucasus to entangle certain forces in combat. This should become the responsibility of the Ukrainian state, since Georgia and Azerbaijan are in the sphere of Ukraine's geopolitical interests -- our national interests. The government, however, does not understand this, and it even brought disgrace upon itself allowing marines, who pledged allegiance to Ukraine, to fight on the side of our potential enemies, despite Kiev's official line. Do you understand this? It was done at Ukraine's expense, with Ukrainian fuel and ships. Let us look at another axis -- Romania -- Moldova -- Cisdnestr -- Ukraine -- Transcarpathia -- Hungary. Apparently, Hungary should be our ally, since it has serious problems with Romanians. We also have serious and urgent problems with Romanians in Bukovyna and Bessarabia. Hungary, however, seeing the sluggishness and passiveness of Ukraine, began very active work aimed at Transcarpathia's secession a few years ago. The so-called Ruthenian movement is financed by Hungary, and the Ruthenian leaders are of Hungarian origin. In the current situation, Ukraine must conduct an active policy, it must. [Markovskyy] What is your combat experience? Where have you fought, and what were the results of this? Why did you do that? [Korchynskyy] Officially, we have participated in two military conflicts: in Cisdnestr and Abkhazia. The decision to take part in the first conflict was obvious to us, since Cisdnestr is an ethnically Ukrainian land inhabited primarily by Ukrainians. Additionally, we know that rapprochement between Moldova and Romania is under way. It is also known that the Ukrainian ethnic minority has always been discriminated against in Romania. If Moldova unites with Romania, we can expect a similar attitude toward the Ukrainians living in Cisdnestr. We should be aware that Ukraine cannot be indifferent toward Cisdnestr. The more so, since as long as Moldova has problems with Cisdnestr, we will not have problems with Bukovyna and Bessarabia. We believe that the concept of "a war in our own backyard," which Ukrainians have been endorsing for more than 300 years, is erroneous. It is too late to fight when the enemy is already in your backyard. One must wage a war on foreign soil. However, the point was not a war. Ukraine had to show a human attitude toward the Ukrainians from Cisdnestr. It was much harder for us to make the decision on participating in the Abkhazian conflict. The point was that Russians fought on the other side in Abkhazia -- both regular units and volunteers. We endorse the idea of Slavic unity, and we do not like to shoot at Slavs. But when the situation in the Crimea had sharply deteriorated -- as a result of the Russian Supreme Soviet resolution on the status of Sevastopol -- we decided to set up a front in Caucasus. Unfortunately, we did not manage to establish an efficiently strong military force there. Our troops, however, were the best among the Georgian Army units, and they distinguished themselves in many operations. For the heroism demonstrated in combat, 30 UNSO troopers were awarded the highest military order of Georgia. [Markovskyy] How many casualties did you suffer in those conflicts? [Korchynskyy] Despite the fact that it was a very intensive conflict, there were no casualties in Cisdnestr on our side. We only had a few wounded. In Abkhazia, unfortunately, seven of our comrades were killed, and more than 20 wounded. I am deeply convinced that if there had not been these victims, we would have had even more casualties here, in Ukraine. Pacifism have elicited much more misery in our history than militarism. [Markovskyy] How does the UNSO obtain their weapons? [Korchynskyy] We are given weapons in conflict zones by governments of countries in which we fight. [Markovskyy] What about Ukraine? [Korchynskyy] We do not need weapons here. [Markovskyy] Then, what, in your opinion, has provoked the authorities' recent actions against you? [Korchynskyy] There has been a trend of merging the UNA-UNSO with strike committees, free trade unions, and social protection organizations. The authorities are afraid that an organized, solidified force is emerging in Ukraine, which can act as an alternative to them, restore order, and assume responsibility for the state and reforms. The recent change in the 187th article of the Criminal Code was aimed against us. It is interesting that this article had previously provided for accountability for anti-Soviet activities. Currently, it provides for accountability for establishing paramilitary units. The right to join any organization is a man's birthright. According to this law, it is a crime to simply establish an organization. Later, sport clubs and scouting camps can be considered "paramilitary," since they also involve discipline, training, uniforms -- all that relates to paramilitary units, according to the law. Weapons? The law does not mention weapons, and one does not have to possess them to be sentenced. Although not a single gun was found during the latest arrests, seven our people are serving time in Kiev. [Markovskyy] What exactly happened on Bold Hill in Kiev? [Korchynskyy] A documentary movie about the UNSO is currently being filmed. At the director's request, our people demonstrated their military drills. They were arrested while these scenes were being filmed. The director was also arrested, and the film was presented as "material evidence." [Markovskyy] The UNSO was established in 1991. Over these past few years, you have been doing what you have wanted. Why have they cracked down on you right now? [Korchynskyy] Primarily, because our organization is getting stronger. Whereas we have not been taken seriously before, now, the regime considers us its main enemy. Second, the regime has had certain illusions about using us in its battle against trade unions and strikers. Do not forget that this regime is young -- before 1991, they were nothing more than snitches. The regime has grown stronger and richer. Every day brings them tens of millions of dollars -- they have enough money to both waste and fight for. [Markovskyy] I have heard that the UNSO was established by the authorities as sort of scarecrow: Look, this is the monster of Ukrainian nationalism. Take a look and be scared. The fact that this monster exists allows the Security Service to tightly control national-democratic forces in Ukraine. [Korchynskyy] One must follow current events. Those who have recently been doing that should notice that our activities are dangerous and uncomfortable for the authorities, including the Ukrainian Security Service. As of today, more than 20 of our comrades are imprisoned as a result of numerous fabrications. Many of them have experienced prisons and mortar fire.... People do not do such things for money. As for the threat to national-democratic forces... Honestly, I am surprised. The country is in a situation that is worse than occupation, the idea of statehood has been compromised, everything that could be robbed and sold has been robbed and sold, and Ukrainian patriots, state leaders, and democrats do not feel right. They drive fancy cars, work in luxury offices, and wear expensive suits.... This resembles a deadly fight with a lunch break, or, as if they fight against communism only twice a week. Apparently, this fight is very comfortable for them.... Our activities pose a threat only to the regime and ourselves. Those who are in between, are only a bluff, facade. Their existence is more convenient for the authorities, and I will explain to you why that is the case. There are basically several hundreds officials who form the regime, and who owe the main part of the capital that is being taken away from Ukraine. The rest is composed of small politicians and businessmen who get the leftovers. The average television viewer, however, blames not the regime but those people he sees on television. He watches Supreme Council debates, certain political parties.... All parties and political leaders try to create an impression that they can influence certain processes. It is very convenient for the authorities that, between them and viewers, there are certain "crawling" political parties which pretend that they mean something. They are the first ones to scream: "The democrats have ruined the country." [Markovskyy] Do you intend to interfere in the developments in the Crimea? [Korchynskyy] Of course. We have enough power to destroy all separatists. We, however, cannot act now, because the first steps are to be taken on the streets of Bankivska and Hrushevskoho. They will stab us in the back in Kiev, to prevent us from acting in the Crimea.
