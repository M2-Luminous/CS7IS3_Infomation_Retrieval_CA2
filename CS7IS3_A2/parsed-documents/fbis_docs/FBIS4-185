Serious incidents in the second constituency of Haho and the first constituency of Wawa led to these annulments. A few days ago, the Supreme Court invalidated the election during the first round, of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] deputy in the first constituency of Oti because Bemba Bahissa's alternate had not satisfied the conditions concerning residence on the territory during the elections. Following these annulments, the opposition still retains the majority with 40 seats -- 34 for the CAR and 6 for the UTD as against 37 for the RPT-Union for Justice and Democracy and one for the Confederation of New Forces.
