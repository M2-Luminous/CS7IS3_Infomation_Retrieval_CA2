Today will mark the opening of the seventh session of the 45th legislature. After more than three months of vacation, extended by the chronic absenteeism of some parliamentarians, there is more suspense and doubt about whether today's session will succeed. The stakes are considerable because the session, which should be held today, 10 January, is aimed at meeting a constitutional requirement, according to the latest statements by National Assembly President Firmin Jean-Louis. However, since September 1991 the unforeseeable has become the rule of the game; everything, including the concerns of the 18 January 1993 parliamentarians, has become a series of situations outside the 1987 Constitution. During a news conference held on 7 January, Senator Firmin Jean-Louis asked those who were elected on 18 January 1993 not to execute their threats to return to Parliament. He added that the return of the 18 January representatives will have a lot of incalculable consequences on the good functioning of the parliamentary institution. Contacted by our station, Sen. Dejean Belizaire, leader of the controversial parliamentarians, said that he maintains his stand. He told Signal Radio that all the 18 January parliamentarians would participate in the reopening of the parliamentary work that will take place today. [passage omitted] Sen. Belizaire concluded that the Parliament has never been more abnormal than during the time when the 18 January parliamentarians decided to temporarily stand aloof. [passage omitted]
