"If they (the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army) do not stop the offensive, I will order a counteroffensive and they will not be able to obtain the territories they could obtain through political negotiations," Karadzic said. He added: "There is no way they can get the territories where they are now killing our people." Karadzic believes the international community will soon exert more pressure to stop the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.
