Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), also told a regular news conference that Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno informed a morning meeting of economic ministers the economy is in a "delicate" phase, with recovery prospects still vulnerable. Noting that her agency's new monthly report cited some areas of "brightness" in the still "broadly sluggish" economy, Kubota cited such factors as improving corporate sentiment and consumption, with strong housing investment and higher purchases of durable goods and small cars. "If there is not a big stumble, the economy is headed in a good direction," she said. She cited such possible pitfalls as slack public works implementation due to the current political turmoil. She quoted Mieno, who has also recently spoken of increasing bright signs in the economy, as citing such causes of uncertainty as domestic long- and short-term money market rates, as well as big changes in the U.S. stock and bond markets. Mieno said Japan's money supply growth remains weak as slack corporate demand for funding discourages banks from lending, according to Kubota. She said the central bank chief also noted recent movements in various market rates, saying that the yield on 10-year government bonds briefly rose above 4.2 percent on worries over the high yen and a drop in stock prices. But he noted the unsecured overnight call-money rate remains "extremely low," she said. He cited recent moves by the Japanese currency up to 102 to the dollar, back to around 105 and again to the 103 level, but the EPA chief said Mieno offered no comment on the moves. Reflecting these uncertainties, long-term market rates have been showing "unstable" movements, trying to settle at levels that reflect economic conditions, Kubota quoted Mieno as saying. For her own economic outlook, Kubota cited an improving global trend, with U.S. and European economies brightening this year and most of Asia remaining strong. She also said that if this year's Japanese tax cuts are implemented as smoothly as planned, they could give an extra boost to an economy struggling to rebound. But she expressed concern about continued worsening trends in employment, citing a record high 3.18 percent unemployment rate for women in Japan.
