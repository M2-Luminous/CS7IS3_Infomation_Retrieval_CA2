The Russian 201 Army Division has set up posts, which are being jointly manned with police bodies. A mobile radio station is broadcasting the Russian division command's appeal to residents of the city to voluntarily surrender illegal arms in their possession. Pamphlets carrying text of the appeal are being distributed in the capital. The patrols have sweeping powers, including carrying out search of all types of vehicles, checking documents in possession of the citizens and confiscating illegally kept arms. Areas, where Russian servicemen and members of their families live, are being kept under special guard. It became known today that an attempt was made to attack the car of the 201st Divison commander during the evening checking of the posts on 7 June. The attacker was disarmed as a result of daring decisive action taken by driver Private Salavat Galimov. The would-be assassin, identified as Nazar Khoitov, born in 1967, was handed over to police.
