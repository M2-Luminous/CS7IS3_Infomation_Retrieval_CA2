Can you brief us on the decision? [Isayas] The first phase of relieving combatants of their duties began last year. About 26,000 combatants have been relieved of their duties since it started. The government borrowed 1 billion birr from the National Bank to be able to implement the project. The second phase is under way, conducted by the Ministry of Defense. The project will lend money to the combatants to enable them to establish small-scale (?industries). Some of the combatants will be employed in government institutions. Those who stay in the Army started receiving their salaries as of 1 January 1994. A study is under way currently to establish the ceiling of their salaries. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] The fourth session of the National Assembly passed a resolution on the press laws of the country. What will be the basis for the press law? Will a press law be passed in this transitional period? What will be the role of the press law regarding the drafting of the constitution? [Isayas] First of all, the press law will be based on freedom of expression. This is not something new. Freedom of expression existed before and after independence. So, it does not mean there was no freedom of expression. But it is essential to establish laws and democratic institutions. The press law to be passed is not something new, but just official confirmation. This press law will be in line with the country's course and charter. [passage omitted] The passing of the press law has a role in the country's political affairs. Without it is impossible to have an open political [word indistinct]. The drafting of the constitution will have no meaning without a press law. Citizens benefiting from the press law can express their views freely in the drafting of the constitution in this transitional period. One of the most important issues which has to be given priority is the passing of the press law. Because of this, the fourth National Congress decided to give it priority.
