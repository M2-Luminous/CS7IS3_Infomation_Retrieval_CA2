The proposal has thus become an official state project, and work has begun to put it into practice. After all, the curtain has been formally raised for this great trans-century education endeavor. Seeing this, insightful people of all social sectors have unanimously expressed the earnest hope that, with this project, China's higher education will embark on a new course of development. [passage omitted] To build big-name universities up to the advanced world level by implementing "Project 211," we should, first and foremost, look into the standards and characteristics of the world's first-rate big-name universities, get acquainted with the basic practice of higher education in the world, and see how we are lagging behind it. The following is a comparison of some major aspects of our institutions with foreign universities, especially big-name foreign universities: 1. Funds for running institutions. All big-name universities in developed countries have ample operating funds. Even at the present time when a Western economic recession is in the offing, their operating funds are still way above ours. For instances, operating funds for all big-name universities in the United States are from $700 to $800 million a year. For such schools as Stanford and Berkeley, the amount even exceeds $1 billion. In Japan, the University of Tokyo has an annual budget of more than 100 billion yen. All these figures are exclusive of private contributions. And whether they are public or private universities, their education funds are, without exception, supplied mainly by government appropriations. In our country, the annual operating funds for the few big-name key universities are only about 100 to 200 million yuan of renminbi. As to key universities run by provinces, the operating funds are generally between 10 and 20 million yuan. Now, all provinces and municipalities have done their best to set aside funds for "Project 211," but when the money is distributed among numerous institutions, the amount that each one can get will be merely 20 to 30 million yuan a year. Of course, when comparing our operating funds with those of our peers in developed countries, we have to take account of the different price levels. On the other hand, however, we should also consider the fact that a sizable part of the operating funds for our universities are disbursed as salaries for the large number of "administrative personnel" who depend on salaries for their livelihood. Such disbursement may cut the already-scanty "operating funds" to one half. 2. Structure and scale. Most of the first-rate big-name universities in the world are "giant universities." They have a big structure with all kinds of specialty courses and are, in particular, strong in fundamental disciplines. In general, each university has over a dozen schools comprising 50-60 departments, and its full-time students may number tens of thousands or even more than 100,000. The ratio between undergraduate and graduate students is generally 1:1 or nearly so. In Harvard University, the ratio has even reached 1:1.5. Most of these universities have more than a dozen or even up to 100 well-equipped research institutes and laboratories plus "research libraries" with 6-7 million volumes of books (the Harvard libraries have as many as 11 million volumes). Compared with them, most of our institutions of higher education are smaller and less efficient. Only a few universities have more than 10,000 full-time students. In our big-name key universities, the ratio between undergraduate and graduate students is generally 4:1 or 5:1. Besides, most of the comprehensive universities which have undergone the 1952 campaign for adjustment of schools and departments are only comprehensive in name but not in reality, not to mention those specialty colleges, which concentrate on a single field of study. Though some reforms toward "comprehensiveness" have been carried out by certain universities in recent years, their newly established schools and departments can in no way match the old ones in quality. 3. Autonomy in running schools. In developed countries, whether it is France whose higher education is under relatively centralized management or countries like Britain and America where universities enjoy "unparalleled freedom in the world," institutions of higher education are generally given varying degrees of autonomy. This is a sacred and inviolable tradition of Western higher education formed over the past 1,000 years. Although the past few decades have seen an increasingly apparent trend toward the "nationalization" of higher education in these countries, the governments' role is to guide, rather than control, the universities' operations by means of fund appropriations or through other measures. In the university, the president, as the highest executive, possesses the supreme administrative power in reality as well as in name. In our country, under the influence of the decades-old planned economic system, institutions of higher education have, so far, been unable to gain the status as independent legal entities. Autonomy in running institutions is still very limited, and the administrative power of university presidents is not sufficiently protected. School affairs, big or small, are still based on the "red-head documents" [government documents with large characters printed in red for headings] issued by the higher authorities. Without the most rudimentary autonomy, how can our institutions operate successfully and play an outstanding role in education? 4. Administrative system. In Western developed countries, autonomy in operating institutions of higher education is associated with the tradition of "professors running the school." Organizations like professors' associations and advisory councils represent the will of teachers at large and stand for their rights and interests. According to the prevailing international concept, "in an institution of higher education experts and researchers are the kings," while the president and all administrative functional departments are merely spokesmen and executors for the teachers' will. In contrast with this, our institutions of higher education have a large administrative body, comparable in size to the faculty. It has numerous departments, employs a large number of personnel, and possesses enormous power, but its work efficiency is low--this is rarely seen elsewhere in the world. Such a huge administrative and logistic body not only takes up a large part of the scanty education funds, but sometimes infringes upon the faculty's rights and interests. In some schools, there has appeared the weird phenomenon that those who do not teach and engage in research work are controlling those who teach and engage in research work. Seeing this, some insightful people in the higher-education field have raised a cry of warning: Unless we drastically streamline these administrative departments, trim their personnel, develop automation of the administrative work, socialize the logistic service, and give the teachers the status as the masters of the institution, we will never be able to build a first-rate world-renowned university. 5. Faculty. According to UNESCO's statistics, the faculty-to-students ratio in institutions of higher education in foreign countries was 1:11.1 in the early 1950's, 1:1.8 [as published] in the early 1960's, and 1:13.5 in the 1970's. At present, the ratio is generally maintained at 1:15. Even in research-oriented universities such as Princeton, Stanford, Cornell, and Cambridge, the ratio is about 1:10. Moreover, the stringent screening and evaluation system and the effective arrangement for the flow of teachers have ensured the salient features of their faculty members such as having a sound academic background and being younger in age. Compared with them, the faculty-to-students ratio in our institutions, which is generally 1:5 or 1:6, is too low. If the large numbers of administrative and logistic personnel are counted as members of the "faculty," the ratio will be even much lower. What is more, the low faculty-to-students ratio is especially noticeable in old key university. Apart from this, there are a host of faculty-related problems, including overemphasis on seniority, aging of teachers, lack of sound academic backgrounds, appointment based on cronyism, and teachers working solely in one department. All these have affected, in varying degrees, the improvement of the faculty's overall quality. 6. Evaluation mechanism. In developed countries, with the development of higher-education research, a quality-evaluation system for institutions of higher education is becoming mature and gradually institutionalized. The United States is the most successful in this respect. It has six university accreditation associations. Any institution of higher education, if not accredited by the association, cannot be recognized as a qualified institution, even though it has been approved by the state government. In addition, there are some 150 organizations for evaluating the quality of institutions or the specialty courses offered by them. These organizations are responsible for conducting periodical evaluation of institutions of higher education. They also publish statements ranking the institutions on the basis of their evaluation. Within institutions, it is relatively common for teachers and students to evaluate each other's performance. This is why some people say that American universities are laden with evaluation within and without. It is due to this evaluation that American universities are maintained at their high level and encouraged to compete with one another for prestige. In recent years, China has begun to pay attention to evaluating its institutions of higher education. Evaluation procedures have been adopted by certain pertinent departments and put into practice in some universities on a trial basis. However, such work is still in the experimental stage, and neither the quality of the evaluation work nor the method applied is satisfactory. In most cases, the work done to appraise and compare the quality of institutions remains at the "experience and impression" level and is far from "scientific." Lacking a sound and strict means of evaluation, it is hard to raise and control the quality of our institutions. The operation of our institutions of higher education has lagged behind the advanced world standards for quality and efficiency. There are gaps in many areas, and some of the gaps are quite wide. The above-cited are just a few big gaps. There is still a long and hard way to go before we can narrow the gaps and bring some of our institutions to a higher level through the implementation of "Project 211." We should make an adequate assessment of the situation and be fully prepared for the work before us.
