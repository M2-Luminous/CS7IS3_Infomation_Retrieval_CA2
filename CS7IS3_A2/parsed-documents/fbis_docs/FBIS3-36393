"The commonality of the geographic location and economic problems necessitate the consolidation of efforts in the interests of the entire territory. The most pressing task is to revivify the timber, mining and fur industries and to combat the plunder of natural riches and their illicit export," Konyukhov said. According to Konyukhov, the new organisation will form an economic mini-community within this component part of the Russian Federation. It pursues no political aims. Work is under way on the charter and programme of the economic union which are expected to be approved by the second joint session of the heads of administrations. The organisation will be funded from the budget of the territory and its component parts.
