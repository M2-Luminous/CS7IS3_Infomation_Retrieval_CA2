Mr. Thaci informed the CSCE representatives of the grave situation of the Albanian schools in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. "In the 1981 there were 38 Albanian middle schools while now they have been reduced in 5. Only 2.8 percent of the Skopje University are Albanians while Albanians make up only 2.4 percent of the police workers. Among 250,000 titles of books at the Skopje Popular Library only 150 are in Albanian language," Mr. Thaci informed the CSCE representatives. "Even Albanians make up one third of the total population, they are considered in the Constitution as an insignificant minority," Mr. Thaci said adding that "though they were under discriminating laws they approved the statement for the independence of Macedonia and recognized both its existence and that of the Macedonian people."
