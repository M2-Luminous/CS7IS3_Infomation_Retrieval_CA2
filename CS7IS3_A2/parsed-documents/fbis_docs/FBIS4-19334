The secret lodge's venerable grand master Licio Gelli was sentenced to 17 years in prison for related crimes, while General Gianadelio Maletti, a former top official at the disbanded SID [Defense Intelligence Service] secret services, got 14 years. Both men were given five-year reductions on their terms. The court's verdict came after four days in camera, and after Gelli failed to turn up for a promised statement to the court. According to the prosecution, in the 1970s and early '80s, Gelli managed to build up control over a large section of the press, over one part of the magistrature, and over the intelligence services in their entirety. During those years, the prosecution told the court, P2 "was a criminal association aimed at committing many acts of espionage, and of violation of secrets pertaining to national security. An association aimed at changing the constitution by illicit means, and at disturbing the work and prerogatives of the government and parliament." Gelli's influence over the magistrature was said to have been exerted through large financial contributions to the conservative Magistratura Indipendente (Independent Magistrature) group. Through influence at the very top of the secret services he succeeded in installing himself more or less as the country's intelligence chief, the prosecution alleged. A hold over the press was achieved with the help of banker Roberto Calvi who bought a controlling stake in the Rizzoli publishing group which then began a campaign to buy up newspapers. "This hold over press sources," said the prosecution, "led to an immediate connection with political interests, and each of those papers was a point of reference for local political cells." [passage omitted] Today's sentence handed down on Gelli was for counts of perjury, possession of secret state documents, and sums paid to Milan magistrates investigating the collapse of Calvi's Banco Ambrosiano in 1982. Unlike the other 12 people in the dock, Gelli was not tried on conspiracy charges because authorities in Switzerland, from where he was extradited to stand trial in Italy, refused to hand him over for this charge. Other sentences handed out today varied from two years and six months to 13 years and six months. [Gelli's assistant] Umberto Ortolani was acquitted. "If ever there was an association whose aim was to condition (public life), that was the P2," commented Public Prosecutor Elisabetta Cesqui, pointing out that the sentence claims the secret lodge was "not an association to commit crime." Cesqui added that she would have to see the motivation of the sentence before making a final assessment, but judicial sources said she will almost certainly take the case to the appeals court. In her final address, the public prosecutor, who asked for 13 and a half years against Gelli, 10 against Ortolani and a total of 69 for the other 11 defendants, argued that the P2 served as an association to commit acts of espionage and the violation of official secrets of importance to national security with the aim of "modifying the Constitution by illegal means." Much the same conclusions were drawn by the parliamentary enquiry whose findings in 1982 led to the P2's banning in late 1982. "I am horrified," commented Left Democrat Party Secretary Achille Occhetto of the sentence. "Incredibly enough, years of serious work by the parliamentary committee of inquiry into the P2 of which I was a member have been cancelled. Faced by this small sentence, we fortunately have many volumes of documents at Parliament showing exactly the opposite." [passage omitted]
