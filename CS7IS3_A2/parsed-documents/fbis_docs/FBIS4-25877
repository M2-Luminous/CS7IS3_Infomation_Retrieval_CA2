A local delegation visiting Beijing has been repeatedly assured by senior Chinese leaders and officials that the time has come for cooperation. Linda Lee reports. [Lee] The message came from the Chinese vice premier and foreign minister today. Qian Qichen was receiving a delegation from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions at the Diaoyutai State Guest House. The tone of the Chinese vice premier was much milder than last year, when Beijing lashed out at Governor Chris Patten's political reform proposals. Qian was quoted as saying that the failure of the political talks last year is a thing of the past; now is the time to cooperate on economic issues. The Chinese vice premier also told the delegation that there has been good progress in recent defense land talks and negotiations on the new airport. Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Director Lu Ping revealed that the Sino-British Airport Committee will meet again sometime later this month, but he did not specify any dates. Lu hinted the gap between the two sides is narrowing.

A solution can be found to that issue, and there should not be any obstacles. The gap between the two sides is narrowing. We are striving to resolve the issue as early as possible. [Lee] On the pension scheme for civil servants, Lu told the federation that the $7 billion proposed by the Hong Kong Government is not sufficient. China will raise the issue at the next Joint Liaison Group meeting.
