Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, made the request during a 15-minute meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Tsutoma Hata in the Japanese Diet (parliament) building, a Chinese trade official said. The official quoted Wu as saying that yen loans had played a vital role in developing the Chinese economy and in boosting Japanese investment in China since 1979, when Japan began to implement its first package of loans to China. Hata, who met Wu last November in Seattle, said that Japan should try to develop long-term relations with China based on repentance for its wartime invasion of its neighbor, He mentioned former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remarks about the war that have been roundly condemned by Japan's Asian neighbors. Nagano resigned in early May after saying that the 1937 Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an aggressor during World War II. The prime minister also hailed the "rapid increase" in bilateral trade, the volume of which reached some 39 billion U.S. dollars last year, an increase of 54 percent over 1992. Wu, who arrived here on Tuesday [31 May], is on a week-long visit to Japan at the invitation of the minister of international trade and industry. She is also leading a ten-member delegation to the regular conference on investment between China and Japan.
