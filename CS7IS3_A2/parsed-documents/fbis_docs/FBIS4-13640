Meanwhile, some progress has been made by the Civilian Affairs Committee. Our colleague 'Umar Zaydani sums up the outcome of this round of talks: [Begin recording] [Zaydani] Another round of negotiations was concluded between Israeli and PLO representatives in Cairo this afternoon. This round of talks registered great progress on several topics listed on the agenda, according to Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the talks. The topics negotiated by the Civilian Affairs Committee have almost been settled. However, some issues, such as the Palestinians' demand to have an international telephone zone number, as well as issues pertaining to stamps and passports, are yet to be decided. They will be decided later, that is, after the agreement is signed. [Shahaq, in Hebrew, with superimposed translation into Arabic] There is also the issue pertaining to the economic talks currently under way in Paris. An agreement has to be reached in this regard. We have to know what is happening there in order to incorporate the economic agreement into the overall agreement. There are hurdles facing the Security Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee, although some progress has been made. Some points on which agreement has been reached have been initialed. With respect to the issues that are still under consideration, they concern setting a timetable for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The outstanding issues within these committees will be discussed early next week. If things continue to proceed as they are doing right now, that is, if progress continues to be made, we will soon finalize what needs to finalized. [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Another week of negotiations between Israel and the PLO has ended. You seem to be close to an agreement. What are the outstanding issues at present? [Sha'th] As is well known, we have completed the agreement on the complete transfer of civilian authorities, including tough issues such as water, electronics, radio communications, air traffic, etc. Likewise, we have completed the larger part of the overall agreement. Nonetheless, agreement is yet to be reached on four or five sentences. Some security issues whose discussion was postponed until next week will have to be decided. An overall deal, also known as a package deal [preceding two words in English] will have to be reached on them. With regard to the issue of jurisdiction [preceding word in English] over territory, the population, and functions, a solution to this issue has been reached. Nonetheless, this solution needs to be drafted and agreed upon in detail next week. With respect to the issue of the Palestinian deportees, I would like to reaffirm that there has been a definite agreement to release 5,000 prisoners. However, we want to set up a framework for the release of the remaining prisoners next week. Such a framework must, at least, establish the bases for setting specific timetables for the release of prisoners. I believe both sides can agree on this issue next week. Next week, we will announce a date for the final signing of the agreement. I hope the agreement will be signed during the period 2-5 May. [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: With regard to the Palestinian prisoners, this issue is of great importance to the residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Will all Palestinian prisoners be released? Or does Israel have any reservations on the release of some prisoners? [Sha'th] Israel has made public its reservations about the release of Hamas prisoners and detainees. These reservations were the outcome of the two recent operations carried out in 'Afula and Hadera. However, I believe this Israeli opposition to releasing Hamas prisoners is connected to the outcome and impact of these two operations. However, the principle we seek to entrench is that of a general amnesty. Moreover, the Declaration of Principles provides for a general amnesty. We want all parties to be covered by this amnesty. This means we should not leave in jail those who resisted or fought during the period that preceded the signing of the agreement. This requires the setting of timetables. To the best of my knowledge, Israeli law stipulates that some categories of prisoners cannot be released, but can be handed over to another authority. When the Palestinian leadership takes over authority in Gaza and Jericho, this law will apply to all residents of Gaza and Jericho. When we take over authority in the West Bank, this law will also apply to the residents of the West Bank. The issue has to be governed by both principles and timetables. [Zaydani] Have the talks been promoted by the fact that Abu-Mazin [PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas] is currently in Cairo, not to mention the meeting held between Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Bucharest? [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, these two developments have had a positive effect. The fact that brother Abu-Mazin is around enables us to meet with him two or three times a day. He received us and the Israeli delegation, that is, the chief Israeli negotiators, once. I believe this had a positive effect. It goes without saying that the high-level meetings held with President 'Arafat can expedite the rapid attainment of an agreement. [Zaydani] What about the civil aviation agreements? [Sha'th] We reached an agreement in principle in this regard this week. The arrangements or modalities [preceding three words in English] for this agreement are yet to be agreed upon. I believe the agreement reached in principle in this regard is good. It provides for the opening of airports in Gaza and Jericho. It also provides for operating commercial and civilian planes between Gaza and Jericho, and also between them and neighboring capitals; at least, the capitals that are are currently bound by ties in the context of peace. In the future, when peace prevails in the region, this network of communications will spread. That is why we said that the first international air route that will be launched will be between Gaza airport and Cairo International Airport. [Zaydani] One last question. It seems that the agreement will be signed, although some other differences regarding passports and stamps are yet to be resolved. [Sha'th] With regard to Palestinian passports, Palestinian stamps, the size of the Jericho area, and the presence of Palestinian soldiers at the Allenby Bridge will be left to be decided by President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin when the two meet. [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Thank you very much. [Sha'th] You are welcome. [end recording]
