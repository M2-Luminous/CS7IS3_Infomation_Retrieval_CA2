As an "assistant secretary general," he will control the worldwide missions of blue-helmeted peace troops from UN headquarters in New York. The nomination for the new leading position prior to the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court on the admissibility of out-of-area missions of the Bundeswehr led to controversies in Bonn between the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Ministry, and the Chancellor's Office. In the mid-1980's, Eisele, who was the commander of the Hamburg Armored Infantry Brigade No. 17, discredited himself with his superiors. TV reporters had asked recruits of his brigade what they would do in the so-called defense case. The general had to defend himself for the almost unanimous reply "clear off." When Minister Volker Ruehe took office in 1992, Eisele was replaced prematurely after no more than 12 months as the chief of the Military Policy Department in the Defense Ministry, because he was considered to be overtaxed. Since early April, he has been chief of the Bonn Bundeswehr Office. In Defense Ministry jargon, this authority has been derisively called the "soldiers' cemetery," because it is where officers whom the Defense Ministry wants to get rid of are transferred. Eisele went to New York last week for an interview at the United Nations. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali must yet confirm the nomination for the influential post, which he wants to fill with a German.
