Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and visiting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin co-chaired the meeting and they exchanged opinions on issues of furthering bilateral economic, trade, scientific and technological cooperation in a constructive way. Li said that Sino-Russian economic and trade relations have made much progress, with bilateral trade volume last year reaching 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, nearly twice the highest figure between China and the former Soviet Union. He noted that there is vast potential for bilateral economic and trade cooperation, for bilateral trade volume last year only made up less than 4 percent of China's total foreign trade volume. Both countries agreed that their two highly complementary economies and their location provide a good base for furthering bilateral economic and trade relations. Although the Sino-Russian trade volume is not very big, Li said he believes that Russia will become an important trade partner of China. They also exchanged opinions on existing problems in bilateral economic, trade, scientific and technological cooperation.
