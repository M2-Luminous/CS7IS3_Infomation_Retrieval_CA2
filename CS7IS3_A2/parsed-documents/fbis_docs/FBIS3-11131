According to diplomatic sources, the main subject Baena Soares will discuss in the meeting he is scheduled to hold today with President Carlos Menem will be the situation in Haiti. Before his meeting with Menem, Baena Soares will hand him the 1994 Inter-American Leadership Award granted by the Panamerican Development Foundation, an organization linked to the OAS. The true reason for Baena Soares' visit to Argentina, however, is the battle over his succession that must be decided in less than two weeks. The struggle among the strongest candidates -- Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernard Niehaus Quesada -- is so hard that the third candidate -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Burelli Rivas -- predicted on 16 March that the OAS secretary general's election, scheduled to be held on 27 March, will not be decided in the first round. Baena Soares's succession was complicated by Gaviria's unexpected candidacy, which was supported by Argentina despite having committed its vote to the Costa Rican foreign minister. The Colombian president's candidacy was launched by the United States and this, according to Burelli Rivas, "changed the rules of the game."
