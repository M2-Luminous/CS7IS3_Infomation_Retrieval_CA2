Srdjan Savic reports: [Savic] The Serbs in the Srpska republic were absolutely correct when they decided not to join the Croatian-Muslim federation, because when, in the second stage, a confederation with Croatia is established, the border would be on the Drina river. This is the view of the Democratic Party. The international community has shown discernment for the middle-of-the-road solution that could lead to peace. However, the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia would very shortly demotivate extreme circles among Croats and Muslims, and this would be more effective than the peace talks, Djindjic said. The next move should be the recognition of the equal status of the Serbian Republic, and the issue of the final demarcation would be settled later. The leader of the Democrats has endorsed the negotiations between the representatives of the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia in Zagreb, stressing that the territorial status quo should be accepted and that more emphasis should be placed on the undisputed points. Zoran Djindjic said that a Democratic Party delegation will visit Russia between 4 and 7 April to explain the national position of Serbs in discussions with the representatives of the state Duma and the democratically orientated parties. Commenting on the situation in our country, Djindjic said that the program of economic stabilization is entering the second stage, that the first stage has resulted in healthy currency and that the dinar will collapse in its contact with the ailing economy without an effective control of business activities.
