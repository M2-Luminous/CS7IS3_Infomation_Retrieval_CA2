FR940504-0-00056 FR940504-0-00014 Gear Definitions and Restrictions In addition to gear restrictions shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3 of this preamble, the following gear definitions and restrictions will be in effect. Troll Fishing Gear Troll fishing gear for the Fishery Management Area (FMA) is defined as one or more lines that drag hooks behind a moving fishing vessel. In that portion of the FMA off Oregon and Washington, the line or lines must be affixed to the vessel and must not be intentionally disengaged from the vessel at any time during the fishing operation. Recreational Fishing Gear Recreational fishing gear for the FMA is defined as angling tackle consisting of a line with not more than one artificial lure or natural bait attached. In that portion of the FMA off Oregon and Washington, the line must be attached to a rod and reel held by hand or closely attended; the rod and reel must be held by hand while playing a hooked fish. No person may use more than one rod and line while fishing off Oregon or Washington. In that portion of the FMA off California, the line must be attached to a rod and reel held by hand or closely attended. Weights directly attached to a line may not exceed 4 pounds (1.8 kg). There is no limit to the number of lines that a person may use while recreational fishing for salmon off California. Fishing includes any activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish.

Inseason Notice Procedures Actual notice of inseason management actions will be provided by a telephone hotline administered by the Northwest Region, NMFS, 206&hyph;526&hyph;6667 or 800&hyph;662&hyph;9825, and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts. These broadcasts are announced on Channel 16 VHF&hyph;FM and 2182 Khz at frequent intervals. The announcements designate the channel or frequency over which the Notice to Mariners will be immediately broadcast. Inseason actions will also be filed with the Office of the Federal Register as soon as practicable. Since provisions of these management measures may be altered by inseason actions, fishermen should monitor either the telephone hotline or Coast Guard broadcasts for current information for the area in which they are fishing.
