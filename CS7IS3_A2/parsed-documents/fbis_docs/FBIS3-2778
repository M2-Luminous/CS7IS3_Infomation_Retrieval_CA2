The disputes between the two country must be settled properly through consultation on an equal footing in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences, the Chinese premier stressed, adding that the problems can only be complicated by exerting pressures unilaterally. The Chinese premier made the statements during his meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his party here this afternoon. Premier Li Peng said that China attaches importance to the current visit by Christopher, hoping that candid talks might help enhance mutual understanding. Recalling Christopher's China visit a decade ago, Premier Li Peng said that great changes have taken place in China as well as in the world, but the changing international situation has not in any way change the importance of the Sino-U.S. relations. On the contrary, he said, the changing international situation has called for the enhancement of Sino-U.S. relations. China has always approached the Sino-U.S. relations from the global perspective and from the fundamental interests of the two peoples, Premier Li Peng told U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He said that the Chinese Government attaches importance to the Sino-U.S. relations and has made tremendous efforts toward improving and developing such relations, adding that in my government work report to the National People's Congress session two days ago, he reiterated again this stand of the Chinese Government. Premier Li Peng reviewed the bilateral trade, which has in recent years, grown rapidly, with the trade volume topping 27.65 billion U.S. dollars, increasing 10 times over that of 1979. He said that China's economy is developing in a sustained, fast and steady manner and the market has kept expanding. Its import is expected to reach 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in the next seven years. At present, transportation, telecommunications and energy industries, for which U.S. is a strong power, constitute the priority sectors of China's development, the Chinese premier said. If the Sino-U.S. relations go well, with the man-made obstacles removed, it would mean a historic opportunity for U.S. economic circles. On human rights issue, Li said that China and the U.S. have different concepts regarding human rights. China is a developing country, Li said. The population of the developing world makes up four-fifths of the world's total. It is not fair to impose the human rights concepts of a developed country on a developing country, Li stressed. China will never accept the human rights concepts of the United States, the premier asserted. For a developing country, human rights are, first of all, the rights to survival and development. A person must first survive before talking about rights, Li said. The disputes between China and the United States concerning human rights can be discussed on the basis of equality so as to enhance mutual understanding, the Chinese premier said, but there should be no putting-on of pressure. Li Peng said that it is a mutually beneficial arrangement for the two countries to maintain normal trade relations. "To speak frankly, if China's most favored nation status is cancelled, the losses incurred to the United States would be no smaller than those to China," said the Chinese premier. China mainly relies on its internal market and has a strong capability of self-reliance, he added. "What the U.S. would lose is a vast market," Li said. "We hope the U.S. side would handle this issue properly." Christopher expressed agreement with Li's remarks in his government work report about the importance of Sino-U.S. relations. He said that President Clinton regards the U.S. relations with China as conforming to the national interests of the United States. He told the Chinese premier that the U.S. can cooperate with China on a wide ranging issues, both global and regional, both bilateral and multilateral, and both in the areas of peace and security. The United States and China are both permanent members of the UN Security Council and the U.S. side is willing to improve its relations with China, he said. Christopher also briefed Li on U.S. views on human rights and MFN. Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei were present at the meeting. Present on the U.S. side were Ambassador Stapleton Roy, Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs Lynn Davis and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner.
