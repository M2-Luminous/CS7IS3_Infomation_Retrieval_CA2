Aristide, who is not related to the president, was struck and forced into an automobile used by the police, the source informed. Soldiers arrested several of President Aristide's supporters this weekend in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. Uniformed members of the military arrested Engineer Jacques Dorcean in the Thomassin area in eastern Port-au-Prince. Dorcean is a well-known supporter of the Lavalas Movement, which backed the exiled president in the December 1990 elections.

So far the military has not released any information regarding the reason for the arrests.
