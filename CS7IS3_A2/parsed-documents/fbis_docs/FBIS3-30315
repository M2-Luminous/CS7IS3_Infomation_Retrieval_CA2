Foreign Minister Melescanu had talks with A. Filali, minister of state and foreign minister of the Kingdom of Morocco about the present stage and the prospects of the Romanian-Moroccan relations, and about international and regional matters of joint interest. Minister Melescanu met with the president of Morocco's Chamber of Representatives, with the Moroccan ministers of mining and energy, public works, and cultural affairs. The talks with the Moroccan personalities gave the two sides the opportunity to express their wish that partnership be the basic principle of the future development of their bilateral relations. To this effect the possibility was examined of taking actions apt to render the Romanian-Moroccan relations a privileged nature. The exchange of opinions on international and regional issues revealed similitude or closeness in assessing the developments in the areas in which the two countries are located and on a wider international plane. Concomitantly with the visit to Morocco of the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, the Romanian-Moroccan Joint Governmental Committee for Economic, Technical and Scientific Cooperation held its 8th session under the chairmanship of the two countries' foreign ministers. The committee agreed on cooperation projects in port facility development, drilling, energy, mining, agriculture, professional training. Both sides admitted that the trade exchanges had been below their economic potential and agreed to favor direct contacts between public and private businesses, between medium and small ventures. At the end of the official visit to Morocco and of the 8th session of the joint committee, the Romanian and Moroccan foreign ministers signed several bilateral juridical documents: the convention for the mutual guaranteeing of investments, the statement on establishing regular consultations between the two foreign ministries, the programme of the cultural accord for the years 1994 and 1995.
