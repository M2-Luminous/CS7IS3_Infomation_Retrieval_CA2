The analyst goes on: Japan's nuclear armament is an obstacle to the process of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula because it can cause a new nuclear arms race in this region. If the situation on the Korean peninsula is to be eased and denuclearization to be realized, nuclear weapons must be removed in and around the region, above all. The nuclear armament being promoted in Japan, however, will inevitably give rise to a new nuclear arms race in the Korean peninsula and its surroundings. Moreover, Japan takes the DPRK as the first target of attack for its overseas aggression. If the Korean peninsula is to be denuclearized, an environment and conditions for it must be created in this region. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula presupposes the removal of nuclear threat, and if it is to be realized substantially, a nuclear threat must be eliminated in its surroundings. Under the conditions where Japan is stepping up its nuclear armament, the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization will be reduced to a good-for-nothing one and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will be, in fact, meaningless. In actuality, the Japanese reactionaries do not want to see the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula settled, the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization implemented and the Korean peninsula turned into a nuclear-free, peace zone, for they may lose the ground for nuclear armament when the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is fundamentally and completely settled and this region is turned into a nuclear-free zone. Their ulterior intention is to oppose the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, aggravate the military confrontation and tension in this region and thus step up Japan's nuclear armament on a legitimate basis. The Japanese reactionaries must immediately stop their criminal nuclear armament that snags the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
