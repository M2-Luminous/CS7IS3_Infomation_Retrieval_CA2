He told the Commons at question time that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd would be seeking to do this in the Brussels talks on the terms for Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway to join the EU. Against a background of some Tory Euro-sceptics threatening a Maastricht-scale revolt if Mr Hurd agrees to voting changes reducing the UK's ability to block unwanted proposals, Mr Major said the Government attached "great importance" to qualified majority voting by EU member states. He was responding to Dr Liam Fox, Tory MP for Woodspring, who called for an assurance "it is the protection of British interests in Europe which will lie at the heart of our position in the current negotiations." The Prime Minister said: "It is important that this country plays a full part in the European Community and exercises its influence both on behalf of people in this country and on behalf of Europe as a whole." The UK was "very much in favour" of EU enlargement and negotiations were very nearly complete, he added. "The present discussions between the 12 are about the institutional changes that will accompany the enlargement. ``Like many other states, we attach importance to qualified majority voting. But I think it is right to consider very carefully the effect upon [word indistinct] of an increase in membership. ``What we need to ensure is that democratic legitimacy and the rights of minorities are sustained within the EU. ``That is what Mr Hurd will be seeking to do in his negotiations.'' The dispute concerns a proposal that, to take account of the forthcoming accession of Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway to the EU, the number of votes that must be secured to block EU legislation be raised from 23 to 27. The British Government currently needs backing only from one other large member state and one small one effectively to veto EU proposals.
