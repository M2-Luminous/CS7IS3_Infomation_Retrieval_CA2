Besides Zhirinovskiy, the party has also invited the head of the Italian Lega Nord Umberto Bossi and Ljupco Georgievski from the Macedonian VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity]. All three of them are supposed to be the guests of the congress of the Slovene National Socialists on 12 February 1994.
