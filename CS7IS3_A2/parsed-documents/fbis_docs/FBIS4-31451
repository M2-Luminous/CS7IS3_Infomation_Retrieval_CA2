Coalition talks between the two parties began on Tuesday. The Expo will be more modest than initially targeted since the original plan of its financing from business sources has been aborted, Bekesi said to the daily NEPSZABADSAG. When the Expo project came into being, the Antall government did not specify the concessions and ownership rights the investors would be entitled to. It also failed to specify the rights of utilisation of the territory and buildings after the Expo, Bekesi said. These oversights cannot be repaired now because of the lack of time before the opening of the Expo. As a consequence, the Expo, which requires 100-120 billion forints, can be financed only from budget sources, he said, adding that the 30 billion forints which has already been allocated by Parliament for the Expo would not cover the costs of even the most basic investments. According to Bekesi, the new government will not revise the plan of the Expo, but due to financial limitations the Expo will be more modest than was originally conceived. Kuncze told NEPSZABADSAG that the Expo must be organised if the deadline can be met and if the event can be financed. Although the amount allocated by Parliament is not enough, more than 20 billion forints has already been spent on Expo preparations over the past three years. Among others, bond issues and real estate constructions have begun, and 24 countries have officially announced their participation. As a result, the Expo cannot be cancelled now even if every sign indicates that it will operate at a loss, Kuncze said. If the SZDSZ is in a decision-making position, the party will recommend modification of the system of implementation and execution, since present preparations do not meet legal stipulations, Kuncze added.
