The press report states that during the meeting it was agreed that from now on the government will use the criminal organization's financial resources for purposes other than subversive activities. [sentence as publsihed] Fujimori, after asserting that he has not and will not hold a meeting with Guzman, said the report was "biased and ill-intended," but did not refer to the media. Fujimori also confirmed that drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, alias "Vaticano," has been placed at the disposal of Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] after it was established he had clear connections with terrorist groups, especially the Shining Path. He went on to immediately explain that that does not mean Dinandro [the Police Antidrug Division] will stop its investigations into drug trafficking. He said: "Investigations will continue simultaneously." The chief of state had a busy agenda in this province in Cajamarca Department, where he arrived at noon on 24 January with the Canadian ambassador and Transportation Minister Dante Cordoba and Agriculture Minister Absalon Vasquez. The president dedicated an irrigation canal the region's farmers have been longing for for 56 years. Some 2,000 farmers will benefit from the system that will expand the agricultural zone toward the mountain range. Fujimori also offered an ambulance to the local health center and to repair schools that are in a poor shape.
