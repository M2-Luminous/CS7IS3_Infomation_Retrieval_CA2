App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new AD: 94&hyph;04&hyph;11 Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation: Amendment 39&hyph;8831; Docket No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;26&hyph;AD. Applicability: The following Model and serial number airplanes, certificated in any category: ␣ 1Model 1Serial Nos. 500S 3314 through 3323. 690B 11480 through 11566. Compliance: Required within the next 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished. To prevent failure of the wing structure caused by stress corrosion cracks in the wing front spar lower cap, accomplish the following: (a) Remove a sample (coupon) of the wing front spar lower cap in accordance with the INSTRUCTIONS: PART I section (Model 500S airplanes) or the INSTRUCTIONS: PART II section (Models 690B airplanes) of Twin Commander Service Bulletin (SB) No. 215, dated March 3, 1992, as applicable. Prior to further flight, send this coupon for a metallurgical examination to the EMTEC Corporation, 124 East Sheridan, suite 101, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, and wait for the results of the examination. Note 1: The manufacturer will incur the cost of the required metallurgical examination. The EMTEC Corporation will bill the manufacturer and send the results of the inspection to the airplane owner/operator. (b) If the results of the metallurgical examination required by paragraph (a) of this AD reveal a fine equi-axed grain structure, prior to further flight, replace the wing front spar lower cap in accordance with the instructions in one of the following, as applicable: (1) For Model 690B, Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; (2) For Model 500S, Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;145, dated August 21, 1992; or (3) For Model 690B, AVIADESIGN, Inc.

Note 2: A fine equi-axed grain structure refers to a grain structure that is approximately equal in all three axes and the grains are considerably smaller than what is typical of the wing spar extrusion. This is in contrast to the elongated, highly directional grain structure with relatively large grains typical of the wing spar extrusion. (c) If the results of the metallurgical examination required by paragraph (a) of this AD reveal a grain structure that is smaller than the large elongated grains, but not fine equi-axed, prior to further flight, inspect the wing front spar lower cap for stress corrosion cracking in accordance with an inspection procedure approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Northwest Mountain Region. (1) Send the result of this inspection in writing to the FAA at the address specified in paragraph (e) of this AD, within 10 days after the inspection or 15 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later. State whether any cracks or corrosion was found, the location and length of any cracks found, and the location and depth of any corrosion found. (Reporting approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB No. 2120&hyph;0056). (2) If any cracks are found, prior to further flight, replace the wing front spar lower cap in accordance with the instructions in one of the following, as applicable: (i) For Model 690B, Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; (ii) For Model 500S, Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;145, dated August 21, 1992; or (iii) For Model 690B, AVIADESIGN, Inc.

The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region Note 3: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region. (f) The inspections required by this AD shall be done in accordance with Twin Commander Service Bulletin, No. 215, dated March 3, 1992. The replacement (as applicable) required by this AD shall be done in accordance with the instructions to either Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; or Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;145, dated August 21, 1992, whichever is applicable.
