FR941219-0-00055 FR941219-0-00015 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 285 [Docket No. 940393&hyph;4093; I.D. 112894B] Atlantic Tuna Fisheries; Bluefin Tuna AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Bluefin tuna quota transfer. SUMMARY: NMFS transfers 5‚ê£metric tons (mt) of bluefin tuna from the longline-south Incidental subcategory to the longline-north Incidental subcategory. NMFS has determined that the fisheries landing bluefin under the longline-south Incidental subcategory will not achieve the full 1994 quota allocation. This action is being taken to extend the season for the longline-north Incidental subcategory, which will assure additional collection of biological assessment and monitoring data and increase the economic benefits from this fishery without contributing significantly to additional bluefin mortality. In addition, this action will prevent waste of bluefin tuna that might otherwise be discarded dead. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 14, 1994 through December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Kelly, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347 or Ray Baglin, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9140. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Bluefin tuna are currently leaving the fall feeding grounds in New England and migrating along the Mid-Atlantic waters, so high incidental catches by longline vessels operating south of 34 N. lat. are not expected to occur. After the addition of 5 mt, effective November 4, 1994 (59 FR 55821, November 9, 1994), the longline-north Incidental subcategory has only 0.6 mt remaining of its total new allocation of 28 mt for vessels fishing north of 34 N. lat. Once the quota is reached for this northern subcategory, any bluefin tuna incidentally taken by longline vessels must be discarded at sea. In order to prevent waste of bluefin tuna, which would otherwise be discarded dead, NMFS is transferring an additional 5 mt of quota from the southern to the northern subcategory. With the addition of this 5 mt, the total annual allocation to date for the Incidental subcategory longline-north will be 33 mt. This amount should be sufficient to account for incidental take of bluefin by the northern subcategory for the remainder of this year while any unharvested balance for the southern subcategory will be added to the 1995 quota. After the transfer of this 5 mt, approximately 12 mt remains available in the longline-south Incidental subcategory. Based on reported catches, bluefin taken from the southern subcategory will not exceed the 12 mt remaining of that quota. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 285.22(i) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Dated: December 13, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
