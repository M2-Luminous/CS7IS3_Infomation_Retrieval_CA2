It has been learned that China was informed of a UN plan to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. China was then asked to cooperate with the plan. This indicates that the UN Security Council has initiated its meetings to earnestly discuss sanctions against North Korea as the deadline for the nuclear inspection of North Korea by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] -- which is scheduled for 22 February -- is imminent. It is therefore very significant. A source said: Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who arranged that day's meeting, gave a briefing on the status of the negotiation process between the IAEA and North Korea, and said that the UN Security Council should take "action" against North Korea if no agreement was reached between the IAEA and North Korea. British, French, and Russian ambassadors supported the U.S. position.
