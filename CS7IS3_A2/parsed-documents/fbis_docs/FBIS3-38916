"Greece has given proof of its sang-froid and responsibility, as opposed to the hysterical improvisations made by many (participants)" in the wake of a weekend mortar attack that killed 68 people in Sarajevo, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said. "The government has reason to be satisfied (...) that no step was taken towards supporting airstrikes." Greece presided over a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday, which turned down French proposals to issue an ultimatum to Serb forces besieging the Bosnian capital. There has been growing international pressure for immediate airstrikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) following the bloody attack on a Sarajevo market. The EC meeting called for lifting the siege "by all possible means, including aerial." According to Venizelos, this implied a rejection of any immediate intervention. Greece is alone among EC member states in its pro-Serb sympathies, and has backed Serb arguments that the attack was a Moslem provocation. In Athens on Tuesday, there were headlines saying "Stop Airstrikes" and "No to Military Intervention" in newspapers supporting the Socialist government of Andreas Papandreou. Greece, the only Balkan country in the EC, claims that military involvement would unleash an inferno and that a negotiated settlement is the only answer. Foreign minister Karolos Papoulias has reaffirmed that Athens would not allow its NATO bases at Preveza, opposite the island of Corfu, to be used for any air operation and would withdraw its NATO airforce personnel. "It would be a symbolic decision without any operational importance," a European military expert close to NATO told AFP. Greece is at loggerheads over the issue with fellow NATO member Turkey, which is sympathetic to the Bosnian Moslems. But despite earlier objections Athens has now agreed to join Turkey in attending a meeting of countries bordering on the former Yugoslavia, called for Wednesday by international peace negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.
