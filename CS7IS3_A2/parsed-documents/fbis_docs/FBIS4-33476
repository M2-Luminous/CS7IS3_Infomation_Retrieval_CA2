An official document indicated that the building had been expropriated from its legitimate owner and donated to Panama. According to the document, the Nicaraguan Government asked the Panamanian diplomatic mission in Nicaragua to return the building because it had been expropriated from its legitimate owner during the administration of Anastasio Somoza, who was killed after being overthrown by the Sandinists. In 1982, the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry decided to donate the building to the Panamanian Embassy in Managua. The building has served as residence for our diplomatic missions since then. Through a "verbal note" on 17 February, the Nicaraguan Government notified the Panamanian Government that in order to correct actions committed by previous administrations, it is working to return property expropriated from Nicaraguans and foreigners. Therefore, it requested the return of the building being used by the Panamanian Embassy. The Panamanian Government replied it has no objections to returning the building, specially if the donation was never legalized. Therefore, it authorized the Foreign Ministry to return the building through the Panamanian diplomatic mission in Nicaragua.
