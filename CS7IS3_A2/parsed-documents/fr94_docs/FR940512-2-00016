FR940512-2-00016 FR940512-2-00008 Although not required by the statute, the Department may require new or additional producers or exporters to become signatories to an agreement, thus raising the coverage above the 85 percent level, in order to permit more effective monitoring of the agreement. In this case, pursuant to the agreement, the GOCR was required to notify the Department whenever new producers or exporters exported subject merchandise to the United States, and whether those producers or exporters had agreed to comply with the terms of the agreement. Agreement, 52 FR at 1361. To ensure that it met this requirement, the GOCR required any new or different producer or exporter which exported a certain volume or value of the subject merchandise to the United States to become a signatory. These new signatories were required to comply with the terms of the agreement during each year they were covered. The new signatories which have been reviewed by the Department provided a further track record of compliance with the suspension agreement. This provided the Department with evidence above and beyond that required under the statute and the Department's regulations for both coverage and termination. Finally, we agree with respondents that the Tile from Mexico case dealt with partial revocation, i.e., a company-specific revocation, of a countervailing duty order under ยง355.25(a)(3) of the Department's regulations. The regulations contain no similar provision permitting partial termination of a suspension agreement. Therefore, the Tile from Mexico determination does not bear on the outcome of this proceeding. Accordingly, we have determined that section 355.25(a)(2) permits termination of a suspended investigation whenever the Department determines that the exporters or producers that originally signed the suspension agreement have consistently accounted for at least 85 percent of the imports of the subject merchandise for a period of at least five consecutive years, during which time they did not apply for or receive any net subsidy on the subject merchandise. In addition, any new signatories must be found to have complied with the terms of the agreement during the time they are covered. The Department has determined that throughout the life of the present agreement, including during the current review, the producers and exporters that originally signed the agreement have continued to account for at least 85 percent of the imports, despite the fact that new producers or exporters were added to the agreement. See Memo to the File, dated March 30, 1994, public version on file in room B&hyph;099, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC. In addition, we have determined that no producer or exporter covered by the agreement has applied for or received any net subsidy on the subject merchandise during this review or during any of the previous four reviews. Hence, for a period of at least five consecutive years after entry into the agreement, the Department has determined that the producers and exporters that signed the agreement and that consistently have accounted for substantially all of the imports of the subject merchandise into the United States have not applied for or received any net subsidy on the subject merchandise. Also, the signatories that were later added to the agreement have complied with the terms of the agreement during each review period in which they were covered. Therefore, we determine that the requirements for termination under ยง355.25(a)(2)(i) have been met. Comment 2: Petitioner argues that the Department should decline to terminate the suspended investigation because all the programs are still in existence and used by the flower producers and exporters for non-subject merchandise. Petitioner asserts that after termination, the former signatories will continue to be eligible to receive benefits for most of the programs, absent active ACOFLOR intervention and monitoring. Moreover, petitioner contends that termination would be inappropriate without updated information covering the 1992 and 1993 review periods. Petitioner argues that it is not unlikely that the flower producers and exporters will use the six programs covered by the agreement. Specifically, petitioner makes the following arguments regarding the six programs: (1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases: Petitioner argues that there will be no incentive for ACOFLOR or the GOCR to continue monitoring receipt of benefits under this program. Petitioner also asserts that there will be incentives for flower producers and exporters to switch equipment used for the production on non-subject merchandise, for which exemptions are allowed, to the production of subject merchandise, for which exemptions are monitored under the agreement. (2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports: Petitioner makes the same arguments as stated above for the Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases. (3) Accelerated Depreciation: Petitioner argues that, although the Department has found that no signatories have used accelerated depreciation, there is no formal or informal mechanism to stop flower producers and exporters from claiming accelerated depreciation on their tax forms. (4) Certificates for Increasing Exports (CIEX): Petitioner argues that the CIEX program has not been terminated because some Costa Rican exporters received CIEX benefits in 1991 through a special commission established in 1984 to pay benefits accrued in earlier years. Additionally, petitioner contends that there are no formal or informal measures to render exports of the subject merchandise ineligible for the benefit.
