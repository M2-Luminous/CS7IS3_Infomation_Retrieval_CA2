Because foreign businessmen and private enterprise operators -- who are only too interested in making use of cheap labor -- pay very low wages, labor trouble is a common occurrence. A Worker's Monthly Pay Is Only 300 Yuan According to a restricted report, factory operators in Shenzhen and nearby areas seriously encroach on workers' rights and interests to in the following ways. 1. Factory operators pay workers very low wages. Statistics from the labor personnel department show that a non-resident worker only gets 300 yuan a month in Shenzhen and adjacent areas, much lower than wages for local people. Though the Guangdong Provincial and Shenzhen governments set the minimum monthly wage at 300 yuan, factory operators in Shenzhen and the adjacent areas usually pay this minimum figure. As a result, many "non-resident workers" can save little after spending their wages on food, clothing, and other daily necessities. Complaints from these workers, who live a miserable life, are heard everywhere. 2. The workers' living conditions are extremely inadequate. To lower their production costs, factory operators cut back their expenditures on housing for workers and other basic facilities. In some places, over a dozen workers are packed into one room, which results in a foul smell. Sanitation facilities also leave much to be desired, with only one water tap or water closet provided for many people. Usually the smell in the water closet is so offensive that one feels like vomiting when using it. Some factories do not even provide dormitories, and the workers have to sleep in the workshops, which is rather dangerous. 3. Safety facilities are not installed as required. Many factories try to earn as much money as possible and pay no attention to safety. 1) The equipment is outdated, resulting in an increasing number of injured and disabled workers; 2) fire fighting equipment and escape mechanisms are so backward that the number of fire victims has become alarming. The conflagration in a foreign-funded factory in Shenzhen, in which approximately 100 workers were killed, shocked the world; and 3) working conditions are very poor. The workshops, which are dirty, noisy, and poorly illuminated, are frightening. And, 4. Workers' welfare is not guaranteed. Workers are not given subsidies when they fall ill and receive no attention when they become disabled due to industrial accidents. Many workers do not have the minimum guarantee of welfare. Workers' Certificates Are Retained To Prevent Them Seeking Employment in Other Factories Workers frequently "change their employers" due to the poor working conditions. To prevent workers seeking new jobs in other factories, enterprise operators in Shenzhen and nearby areas typically illegally retain their employees' certificates. A restricted investigation report states that Shenzhen government departments often receive complaints from workers against their employers for illegally detaining their certificates. Some enterprises in Shenzhen have collected the workers' identity certificates and border passes and then locked them in drawers on the excuse of helping them get temporary residence permits. An employer in a garment processing factory in Shenzhen did not apply for temporary residence permits for over 100 workers eight months after collecting their identity certificates and border passes and refused to give the certificates back to the workers, despite repeated demands, using the excuse that the "necessary procedures for applying temporary residence permits are underway" or that the "certificates were lost in the process." When the department concerned, after receiving the complaints, inquired with the employer about the matter, the latter continued to lie, saying that they "kept" the certificates because the police substation rejected the workers' applications for temporary residence permits. A factory, which specializes in processing supplied materials, set aside the workers' certificates for fear that they would seek jobs in other factories, and the employer, when questioned by the department concerned as to the reason, shouted: "If I do not retain their certificates, will my factory not be forced to suspend production if they `go over to other factories'!" Both Employers and Employees Lack Awareness of the Need To Abide by the Law Putting on a long face, a female worker told the following story: When she, along with a number of fellow villagers, was employed by a garment factory, the boss took away their certificates. After receiving a telegram from home telling her that "her father was seriously ill" and urging her to come home, she asked the boss for leave and to return her certificate. Instead of getting back her certificate, she was scolded by her boss. Many workers complained: "Since our employer has retained our certificates, we dare not go out, for fear that we will be arrested by public security officers if we fail to produce a certificate. We are on tenterhooks when we are in bed at night, because public security officers could come to our dormitory and ask us to produce certificates." An analysis has revealed that there are three reasons why employers retain workers' certificates. 1) Some enterprise operators are undereducated and lack awareness of the need to abide by the law, so they know nothing about the regulations regarding identity certificates and believe that it is an insignificant matter to retain workers' certificates. 2) Some enterprises which have poor economic efficiency and offer workers low wages retain workers' certificates for fear that the workers will seek jobs in other enterprises. 3) Some workers, who also know nothing about the regulations regarding the identity certificate, still work honestly for the employer after their certificates are retained rather than safeguarding their rights and interests in a lawful way, thus enabling the employers to have their way. And, 4) Some units recruited workers before going through the necessary procedures for hiring workers and could not get temporary residency permits for their workers. But they cheated the workers by saying they "were applying for temporary residency permits" for the workers and in fact kept the certificates in their own hands, refusing to give them back to the owners for quite some time. The Workers Set Up Trade Unions Simultaneously Having their rights and interests been repeatedly encroached upon, workers in Shenzhen and nearby areas set up trade unions on their own to deal with the unlawful practices of enterprise operators. Initial statistics have indicated that there are currently over 800 trade unions at various levels. The main task of these trade unions is to seek a solution for the problem of unequal payments to workers through discussions with employers. Generally speaking, workers are willing to join trade unions, but they do not do so openly, because they are afraid they will be laid off for such activity. Though these trade unions play a positive role in safeguarding workers' rights and interests, they have several serious defects. First, the trade unions are not very well-organized and resemble secret societies, which lack a set of management principles and rules, and thus usually act based on feelings and personal loyalty. Second, many trade unions do not have a well-considered strategy for safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests. Instead of dealing with the employer in a lawful way, they usually choose the method which is so destructive that foreign investors are quaking in their boots. Third, some trade unions often set forth inappropriate demands which are unacceptable to the employer. And fourth, the trade unions often go so far in their disputes with the employers that the situation ends up in a mess. Obviously, the trade unions simultaneously organized by workers in enterprises in Shenzhen and nearby areas are different from those set up by the central authorities in a planned way, but governments at all levels do not take any action against these unauthorized trade unions. Foreign-funded and private enterprises are very disgruntled with these unauthorized trade unions, and the two sides are displaying great hostility against one another. This has received adequate attention from the central authorities and provincial and municipal governments, and it is believed that some measures will be soon taken to solve the problem.
