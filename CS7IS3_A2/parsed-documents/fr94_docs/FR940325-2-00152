FR940325-2-00152 FR940325-2-00061 NATIONAL COMMISSION ON INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION Notice of Public Hearings and Comments SUMMARY: The National Commission on Intermodal Transportation is seeking comments and recommendations from interested parties on how to achieve a more efficient and productive intermodal transportation system in the United States. The Commission is charged by Congress to ``make a complete investigation and study of intermodal transportation in the United States and internationally.'' Created by Section 5005 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the Commission has members appointed by the President and the Congressional leadership. The Commission is chaired by Robert D. Krebs, Chairman, President and CEO of Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. The Commission's legislation specifies three fundamental tasks: (1) Determine the status of, and problems related to, intermodal transportation today; (2) identify the resources needed to enhance intermodal transportation; and (3) make recommendations on how to achieve an efficient intermodal transportation system. The Commission will focus on passenger and freight traffic, public and private sectors, and all modes of transportation. The Commission will submit its findings to Congress on September 30, 1994. DATES: Public hearings will be held in Washington D.C. on May 2, 1994, New Orleans, LA on May 10, 1994, and Los Angeles, CA on June 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written, signed comments to Anne D. Aylward, Executive Director, NCIT, 301 N. Fairfax Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Those interested in testifying please contact the Commission by telephone at (703) 603&hyph;0153 or fax (703) 603&hyph;0159. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Please call the National Commission on Intermodal Transportation (703) 603&hyph;0153. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Areas of Inquiry The following questions illustrate the type of issues the public is invited to address, but they are emphatically not intended as a comprehensive list of issues that the Commission expects to consider. Respondents may focus on these issues and any other specific matters that would bear upon the improvement of intermodal transportation in the United States. Status of the Existing System •What is the status of intermodal transportation today? Where is intermodalism working? •What are the key intermodal bottlenecks in freight traffic? •What are the key intermodal bottlenecks in passenger traffic? •What are the best examples of efficient intermodal facilities and operations_passenger and freight? •How would the proposed National Transportation System (NTS) affect the development of an intermodal system? What criteria should be used in developing an NTS? •How has intermodalism developed in the freight sector? Are there lessons transferable to the passenger sector? Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Questions •Would modification of government structures enhance development of an efficient itnermodal transportation system? If so, how? •How can institutional barriers between private (freight) and public (passenger) be reduced to enhance intermodal planning at the local, state and national levels? •Are there specific legal impediments to increasing intermodal efficiency such as: outdated, inefficient, cumbersome regulations/laws, jursidicational issues among governments, impediments to sharing resources, inconsistency of regulations among states, and antitrust impediments to standardization? •Are there structural or process impediments to improving existing infrasture capacity? •Has ISTEA made a difference in MPO treatment of intermodal projects? •Do the existing intermodal planning structures at the state and local levels need additional national standards and criteria to insure that a consistent national plan emerges from the MPO/state process? •What are the barriers to promoting ``seamless borders'' for international intermodal movements? Funding and Financial Questions •Is adequate funding of intermodal transportation presently available? Identify specific gaps. •What additional investment is required to meet the nation's needs, including access to ports, airports, and intermodal terminals? •Are innovative methods and sources of financing needed to provide adequate funding for intermodal transportation? If so, what might they include? •How can federal, state and local governments best leverage transportation investments to encourage intermodal transportation? •Are there significant opportunities for investment by the private sector or for privatization that would advance intermodalism? What barriers exist? Technology and Research Questions •What new technology will enhance development of an efficient intermodal transportation system? How can the federal government encourage its introduction? •How can decision-support planning tools be developed for use in the public resource allocation process? •Are there essential intermodal R & D needs that cannot be met by the private sector alone? •How can the concerns of publics with special needs (elderly, handicapped, disadvantaged, etc.) be better served by intermodal systems? Respondents may focus on these issues and any other specific matters that would bear upon the improvement of intermodal transportation in the United States. Sandra K. Bushue, Deputy Director.
