The increase of the GDP by 2.1 percent compared with the same period last year in western Germany was the first increase in the annual comparison since 1992. However, this result needs to be interpreted, because it could easily lead to incorrect conclusions. Of course, following the deep valley of recession of 1993, such a figure is primarily good news, because it makes clear that the recovery has intensified and has gained ground. The danger of a relapse, which was hanging over the German economy like the sword of Damocles for the past months, may now be considered finally banished. However, things get problematic if one takes the growth rate at face value and even extrapolates it, because there is no doubt that it exaggerates the actual development. This is primarily due to the fact that this 2.1 percent refers to an extremely low statistical base. During the first quarter of 1993 the recession had reached its absolute low point. This means that, for instance, the corresponding rate for the second quarter will be considerably lower, because during the comparable period last year the economic development had already stabilized a bit. By the way, the development of the GDP also shows that the recovery is progressing a bit more slowly. Compared with the fourth quarter of 1993, the overall output of the German economy during the first quarter increased only by a moderate 0.5 percent. However, this does not change anything about the fact that one may revise the forecast for the entire year 1994 slightly upward against the background of the figures of the quarter. The Ifo Institute has just done that; the economic researchers from Munich now expect an increase of the real GDP in the west by 1.5 to 2 percent in contrast to the 1.5 percent mentioned in the spring report of the research institutes. In the new laender, where the institute expects a strong increase of investments to 160 million German marks [DM], an overall economic growth of at least 7.5 percent is considered possible. However, here, too, it is important that the considerably better result this year will form the platform for a further growth next year, which could then reach 3 percent or perhaps even a bit more. Unfortunately, all this has hardly any effect on the labor market. According to Ifo, the number of unemployed in the west will once again grow by 300,000 to 2.6 million on annual average this year; in the east it will probably go up by another 50,000. The current decline in May to 2.5 million (west) and 1.15 million (east) is largely seasonal; practically no stimuli by the economic development are felt as yet. And what does this growth process consist of? The main elements still come from abroad. This is shown, first, in the foreign trade balance, where goods exports skyrocketed to DM61.2 billion in March (February DM50.7 billion). Even though imports also increased strongly -- to DM53.8 billion following 44.9 billion -- the surplus in foreign trade rose to DM7.4 billion (previous month DM5.8 billion). The order statistic, too, still shows an excess in foreign orders. In the two-month comparison of March/April with January/February orders in the processing industry rose by an average of 6 percent. Germany contributed an increase by 5 percent to this and other countries an increase by 8 percent. However, the April figures indicate that the wind might be changing. In April orders increased by 0.6 percent compared with the previous month, whereby domestic orders were 2 percent higher and foreign orders declined by 1.5 percent. Still, such a monthly result is not yet a guarantee that domestic orders are recovering, but it would certainly correspond to the usual pattern of the economic development if the export orders, which have increased for quite some time, would soon give rise to more orders also at home. As a result of the increasing number of orders received, industry has switched to the next higher gear in output. In April output rose by 2.5 percent compared with May and by 4.1 percent compared with last year. There are two circumstances that are irritating at the threshold to the economic summer. First, the companies' inclination toward investments is still not very high and, second, interest rates have been rising for some months. An Ifo poll has shown that industry is planning a nominal plus in investments of only 0.5 percent, which probably means a real minus of about 2 percent. This reflects the fact that the companies still have considerable reserves in capacity and that one still needs a certain time in upswing before investments in expansions are ordered. As regards private consumption, on the other hand, it has developed far better than predicted. While one rather had to expect a decline because of the declining real income as a result of higher taxes, private consumption rose by 1 percent during the first quarter of 1994 compared with the last quarter of 1993. This shows that the citizens want to maintain their standard of living even if incomes go down and that they rather accept a declining savings quota instead. However, in April retail trade suffered a virtual slump with a decline of 9 percent. Nevertheless, there is the prevalent opinion that, even though private consumption will not be able to make a contribution to the upswing in this period, it will, on the other hand, at least not cause any damage to the economic development. Interest Risks In contrast, the rise in the capital market interest rate to more than 7 percent now does not quite fit the situation. The economic development has by far not reached a stage at which it would be appropriate to make long-term money, which is essential for investments, more expensive. This is all the less so since the development of prices over the previous months has led downward; in April the inflation rate was 2.9 percent, thus being below the 3- percent mark for the first time in three years. Certainly, the interest rate is still below the long-term average, but the signal given by the rising interest rate is problematical. Even though the Bundesbank is doing everything possible to push short-term interest rates downward, one can see once again that its arm is not long enough to reach the end. Despite all assumptions to the contrary, it is obviously not possible to decouple the development of the capital market in Germany from that in the United States. When the interest rate is still at least 0.5 percent higher and keeps rising, this is certainly appropriate to the situation in view of the U.S. economic development, which is in full swing. In our country, however, this could brake the upswing, which would be anything but desirable in the coming months. What applies to Germany also applies to the international economy as a whole: The recession has been overcome, but climbing out of the valley is difficult. The only exception is the United States, where the economy is currently growing at an annual rate of 5 percent. Japan, on the other hand, still has difficulties. The high exchange rate of the yen is an enormous brake on the recovery, the domestic programs for stimulation have not yet had an effect. Therefore, a considerable increase of the GDP is expected only for next year. In West Europe, Great Britain and Norway are the pacemakers of the economic development. In total, the HWWA [Hamburg Archive for World Economy] expects an increase in the GDP of the West European states by 1.5 percent, with accelerating growth during the second half of the year. In 1994 the volume of international trade will probably rise by 5 to 6 percent and thus reach approximately the speed of expansion it had during the second half of the 1980's.
