Under this bill, the United States can provide additional finance to Belarus -- which rigorously follows the course toward nonnuclear status, in keeping with international treaties on confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe -- to compensate for its expenses connected with the reduction of its army to the necessary sufficiency level. The cost of destroying excess military equipment is a burden currently being borne by the Belarus taxpayers. Any help in this area would be more than welcome. Discussion of this important issue is expected at the summit meeting when U.S. President Bill Clinton visits Minsk.
