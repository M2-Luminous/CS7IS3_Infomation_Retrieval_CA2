As a meeting of the "executive committee" of this illegal organization was due to start the police stormed the premises, prevented the meeting from taking place and arrested Ismailj Kastrati and Sulejman Ahmetaj, the "president" and "secretary" of this Albanian "chamber", together with 11 "committee" members. The first two were detained while the others were released after interrogation. Reporting on this incident, the newspaper BUJKU said that the police acted correctly. The paper also recalls the statements by Serbian officials saying they will not tolerate any organization of parallel power in Kosmet. BUJKU admits that the Serbian authorities granted licenses to 14,000 private enterprises whose owners were mostly ethnic Albanians, but they cannot accept their being organized outside official institutions. The Chamber of Commerce of Kosovo and Metohija does exist in Pristina. It represents the interests of all economic subjects regardless of their nationality. Ethnic Albanians are also members, and some of their private entrepreneurs are even using the premises that they leased from the Chamber. However, the political group rallied round Ibrahim Rugova is trying to establish the parallel forms of power and thus prove that Kosovo is outside Serbia and that it is allegedly "a separate independent state."
