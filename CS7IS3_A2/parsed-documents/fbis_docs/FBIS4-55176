Kovacic and M. Mikuljanac: "All the Balkans Are Serbia"] [Text] Belgrade -- Brother Serbs, do not retreat even an inch, do not retreat, but go forward and bear in mind that Russia, Moscow, and the Russian people are with you. This was stated by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, at the end of the rally held to mark Victory Day at Belgrade's Republic Square yesterday. The rally, which the Belgrade police initially banned and then allowed and secured, was organized by the Serbian National Renewal [SNO] and was attended by several thousand Belgrade citizens. The speakers and guests (14 members of the delegation of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, a few dozen SNO officials, the representatives of the RS [republic of Srpska] and the RSK [republic of Serbian Krajina], and two security teams) were standing on an improvised stage (a truck), in front of the monument to Knez Mihailo. They were surrounded by journalists, cameramen, and citizens, who wore uniforms and carried banners. Mirko Jovic (president of the SNO) and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who were greeted and seen off with ovations, were the only ones who managed to change the acquiescent atmosphere, marked only by occasional chanting of "Russia" and "Serbia." Mirko Jovic began his speech by saying that the "international community has taught the Serbs that the factual situation is more important than history, and therefore, after three years of war, the Serbian unification is an undisputable fact." "Our country is now so large that you can spend 16 hours travelling in any direction, even with the best car. We know that you are envious," Jovic said addressing the West, "because the states that you support can be crossed in half an hour." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (who Jovic introduced as the commander of the Russian and Serbian armies) also had messages ready for the countries of the Western Europe and the United States. "They must know that it is dangerous to go to the south and the east, because this could be their last war. If they continue attacks on the Slavs, we will be forced to use the entire Russian military potential. If they do not listen to the voice of reason, they will put their countries in an unenviable position," Zhirinovskiy predicted. Insisting that all foreign armies should leave the Balkans ("if any foreign army is to be here, this should then be the Russian army"), Zhirinovskiy said that the Serbs should themselves decide on their borders. According to them, "it would be appropriate if all the Balkans were Serbia." Zhirinovskiy promised Serbia every kind of help, including military, as soon as he comes to power. He told those gathered to "bolster the Orthodox fate and believe in victory." The rally was also addressed by Biljana Plavsic (vice president of the RS), Branko Vojnica (chairman of the RSK Assembly), Veselin Djuretic, General Viktor Ustinov, Admiral Yevgeniy Busov, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy (who ended his speech by saying "The Russians are coming"), and Dusan Krunic. Milan Gvero (deputy chief of staff of the RS Army), who was supposed to speak, did not speak. The rally was concluded by Bora Djordjevic with a song "The Night Is Dark." Last night, the Russian delegation held talks with the representatives of the RS and RSK behind closed doors in the Bosanka villa.
