A joint statement has been released. The statement reiterates the imperative that a cease-fire should immediately take effect; there should be a lasting cessation of hostilities as well as a lasting basis for regulating relations between the Croat and Bosnian peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has been agreed that Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic will meet on 8 January. An agreement was also confirmed in Vienna on a free-trade zone in the port of Ploce. The cease-fire plan will be discussed in Bonn. Peace mediators Owen and Stoltenberg said that a cease-fire agreement alone would not solve the problem because in Bosnia-Herzegovina 69 cease-fires had been agreed so far while the end of the war was still not yet in sight. Due to the protracted grave situation on the ground, proposals were tabled for the first time for mutual demarcation between the Croats and Muslims. The two sides agree that an immediate cease-fire and a lasting cessation of hostilities is in the interest of both peoples and both states. In Bonn on Saturday Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic will also discuss the organization of future political, military, territorial, and humanitarian relations between the two peoples. [Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic] "This is by all accounts the most precious result of today's and yesterday's meetings. This means that at the meeting of the two presidents they will also talk about a cease-fire." [Unidentified announcer] Being aware of the risks in the event of these conflicts on the ground deepening and spreading, both sides accepted peaceful solutions to the problems. They particularly discussed the need for full compliance with the existing cease-fires, especially so in central Bosnia. A comprehensive plan is being drawn up for the implementation of the cease-fire along front lines, including a suspension of all military activity, thus creating preconditions for a lasting cessation of hostilities. This plan, which must be finalized by Saturday, will include protection for the population and trust-building measures. [Unidentified correspondent] "Do you believe there is some chance of an agreement on a cessation of hostilities in Bonn on Saturday?" [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic] "Talking about whether there is any chance, the answer is, in fact, yes. The answer to this question is yes. This will not be simple. I can see that there is goodwill and this is why my answer is yes, there is a chance." [Unidentified announcer] An agreement was also reached on a free-trade zone in the port of Ploce. The cochairmen's suggestion about access to the sea near Prevlaka was explicitly rejected. For the first time, envoys Granic and Silajdzic told each other their territorial demands. For the first time, the Muslims discussed Croatia's stands on territories. On the ground in Bosnia, in the shadow of death, a diplomatic foundation for a new peace was found. [Granic] "Both sides have taken on an obligation to do their best to implement the existing agreements and signed agreements. This means putting an end to all conflicts. In any case, to us this therefore means that the Bosnian Muslim offensive on the Croat enclaves in central Bosnia should stop, and so should conflicts along all frontlines between the Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will also be one of the main topics of the Tudjman-Izetbegovic meeting." [Unidentified announcer] Some of the most important results are the humanitarian solutions -- a special commission will ensure the crossing of a field hospital to the left bank in Mostar tomorrow [6 January], the reconstruction of the devastated city, and the return of expelled persons according to the Brussels agreement. This will be discussed by the working group for Mostar. [Granic] "We have achieved several concrete results. This might not seem enough, the situation being what it is, but we believe this to be a step forward -- especially regarding the humanitarian situation, the Mostar issue. "The talks were held in a constructive atmosphere. We hope it stays the same in future, but most of all we hope that these measures and agreements at certain levels will result in a cessation of hostilities -- this is the most important thing, without this all these agreements will acquire a completely different dimension. I hope we will succeed." [Unidentified announcer] A special commission will meet on 7 January to discuss the passage of humanitarian convoys, the evacuation of the wounded, and the long-term supplying of hospitals. A commission for the exchange of prisoners will meet on 11 January.
