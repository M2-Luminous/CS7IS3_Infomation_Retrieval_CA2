They were not selling the most up-to-date equipment, just obsolete naval vessels. Three were purchased by St. Petersburg firms to break up for scrap and the fourth -- a medium amphibious warfare ship -- to be converted into a freighter. On the whole the auction was deemed a success. However, the command of the Baltic Fleet was in no hurry to appraise it; indeed it had earlier been sharply criticized by the Ministry of Defense for its commercial activity. That is why there was a shroud of secrecy over the auction and why no journalists were there, even though we have all known for a long time that with the loss of the bases in the Baltic countries and with the fleet being cut back auctions like this could well resolve one of the most acute issues -- that of financing the housing program for servicemen and their families.
