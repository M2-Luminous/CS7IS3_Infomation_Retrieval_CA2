UNHCR spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said Thursday [13 January] that some areas in Kosovo were without heat or electricity and that the human rights situation was also causing concern. The organisation has asked governments not to send ayslum-seekers back at least until spring -- even if they do not fulfil the conditions for refugee status. Switzerland gave temporary shelter to about 1,800 Albanians from Kosovo in 1993, but only accorded 100 of them refugee status. Several political and religious groups recently tried to intervene with Bern authorities in a bid to prevent the expulsion of Kosovo Albanians.
