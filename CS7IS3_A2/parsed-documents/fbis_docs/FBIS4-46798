Just what threat do the antidumping suits pose for the Ukrainian economy as a whole? Quite obviously those in the Ministry of Industry, with jurisdiction over most of the enterprises with an export potential, had to work out some projections dealing with these issues. What were those projections? Anatoliy Holubchenko, Ukrainian minister of industry, talks with a UNIAN correspondent about them. [Nikolaychuk] Mr. Anatoliy, Ukraine's difficulties, as commonly known, started with the initiation of an antidumping suit by the International Arbitration Court against the metallurgical flagship Azovstal. How complicated is that situation? [Holubchenko] The problem of dumping is increasingly acute for Ukraine. We have done too much "trading" in the years of unlimited freedom. The reason being the lack of a price regulation mechanism as well as three years of uncontrolled trade by our enterprises. Particularly in types of products that are in short supply, which are eagerly purchased, and also in raw materials. Canada and the United States initiated antidumping litigation involving products that are supplied from Ukraine. Even though the products were not supplied directly by Azovstal or even by Ukraine, but by the Kleker firm, which simply acquired sheet steel from Azovstal and resold it in Canada and the United States. We are, however, a civilized country with a state economic sector. Therefore complaints concerning those products, which come from Ukraine, are expressed directly to the government. A special task force has now been formed, headed by my deputy Valeriy Mazur, which is working on the antidumping problem. [Nikolaychuk] Beside the Azovstal suit, what other antidumping litigation was initiated against Ukraine? [Holubchenko] The EC filed an antidumping suit against our government pertaining to ferro-alloys, certain types of mineral fertilizers, and cast iron. Today, for instance, Ukraine is selling cast iron at $95-$115 per tonne. Europe is maintaining a price of $140-$150. Naturally it cannot allow our cheap cast iron on its market since that would ruin its producers. Therefore, in protecting its producers, the EC initiated a suit against us. That, naturally does not mean the production of cast iron is that cheap in Ukraine. But because we have always maintained low prices for energy sources, the cost of cast iron production was artificially kept low. [Nikolaychuk] Approximately how much and from whose treasury will the Ukrainian enterprises have to pay in case the suits are lost? According to certain data, for instance, Azovstal alone is being threatened with a fine of $1.5 million. [Holubchenko] We are working on that right now and in my opinion, have every chance of avoiding payment of fines. Almost daily our experts participate in negotiations with EC experts and western firms. Naturally, we ask that consideration be given to the fact that Ukraine is a developing country and that the violation occurred due to our lack of experience and ignorance. [Nikolaychuk] Please indicate whether the guilty enterprises will become bankrupt if Ukraine has to pay in case of the loss of antidumping lawsuits? [Holubchenko] I do not believe so. But the point is not the fines. If we should lose the suits such heavy taxes will be imposed on the import of Ukrainian products that Ukrainian enterprises will be unable to appear on the market at all. For example, we are selling cast iron today at $105, while EC countries sell it for $150, and in case of a loss Ukraine will be compelled to sell cast iron in Europe at $200. No one would buy it. In other words we will lose the market. [Nikolaychuk] Do the enterprises have adequate funds to pay the fine? [Holubchenko] If they do not have them, they will have to be earned. They must build less and pay lower wages and even smaller pensions. In other words, it will be necessary to economize.
