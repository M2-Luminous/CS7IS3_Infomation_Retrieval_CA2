FBIS4-5885 "dreas073_a_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Corporate Bankruptcies Decrease in 1993 Corporate Bankruptcies Decrease in 1993 OW1504053694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0437 GMT 15 Apr 94 OW1504053694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The number of corporate bankruptcies in Japan fell 2.9 percent in fiscal 1993 for the first dip in four years, despite staying above 14,000 for the second straight year, a private credit research agency reported Friday [15 April]. Corporate failures with liabilities of 10 million yen or more numbered 14,019 in the year ended March 31, while liabilities left by the bankrupt firms slid 10.7 percent to 6.65 trillion yen for the second consecutive yearly fall, Teikoku Databank said. The amount of liabilities was the third largest on record, it said. The record for liabilities was 7.77 trillion yen in fiscal 1991 when the economy was hard hit by a stronger yen. Despite the overall decline in business failures, the number of recession-induced bankruptcies or those going bankrupt due to poor sales climbed 14.6 percent to 8,645, signaling that the economic slump still drags on, the agency said. This type of bankruptcy accounted for 61.7 percent of total failures, up 9.5 percentage points from the previous year, it said. Corporate failures were at high levels throughout the entire year with over 1,000 failures reported each month, during the worst economic slump in decades. The findings come at a time when the economy is showing brighter signs in some sectors and as Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno has declared the worst is over. But Teikoku Databank said Japan is still mired in the prolonged economic slowdown despite signs of recovery in some sectors, and noted that a full-fledged recovery is not expected until 1995, judging from such negative factors as the strong yen and an increase in long-term interest rates. In March, corporate failures fell 4.3 percent from a year earlier to 1,282 cases with liabilities shrinking 40.2 percent to 463.62 billion yen, the agency said. March was the second consecutive month in which business failures fell from the year-earlier level, but it was the first time in three months they have risen above 1,200, it said. In the latest reporting month, the number of recession-induced failures dropped 5.8 percent from a year earlier, but their share of total bankruptcies exceeded 60 percent for the eighth month in a row. Such bankruptcies totaled 789 cases, compared with 838 cases a year earlier.
