The parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, told the Lok Sabha that India's policy is consistent that the treaty should be universal and nondiscriminatory. He was responding when several opposition leaders demanded that the government should make its position clear in view of the reported U.S. pressure for convening a regional conference on the issue. Raising the matter during zero hour, Mr. Chandrajit Yadav, Janata Dal, said the government should not agree to anything which will stop the research and development work for peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
