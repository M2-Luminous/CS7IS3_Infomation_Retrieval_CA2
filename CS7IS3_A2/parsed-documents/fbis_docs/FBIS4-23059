Parfenov, Joint Institute of Nuclear Research, Dubna; UDC 621.374.387] [Abstract] An input register module in the FASTBUS standard has been developed for recording coordinates in a multichannel hodoscope and their subsequent transfer into a buffer memory, this 2x32-bit F65588 device being much faster and ``deeper'' than the existing F6585 4-bit shift register. The module built with K500 series microcircuits includes two differential receivers, two input registers, and two sequentially operating memories. The first register stores the leading edge of clock signal pulses and then transfers it to the W[.sub]e[/]memory, whereupon the second register stores the trailing edge of clock signal pulses and then transfers it to the C[.sub]s[/] memory. In this way the recording speed is doubled and the resolving time is halved. Both memories operate in the mode of data storing with the W[.sub]e[/] and C[.sub]s[/] recording signals put in the constant resolving state by means of a reset signal coming from the front panel. Addressation is done in Gray codes by two corresponding binary counters, with subsequent recoding by means of exclusive OR logic and with a register on the output side which eliminates the possibility of data being sent to the wrong address during a change of address. A trigger signal indicates when an event takes place. The module includes also two delay counters, a remarkable feature thus being the possibility of presetting the time delay between that trigger signal and the beginning of data recording. In this way data can be recorded both before and after the trigger signal, which makes it possible to also record the ``history'' preceding an event. Readout of data from the FASTBUS trunk is effected by means of a 2x4 decoder with one input and four outputs, both memories having been partitioned into two segments each and a CSRO register generating an FB reset signal which is then combined in the OR mode with the reset signal from the front panel. Multiplexing of output signals is done by combining the respective memory outputs in the inclusive OR mode and by using the control inputs of the C[.sub]s[/] memory, to which resolving signals are sent by the decoder. The author thanks A.G. Litvinenko for helpful discussions and for evaluating the necessary parameters, also V.I. Maksimenkova and D.P. Mikhalev for assisting in assembly and adjustments of the module. Figures 2; references 2.
