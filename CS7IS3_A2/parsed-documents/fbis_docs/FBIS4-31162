Currently, he can only count on the weak Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms. And it is becoming increasingly clear that his rapport with the party makes no sense. A divorce before the elections is possible. So far, Walesa's attempts to win the favors of "Solidarity" have come to nothing. The president blocked popiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative pay] but the trade union did not agree. And it may never. There are both enthusiastic supporters and fanatic opponents of Walesa in "Solidarity." The former are blocking the latter's measures, and so far -- successfully. So what is the president counting on? Most probably, he is counting primarily on television. Through television, he wants to reach out to society ... over the heads of politicians. So he is fighting like a lion for access to television. Competitors Are Waiting Walesa's most serious competitors -- Aleksander Kwasniewski with 16 percent and Waldemar Pawlak with 9 percent -- have so far not submitted their candidacies. They will definitely try to postpone the decision until the last moment. By declaring their participation in the race, they will initiate a war with the Belveder. The war will paralyze the government's routine proceedings, so the later it begins, the better. Being front-page politicians, Kwasniewski and Pawlak do not have to rush things. They are popular, and they have strong party structures to back them. Could they give up trying to win the presidency for themselves? Yes, they could. There are more candidates waiting in the back room: In the Democratic Left Alliance, it is Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy (3 percent), while in the Polish Peasant Party -- Deputy Sejm Speaker Jozef Zych. Party Primaries Among post-"Solidarity" parties, the slogan of having just one candidate of the post-1980 August Poland is popular. But so far, not much has happened -- it remains just a slogan. "Primaries" are taking place in the parties and coalitions. Only the Alliance for Poland (Christian-National Union, Center Accord, Peasant Accord, Movement for the Republic, Conservative Coalition) has come up with a candidate. It is Supreme Court Chief Justice Professor Adam Strzembosz (4 percent). In the Freedom Union [UW], two names appear most often: Leszek Balcerowicz (4 percent) and Jacek Kuron (4 percent). Each man has different ideas for reforms. By choosing one of them, UW members will choose the party's image. If they decide in favor of Balcerowicz, then UW will become a party of "friends of the market" while if they choose Kuron, then UW will become a party of "friends of the people." It is a choice which a large part of UW members wants to avoid making. Balcerowicz is "too liberal" while Kuron is "too social democratic" for them. So it cannot be ruled out that it will be... Hanna Suchocka again. It could also be Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Bronislaw Komorowski, or Andrzej Zoll. Whose Names Does "Solidarity" Whisper? "Solidarity" is also talking about some candidates. The names of Zbigniew Romaszewski and Jan Olszewski are being mentioned. Both of them have been involved in establishing a "Solidarity"-type political party. Their campaign could help promote such a party. But Marian Krzaklewski, the trade union's chairman, is not among enthusiasts of such a party. He is strong enough to successfully block both candidacies. Will he submit his own candidacy?
