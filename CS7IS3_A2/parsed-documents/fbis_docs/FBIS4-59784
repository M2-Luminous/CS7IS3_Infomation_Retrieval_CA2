He affirmed that war never resolves any issue in the world. In exclusive statements to Samir Rajab, chief editor of MAYU newspaper, the president said war ends unity and does not protect it. The Yemeni people are the ones paying the price with their own blood and their vital institutions that are being destroyed by the battles and wars. War has never resolved any issue in the world, even when one party triumphs over another. The president added that he has repeatedly advised Yemeni leaders not to resort to military force. The basis for resolving any problem should always be dialogue.
