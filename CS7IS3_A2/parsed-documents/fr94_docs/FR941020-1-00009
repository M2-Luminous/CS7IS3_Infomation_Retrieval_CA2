FR941020-1-00009 FR941020-1-00002 Currently, regulations at 7 CFR 273.8(c) describe both liquid and non-liquid resources that are counted when determining a household's eligibility for food stamps. Non-liquid resources such as land, buildings, and licensed and unlicensed vehicles, with some exceptions, are included as resources because they can be converted to cash. However, not all property can be easily sold, and this has posed significant problems for both State agencies administering the Food Stamp Program and households applying for benefits. Except for the provisions regarding vehicles, current regulations focus on the accessibility/inaccessibility of resources. In establishing inaccessibility, State agencies are compelled to require a household to verify that the property it owns, which is not otherwise an exempt resource, has little or no fair market value; cannot be sold because it is jointly owned with non-household members who are unwilling to sell; or is otherwise inaccessible. In many instances, households have found it difficult to provide this verification. Further, in establishing accessibility/inaccessibility, State agencies may be faced with questions of state property law and probate law. The situation was particularly difficult with heir property, i.e., an undivided fractional interest in a decedent's property. It is apparent that the treatment of heir property was the primary problem Congress was addressing when it passed Section 1719 of the Leland Act, as the legislative history contained in House Report No. 101&hyph;569, 101st Congress, 2nd Session, Part 1, at 429&hyph;30, specifically refers to the problems of heir property encountered by food stamp applicants and State agencies. Section 1719 of the Leland Act required the Department to promulgate regulations requiring State agencies to develop standards for identifying kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, a household is unlikely to be able to sell for any significant return because the household's interest is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's interest would be relatively great. Resources so identified were to be excluded as inaccessible resources for food stamp purposes. Our Earlier Proposal and Comments In order to implement Section 1719, the Department proposed an amendment to 7 CFR 273.8(e) that would have excluded as a resource property that a household could not sell for any significant return because the household's interest was relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's interest would have been greater than the value of the property. The proposed rule provided that a property would be excluded as a resource if it could not be sold for more than $2,000 and the cost of selling the property exceeded 75 percent of the expected sale price. State agencies would have been required to establish standards for identifying the costs likely to be associated with the sale of various types of property and the likely gross value of such property as a guide for recipients and eligibility workers to follow in determining if the property was accessible as a resource. The August 13, 1991 proposed rulemaking generated twenty comments. The general consensus of the comments was that the proposed rule violated the intent of Congress by imposing criteria that a property is considered an inaccessible resource if it could not be sold for more than $2,000 and the cost of selling the property exceeded 75 percent of the expected sale price. However, the Department found there was no consensus among the commenters on how to amend the proposed rule to determine what types of property should be excluded. For example, one commenter suggested amending the proposed rule to say that the property be considered inaccessible if it cannot be sold for $2000 or more or the cost of selling the property is at least 75 percent or more of the sale price. Another commenter recommended the definition of inaccessible property be changed to include the following criteria: (1) It is jointly owned by non- household and household members; (2) It cannot be converted to cash without the consent of all parties; and (3) It cannot be converted to cash because all parties do not agree to sell or all parties cannot be contacted to consult. A third commenter suggested the final rule exclude property which is either heavily mortgaged (such as over 75 percent of its value) or owned by more than two people and exclude property where for whatever reason net proceeds after paying all expenses (including co-owners and liens) in selling the property would be less than $2000. 1991 Technical Amendment In December 1991, Section 904 of the 1991 Technical Amendments amended Section 5(g)(5) of the Food Stamp Act by adding to the end of this paragraph the following new sentences: A resource shall be so identified [as inaccessible] if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. The Secretary shall not require the State agency to require verification of the value of a resource to be excluded under this paragraph unless the State agency determines that the information provided by the household is questionable. The Current Proposal The Department has carefully considered Section 1719 of the Leland Act, the Congressional intent evidenced in House Report No. 101&hyph;529, 101st Congress, 2nd Session, part 1, the comments regarding the August 13, 1991 proposed rule, and the language in Section 904 of the 1991 Technical Amendments. As a result, this proposed rulemaking is significantly different from the Department's previous proposed rule on this subject.
