FBIS4-7970 "dreeu068_y_94007" FBIS-EEU-94-068 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Kosovo Albania Reportedly Training Kosovo Separatists Albania Reportedly Training Kosovo Separatists LD0504192594 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1855 GMT 5 Apr 94 LD0504192594 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Pristina, Yugoslavia, April 5 (TANJUG) -- The public prosecutor in Pristina has ordered an investigation of six ethnic Albanians suspected of plotting to set up an ethnic Albanian paramilitary force in Serbia's province of Kosovo-Metohija in order to detach it from Serbia and its parent Yugoslavia and annex it to neighbouring Albania. The suspects -- Fehmi Lestrani, 21, Skelzen Bajrami, 21, Nexhmedinpsadriju, 31, Luan Heta, 23, Beqir Muleci, 38, and Isni Franc -- are all in investigative detention. In the course of 1992 and 1993, the group is suspected of having undergone military training in Albania under the orders of the self- proclaimed government of "the republic of Kosovo." The training included instruction in the use of all sorts of small arms, armoured personnel carriers, tanks and explosive devices and in sabotage. Many ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] have been trained by Albanian army officers near Elbasan in Albania. A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in Kosovo-Metohija whose population is mostly ethnic Albanian. The separatists allege human and minority rights violations in an effort to justify their struggle for separation. The Yugoslav police has irrefutable proof that dozens of ethnic Albanians from the province have undergone military training in Albania, but fears that many more have gone undetected. In mid-1992, eight ethnic Albanians received prison terms for smuggling into Kosovo-Metohija 74 automatic rifles, 14,000 rounds of ammunition and other military equipment from their training camp near Tirana. This and the latest case show that ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav republics are being trained in several camps in Albania, that the practice has been going on for years and that such activities have been intensified of late. Ethnic Albanian separatist leaders have recentty decided to form a 40,000-strong paramilitary force, to help them in their unlawful efforts to set up their own bodies of power throughout the province. A number of officials of the self-proclaimed defence ministry of "the republic of Kosovo" are soon to stand trial in Pristina. "Defence Minister" Hajzer Hajzeraj and his lieutenants in Pristina, Podujevo and Lipljan were directly subordinated to Anton Kolaj, vice-president of the leading ethnic Albanian party -- the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo -- who has fled the province when the circle around him began to tighten.
