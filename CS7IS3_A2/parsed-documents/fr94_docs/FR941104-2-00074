FR941104-2-00074 FR941104-2-00042 [Finance Docket No. 32557] Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, Southeast Kansas Railroad Company, and South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad Company_Joint Relocation Project Exemption_in Kansas and Oklahoma Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP), Southeast Kansas Railroad Company (SEKR), and South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad Company (SKOL) jointly filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate lines of railroad. The joint project involves 68.1 miles of SKOL's line and involves: (1) SKOL's granting trackage rights to MP and SEKR over SKOL's line (a) between milepost 155.8 at Cherryvale, KS, to milepost 165.7 at Independence, KS, and between milepost 0.0 at Independence, KS, to milepost 37.6 at D.Y. Junction (Dewey), OK, a total distance of 47.5 miles (the Tulsa Subdivision); and (b) between milepost 16.9 at Coffeyville, KS, and milepost 0.0 at Cherryvale, KS, in Montgomery County, KS, a total distance of 16.9 miles (the Coffeyville Subdivision); (2) SKOL's granting MP trackage rights over SKOL's line between milepost 37.6 at D.Y. Junction, OK, to milepost 41.3 at Bartlesville, OK, a distance of 3.7 miles (SEKR holds rights over this trackage based on an assignment from MP at the time SEKR leased the Bartlesville Subdivision); and (3) MP's incidental abandonment and discontinuance of operations and SEKR's incidental discontinuance of lease operations over the line beginning at milepost 171.0 near South Coffeyville, OK, and ending at milepost 191.15 near Dewey, a distance of approximately 20.15 miles in Nowata and Washington Counties, OK. The transaction was to have been consummated on, or soon as possible after, October 12, 1994. MP is a class I rail carrier. SEKR and SKOL are class III carriers. SEKR operates a line of railroad known as the Bartlesville Subdivision from milepost 171.0 at South Coffeyville, OK, to milepost 200.0 near Bartlesville, OK. SEKR has not conducted train service over the segment of line between mileposts 171.0 and 191.15 (near Dewey, OK) for more than two years. SEKR uses haulage via SKOL to move its cars from Coffeyville to Dewey or Bartlesville and the cars are then interchanged to an SEKR crew for placement to SEKR customers in Dewey or Bartlesville. SKOL will grant trackage rights to SEKR and MP between Coffeyville, KS, and Dewey so that SEKR and MP can provide service to Dewey. SKOL's grant of these trackage rights will permit SEKR to discontinue its lease operation and MP to abandon and discontinue its operation on the out of service trackage from mileposts 171.0 to 191.15. The joint relocation project involving MP's and SEKR'S rail operations will result in an alternate and satisfactory continuation of rail service to customers. There will be no new traffic generated by the proposed transaction, there will be no extension of rail service into new territory, and there will be no adverse effect on shippers. In addition, there will be no change in the competitive situation of the rail carriers in the area. The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment and/or discontinuance component of a relocation project only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. See, generally, Denver & R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation over BN, 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). Under these standards, the abandonment and discontinuance under consideration here is not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission has determined that line relocations embrace trackage rights transactions such as the ones proposed here. See D.T. & I.R._Trackage Rights, 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected by the conditions set forth in Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Jeanna L. Regier, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, NE 68179, and Karl Morell, Ball, Janik & Novack, 1101 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20004. Decided: October 27, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
