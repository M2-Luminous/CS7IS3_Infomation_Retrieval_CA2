[passage omitted] Let us now join on the ground the only, or one of the very last European journalists there, Laurent Boussie. Laurent, can you hear me? [Boussie] Yes, absolutely, Daniel. [Bilalian] Laurent, we have heard that this morning the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebel forces launched a major offensive on the capital, as if they wanted to be ahead of France or any foreign action. [Boussie] Listen, Daniel, according to the information given to us by the UN officials, this is the largest offensive ever against the capital. This offensive woke us at 0300 with very intense shelling from RPF positions onto government ones. A bit later, around 0500-0530, there was infantry shelling in addition to artillery shelling. Machine guns could be heard [words indistinct] and shells continued falling uninterrupted. This offensive lasted until almost noon today, which means that this is an extremely significant offensive, with a lot of firing, with a lot of ammunition used. For about 30 minutes now, it seems that a certain calm has prevailed: The noise and smoke have slightly subsided, there is a bit less artillery firing and, according to the latest news, which is reported to have been gathered -- reported only, because I have not seen this for myself, obviously, I am not directly on the front line right now, but according to the latest news -- the RPF, that is, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, is reported to have gained ground. [Bilalian] As the possible French intervention in Rwanda is drawing closer -- this is still on the cards -- it has been said that those francophone African forces with the United Nations -- that is, the Senegalese, the Togolese, the Congolese -- have received threats from the rebels and that these contingents want to leave. Have they left this morning? [Boussie] Listen, they wanted to leave yesterday. This morning, the Senegalese and the Togolese left -- or rather, they got into trucks and buses. They started to drive off and they are reported to have been -- reported only -- stopped outside the town. They are reported to have been searched, they are even reported to have had some of their belongings taken away. They are reported to have then been able to leave and to drive on but I have no more news for the time being. What is certain is the fact that the francophone contingents have left the UN headquarters here, in Kigali. [Bilalian] When we listen to you, we get the impression that anyone who is francophone -- whether they are troops, journalists, or diplomats in Rwanda -- is now in danger. Are you stuck yourself, Laurent? [Boussie] Listen. For the time being, we -- myself and the France 2 team, that is, Jean-Marie Lemaire and Gerard Flegeot -- are inside the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] command post, that is, the UN command post. We can go out from time to time, but we are very careful: When we want to cross the front line, we leave with UN cars and I must say that, sometimes, we are quite frightened in town.
