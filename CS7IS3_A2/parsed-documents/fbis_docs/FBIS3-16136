Just before leaving, President Mircea Snegur made the following statement to the correspondents: [Begin Snegur recording] This visit to Belgium is part of our foreign political activity, belonging among the events scheduled to take place in 1994. Its main goal is to sign the Partnership for Peace plan, since that partnership ensures security and stability in Europe within the new circumstances that emerged after the collapse of the socialist bloc and the Soviet Union. Moldova is a small and peaceful country that does not represent any danger whatsoever for anyone. Moreover, as you may know, the people have decided [in the 6 March public opinion poll] that we should promote a policy of neutrality; therefore, we need certain guarantees, and such guarantees are offered to us by Partnership for Peace. In the same context, a meeting is scheduled to take place at the headquarters of the Western European Union [WEU] to discuss the same issues of security and cooperation in Europe. We consider our meeting at the European Union headquarters as very important because we want to conclude a partnership and cooperation accord with that economic union. Negotiations will be initiated as soon as possible; thus, it is necessary to pay a visit to the European Union. Finally, we will approach aspects of our bilateral relations with Belgium because we need to discuss the bilateral documents that are being prepared for signing. Thus, my three-day visit will actually consist of a one-day visit to Belgium, another day will be consecrated to NATO in view of the Partnership for Peace plan, and the third one to my talks at the European Union.
