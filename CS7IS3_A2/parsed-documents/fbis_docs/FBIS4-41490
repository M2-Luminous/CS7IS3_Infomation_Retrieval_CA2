It insisted on holding parliamentary and presidential elections as specified by the constitution. In its statement made public in the Duma Friday the group said that its members could not agree with the proposal made by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. The statement said that Russia's Choice was giving priority to legality and morality over political expediency. It cast doubt on the desirability of what Shumeyko had proposed. The Russia's Choice group considers that instead of consolidating political stability it would destroy the weak saplings of civic accord, trust between political groupings and respect for the law that had emerged in Russian society recently. The group is not convinced by Shumeyko's argument that the extension of the terms would save much funds. It states that society had paid dearly for every short cut of democratic procedures. What is more, it would be members of parliament who would make a decision on extending their own terms, which would place them in a delicate moral position.
