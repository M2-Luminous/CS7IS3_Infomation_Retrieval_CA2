Gulf states will pay the remaining sums, provided that $500 million worth of Russian military equipment is purchased and paid for in cash. A source close to the premiership office told AL-HAYAH that an agreement to this effect was reached during the recent visit to Damascus by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister and head of the military-industrial complex in Russia. AL-HAYAH has learned that the agreement, whose details have not been revealed, stipulates Russia's agreement to write off 80-90 percent of the debts accumulating from previous contracts with the Soviet Union and then Russia. These debts are estimated at more than $10 billion. Two Gulf states are expected to pay the remaining sum, which it is believed will be transferred to the Central Bank of Russia, which will finance the purchase of Syrian commodities to be exported to Russia as a means of paying the debts. It has also been learned that the agreement provides for the purchase of military equipment worth $500 million to be paid to Russia in cash. Moscow considered this step "a new chapter" in relations between the two countries. Details of the military agreement have not been revealed. However, it is understood that Moscow "took account" of concerns conveyed to President Boris Yeltsin by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who urged the Russians not to sell to Damascus aircraft the Israelis regard as "a disruption of the security balance." It is also understood that the Russians pledged not to implement previous contracts, especially with regard to exporting spare parts for weapons the former Soviet Union had supplied to the Syrians. A Russian expert familiar with details of the agreement stressed that it could cause "embarrassment" for Moscow when dealing with other indebted countries. He mentioned in particular Iraq, Libya, and Yemen. He said that these countries could demand a similar treatment and the writing off of part of their debts, which he estimated at about $20 billion.
