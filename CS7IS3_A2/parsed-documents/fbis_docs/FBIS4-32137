Sugarev justified himself, casting the blame on the group, which in his view was committing suicide. In a shocking interview given to a Sofia newspaper, Svobodka Stefanova made defamatory statements against Stefan Savov, Georgi Petrov, Mikhail Nedelchev, and Vesela Rasheeva, accusing them of plotting to discredit others and making offensive generalizations about their past and standard of education. Edvin Sugarev emotionally defended her. This prompted Petrov and Rasheeva yesterday to demand the expulsion of Stefanova and Sugarev from the SDS parliamentary group. In the lobbies of parliament, Stefan Savov asked Georgi Petrov to withdraw his own resignation. However, the issue did not come to a vote at the meeting. Aleksandur Yordanov appealed for personal disputes to be settled, even by expulsion if necessary. According to Rasheeva, the SDS will not disintegrate just now, but the sharp decline in its image makes it pointless to "stand together." SDS Deputy Romil Popov declared that it was high time for Filip Dimitrov to resign. He angrily stated that Dimitrov was to blame for everything. He allowed people like Ludzhev and Michkovski to leave the coalition, handed over the power held by the SDS without the parliamentary group deciding to do this, provoked splits in the SDS member parties, and even permitted his own cronies like Vasil Mikhaylov and Edvin Sugarev to spread slanders. Popov said that for a year now he had been campaigning to remove Filip Dimitrov from the SDS leadership. He claimed that two-thirds of the SDS deputies agreed with him, including Zlatka Ruseva, Vesela Rasheeva, and most of the deputies from the United Christian Democratic Center, the RDP [Radical Democratic Party], and the DP [Democratic Party]. The SDS parliamentary group does not have the powers to decide on my resignation, F. Dimitrov explained with a smile. Under the SDS regulations, Dimitrov said, he can only be removed from his post if five of the SDS member parties raise the issue in the National Coordinating Council and 10 of the 15 parties then vote against the incumbent leader. If it so decides, the SDS parliamentary group can only decide to remove certain deputies from its ranks, but this does not affect their powers in the National Coordinating Council.
