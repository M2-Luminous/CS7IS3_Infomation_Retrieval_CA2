The conference participants described the current situation in the defense sector as critical. Not only has the slump in the production of both military and civilian output not been halted but, on the contrary, it is snowballing. While it was 34.3 percent in January 1994 compared with the corresponding month last year at constant prices, it was 48.7 percent in April. In April the rate of decrease of production in the civilian sector (49.1 percent) exceeded the fall in military production (47.6 percent) for the first time. The wave of stoppages at enterprises and production facilities is swelling. Ten of the sector's 176 enterprises have stopped work completely and 123 are working an incomplete working day or week, and 284,000 people are on enforced leave. The low level of wages (30,000-40,000 rubles at a number of enterprises), delays in paying them, the massive nature of job cuts, and the destruction of enterprises' social sphere are causing dissatisfaction and an increase in tension in labor collectives. The conference demanded that legal action be taken against officials of state administration organs for the long delays in paying for products manufactured under state orders and consequently for the late payment of wages to defense enterprises' workers. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported on the sector trade union's picketing of the Russian Government building and on defense sector working people's rallies accompanied by a 10-15-minute stoppage of the production of civilian output, which were held in April-June. The defense industry trade union is now deciding the question of holding a one-day strike accompanied by economic and political demands.
