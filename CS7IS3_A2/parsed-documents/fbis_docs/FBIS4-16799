Former officer of the Main Intelligence Department of the General Staff (Russian abbreviation GRU), Vladimir Rezun, defected from Geneva to Great Britain in 1978 after four years of work in Geneva as a fixed-post espionage officer. At present, 47-years-old Rezun lives in a military base in Great Britain under protection and teaches in a military educational establishment. As he repeatedly said, Rezun was sentenced to death in the Soviet Union after his defection. Rezun has written seven books. The Ice-Breaker which he signed as Viktor Suvorov is the most popular. In the book, Rezun based on open Soviet publications to prove that "the Soviet Union was the main culprit and the main instigator of the World War II" and that "the Communists unleashed the war in Europe by the hands of Hitler in the 30s and were preparing a swift strike against Hitler himself to seize the Europe he had destroyed." The Ice-Breaker was published in many countries. In 1992 more than 300,000 copies were printed in Russia. Rezun gave a news conference in Moscow on April 13 when he answered journalists' questions over the telephone from Britain.
