It has never had the ambition to interfere in its internal affairs. This was stated by SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik in response to the statement issued by SDSS Deputy Chairman Jozef Hruby. Ftacnik said that there did not exist a single SDL document or working paper that would talk about a merger with the SDSS. On the other hand, in the document entitled "Draft Concept of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Course of Action in the Preelection Period in the Foreign Policy Sphere," it is stated on page 7, under item 6.5: "Can a merger of the HZDS with the Social Democratic Party be considered in the future?" SDSS Deputy Chairman Jozef Hruby should therefore turn his attention in another direction, Milan Ftacnik noted. The SDL statement goes on to say: "We know that the left-wing coalition of the SDL, the SDSS, the Farmers Movement, and the Green Party in Slovakia [SZS] is a thorn in the flesh of certain circles in the HZDS, which has found itself in international political isolation and remains without a clear-cut profile. The question arises whether this voice from within the SDSS is not all too reminiscent of the departure of a small group from the SZS, which had also rejected a democratically drafted and approved coalition agreement in the name of the preservation of the party's authenticity and objections to the SDL and started to establish a new party and simultaneously send out signals to the HZDS. The game of breaking up the [HZDS's] most serious political and electoral competitor, the Left Choice coalition, apparently continues. It bears testimony to the nervousness and lack of self-confidence of those who organize it from behind the scenes.
