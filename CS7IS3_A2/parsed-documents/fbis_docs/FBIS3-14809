He lives in a modern apartment block constructed in the typical style of the homes of the former Soviet nomenklatura -- a fenced garden, porter's desk, immaculate entrance lobby, and four elevators. It is the same block where I came to interview Leonid Brezhnev's grandson some months ago. The former parliamentary speaker's apartment seemed even larger and more comfortable than that occupied by Brezhnev's grandson -- a labyrinth of rooms, mahogany and oak "empire" style furniture, paintings by well-known artists on the walls, and soft carpets. The man who opened the door for us wore no shoes, only socks. As soon as we entered, CORRIERE DELLA SERA's Paolo Valentini and I followed suit and removed our shoes, as is usual in Russian homes, in order to avoid dirtying the floor with snow and mud. In stockinged feet, we followed him to the office where Khasbulatov was waiting for us. It was his first morning of freedom. He wore a black shirt, blue jeans, and slippers. He held a big cigar, from which he drew from time to time. He was pale, rather as he was when we interviewed him 4 October with Rutskoy in the White House under the gunfire. But of course he was in a much better mood. He got up from a divan covered with a large bearskin, on which we then sat. He shook hands with us and said: "I wanted to meet with you out of politeness, out of respect for what you did that day." He was referring to the appeal that he issued through us for the Western countries to intervene vis-a-vis the Kremlin to save his life and the lives of others, if they surrendered. "But the Russian newspapers printed a lot of nonsense, as though Rutskoy and I had sought help only in order to escape who knows where." We told him how we conveyed their appeal to the Italian diplomatic service and how it reached the EC foreign ministers at their meeting in Brussels. "This is the first time I have heard about it. The Russian press misled our people. Be that as it may, we came out of parliament alive 4 October not thanks to the help of the European governments but because the commandos of the Alfa and Vympel group sent by Yeltsin to kill us all refused to obey orders. As you know, Alfa and Vympel were dissolved, destroyed as a punishment, a few days ago. [LA REPUBBLICA] Will you tell us how exactly your arrest took place? [Khasbulatov] Two young commanders reached us. We had moved to the room next to that in which we received you for the interview a little earlier, because shots were still reaching that one. They said: "Our group has met and decided not to carry out the order to arrest you and to execute you, Ruslan Imranovich [Khasbulatov], Aleksandr Vladimirovich [Rutskoy], whom we greatly respect, and all the others here. We are officers, we have a heart, we reason with our own brains, we love our homeland, and we know that you are defending a just cause -- the constitution. If you trust us, follow us, leave here with us, and we will protect you from those people. We will guarantee your safety, even if they attack us." We did trust them, and all went well. [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you feel now, after five months in prison? [Khasbulatov] After 144 days, to be exact. Well, the air of freedom is always better, it is a great help. Now I want to finish writing my book on economics, then I will think about a book about what happened in October. The book about the 1991 coup has been translated in several countries, including Italy. I would like a publisher who pays well... [LA REPUBBLICA] You do not intend to be just a writer, do you? [Khasbulatov] I must think about it. [LA REPUBBLICA] Don't you want to return to politics? [Khasbulatov] In the past three years it has become difficult to find political interlocutors who are really worthy from the viewpoint of integrity. Those with whom I have had dealings behaved like petty criminals, always prepared to break their word. Petty tricksters who adopt the guise of great politicians. They disgust me. I do not know when a new leadership class will emerge. Be that as it may, I am an economics teacher, a respected and well-known academic. I will write books, return to my students. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that Russian democracy is in danger? [Khasbulatov] Unfortunately democracy in Russia has taken a great step backward. Until 21 September (the day Yeltsin dissolved parliament -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) there was a democratic system, a democratic constitution, better chances of emerging from the economic crisis. Now there is an authoritarian system. Ask the Western leaders whether they are pleased with the result. I would like you to convey my question to Mr. Kohl, Mr. Major, Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Clinton: Are they pleased with what they have done to Russia? They have helped Yeltsin to become a dictator with no limits or controls, they have driven the country to the brink of destruction. For our people there is no longer any democracy or freedom: Are people in the West happy about this? [LA REPUBBLICA] Yeltsin and the government are espousing many of your positions in economic policy, in foreign policy... [Khasbulatov] All they can do is repeat my words. They cannot act. At least they have realized something, despite their lack of intelligence: They have realized that parliament and I were right. Now they are saying what the people want to hear, but I have my doubts about whether they are capable of acting. If they do something, they do so clumsily, unprofessionally. This irritates both the Russian people and the world community. [LA REPUBBLICA] What is your opinion of this Duma, the new parliament? [Khasbulatov] It is too early to issue a final assessment. After all, it has only been working for little over a month. For the present, I am grateful to the deputies who, by approving the amnesty, respected the voters' wishes: None of them could have been elected if he had not pledged to struggle to restore some justice. [LA REPUBBLICA] Was the amnesty a surprise for you? [Khasbulatov] No, because I know the Russian people and their ability to bring pressure to bear. We owe our freedom entirely to the people. There has been talk about my release for weeks now. In any case there was no evidence; all their attempts to fabricate it were in vain. Their story no longer stood up. They were obliged to release me and Rutskoy. Parliament and I did not take a single illegitimate step, but they wanted to blame us for certain mistakes, the street incidents, and the actions of the armed gangs, which acted autonomously. I never ordered the television station to be attacked. [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you consult with Rutskoy before deciding whether to accept the amnesty? [Khasbulatov] No, we were always totally isolated in prison. But I would remind you that to accept an amnesty does not entail acknowledging your guilt. [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you ever hit or maltreated from the day of your arrest until your release? [Khasbulatov] Never. Everyone always treated me with respect. I will tell you a story in this regard. It was the commandos of the Alfa group that brought us to prison in a bus. Perhaps somebody did think that I was public enemy number one, because Kortsakov, the head of Yeltsin's personal bodyguard, was in the bus too, and there were two armored cars behind. The young commandos were forbidden to speak, so as they entered the bus, one by one, each of them placed a hand on my arm and squeezed it as a sign of solidarity. [LA REPUBBLICA] How did you spend your time in prison? [Khasbulatov] I had a lot of time to reflect. I read a great deal. Books on philosophy. And novels -- all of Dreyser's, Sue's "The Mysteries of Paris," and Prosper Merimee. [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you never depressed? [Khasbulatov] Never. In my heart I always believed that this is how things would turn out. I never lost hope. [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you speak with Rutskoy Saturday evening [26 February], after your release? [Khasbulatov] I phoned him at home but he was already asleep. [LA REPUBBLICA] What time did you go to bed? [Khasbulatov] At 0500 this morning. My desk was covered in mail and documents. I spent the night sorting them out. [LA REPUBBLICA] Did your wife experience any problems during this period? [Khasbulatov] She received telephone calls telling her that she had to leave this apartment. It is said that Yeltsin has created a new system. It is not true: He uses the same communist methods from before. [LA REPUBBLICA] You used to be great friends with Boris Yeltsin. How did you become arch enemies? [Khasbulatov] I would not say that we were great friends. It would take a book to answer your question. We will talk about it again next time. [LA REPUBBLICA] But if you could say something about Yeltsin now... [Khasbulatov] I will not say anything. As far as I am concerned, he no longer exists. I regard him neither as a political leader nor as president; this man no longer exists; he is neither dead nor alive. As far as I am concerned, he is finished. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that Russia shares your opinion and that Yeltsin will not remain in power long? [Khasbulatov] Yes, I am absolutely sure. [LA REPUBBLICA] Ruslan Imranovich, pardon me for asking: Why do you always wear a black shirt? Were you wearing one when you were arrested? [Khasbulatov] No. In parliament I wore a white shirt. But after two weeks of being without water and unable to wash, it became black. This one really is black, though. I put it on precisely in order to recall 4 October.
