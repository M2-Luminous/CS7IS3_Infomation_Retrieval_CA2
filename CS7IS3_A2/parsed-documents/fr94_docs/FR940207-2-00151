FR940207-2-00151 FR940207-2-00073 (2) Operation of the Original Options Exercise Settlement Agreements After OCC entered into the Original Agreements with the CCCs, OCC began to settle the great majority of equity option exercises through the facilities of the CCCs. 8 Each clearing member was required to designate a CCC as its designated clearing corporation (``DCC'') for purposes of effecting settlements of exercises of equity options. Rather than delivering an underlying security broker-to-broker, in the revised system a delivering clearing member delivers the security to and receives payment of the exercise settlement amount from its DCC. A receiving clearing member makes payment to and receives the security from its DCC. If the delivering clearing member and the receiving clearing member have designated the same CCC as their DCCs, all deliveries and receipts of securities and all payments and receipts of settlement monies will take place at that DCC in accordance with its settlement procedures. If the delivering clearing member and receiving clearing member have designated different CCCs as their respective DCCs, the DCC for the delivering clearing member delivers the security to and receives payment from the DCC for the receiving clearing member in accordance with the interface arrangements between the two DCCs. 8 OCC first executed Options Exercise Settlement Agreements with each of Stock Clearing Corporation (NSCC 's predecessor), SCCP, and MCC in 1976. The Original Agreements provide for a five-day settlement period for settlement of exercises of equity options. The date of the exercise and the settlement period are analogous to the trade date (``T'') and settlement period for ordinary, regular-way stock trades. OCC reports the exercises and assignments of clearing members to their respective DCCs during the night of T. The DCCs effect settlement on the fifth business day after T (``T+5''). 9 9 Consistent with the recently approved Commission Rule 15c6&hyph;1 under the Act that, effective June 1, 1995, will shorten from five business days to three business days the standard settlement time frame for most broker-dealer trades, the settlement period for settlement of exercises of equity options will be shortened to three business days. If the parties to the Second Restated Agreement determine that the agreement needs to be amended to accommodate a three business day settlement cycle of equity option exercises, the CCCs and OCC will file the necessary proposed rule changes with the Commission. Telephone conversation between James C. Yong, Deputy General Counsel, OCC, and Jerry W. Carpenter, Branch Chief, and Peter R. Geraghty, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission (December 29, 1993). For a detailed description and discussion of Rule 15c6&hyph;1, refer to Securities and Exchange Commission Release Nos. 33&hyph;7022; 34&hyph;33023; IC&hyph;19768; (October 13, 1993), 58 FR 52891 [File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;93] (order adopting Rule 15c6&hyph;1). B. Changes Made by the Second Restated Agreements The Second Restated Agreements alter and supplement the provisions of the Original Agreements in several ways. The most important modifications are set forth below. (1) Timing of the Effectiveness of the Guarantees of the Correspondent Clearing Corporations Section 4 of each Original Agreement provides that if the CCC does not notify OCC prior to 12 Noon Central Time (1 p.m. Eastern Time) on T+4 that the CCC has ceased to act for an OCC clearing member which had designated the CCC as its DCC, the CCC is unconditionally obligated as of that time to complete the settlement of the exercise. These provisions were in accordance with the provisions of the rules of the CCCs as in effect in 1976. However, each CCC has subsequently amended its rules to provide that the CCC will be unconditionally obligated to complete settlement of any ``locked-in'' trade 10 in any security eligible for settlement through the CCC's continuous net settlement system. The CCC's guarantees commence at midnight, or in the case of MCC at 11:59 p.m., of the day the trade is reported to the CCC's participants, which is usually T+1. 10 Locked-in trades are trades executed through automated order routing and trade execution systems. Each of the Second Restated Agreements provides that exercises and assignments of options reported by OCC to the CCC will be deemed to be locked-in trades. Section 4(a) of each Second Restated Agreement provides that the CCC will become unconditionally obligated to effect settlement or to close out each exercise and assignment of equity options overlying CNS Securities commencing at the time specified by the CCC 's rules applicable to locked-in trades in securities eligible for settlement through the CCC's continuous net settlement system. This revised provision has the effect of causing options exercises and assignments reported by OCC to the CCCs during the night of T to become guaranteed as of the time at which the CCCs generally become obligated to effect settlement (i.e., usually midnight at the end of T+1. 11 OCC Rule 913 is amended to state expressly that OCC's direct guarantee to the clearing member acting on behalf of the holder of the option terminates at the time that the clearing member's DCC becomes unconditionally obligated to effect settlement of the transaction. 12 11 The trade guarantee rules of the CCCs described in the text have been approved by the Commission on a temporary basis. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32547 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 26491 [File Nos. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;04, SR&hyph;SCCP&hyph;93&hyph;02, and SR&hyph;MCC&hyph;93&hyph;02] (order granting approval until June 30, 1994). If the Commission should in the future decline to approve these rules, OCC and the CCCs will need to review the question of the point in time at which the CCCs guarantee options exercise settlements, and OCC will need to review its procedures for settling stock option exercises and, in particular, make adjustments to its margin system. 12 Section 4(a) of each First Restated Agreement permitted the CCC to eliminate an exercise transaction from its system in accordance with its rules even after its guarantee had attached to the transaction. Although this could have occurred only in the extremely unlikely event that a security were to cease to be eligible for settlement through the continuous net settlement system of the CCC during the time remaining until actual settlement of the transaction, OCC has concluded that it cannot efficiently develop a margin system that reflects and neutralizes OCC's risk exposure if a CCC's guarantee can be revoked after attaching to an exercise transaction. Accordingly, each Second Restated Agreement provides that the CCC will not eliminate any exercise transaction of options overlying CNS Securities from its system after its guarantee attaches. Section 4(b) of each First Restated Agreement provided that in the event of a default by an entity for which it is the DCC, the CCC voluntarily could determine to complete settlement of transactions with respect to which it had not yet become obligated at the time of the default. OCC has concluded that it cannot efficiently develop a margin system that reflects and neutralizes OCC's risk exposure if the CCCs have the right to make this voluntary determination. Accordingly, each Second Restated Agreement expressly provides that the CCC will not effect settlement of transactions which have been reported to it but to which it has not yet become obligated at the time of the default.
