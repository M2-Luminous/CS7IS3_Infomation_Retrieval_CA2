Correspondents Michael Enger, Corinna Gutstatt, and Hans-Peter Weymar said in a telefax sent from Diyarbakir on Thursday [24 March] that they were blindfolded and taken from near Lice to Hazro. Film material and personal notes were forcefully taken from them. Their hands were tied behind their backs during several interrogations. They were taken to Diyarbakir and released that evening. The television crew, which wanted to do a program on the Nevruz spring festival last Monday and the municipal elections in Turkey next Sunday, had already been attacked once while they were filming last Sunday. In their telefax, they also say the Turkish Army is continuing its operations against the Kurdish civilian population with undiminished violence. Villages are systematically destroyed and burned, and people are mistreated, killed, and driven out. With the election approaching, violence against international observers is becoming increasingly widespread, the correspondents say. A Finnish observer delegation was also detained for a day.
