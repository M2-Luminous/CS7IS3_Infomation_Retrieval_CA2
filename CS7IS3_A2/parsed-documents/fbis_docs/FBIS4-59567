This is the question that Washington officials are still asking themselves and they are coming up with the same stale reply. To attain its objectives in the region, the United States has to continue to project the Islamic Republic of Iran as the regional bad guy. It has to depict the region as tense, to intimidate the southern shaykhdoms, and to warn them as if they are being threatened by Iran. Therefore, they should rely on the United States to help protect them. To do this it is necessary to launch propaganda regarding Iran's military capability so that the Arabs will allocate more petrodollars to purchase more arms to protect their security. These remarks seem a trifle repetitive, but they are true. However, we are surprised and regret that these same remarks have worked on those on the other side of the Persian Gulf and that the United States continues to milk the regional shaykhs with this repetitive and deceitful propaganda. This propaganda by Washington is continuing, but our question today is: Why don't the Arabs think about their own interests and continue to be duped by this hollow and repetitious propaganda? It is amazing that these Arab shaykhs do not even ask themselves: Who endangered the security of the region? Who instigated Saddam to initiate an eight-year war against Iran? Who has humiliated the Arabs before Israel? Who has made the Persian Gulf waters unsafe? Who plundered the wealth of the Arabs in two Persian Gulf wars? Who has eyes on the wealth and oil of the Arabs today? Who is demanding greater contempt and humiliation for the Arabs against Israel and formulating plans for this purpose? These are questions that are not difficult for the regional shaykhs to answer. However, they do not even seem to have the permission to understand these facts! U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs Robert Pelletreau repeated these U.S. accusations against Iran in the presence of Arab representatives of the mass media in Abu Dhabi, and it seems that no one had the sense to ask Pelletreau to stop these repetitive remarks and say something new that should at least have some elements of reality. A while later, the Arab mass media acted as if it had received fresh grist for its propaganda mills and repeated the same accusations verbatim along with whatever had been dictated to them by the U.S. officials. Thus, they demonstrated that they have no willpower or opinion and do not even realize their own interests. In its latest edition, the 'UKAZ newspaper that is affiliated with the Zionist circles of Saudi Arabia and is directly instructed by the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, resorted to exposing the so-called nuclear program of the Islamic Republic of Iran. To make its allegations appear to be authentic, it presented astoundingly astronomical sums as Iran's nuclear expenditure. It appears that the entire text had been dictated verbatim by the CIA rapporteur at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh. It is regrettable that the regional shaykhs have fallen into this vortex and cannot see these prospects very clearly with their astonished eyes. The fact that the Saudi publications take their orders from the U.S. Embassy is not a source of pride for the Saudis. It is not to their benefit to grovel so much and to show how eager they are to take dictation from the Americans. Perhaps it would have been better to have kept up appearances and have waited awhile before 'UKAZ published Pelletreau's repetitive remarks dictated by the United States. Then it would not have appeared to be so servile.
