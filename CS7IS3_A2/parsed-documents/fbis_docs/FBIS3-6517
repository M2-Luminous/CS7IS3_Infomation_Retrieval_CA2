This process would help gradually eliminate the system of governing ministries, governing administrative levels and the distinction between centrally and locally controlled enterprises. VIETNAM NEWS today quotes a prime minister decision as saying that group of enterprises will be established on a trial basis in Ho Chi Minh City and some ministries relevant to economic and technology management. The creation of group must assure restriction of monopolies on one hand, and uncontrolled competition on the other. The decision emphasized that the chosen enterprises should include corporations or big companies which have played important roles in the national economy. These groups are legal economic entities established by the state and each of them consists of at least seven member enterprises having a minimum legal capital of 1,000 billion dong. The group' management board will be comprised of seventy-nine members appointed by the prime minister. The State Planning Commission is expected to submit incorporation proposals to the prime minister for approval by June.
