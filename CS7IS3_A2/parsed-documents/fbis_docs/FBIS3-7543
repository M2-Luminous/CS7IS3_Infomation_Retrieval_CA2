Mr. Romulo pointed out that North Korea's relations with Beijing as its last remaining ally should be viewed with serious concern by the United States because "Beijing is a key player in maintaining equilibrium in this region." "We hope Washington would soon come to an understanding of what their position is vis-a-vis China," Mr. Romulo said, referring to the disconcerting dispute on Washington's move of linking the granting of MFN status to Beijing over alleged human rights abuses. "I understand and sympathize with their concerns on human rights abuses but I do not believe that they should use MFN as the big stick. In this particular instance, unless and until the Unites States comes to a resolution of what their policy is, I think the big stick approach is inappropriate because it might generate a certain level of instability in this otherwise unstable region. [sentence as published] And the only people who will suffer in this are people like us who are in this region. That's why we are asking the United States to look at their policy and come up with a responsible approach so that it does not generate disequilibrium in this part of the world," he said.
