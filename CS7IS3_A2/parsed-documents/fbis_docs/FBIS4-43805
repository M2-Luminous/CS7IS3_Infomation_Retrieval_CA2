On Monday [21 June] Siemens spokesman Rainer Jend confirmed that the company has declared its readiness to temporarily renounce any further transports until "uncertainties" of the German supervisory authorities have been clarified. Siemens has thus anticipated an order by Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens), who intended to prohibit further deliveries to Tomsk effective immediately. In May 1993, a contract was concluded with the Russian company, Tekhsnabexport, for the delivery of 140 tonnes of "slightly contaminated manufacturing remains" from the production of uranium-containing fuel elements in the factory in Hanau. In the past this "uranium scrap" was cleaned in Hanau itself. Since an explosion in late 1990, this has no longer been possible. The material, which has accumulated since then, was now supposed to be reprocessed in Tomsk. Jend said that the return to Germany of 70 tonnes of reusable enriched uranium hexafluoride as well as residue suitable for final storage was envisaged. In five transports, 49 tonnes of uranium material has already been delivered to Russia with the permission of federal authorities. So far, the Hesse Environment Ministry had, in vain, demanded detailed information about whether the reprocessing in the facility in Tomsk, which is suffering from safety defects, according to German environmentalists, "is done without detrimental effect on the basis of German law." A ban by Hesse (without immediate implementation) against the so far last transport on 30 May was nullified juridically by a complaint to the Administrative Court by Siemens. After Hesse had presented new arguments regarding the composition of the uranium material to Bonn, the Federal Environment Ministry for the first time permitted immediate implementation by Hesse in early June, if Siemens did not voluntarily renounce further transports for the time being.
