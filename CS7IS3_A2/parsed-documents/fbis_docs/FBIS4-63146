The Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense Press Service deems it essential to outline the following: An agreement on a cease-fire was reached at the talks. It was also agreed that there should be an opportunity for the negotiating parties to work on the final document in a peaceful atmosphere. The document was not signed because several of its paragraphs were not consistent with each other. An experts group is working on it. The defense ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia will hold a new round of talks when the experts conclude their work. Meanwhile, the situation in the operations zone has been relatively peaceful during the past few days. However, our military positions in various parts of the front line have been fired upon. Sadarak in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic was also fired on with PDM's [not further specified] and mortars last night. Azerbaijan's military forces ignored these provocative activities and refrained from returning fire.
