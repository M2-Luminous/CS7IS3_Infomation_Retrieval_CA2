FR940722-1-00055 FR940722-1-00012 The proposed revision to §23.807(b)(5) would editorially revise the current egress requirements for acrobatic airplanes. New §23.807(b)(6) would establish similar egress standards for utility category airplanes that are certificated for spinning. Industry sources estimate that an aerobatic, quick-release door would cost an incremental $10,000 in engineering design per affected airplane model and an additional $500 per production airplane. Little or no additional weight is expected. These costs would apply only in cases where the manufacturer determines that the marketplace return of a combination type certificate would outweigh the additional costs of design and production. Section 23.841␣Pressurized Cabins The proposed revision to §23.841(a) would extend the cabin pressure requirements of current paragraph (a), which now apply to airplanes certificated for operation above 31,000 feet, to airplanes certificated for operation above 25,000 feet. Current part 25, JAR 25, and proposed JAR 23 include the same requirement proposed here. This proposed requirement is intended to protect airplane occupants from harm if a malfunction occurs at altitudes where symptoms of hypoxia occur, usually above 25,000 feet. For airplanes that will be certificated for maximum altitude operation between 25,000 feet and 31,000 feet, the proposal would necessitate two additional pressure altitude regulators and associated plumbing. Industry sources estimate that the proposed requirement would cost an incremental $1,000 in engineering design per affected airplane model and $2,000 per production airplane. Any additional weight would be negligible. The benefits of the proposal would derive from the incremental protection against hypoxia afforded to occupants of airplanes certificated for maximum altitude between 25,000 and 31,000 feet. Due to the increasing use of turbine engines, more part 23 airplanes are likely to be approved for operation above 25,000 feet. In the absence of this proposed rule, an increasing number of occupants would be exposed to the potential for harm in the event of a failure or malfunction of the pressure system on these airplanes. Section 23.855␣Cargo and Baggage Compartment Fire Protection Proposed paragraph (a) would require all sources of heat within each cargo and baggage compartment that are capable of igniting the compartment contents to be shielded and insulated to prevent such ignition. Existing §23.787(f) requires that cargo compartment lamps be installed so as to prevent contact between the lamp bulb and cargo. The proposal would clarify and extend this provision to include all sources of heat for baggage as well as cargo compartments. Lights and (rarely) heaters for pets are typically the only sources of heat located in a baggage or cargo compartment. A wire cage, costing no more than $20, around the heat source would meet these requirements. The FAA estimates that the cost of compliance per airplane would be no more than $40 in those rare cases where such protection would not have been provided anyway. The benefit of the proposed provision is a reduction in the possibility of fire caused by the ignition of compartment contents by lights or heaters. Proposed paragraph (b) would require cargo and baggage compartments to be constructed of materials that meet the appropriate provisions of §23.853(d)(3). Currently these requirements apply to commuter category airplanes and to the materials used in the compartments of these airplanes. The proposed new requirement would expand this applicability to the cargo and baggage compartments of all part 23 airplanes. In effect, the proposed new requirement would require materials that are self-extinguishing rather than flame resistant as currently required under §23.787(d). Information provided by manufacturers shows that materials that meet self-extinguishing flame requirements are available at a slightly higher cost than materials that meet flame resistant requirements. The FAA conservatively estimates that the incremental costs of complying with proposed §23.855(b) would be less than $200 per airplane. The safety benefits of this provision would be an increase in cargo and baggage compartment fire protection. Proposed new paragraph (c) would add new fire protection requirements for cargo and baggage compartments for commuter category airplanes. The proposed rule would require one of the following three alternatives: (1) The compartment just be located where pilots seated at their duty station would easily discover the fire or the compartment must be equipped with a smoke or fire detector system to warn the pilot's station. The compartment must also be accessible for fire extinguisher application.
