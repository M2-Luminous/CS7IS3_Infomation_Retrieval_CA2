In May, eight mines, which ordered and received six tonnes of explosives, were notified there would be no further deliveries until the mine managements settled oustanding debts with the explosives manufacturers, TANJUG learns at the Serbian Chamber of Commerce. Most of the mines have had to go back to manual operation and minimum use of equipment. In order to maintain the output, they would have to invest about 135 million dollars in technical improvement this and the following year. Negotiations with bankers are underway, but it is still uncertain whether they will aprove the credits, the Chamber of Commerce says. According to the targeted energy output for 1994, Serbia's underground mines are expected to produce 760,000 tonnes of coal, and open-pit mines a further 31,6 million tonnes. It is highly certain now that this year's coal production will hardly reach the expected demand, which is usually at its peak in September. Since the Serbian power industry has conducted minimal power network overhauls over the past three years, the grid will hardly endure an increased load in winter. Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) has had to become self-reliant in power production since the U.N. Security Council imposed tough sanctions against it in late May of 1992. The embargo also includes a ban on crude oil deliveries.
