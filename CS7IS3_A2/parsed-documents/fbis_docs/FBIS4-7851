FBIS4-7851 "dreeu067_y_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Montenegro _O_Resistance to Military Service Examined _O_Resistance to Military Service Examined 94P20602A 94P20602A CSO [Editorial Report] South Slav media have been carrying reports that the Yugoslav military leadership has become increasingly worried about troop morale. Fewer and fewer soldiers are going to war voluntarily, and the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro have had to resort to forceful mobilization of Serb refugees. Commenting on this issue in a 3 February interview on Sarajevo radio, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said that the Yugoslav military may be suffering a "shortage of manpower" and having problems with "the morale of that manpower." In the 17 March issue of the Ljubljana daily DNEVNIK, the Slovene Press Agency [STA] reports that few conscripts are responding to call-ups in Montenegro. Many of them obtain medical certificates attesting that they are physically incapable of serving in the armed forces. Quoting the Podgorica weekly LIBERAL, STA states that such false medical certificates are sold by draft officers at a high price, adding that many reservists prefer going to jail to enlisting for the "defense of the fatherland." According to the report, the military police are quite active, picking up draftees on the streets and delivering them to military barracks. STA reports that the "action" is supposedly coordinated by Major Veselin Sljivancanin, a "man on the wanted list" and the "hero of Vukovar." As commander of the 5th Motorized Brigade of the Podgorica Corps, he is also in charge of all Montenegrin draft boards. According to "well-informed sources," he was sent from Belgrade to Montenegro to "put military affairs in order and raise the morale of the military." "Other sources" claim that his assignment is to prevent the possible secession of Montenegro from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, if necessary by utilizing the "methods he employed in Vukovar." Examining his role in Montenegro, the 5 November issue of the Podgorica opposition weekly MONITOR concludes that Sljivancanin, "a lover of the Socialist Party of Serbia" and a proven fighter for the "Serbian cause," had been sent to exert "federal" pressure on the Montenegrin Government. Although he was allegedly received "cooly" by his immediate superior, General Milorad Obradovic, MONITOR reports, many people feel that Sljivancanin might remain in Podgorica permanently, while others believe that his assignment must be viewed as a "temporary solution" within the context of personnel changes in the Yugoslav Army.
