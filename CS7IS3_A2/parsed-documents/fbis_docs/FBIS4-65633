He also asked them to avoid increasing the social tension, which he said is being "fueled by the Right." Gonzalez made these remarks at the presentation of the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections. The meeting was attended by a thousand officials of his party, including the main leaders, but not Alfonso Guerra. The organizers did not fill the Conference Center auditorium. "We are experiencing an extremely difficult time, a very delicate moment," Felipe Gonzalez asserted, "with considerable social tension, fueled by the Right. And we must make an enormous effort to mobilize all our members in order to explain what the 12 June elections mean, and do so without creating social tension; without falling into the dynamic of tension in the face of tension." Stay in Touch The prime minister therefore added that despite the "personal harassment" to which the Right is subjecting him, "we must not become infected and must continue to convey calm and tolerant conduct" despite "the anguish and embarrassment" the Socialists feel at "some slippery conduct" and at having "placed trust in some people who have abused it." He emphasized that "calm is important" at this difficult time, and announced: "I will stay calm and in touch with the situation. I am sometimes tempted to respond angrily to many of the things that are said, and could respond very toughly." "Therefore," he added, "I prefer to maintain a clear commitment to pursue the corruption cases -- those which exist and those which may emerge -- and to try to implement economic recovery, in order to continue the path of solidarity on which we have embarked, so there will be no turning back in this historic process which some people wish to stop." He reiterated, as he did in Seville a week ago, that the Socialists are prepared to transform Spain and to restore international dignity to this country, "but we are not prepared to endure scoundrels in our ranks. We could not imagine it." And, on the other hand, he praised "the upright and honest conduct" of thousands of Socialist officials who have made possible Spain's transformation, which can be observed "by noting our country's image." Given this political and social situation--which he acknowledged on several times--he warned the Socialists that they have ahead of them "a great challenge, which will not be easy, because we are experiencing a political situation of great difficulty and an economic crisis which is beginning to be overcome," although this is not yet perceived by the public. In order to encourage them, he asserted that they have "the best list for the European Parliament," considerable political experience, both domestically and in helping to develop European unity, and also a considerable responsibility to millions of citizens who have trusted the Socialists and "made this party the party which champions the values of freedom, equality, and solidarity." These arguments led him to assert that "if the electoral confrontation takes place on level ground, our success is assured." Nevertheless, he expressed his fear that the People's Party does not have that intention and is not interested in a debate on European issues, because "it has very little to offer, because they represent the negative tradition of turning our backs on Europe." These were not his only criticisms of the Right. For instance, he also said that the Right "still has the same attitude of alarmism" and of refusing to see achievement, and he asserted that "they even refuse to acknowledge" the figures showing the beginning of economic recovery. He also hinted that the People's Party, which he at no point named, will try to conduct a dirty campaign. He also pointed out that 12 June is the ninth anniversary of the signing of Spain's treaty of accession to the EC, and asserted: "If we acted like others," referring to the Right, "we would spend our time recalling who accomplished this."
