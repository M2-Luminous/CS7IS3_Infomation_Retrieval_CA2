Shukur Zukhurov, head of the government delegation and minister of labor and population employment, who previously would not give any guarantees of safety of refugees wishing to go back to Tajikistan, stated in his address that the republic's government gives full guarantees to all who "wish to return to the republic with the intention of rehabilitating the ravaged economy." But right on the heels of it Zukhurov added in an interview for a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that this question would only be resolved through joint efforts of the government and the opposition. Zukhurov paid special attention in his address to the question of guarding the border. "Helped by Russia and the CIS countries, Tajikistan will be able to protect itself, but we do not want this to be done at the price of young people dying. Which is why these talks are so important," Zukhurov declared. Otakhon Latifi, head of the opposition forces delegation and chairman of the Coordination Center of Democratic Forces of Tajikistan in CIS Countries, underlined right at the start of the talks that the opposition had not gone back on their plan for the settlement of the conflict, and he thought that the border question, like the one about the return of refugees, cannot be resolved without political accord. A political consensus, according to the opposition, becomes possible in the event of the creation of a Council for National Reconciliation (with representatives of all regions of the republic taking part), a State Council comprising neutral and competent people, disarmament and disbandment of all government and opposition armed groups and formations, the return of refugees, and the holding of free democratic elections. In his interview for a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Latifi pointed out that even today's Dushanbe leaders, "including in that number Emomali Rakhmonov himself, talk about the incompetence of the old parliament, whereas electing a new parliament in conditions of a breakdown of law and order and the absence from Tajikistan of nearly 1 million citizens is a road toward a new impasse." [passage omitted] So far Tajikistan's government has been rather evasive in its reaction to the opposition's demand for the creation of a State Council. For example, Makhmadsaid Ubaydullayev, Tajikistan Council of Ministers deputy chairman, underlined in an interview to ITAR-TASS yesterday that today's government is quite legitimate because it was elected by the country's Supreme Soviet. On the other hand, in Ubaydullayev's opinion, this question, likewise the form of a future state system of the republic, can be decided on and chosen only by the people of Tajikistan rather than an individual group of people. In this sense, the deputy prime minister ruled out the holding of a referendum. According to information from trustworthy sources, results of the current talks are being eagerly awaited not only by tens of thousands of refugees, but also by armed opposition groups. Conferences of opposition field commanders are taking place these days in Talukan (Afghanistan) to discuss further actions. Sources maintain that these forces have so far undertaken no major offensive against the Tajik-Afghan border. [passage omitted] Even if the talks take the most favorable turn, one should not forget about the time factor. Both sides are represented at today's stage of talks by "second echelons" of the power structures. A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told in yesterday's telephone conversation by Haji Akbar Turadzhonzoda, former head of Tajikistan's Muslims who is now in Teheran, that he did not come to Moscow because the government delegation is not representative enough. Interestingly, Tajikistan Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov is in Moscow as a private individual and seems to be secretly in control of the official Dushanbe delegation. It is therefore hardly probable that the delegations, in their present composition, will score appreciable successes. As in all similar conflicts, time is not on the side of those advocating compromise -- a further delay in resolving the problem may result in the situation finally getting out of control and events assuming an uncontrolled, spontaneous nature.
