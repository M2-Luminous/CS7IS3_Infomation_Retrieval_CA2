FR941025-2-00049 FR941025-2-00038 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY [FEMA&hyph;1033&hyph;DR] Georgia; Major Disaster and Related Determinations AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice amends the notice of a major disaster for the State of Georgia (FEMA&hyph;1033&hyph;DR), dated July 7, 1994, and related determinations. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Pauline C. Campbell, Response and Recovery Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated October 13, 1994, the President amended the cost-sharing arrangements concerning the Federal funds provided under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq .), in a letter to James L. Witt, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as follows: I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Georgia, resulting from torrential rain, high wind, tornadoes and flooding resulting from Tropical Storm Alberto on July 3 through July 25, 1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude that special conditions are warranted regarding the cost-sharing arrangements concerning Federal funds provided under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act'') for the Public Assistance program. Therefore, I amend my previous declaration to authorize Federal funds for Public Assistance at 90 percent of total eligible costs. This 90 percent reimbursement applies to all authorized Public Assistance costs, including debris removal to eliminate immediate threats to public health and safety, emergency work to save lives and protect public health and safety, and repair or reconstruction of uninsured public and private non-profit facilities. This adjustment to State and local cost sharing applies only to Public Assistance costs eligible for such adjustment under the law. The law specifically prohibits a similar adjustment for funds provided to States for the Individual and Family Grant program. These funds will continue to be reimbursed at 75 percent of total eligible costs. Please notify the Governor of the State of Georgia and the Federal Coordinating Officer of this amendment to my major disaster declaration.
