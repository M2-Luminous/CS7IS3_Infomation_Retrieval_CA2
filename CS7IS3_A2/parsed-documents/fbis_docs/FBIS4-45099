Hojjat ol-Eslam Moqasiyeh, supervisor of the Antinarcotics Public Prosecutor's Office, gave a speech in which he said in this regard: Last year was a year in which much work was done at the public prosecutor's office and by the police, and everywhere there were more narcotics seizures, more arrests of addicts and smugglers, and more narcotics procurement and distribution gangs were destroyed. New changes also began in this regard. The increased seizure statistics in the country show the greater efficiency and activity of antinarcotics agents, while in some countries where there are more addicts, smugglers and narcotics, the statistics on seizures and arrests are much lower. He added: In the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] 19,713 cases were filed and investigated, and 71.6 metric tons of seized narcotics in the country were delivered to factories for conversion in the pharmaceutical industries. He also added: In view of the fact that the antinarcotics campaign is a sacred struggle, sacred procedures, methods, and individuals must also be employed in this regard, and sound individuals must be used.
