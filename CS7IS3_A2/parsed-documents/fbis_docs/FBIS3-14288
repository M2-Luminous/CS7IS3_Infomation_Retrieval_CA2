Suffice it that we point to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the subsequent decision to set up a new settlement neighborhood in holy Jerusalem, then to the United States' abstention from the Security Council vote on the status of Jerusalem, and to what is happening now in Hebron -- from the destruction of buildings by rockets to the endless falling of martyrs by official bullets! Undoubtedly, the decisionmakers in the Palestinian negotiating side have heard about all these things, but that did not prevent them from agreeing to resume the talks and accepting to play the game of "technical" details, without drawing the appropriate conclusions about the meaning of the continuing Hebron massacre and about the U.S. position on Security Council Resolution 904. [passage omitted] Amid this amazing urge to negotiate, without taking into account the bloody developments in the occupied Palestinian territories and without paying attention to the calls by the majority of the territories' residents to stop the talks until the conditions for the Palestinian people's protection are met, the PLO's leadership crisis is intensifying. Half of the Executive Committee members did not attend its recent meetings. The half that did attend were not harmonious. Negotiating decisions are adopted even before those members are informed about them. The Israeli and U.S. sides are aware of this fact. They are also aware that among the nine members attending the current Executive Committee meetings, three did not agree to the Oslo accord. In addition, other members are opposed to the way in which decisions -- if they are decisions -- are being adopted by the Executive Committee. This situation must not continue. It undermines the PLO's status as the Palestinian people's sole legitimate representative and has a negative effect on its credibility as a negotiator on behalf of these people as well as on its negotiating power. Once again we call on all those concerned about the PLO's status and credibility to meet and consult in a bid to assess the situation and agree on measures that at least ensure the minimal national unity. The Oslo road is no longer passable. It is full of settlements and calamities that have befallen our people through the long lists of martyrs, confiscations of land, and daily violations. It is no longer possible to jump over what has accumulated on the Oslo road. If anyone is thinking of doing so, it will be a dangerous jump and his fall will be so hard that we would not wish it on any of our people.
