For a month or so now, we have been chatting with Marcos Castellon in Florida; but now we have him here, live, in person, a guest at the [emigre] conference and a guest on our program today. Good morning. [passage omitted] [Cavada] Marcos, I think we could begin -- and later go into other things -- with last night's big news, which is that Cuban President Fidel Castro received all the participants at a reception. Very briefly, what did you think of the meeting? How was it? [Castellon] The first thing I have to tell you is that we all attended. I think everyone who was invited to the conference was there last night at the Convention Center [place as heard]. And everything unfolded within the atmosphere that prevailed throughout the conference: a climate of complete normalcy. We all had the opportunity to say hello to President Fidel Castro. In many cases he recalled details -- because there were many people with whom he had had contact in the past, at some other stage in his life. Then he moved into the hall where we were all talking. But a climate of complete normalcy. I mean, in the same tone in which all this has been unfolding. It was very interesting. [passage omitted] [Cavada] In this connection, Marcos, what do you think -- apart from the point that you noted -- were other important things about the conference? [Castellon] I would like to highlight a conclusion that I have drawn, and I hope that many of us who participated in the conference also understood it this way. One thing became clear: First, the very fact of convening the conference, as was pointed out several times, is a demonstration of firmness but is, above all, a demonstration of respect and, I could also say, of humility. The only thing the Cuban authorities have asked of this group of us who have come to Havana, the only thing that has been asked of us is understanding. Nothing more. [Cavada] People were saying, before the conference took place, that it was going to be a failure. Or rather, not a failure but what the Cuban Government wanted it to be, because it was a meeting among friends -- that there would be no divergent opinions. After spending three days yourself, sitting there, listening, and participating, is that the way it was? [Castellon] Look, aside from the testimony you people, and all the Cuban and international press, have been able to gather through all those interviews, about the diversity of opinion there was among us, I can guarantee that I know personally, and live with, in Miami, many of the people who were there; I know how they think. I know what their ideological and political backgrounds are. Basically, if there is one thing we have in common, it is that there are no fanatics among us... [Cavada] Yes. [Castellon] But within that lack of fanaticism, there is extraordinary diversity, an extraordinarily broad gamut of differences in ways of thinking. This has not been a meeting of friends. It cannot be denied that there are friends among the participants; but there are also others who are not such great friends. And others who are frankly not friends at all. [Announcer] But, as Eusebio Leal was saying, decent people. [Castellon] Yes, indeed. And everything unfolded in a climate of absolute respect for the differences, on both sides. Because the point is not to accentuate differences but rather to seek out that which unites us, and build on that. [passage omitted] [Announcer] All right, so you are leaving tomorrow morning. And day after tomorrow, you will be informing us. [Castellon] Indeed I will. We will continue "Doing Radio" from Miami, and now with even greater reason, for you people here in Havana.
