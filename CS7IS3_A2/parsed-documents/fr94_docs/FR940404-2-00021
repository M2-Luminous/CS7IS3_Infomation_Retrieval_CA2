FR940404-2-00021 FR940404-2-00018 [Project No. 1922&hyph;008 Alaska] Ketchikan Public Utilities; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment March 29, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a new major license for the existing Beaver Falls Hydroelectric Project, located on Beaver Falls Creek near the city of Ketchikan, in the First Judicial District of Alaska. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Forest Service have prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project that analyzes existing and potential future environmental effects of the project. Our conclusion is that approval of the project would not be a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix Project No. 1922&hyph;008 to all comments. For further information, please contact Mr. Carl Keller, Environmental Coordinator, at (202) 219&hyph;2831. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
