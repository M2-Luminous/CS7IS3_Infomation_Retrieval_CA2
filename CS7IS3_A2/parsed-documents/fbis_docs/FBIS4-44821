The end of the European inferiority complex in semiconductors, an area largely dominated by Japan, the United States, and South East Asia, is in sight. The CEA and France Telecom, who are jointly conducting research on electronic components, have just developed a new engraving technique on logic silicon circuits, an essential technique for the industrial production of chips. This progress is important because Europe has been very much missing from the technological battle being waged between the United States, Japan, and the rest of Asia. At the end of the eighties, Europe was even becoming totally dependent on foreign supply for its electronic components. This situation was all the more serious because electronic components are becoming a major element in all industrial sectors from nuclear plants to aircraft, from watches to washing machines, from computers to automobiles. In a nutshell, the share of chips in consumerables is constantly growing. The European Commission reacted a little late in the day in 1990 when it created JESSI (Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative), a research program grouping together the main manufacturers in the sector (Philips, SGS-Thomson, Siemens, Matra). A year later, in 1991, the CEA and France Telecom joined forces to form an EIG [Economic Investment Grouping] working within the framework of Jessi. The task of the EIG was straightforward: to provide Europe, within three years or less, with sophisticated silicon engraving technology. Both public bodies managed to meet this demand within the given deadline. So what are we talking about? In simple terms, silicon chips are subject to two conditions: They must have increasingly large capacities and be increasingly small in size. "Think of a book," Xavier Dariel, an engineer at the CEA, explained. "If you want to increase the number of chapters without increasing the number of pages, then you have to reduce the typeface. This is somewhat similar to what we are doing with components. We are engraving logical circuits on to small squares of silicon. To reduce their size, we have to develop techniques to enable increasingly finer circuits to be engraved." Currently the chips have micron-sized engravings, in other words the size of a hair divided by 50. France Telecom and the CEA have overcome the micron barrier to reach 0.35 microns, and will soon reach 0.25. "Our innovations have enabled 1.5 million transistor test memories to be manufactured which were perfect right from the first production batches," the EIG director explained. Teams working in CNET [National Telecommunications Study Center] in Grenoble (France Telecom) and Leti (CEA) managed to succeed in the feasibility demonstration of this new technique, the so-called CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semi-Conductor) in 0.35 micron technology. The validation of results should be carried out immediately at the Crolles (Isere) industrial plant and would enable the development of a 0.35 CMOS micron facility there from 1995 onwards. The main innovations remain the use of deep ultraviolet photoengraving and mechanical-chemical polishing techniques to completely level the dielectrics (insulation) after depositing. They also involve the structure of the drains and transistor sources, the use of ultra-fine oxide grids or the definition of doping transistor channels. The interconnecting network includes three layers of aluminum alloys. The feasibility of a new deposition method of nitride-titanium distribution barriers has also been demonstrated. Specialists will value this. "This technological progress opens up the way to future generations of 0.25 micron technology and less," the director said. "They will contribute to Europe continuing in the race towards the miniaturization of electronic components which, we know, will influence the competitiveness of a large number of constantly expanding industrial sectors." Semiconductors are a strategic technological challenge and should be worth some 600 billion French francs in 1994, according to Dataquest (a bureau specialized in the study of and prospects for technology). The number of applications is constantly growing and the market could be worth a thousand billion French francs by 1998. The geographical distribution of semiconductor consumption proves revealing. Consumption in the Asia-Pacific region should exceed that of Japan in 1995, Dataquest predicts, with an expenditure of $28.09 billion in 1995 for the purchase of semiconductors compared to $22.83 billion in 1994, and $27.32 billion against $26.61 billion for Japan. "We have raised our estimates for the Asia-Pacific region because we anticipate a continuation in the explosive growth experienced in 1993," Gene Norrett, who is responsible for semiconductors at Dataquest, said. The Asia-Pacific region should represent 28 percent of the semiconductors market by 1998, or $26.72 billion, with China being the main consumer in this region.
