(CPC) said Wednesday [1 Jun] it will step up investments in Vietnam in tandem with the government's "southern strategy." "With the anticipated liberalization of the local oil market, the CPC has to go international while trying to consolidate its local market share," CPC Chairman Chang Tzu-yuan said in a speech marking the CPC's 48th anniversary. For now, the CPC is Taiwan's sole oil supplier. The CPC, along with France-based Total Oil Company, signed a contract with Vietnamese authorities in February to build a refinery there, pending the results of a feasibility study on the construction site, likely environmental impact, and other factors. Construction of the refinery is expected to begin soon after the feasibility study is completed early next year, and the refinery, with a daily capacity of 130,000 barrels, would begin commercial operations in 1999. Some of the oil products produced by the refinery may be shipped back for local consumption, according to Chang.
