This was his first exclusive interview for SLOBODNA DALMACIJA following the negotiations between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic in Bonn. [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] In spite of the latest negotiations between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, we heard on Tuesday morning [11 January] that the Muslim army was continuing the attacks on the HVO troops in central Bosnia. [Roso] Yes, this information is correct. The Muslim army continued the attacks on Croat territories at Vitez, Novi Travnik, and Busovaca. It is certain, which the information from the ground has confirmed, that the Muslims will not be give up their ambitions. Apart from attacking almost all our defense lines, they are also preparing new attacks. We know that their plans to attack Kiseljak have been completed. [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] How do the HVO troops respond to this, and what is the current situation in central Bosnia? [Roso] We respond the way we have to in order to survive. We can only survive by fighting and defending ourselves. I would say that we Croats have a genetic will to survive, but also the will for peace, and certainty about success, because we know that what we are defending belongs to us. I can say that I am impressed by the willingness and morale of my troops, which have warded off all aggressor attacks. Saving the Hostages [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Is the information that the Muslims have managed to cut off the communication between Vitez and Busovaca, true? [Roso] This information is incorrect. What is correct is that they had occupied several houses, but our troops, in a counterattack, retrieved the lost positions at Buhine Kuce. I must point out that the members of the English battalion, whom we had had several complaints about, this time helped us get out the civilians, which we are very grateful about. During the last Muslim attacks at the area of Buhine Kuce, the Muslim army, reinforced by some 200 foreigners from Islamic countries, took away 35 hostages, most of whom are women. We are doing everything to save these hostages and find out what happened to the 72 missing Croats from Krizancevo Selo. [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] You have said that, during the attack at Buhine Kuce, the MOS [Muslim Defense Forces] had been reinforced by foreigners from Islamic countries. We would like to know how they get to the Muslim areas in Bosnia. [Roso] They are transferred in various ways by humanitarian convoys. [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Ground reports speak of the Muslims having violated international rules of war. What does this concern? [Roso] They do violate all the rules of war. In the attacks at Krizancevo Selo, Lazine, and now at Buhine Kuce, but also elsewhere, they were using active chemical substances and poison gases. To protect themselves, our defenders as well as the civilian population have to use masks and wet cloths during the Muslim attacks. These are superhuman efforts, and I am sure that the resistance of the Croats of central Bosnia is representative of the Croat national struggle. It is an example of Croat sacrifice and togetherness. I believe in them, and would like to use this opportunity to tell them to hold on and that there are no changes of what I promised them in Kiseljak. My goal is to preserve the Croatian people, and I will use every available means to prevent the enemy, whatever they may be called, from pushing us out of our historically Croatian territories. Regardless of the many enemies, Croats have no choice; they have to defend their territories in Bosnia. A Message to the Croats [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Is that a message to the Croatian defenders and Croatian people in central Bosnia? [Roso] Not only to them, but to all Croatian people. I would like to use this opportunity to invite all Croats to help in the defense of Croatian territories in Bosnia, because without these territories there is no Croatia. I would like to appeal to Croats abroad, from the United States and Canada to Australia, to help the Croatian people's just fight in Herceg-Bosna through promotional activities. I would like to tell them not to conduct politics in bars. There is no such thing as a political prescription, but there is such thing as concept [as published], which is appearing with united forces. My motto is `Viribus unitis'. The Americans, Germans, and other nations have realized that. Everyone has, except some of our fanatics, and it would be good if they were imitated, if only once. I feel bad about not having political cohesion and political culture when it comes to the Croatian people. [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] After the negotiations between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, what will be the reactions of the Croats in Herceg-Bosna? [Roso] The Croats will again respect all international decisions, although every time we have presented the geostrategic reality in the Balkans, the international community has not taken it seriously. I find it very strange and hard to understand the actions of our old Europe, which has failed to understand that this is a realistic political time in which the Croatian people are demanding their share of the European equation. I would also like to say that in this war of the Muslim army against the Croatian people there has also been extremist Islamic fascism, which is a threat to Europe itself. I would not like to be misunderstood. The Muslims as a people are not a problem; it is only some of them who are inclined toward this extremist Islamic fascism, which now appears in a new context. The Muslim leaders must realize that in these areas there can be no other reality except a contemporary European one. [Box, p 7] Heroic Fighting "In Croatia, especially in the Croatian media, there is little emphasis on the problems of Croats in the besieged enclaves, who have not received any aid in months. There is also little talk of the crimes committed against the Croats of Herceg-Bosna. It hurts me that there is so little mention of the heroic Croatian fighting in the besieged enclaves around Turija, Zepce, Vares, and Usora. These people and the brigades that will not give up a meter of their territory to the enemy should be congratulated." The Franciscans "I would like to ask the Franciscans of Bosna Srebrena to once again show determination in saving the Croatian people in Bosnia. They have done so many times in history, and at this moment the Croatian people in Herceg-Bosna expect them to do it again. We especially need them to help us with food, because our people in central Bosnia are hungry." The Arrows "I hold the arrows of Croatian youth in my hand. Naturally, I do not use them. My goal is to preserve each Croatian life, as well as the Croatian people. I will do everything to stop the exodus of Croats."
