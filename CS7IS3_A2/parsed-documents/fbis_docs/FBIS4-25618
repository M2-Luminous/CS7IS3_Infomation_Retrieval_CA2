The overall investigation into the market was jointly sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Radio, Film and Television, the Press and Publications Bureau, the Copyright Bureau, the Industry and Commercial Bureau, the Taxation Bureau and the Public Security Bureau. Most sales departments dealing in audio-video products, especially XINHUA bookstores and foreign language bookstores, which are the main channels for publishing and selling audio-video products, are engaged in lawful business. At present, Beijing has nearly one thousand sales outlets for audio products and seven hundred for visual products. There are 80 professional audio-video presses and over 40 other book presses with the right to produce audio-video publications. In recent years, more than 400 video projection venues and over 500 karaoke bars have been set up. Beijing's audio-video market is booming. The reason for the healthy operation of Beijing's audio-video market is the close supervision by all government departments and the popularization of copyright knowledge. A recent rush check on the sale of audio-video products was carried out by relevant government departments along the main commercial streets of Beijing. A number of tapes and compact discs in violation of copyrights were confiscated.
