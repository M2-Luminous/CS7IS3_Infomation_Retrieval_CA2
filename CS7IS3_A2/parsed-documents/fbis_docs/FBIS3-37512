This primarily applies to the economy and trade. Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed out during a meeting with his British counterpart John Major, who is paying an official visit to our country, that according to last year's results Britain was third in Western trade with Russia. Neither side intends to rest on its laurels. During the British delegation's visit to Moscow they discussed plans to step up cooperation in the field of fuel and energy and communications, as well as in education, science, and culture. Such an important avenue of our cooperation as British firms' involvement in implementing the privatization program in Russia will be "inspected" by John Major in Nizhniy Novgorod, which he is to visit after Moscow 16 February. It is there that the practical aid that British capital has afforded the oblast administration's efforts is most palpable. The day before in Moscow's Kremlin a symbolic line was drawn under the period of hostility between our states, a period which for several years now has effectively been at an end. The Russian president and Britain's prime minister signed a joint statement on nontargeting of their strategic nuclear weapons against one another. During the delegations' talks in the Kremlin it was also pointed out that military cooperation between our states gratifies the two countries' leaders. However, as far as developing this cooperation is concerned, the sides have at the moment confined themselves to a fairly cautious "agreement in principle" that Russian and British Army subunits should hold a series of joint exercises from early 1995 on both Russian and British territory. The politicians were also cautious in their statements on the military-political aspects of our relations during a meeting at the Russian Defense Ministry in the afternoon of 15 February. Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev received British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. In the opinion of Russia's defense minister, it was noted at this meeting that the "Partnership for Peace" principle proposed by NATO is a good, attractive principle. However, when talk turns to putting this into practice, it is obvious that the concrete programs for implementing this partnership are currently at the development stage. John Major voiced a fairly optimistic opinion of the results of his discussion of the Bosnian crisis with Russia's leaders, noting the Russian-British (in this case also read NATO) mutual understanding "on many important aspects of a settlement to the conflict." President Yeltsin was more restrained in his opinions, saying that "some people are trying to resolve the Bosnian question without Russia's involvement. We will not allow that." It is easy to guess that the NATO military-political leadership is the unnamed "some people." Evidently one of the aims of John Major's visit was to try to win Russia over to NATO positions, secure its consent to the planned troop operation in Sarajevo, and thus invite Russia to take part in that resolution of the Bosnian conflict. However, both President Yeltsin and Premier Chernomyrdin clearly told the British premier that Russia has its own view of how the conflict should be resolved, namely that peace can only be secured in Bosnia via negotiation. On the whole the British premier's visit to Russia clearly showed that Britain and Russia are profoundly committed to developing a mutually beneficial partnership and establishing the kind of relations that may indeed become partnership relations in the near future, as Boris Yeltsin suggested during his visit to London.
