Y. Sung, and Michael Smith] [Text] China's intention to summon a civil servant to Beijing to explain the airport management plan to the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) signals the start of a fight for control of the bureaucracy ahead of 1997. Beijing sent a written invitation to Chief Secretary Anson Chan, asking Hong Kong officials to visit Beijing. The letter, dated yesterday and printed in Chinese, said the invitation was at the request of the Chinese government. "The PWC's Economic Group sincerely invites government officials to attend the group meeting ... to explain some points contained in the Airport Corporation Bill so as to avoid misunderstandings," the letter said. It was signed by PWC leaders Nellie Fong and Gao Shangquan. Describing the letter as "only a beginning", pro-China sources said: "From now on, the battleground between China and Britain will be the civil service." It is understood China has a list of subjects on which it wants input from top-ranking local administrators--ranging from changes to laws to fit in with the post-1997 situation to infrastructural projects such as the new airport and Container Terminal 9. Such input is intended to help the PWC formulate policies for after 1997. The pro-China sources also told The Standard that this tussle was signalled last month when some PWC members, notably Vincent Lo, head of the Business and Professionals Federation, suggested civil servants should be nominated to the committee. The suggestion met strong opposition from the government and legislators. Beijing decided then that it could expect no cooperation from the administration and became even more determined to take control of the top rungs of the civil service to undermine Governor Chris Patten. Beijing is understood to have prepared for this fight. In anticipation of the failure in the Sino-British talks, one of the first tasks assigned to the PWC was to seek talent and recommend local civil servants for all key positions. PWC member and former Executive and Legislative Councillor Rita Fan and others met more than a dozen top civil servants within days of the first PWC plenary session in July last year. It is understood that since then China has worked out who it does not want and who will hold key positions. Among those it does not want are Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Sze, and Director of Broadcasting Cheung Man-yi. It is also understood that China might like to see some former top-rank civil servants who resigned recently return to the service. Chan is standing firm on her refusal of China's invitation. "I think I have already said we have well established channels of communication," she said yesterday. Finance Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said: "If these people have questions of clarifications on the bill, they are welcome to put them and we will answer them. But there is no question of us sending people to Beijing to appear before the PWC." In Beijing, the State Council's Hong kong and Macao Affairs Office director, Lu Ping, said he regretted the government's decision.
