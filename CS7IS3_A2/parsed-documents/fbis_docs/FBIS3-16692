The Arkhangelsk Oblast newspaper VOLNA reports that last year regular launches of launch vehicles made on the basis of combat ICBM's. Thus with the aid of the new "Start I" launch vehicle an experimental electronic mail satellite was put into orbit. In all last year 36 space vehicles were launched from the world's northernmost cosmodrome, only eight of them in the interests of the Defense Ministry. This year's program includes the launch of the new "Koronas" geophysical satellite which will continue the study of the polar aurora in the upper strata of the atmosphere and will begin regular observations of the Sun. And the "Okean" satellite will search for shoals of fish and investigate the ice on Arctic shipping routes.
