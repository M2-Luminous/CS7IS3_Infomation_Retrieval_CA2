Tang and Y.C. Tsai] [Text] Brussels, Jan. 19 (CNA) -- The Belgian Government's decision to further simplify visa procedures for Taiwan businessmen and tourists will certainly help boost ties between the two countries, a spokesman for the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Brussels said Wednesday [19 January]. Belgium's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a notice to all its consular offices on January 10 announcing new visa measures for Taiwan visitors, the spokesman noted. Under the new measures, Taiwan tourists or businessmen will be issued visas at the Belgian Trade Association in Taipei. And when applying for a Belgian visa in a third country, Taiwan visitors who were granted a visa in the previous two years will be processed without the need for approval by Belgium's Foreign Ministry. Earlier, the Brussels government simplified visa procedures for Taiwan students who want to pursue advanced studies in Belgium.
