Moreover, they add, he is also a former communist. However, in FYROM everyone agrees about one thing: Gligorov is the president that the country needs. The 76-year-old politician is a kind of father of the fatherland, the link cementing together a small Balkan republic, which is arduously progressing toward democracy and stability. He is a man who has a soft spot for the Netherlands: "Your country has really helped us tremendously," he said. The FYROM flag -- a red background bearing the disputed golden star of Vergina -- flies proudly in the grand presidential office. The use of the star is one of the reasons why, on 16 February, Greece announced a boycott against FYROM -- or Skopje, as the Greeks call it. Other points of conflict include the name of the country, the "Republic of Macedonia," and a passage of the Constitution in which FYROM says that it intends to stand up for FYROM nationals living outside the country's national borders. Athens regards this as tantamount to laying a claim on the Greek province of Macedonia, and speaks of pilfering Greek history. Attempts at mediation by the United Nations and European Union have proven fruitless. [Zimmerman] Can the conflict with Greece still be resolved? [Gligorov] If we deal with the matter reasonably, then a solution is possible. We must carry on as neighbors. I must say categorically that there are no real conflicts. We merely have common interests. Emotions in Greece have to calm down. The mass demonstrations must come to an end. When life gets back to normal we will manage to sort things out. At this moment in time, the Greek politicians, who are themselves responsible for the demonstrations, are incapable of rational thought. They are prisoners of the emotions which they themselves have stirred up. [Zimmerman] Is there a possibility of compromises on the moot points: the name, the flag, and the constitution? [Gligorov] We have already made concessions to Greece. We joined the United Nations under the name FYROM, the English abbreviation for Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a name that is utterly inappropriate and not in accordance with our Constitution. We have adapted the Constitution and made it clear that we do not wish to become involved in the internal affairs of our neighbors. We have proposed the conclusion of an agreement with Greece -- under the supervision of the United Nations or the European Union -- guaranteeing the inviolability of our respective borders. We did so again today. That should be enough to wipe away any fears regarding territorial claims. However, nothing is good enough for Greece. Instead of opting for a dialogue, the government in Athens opted for an embargo that is causing us great damage. The Greeks are even making any resumption of talks subject to certain conditions. And if we give in to the Greek demands, what else will remain to be negotiated? We understand that compromises will have to be made by both parties, and we are prepared to accept that. But not under pressure of an embargo. Why should we not call ourselves Macedonia, as this country has been known for the last 50 years? Who has the right to demand that people and states should change their name? And regarding Article 49 of our Constitution: The Greek Constitution contains an article containing virtually identical wording, the difference being that Greece believes that it can stand up for the interests of Greeks living abroad, while denying us the right to do the same. [Zimmerman] Can the article be falsely interpreted? [Gligorov] Look, the problem is quite simply that Greece denies the existence of national minorities. It believes that everyone in Greece is simply Greek, whereas there are also Turks, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Vlachs, and Albanians living there. [Zimmerman] Do the Greek demands conceal any territorial ambitions? [Gligorov] I do not believe that Athens has any territorial ambitions toward the FYROM, but I am not convinced that the same applies to Greece's remaining neighbors. Think of the issue of northern Epirus (a region of Albania containing a Greek minority). There are also problems with Turkey. [Zimmermann] The star of Vergina on the national flag could also have been a Macedonian lion. Vergina is in Greece, and the sarcophagus of Philip II, which bears the star, is in the archaeological museum in Thessaloniki. [Gligorov] The Balkan cultures, like the people in the area, are mixed. You can also see this star in our churches. We have no intentions of stealing any of their national heritage or history. If everyone claims exclusive rights, then what should be done with the town of Ochrid, for example? That is where you can gain a picture of the history of the Balkans. Go and dig there: First you will come up against the Slavic culture, then the Byzantine, then the Roman, and Ancient Greek, and so on. The dispute is a good reflection of the atmosphere in the Balkans, which is one characterized by nationalism and emotions. [Zimmermann] Can the embargo, with all the negative consequences it has for the people, lead to an upsurge of nationalism in your country? [Gligorov] The danger is there. However, we are endeavoring to keep the passions under control. As was the case at the time of the first Greek embargo, imposed last year, we have not taken any countermeasures. Nor have there been any nationalist demonstrations here. Anything like that would merely lead to a running feud with the Greeks, which would only make the resolution of the problems more complex still. Consequently, I believe it is of the utmost importance that the demonstrations in Greece should stop, that the sentiments of the people there should no longer be manipulated. We all know where demonstrations of that kind led to in Yugoslavia: to war. [Zimmermann] Is there a danger that the war in the former Yugoslavia will spill over into the FYROM? [Gligorov] Of course. That is why we were so glad to have UN peacekeeping troops, including 600 Americans, in our country before a violent conflict broke out. The presence of the U.S. troops is politically and psychologically of great importance, and definitely gives us a sense of security. It is clear to everyone that the Americans are not here by chance. The U.S. superpower understands that there is a chance of the conflict spreading, and that Kosovo or the FYROM could become involved. If that were the case, then the situation would escalate into a Balkan war, involving involve two NATO countries, Greece and Turkey.
