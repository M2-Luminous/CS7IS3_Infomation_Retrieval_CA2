While calling for an end to this practice, the article said that some people abroad would always like to use human rights as a pretext and flagrantly interfere in China's domestic affairs. Time and again they put forward lists of names of allegedly persecuted people of various kinds and ask, in disregard of the laws of China, for earlier release of prisoners on the lists. They threaten otherwise to impose sanctions on China or to cancel certain favorable treatment. A country must have its own laws and regulations compatible with its internal conditions, the article said. "It is universally acknowledged that people who break the laws must be punished according to relevant laws in that country." It is unacceptable, even though it is laughable, that the lists of names of such alleged victims of human rights and the so-called facts published are often based merely on hearsay and rumors. For instance, some of the people on the lists are just described as having the name of so and so, with no other detailed information such as age, address or origin. On some occasions, the handful of overseas critics simply distort the facts and stick labels of high-sounding noble causes -- such as for the cause of democracy or for political differences or for religious beliefs -- on listed criminals who have actually been convicted in China of various crimes, such as arson or murder. These foreigners with ulterior motives falsely allege that criminals who are actually receiving fair treatment and enjoying sound health have been cruelly tortured and are on the verge of death. China rules itself, and will always do so, only in accordance with its own laws and regulations. Others may have different opinions about such laws and regulations, but they can never be authorized to change them or to ask China to handle its domestic affairs in line with the laws and decrees of another country. People abroad who would like to use the laws and regulations of their own country as a model and to force other countries to accept these laws are in practice interfering in other countries' affairs. A country, as well as its laws, has its dignity. Relevant bodies in China will put on trial people who have broken the law on the Chinese mainland, in accordance with the laws and regulations of China. The Chinese Government does not allow any other foreign country to interfere in such affairs. All these efforts are aimed at safeguarding the dignity of the country and its laws, the article said. It is a right and proper duty of all governments of different countries to defend their own laws and order, and vindicate the political stability of their countries, but it is not justified for some foreign people to stick their nose in China's domestic affairs, the article stressed.
