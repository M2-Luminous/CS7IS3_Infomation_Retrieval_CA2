The police on Saturday launched sweeps targeting Abu-Nidal's banned Fatah-Revolutionary Council movement, arresting fifteen persons and closing a trade office, the source told AFP. The crackdown was decided after the Lebanese authorities had proved that Abu-Nidal's group was behind the killing of Jordan's embassy first secretary in Beirut, Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, on January 29, the sources added. Documents and propaganda leaflets were found in the trade office, located in the al-'Abdali neighborhood of the capital Amman. Investigations are underway to determine if there is enough evidence to put the 15 on trial, the source said. Most of the suspects have had already spent time in prison in the 1970s for their links to Abu-Nidal's group. King Husayn on Feb 13 accused an Arab country of having ordered an extremist group whose leader lives in that country to carry out the murder. The king did not name the country but a Jordanian source said he was referring to Libya. Tripoli has denied these accusations.
