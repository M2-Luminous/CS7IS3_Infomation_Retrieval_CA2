Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Secretary General Wataru Kubo told reporters the Finance Ministry will reveal its budget plan on February 5. Parties in the ruling coalition have already agreed on the budget schedule, said Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDP, the largest among the seven ruling parties. Kubo also said the government needs to prepare a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 in parallel with the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget. Japan's fiscal year starts April 1 and lasts through March 31 the following year. In Japan, the government makes it a rule to compile budgets in late December. But this time, Hosokawa's cabinet put priority on the passage of political reform bills and postponed compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget to February. Kubo reiterated the SDP's argument to implement an income tax cut as part of efforts to shore up the long sluggish Japanese economy. He called for issuing short-term, deficit-covering bonds to finance the tax reduction. Kubo said the Hosokawa cabinet may resign en masse if it fails to gain Diet approval of the political reform bills during the current extraordinary Diet session ending January 29. "On my forecast, the possibility of (the cabinet's) resigning en masse is strong," Kubo said. The package of bills, designed to introduce single-seat electoral districts and impose antigraft measures, have been pending in the House of Councillors since November. Hosokawa has staked his premiership on enacting the bills before the end of the current extended session of the Diet.
