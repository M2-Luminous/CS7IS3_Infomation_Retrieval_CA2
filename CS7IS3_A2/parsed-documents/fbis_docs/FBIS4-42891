Sources said that Russia would be involved in `far-reaching' but informal cooperation going beyond a simple Partnership for Peace accord. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier said this was natural given `Russia's size, broad interests, resources and military capabilities.... Russia is and will remain a vital actor in European security affairs.' `But Moscow must first sign a Partnership for Peace accord which 18 of its Cold War allies have already signed,' he added in his address. The allies agreed to promise Russia cooperation and consultations outside a Partnership accord, notably nuclear safety and disarmament issues, sources said. The allies invited Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to sign a Partnership accord soon at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Simultaneously, the two sides would then issue a declaration spelling out in detail their future cooperation, officials said. Thursday's meeting opened with a promise to NATO's immediate neighbors to the east that the alliance has no plans to use Moscow to draw `new dividing lines across Europe' as happened at the February, 1945, Yalta conference by Russia, the United States and Britain. NATO Deputy Secretary-General Sergio Balanzino said Russia `is and will remain the single most powerful nation in Europe.' But NATO has no intention to cooperate with Moscow `in so-called Yalta-2,' he added. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said better relations with Moscow was `a matter of huge importance' as NATO seeks to craft a new European security order after the cold war. The Partnership for Peace provides for broad political and military cooperation, including joint maneuvers. NATO will also help the East European nations draft defense budgets and convert arms industries to civilian purposes. It stops short of providing any security guarantees, but will allow for eventual NATO membership for some East European countries.
