In an interim report on Japan's nuclear power policy, the advisory committee for energy scrapped an original scheme to start operation of a second nuclear recycling plant from around 2010. When to start the operation of the second plant, designed to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to produce plutonium, will be decided around 2010, the report said. The report called for limiting Japan's nuclear recycling to a nuclear power plant in Rokkasho, Aomori Prefecture, until the second reprocessing plant is completed. The Rokkasho plant is scheduled to begin reprocessing nuclear fuel around 2000, a delay from the mid-1990s of the previous plan, the report said. Japan's first "fast breeder reactor" should be built early in the next decade rather than the second half of the 1990s as originally envisaged, it also said. "The rescheduling does not mean Japan's nuclear policy has retreated," an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told a press conference. "Its policy of promoting plutonium use remains unchanged," he said. "Japan will proceed with the nuclear recycling plan in a manner that doesn't raise global concern over nuclear proliferation," he added.
