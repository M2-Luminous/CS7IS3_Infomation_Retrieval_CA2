FR940228-0-00066 FR940228-0-00015 9. Omnipoint was granted a preference for its development of 2 GHz equipment that uses advanced techniques that will facilitate continued development and implementation of PCS services and technologies. Omnipoint was the first to produce practical, working 2 GHz equipment for PCS. It engaged in radio frequency engineering and related spread spectrum product design, development, miniaturization, and manufacture of 2 GHz equipment. 10. Omnipoint designed and manufactured equipment that uses direct sequence spread spectrum access techniques in a 5 or 10 megahertz channel. The original work of Omnipoint contributed significantly to the development and testing of PCS services and design concepts that will facilitate initial implementation of PCS in the 2 GHz band on a sharing basis with fixed microwave licensees. Omnipoint has demonstrated that its 2 GHz PCS equipment uses innovative technology, combining spread spectrum and time division techniques. Further, Omnipoint has demonstrated the capability of providing PCS service using its equipment. Finally, the use of Omnipoint's handsets by other parties to develop PCS experimental systems has fostered the development of PCS. 11. By receiving a pioneer's preference, APC, Cox, and Omnipoint, if otherwise qualified, will not be subject to competing license applications in Channel Block A, a 30 megahertz MTA in the 1850&hyph;1865 and 1930&hyph;1945 MHz bands. APC, Cox, and Omnipoint argued that a 30 megahertz MTA grant was necessary to permit implementation of the systems they proposed. 12. Cablevision Systems Corporation (Cablevision), Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC), and Fidelity Investments and Cylink Corporation (Fidelity/Cylink) disagreed that a 30 megahertz MTA license should be awarded pioneers. Cablevision contended that a 20 megahertz BTA block would permit the grantees to use the band in which they have conducted experiments, while not conveying a windfall 30 megahertz MTA block that could have a preclusive effect on other licensees. SBC concurred, stating that a 20 megahertz BTA block would be enough spectrum to provide adequate PCS service. Fidelity/Cylink argued that a 10 megahertz BTA block at 2130&hyph;2200 MHz would be adequate because such a block would enable the provision of full-featured PCS, as well as many specialized PCS services. 13. The Commission found the arguments of APC, Cox, and Omnipoint persuasive. Each applicant conducted experiments in the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz band, not in the 2130&hyph;2200 MHz band. An award in the lower band is appropriate to ensure that the grantees can implement the services they have proposed. While the Commission continues to believe that the upper band has the potential to provide a variety of important PCS services, APC, Cox, and Omnipoint have designed their systems and conducted their experiments in the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz band. Further, the Commission is not convinced that a 20 megahertz BTA grant would be adequate, given the nature of the systems proposed. Accordingly, the Commission awarded each pioneer a 30 megahertz MTA block in the service area each requested. 14. The Commission instructed the licensing bureau to condition licenses issued as a result of these pioneer's preference grants upon construction of PCS systems that substantially use the design and technologies upon which the preference awards are based and upon each licensee holding its license for a minimum of three years or until the construction requirements applicable to the five-year build-out period specified in Section 99.206 of the Commission's Rules have been satisfied, whichever, is earlier. APC's service area is the MTA that includes Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland; Cox's service area is the MTA that includes San Diego, California; and Omnipoint's service area is the MTA that includes northern New Jersey. The Commission noted that both PCS channel blocks and service areas are the subject of petitions for reconsideration and clarification. Should either PCS channel blocks or service areas be amended on reconsideration, the pioneer's preferences will be modified accordingly.
