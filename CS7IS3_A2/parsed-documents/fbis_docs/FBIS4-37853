The PLO leadership's reaction to the report will be issued after the report is studied. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that several members of the Palestinian Authority have already rejected the conclusions of the Shamgar Commission. Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat said the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre was not perpetuated by one individual but rather stemmed from the settlement policy. He maintains, therefore, that the Israeli Government should bear the responsibility. 'Urayqat warned that the presence of the settlers in the territories is a time bomb which can go off any minute.
