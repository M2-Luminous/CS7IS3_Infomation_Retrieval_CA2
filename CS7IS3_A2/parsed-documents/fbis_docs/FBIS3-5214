The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled "U.S. Economic Hegemonism." The editorial begins: "The U.S. Clinton administration revived `Super 301,' the foreign trade retaliation law, despite the world's consistent opposition to it. We cannot help expressing grave concern over this unilateral trade strategy taking the world free trade hostage. The United States and Japan, which led the situation to this consequence, should feel responsible for it as major economic powers and resolve the dispute in a reasonable way." The editorial says the U.S. action runs counter to the multilateral Uruguay Round system, adding: "The Uruguay Round system is faced with a crisis of withering to death even before its official signing." The editorial then notes: "The Super 301 is aimed at Japan and may cause little impact in view of the fact that ROK-U.S. trade is balanced and there are few pending issues between the two countries. However, in the long run, it can be used as a weapon to pressure us to open our goods and services market wider. Moreover, this `economic hegemonism' can incapacitate multilateral negotiations and curb the world's free trade development, bringing about considerable loss for exporting countries like us." The editorial then says: "We can appreciate the super-tough position the United States is taking in view of the fact that the United States has a more than $110 billion trade deficit (in 1993) over half of which comes from its trade deficit with Japan." The editorial then stresses that Japan should open its market wider, and urges the United States to make internal efforts to improve the deficit situation. The moderate TONG-A ILBO on page 5 carries an 800-word article by reporter Yang Ki-tae entitled "What Impact Will the Super 301 Have on Our Economy?" The article begins: "Although the U.S. Super 301 is aimed, in the first place, at Japan, it can cause direct and indirect shockwaves to our foreign trade and industries. We could even become an object of retaliation to the same degree as Japan." The article then notes: "The United States is putting continuous pressure on the ROK to open financial and distribution markets, the market areas for which the Uruguay Round negotiation has not reached settlement, and, therefore, the Super 301 could be used to pressure the ROK to make additional market openings." The article then concludes: "Some observers, however, think that the revival of the Super 301 may not necessarily be a disadvantage to us. Since sufficient dialogue is made between the ROK and the United States on pending trade issues through such channels as the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) and since the ROK government is moving toward lifting restrictions in various areas and toward internationalization, there will be little chance of the ROK being subject to retaliation by the Super 301." The independent, moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN on page 4 carries an 800-word article by reporter Kim Chong-hyon entitled "Our Countermeasures." The article notes: "Although this Super 301, different from that of 1989 and 1990, is limited as an administrative decree and is characterized as primarily aimed at Japan, since the `revival' itself could cause enormous shock wave, our government is very perplexed." The article then adds: "Since the settlement of the Uruguay Round negotiation, the United States has been requesting the ROK, through such channels as the DEC, to more widely open the service market consisting of nine areas; to open the financial market earlier; to ensure fair competition; to eliminate discrimination against imported cars; and to reinforce the protection of intellectual property rights. Therefore, the ROK can be classified as a priority negotiation list country." The article then adds: "If the United States takes a retaliatory measure with its Super 301, the government intends to resolve the issue through such channels as the dispute settlement procedure of the World Trade Organization (WTO), while making efforts to persuade the United States by presenting our internationalization program, which includes market opening schedules." The article then notes a remark by Han Yong-su, director of the Trade Cooperation Division of the Trade, Industry, and Resources Ministry: "Although the United States has a degree of complaint about its trade with the ROK, the United States thinks well of ROK efforts for openness, including our opening of the rice market. Even if the Super 301 is put into operation, there is little possibility that the United States will place the ROK on the priority negotiation list."
