Around 800 billion rubles will be used directly in agriculture. As Vice-Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha told an ITAR-TASS correspondent, this will be enough to cover the end of the livestock wintering season, the preparations for spring sowing, and the payment of the many debts of farms to numerous suppliers. Aleksandr Zaveryukha still hopes that the agroindustrial complex will receive the requested 6 trillion rubles in credit in the first half of the year. He believes that branches of the complex cannot survive their present difficulties without this money. The use of credit, tax, and price policies to support agriculture is a common practice in all countries, he stressed. This is particularly important today, now that price disparities are growing more pronounced. Last year the prices of agricultural products increased 8.5-fold, but the prices of manufactured goods increased 12-fold. In reference to the heated arguments over the financial requests of the agroindustrial complex, Aleksandr Zaveryukha suggested that certain groups are disturbed by the position of complex administrators. These groups, which include officials from some ministries and departments, he remarked, "are infuriated that we are not requisitioning imports, requesting credits for imports, or requesting funds in connection with the so-called coefficients that forced us to lower the prices of our own products to someone's benefit. They also object to our insistence on the use of customs duties for the slight reduction of food imports." The vice premier said that the projected financing for the agroindustrial complex is "closely related to the preliminary budget." The budget is based on earlier decisions, particularly the presidential edict on the creation of a fund to support the most important branches of the national economy.
