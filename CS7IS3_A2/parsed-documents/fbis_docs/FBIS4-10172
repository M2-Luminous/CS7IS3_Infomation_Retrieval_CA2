FBIS4-10172 "drlat068_i_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Nicaragua No Agreement Reached on Armed Forces Law No Agreement Reached on Armed Forces Law PA0804030194 Managua Radio Corporacion in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Apr 94 PA0804030194 Managua Radio Corporacion Spanish BFN [From the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast] [Excerpt] At a very lively news conference during which reporters asked many questions, General Humberto Ortega said the Army and the executive branch had still not reached an agreement on the military organization law. He said an agreement will probably be reached in 15 days but that the draft has not been sent to the legislature because no consensus has been reached. We asked Gen. Ortega if he was not the center of discord [words indistinct] his retirement. He denied this. Let us hear what Humberto Ortega said: [Begin Ortega recording] I think we have to be confident. Our work with the executive branch has been detailed and determined. We have discussed it several times precisely because we want to give the country and the Army a law that is a solid basis for the future. We do not want things to be done haphazardly. I think it is preferable to have a delay and end up with a solid document that can take us into the end of this century and into the next than to reach an agreement quickly. We want a serious law, not something done carelessly that will not be respected later or whose regulations will not be followed or that impede the institution's efforts to mature, as has been the case throughout this century. The truth is that we did not inherit a Nicaraguan Army. The National Guard was destroyed in the 1979 revolt. We started to build the Army after the peace agreement was signed in Sapoa in 1988. During the war [words indistinct] during the Reagan administration, it was impossible to build an Army for all Nicaragua. So this Army is still young and things are still rough. It is true that there has been a delay in the executive branch's and Army's search for a mature, adequate, and feasible law. We think it is worth it to wait 15 days at the most to see if we are able to reach an agreement on a law that will not be disregarded later on. The Army and I are totally willing to achieve this goal, and we are confident that we will overcome the problems that still, today, prevent me from telling Nicaragua that the executive branch and the Army have reached a thorough agreement. We agree on many things, but there are others crucial issues about which we have not been able to reach an adequate consensus. I am confident that we will reach it. [end recording] [passage omitted]
