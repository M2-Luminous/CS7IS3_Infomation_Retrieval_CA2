Mr. Chretien says Canada may even extend its 200-mile offshore economic zone to protect depleted stocks. Canada has negotiated a one-year moratorium with more than a dozen other nations to protect threatened species in waters that straddle the Grand Bank or are just outside. Alvin Cater reports: [Cater] At the legislature building in St John's, the prime minister listened to pleas for help from people whose lives have been ruined by the collapse of the Atlantic fishery. For two years a ban on the northern cod has deprived them of their livelihood. But foreign vessels have continued to fish just outside Canadian waters on the nose and the tail of the Grand Bank. In Brussels last week some European nations agreed to a moratorium on east coast fishing. Today Chretien warned Canada is preparing to flex its legislative muscle if the foreign fishing doesn't stop. [Begin Chretien recording] The bill will be ready within weeks. As soon as the fishing starts again, if it's not respected, the bill will be passed and we will use the resources we have to make sure that the bill is respected. [end recording] [Cater] Chretien wouldn't say how the government will police the nose and the tail of the Grand Bank if it extends Canada's jurisdiction. Many people in the audience have been receiving federal aid since the ban was imposed but because of this week's budget they'll be receiving smaller checks. The prime minister only talked about the budget as he answered reporters' questions. He admitted the aid program is being scaled back but he insisted the cuts will not be drastic. [Begin Chretien recording] There will be some change. I cannot deny that. But those who say that they will be cut in half, they will have to swallow their words. [end recording] [Cater] The prime minister also said the government had no choice but to slash unemployment insurance [UI] benefit. Otherwise, he said, the UI fund would eventually go broke.
