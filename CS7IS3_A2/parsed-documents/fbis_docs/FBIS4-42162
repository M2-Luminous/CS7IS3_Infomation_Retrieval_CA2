That was how the minister explained his viewpoint to the Belgian press. However, Claes questioned the future of this introductory conference. Thus, the 39 foreign ministers will undoubtedly reach an agreement by Friday [27 May] on a (probably rather noncommittal) declaration with a view to initiating consultations regarding minorities and borders in Central and East Europe and the Baltic countries. "However, supplements on working methods are still open to ratification." Consequently, the approach initially aimed at, namely bilateral talks, has been dropped, meaning that the planning partially escapes the inspection of those taking the initiative. Moreover, according to Claes, "there are still problems with the two round tables. Russia has still not promised that it will take part in the round tables on the Baltics. Russia feels that the Balladur Pact somewhat thwarts the CSCE activities and wants to give Max van der Stoel, the CSCE special envoy for human rights, free rein. On this, Moscow could be swayed by the United States with the argument that international politics is already developed enough. As for the other roundtable, there is still disagreement between Hungary and Romania on whether or not to allow the Hungarian minorities to take part in the talks." "The most important thing is yet to come," Claes said. The upcoming EU presidents, France and Germany, namely, will have to work very hard at this.
