FR940216-1-00016 FR940216-1-00008 No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.1a␣Special Use Authorizations, Contracts and Operating Plans The term ``operating plans'' in the heading and text of this section would be changed to ``plans of operations'' in order that one standardized term can be used throughout this part to describe the various documents authorizing mineral related operations conducted pursuant to 36 CFR part 228 or 36 CFR part 292, subpart D. The last sentence of this paragraph would be removed as it duplicates information contained in other parts of 36 CFR and does not pertain to law enforcement on the National Forest System. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.1b␣Penalty This section currently states the penalty for violating these rules in the words of 16 U.S.C. 551: ``Any violation of the prohibitions of this part (261) shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than six months or both *␣*␣*.'' However, the enactment of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, as amended, established categories of offenses based on the maximum amount of imprisonment for each offense (18 U.S.C. 3559). Offenses with a maximum term of six months of imprisonment, such as those offenses covered by these regulations, are now considered ``Class B Misdemeanors'' (the subject rules were formerly classified as petty offenses, 18 U.S.C. 3559(a)(7)). The statutory language of 18 U.S.C. 3571 prescribes a range of fines for Class B Misdemeanors depending on specific circumstances associated with the violation. The proposed revision to this section reflects this statutory change and provides for an exception by including the words ``unless otherwise provided'' which, for example, would apply to the enforcement of the collection of fees authorized by the Land and Water Conservation Act (36 CFR 261.15). A failure to pay such a fee is an infraction, which allows for a range of fines pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571 but does not allow for imprisonment of the offender. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.2␣Definitions Two existing definitions would be revised and twelve new definitions would be added to conform to various amendments that are proposed elsewhere in the subpart: The term ``Damaging'' would be revised to add the words ``rut'' and ``gouge'' to better define damage to roadways and property. The last sentence of the definition for the term ``National Forest System'' would be revised to conform to the definition established in the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1609(a)). The term ``Alcoholic beverage'' would be added to clarify which beverages are intended to be covered in the prohibition against possession and use of alcoholic beverages at 36 CFR 261.58(bb). In the absence of a definition in this section, the Forest Service has relied on defining alcoholic beverage by reference to State law. The intention was to prohibit possession of all forms of alcoholic beverages when provided by an order; yet in some states, the definition of alcoholic beverages does not include beer and wine. This inconsistent treatment of ``alcoholic beverage'' in the present rule can be remedied by defining alcoholic beverages as ``beer, wine, distilled spirits, and any other beverage defined as such by State law.'' The term ``Computer'' would be added to clarify the type of machines covered under two new proposed rules in 36 CFR 261.9. The definition is the same as the definition at 18 U.S.C. 1030. The term ``Contraband'' would be added to support a proposed revision at 36 CFR 261.4(c). The term ``Controlled substance'' would be added so that possession of drugs may be handled through a United States Magistrate judge by the issuance of a violation notice, rather than by proceeding under the simple possession statute at 21 U.S.C. 844, which requires either the filing of a complaint or information, or indictment by a Federal grand jury. The definition is the same as that used at 36 CFR 1.4. The terms ``Endangered species,'' ``Threatened species,'' and ``Sensitive species'' would be added to implement the rules at 36 CFR 261.9 (a) and (b). The current rule refers to these terms, but does not provide definitions. The proposed rule defines Endangered species and Threatened species as those species designated as such by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce. The proposed definition for Sensitive species is the same as in the Forest Service Manual, section 2670.5. The terms ``Guiding'' and ``Outfitting'' would be defined to indicate to the public and the courts the intended prohibited acts when engaging in such activities without a special use authorization. The definitions proposed parallel those found in the Forest Service Special Uses Handbook (FSH 2709.11). A definition of the term ``Intimidating'' would be added to clarify the prohibited acts covered by this term.
