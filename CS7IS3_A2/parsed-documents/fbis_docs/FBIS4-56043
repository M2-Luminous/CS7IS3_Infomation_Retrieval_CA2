Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on Tuesday said Egypt would not invite the F.R.Y. to take part in a conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to be held in Cairo from May 31 to June 3, stating without any arguments a series of shocking accusations about the F.R.Y.'s alleged involvement in the civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. "The Egyptian foreign minister's statement is unacceptable and does not comply with the actual state of affairs," officials of the F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry told TANJUG. "His explanation and arguments have been long surmounted, not only by reality and truth which is pushing its way despite the media campaign against the F.R.Y., but also by the events such as a ministerial meeting of Russia, the European Union and the U.S. on Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva on May 13," the same sources said. The F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry set out that it interpreted Egypt's decision as a gross violation of the agreement on the F.R.Y.'s participation in the NAM meetings when crisis in the former Yugoslavia is discussed and as a misuse of the role of the host at the NAM ministerial meetings. "We interpret that decision as a wish to have the NAM openly sided with the Moslems in the civil war in Bosnia," it was said in the F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry. After the NAM summit in Jakarta, a so called gentlemen's agreement was drawn up under which the F.R.Y. has a full right to actively participate in the NAM meetings, at which either the crisis in the former Yugoslavia or other topics are being discussed. Egypt defaulted regarding the New York agreement and acted in an ungentlemanlike way. An obvious intention is to exclude the F.R.Y. from the NAM, but this would require a full consensus. The Islamic bloc in the NAM is trying to persuade, first of all the non-aligned countries of the black Africa to join the bloc of the "friends" of the Bosnian Moslems.
