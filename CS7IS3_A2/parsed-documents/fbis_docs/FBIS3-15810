Following one hour of talks, the two ministers addressed the media. Kozyrev stressed that his country was in agreement with other international factors in its belief that the recent positive climate surrounding the resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis should be sustained. Minister Granic added that the agenda of their talks included the Washington agreement and the work of the expert commissions in Vienna. He stressed that the negotiations ought to also include--in addition to the Croats and Muslims--the third side, without which it is impossible to reach a final solution either in Bosnia-Herzegovina or in the entire region. According to Granic, the interlocutors discussed the question of returning Croatia's occupied areas under the full jurisdiction of our state. [Begin Granic recording] We regard the Russian Federation's role as positive. We also appreciate Kozyrev's personal role, as well as Mr. Churkin's, in these negotiations. We also expect that negotiations with the third side will resume the moment the present negotiations in Vienna are ended. [end record] Replying to a number of questions raised by the media, Russian Minister Kozyrev reiterated that his country has always favored a global solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that--following his talks with Granic and earlier in talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina's Prime Minister Silajdzic, who is also staying in Moscow--he has received assurances that the Croatian-Muslim agreement is not to the detriment of the third side. He also said that no one was officially questioning the internationally recognized borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The Russian minister noted that he had recently talked to Radovan Karadzic about how to save the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina under conditions of respect. It is the peoples of that country who must decide on its state territory, Kozyrev said. Speaking about UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] role, he added that Russia was in favor of continuing the mandate of the blue helmets in the conflict areas. This can only be in support of a political solution in the area of the former Yugoslavia. Minister Granic endorsed this view by saying that within the next few days Croatia would demand that the UN Security Council reinforce the mandate of the blue helmets. Following his talks with Minister Kozyrev, Granic went to a working lunch with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy for the area of the former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin.
