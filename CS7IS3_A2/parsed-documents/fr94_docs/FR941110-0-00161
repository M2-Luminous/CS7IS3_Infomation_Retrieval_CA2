FR941110-0-00161 FR941110-0-00016 Comment: One commenter asked how prior competency will be judged. Various commenters suggested that prior competency be defined by a minimum of one year of continuous experience as administrator of a long term care facility, by demonstrated expertise and experience in the operation of a nursing facility similar to the one the temporary manager is needed to manage, or by demonstrated experience in temporary management. Another commenter suggested that a measure of competency be whether the temporary manager served within the past 10 years as the administrator of a facility which furnished substandard quality of care. Response: As explained below, we are no longer requiring that the temporary manager be a licensed nursing home administrator or demonstrate prior competency as one. Because the skills and experience a temporary manager must have to correct deficiencies will vary on a case by case basis, HCFA and the State need to have the flexibility to appoint whoever is most suitable without the constraints of overly prescriptive eligibility requirements. When it happens that an individual interested in becoming a temporary manager is or has been a nursing home administrator, the compliance histories of the facilities managed by him or her will be reviewed. We will provide in manual instructions that there be such a review because we agree with the commenter that it would be inappropriate to appoint as a temporary manager an administrator who has had difficulty maintaining facility compliance in the past. Comment: A number of commenters believed that the temporary manager should not be a current competitor of the facility, have ownership interest in a competitor, or have been recently employed by a competitor. Commenters were concerned that these individuals would gain an unfair competitive advantage if appointed temporary manager. Response: We appreciate this concern, and we and the State will attempt to select temporary managers who are not affiliated with competitors of the facilities to be managed when the pool of temporary manager candidates allows. However, the purpose of imposing temporary management or any other remedy is to achieve and maintain substantial compliance with Federal requirements. When the only temporary manager candidate likely to accomplish this goal is affiliated with a competitor of the problem facility, HCFA and the State will necessarily consider that affiliation to be subordinate to the administrator's competency. If the facility feels more threatened by compromised competitiveness than it does by termination of its provider agreement, it has the right to refuse to relinquish control to the temporary manager selected by HCFA or the State, and subject itself to the possibility of termination instead. Comment: One commenter was concerned that persons interested in acquiring a financial interest in a facility would be motivated to serve as that facility's temporary manager in order to gain a competitive edge in later negotiations. The commenter asked that we prevent this possibility by precluding through contract with the temporary manager the purchase or other acquisition of the facility for a fixed period of time after completion of the temporary manager's responsibilities. Response: We do not have the authority to restrict a temporary manager's future business activities. If the facility to be managed has reason to believe that the temporary manager chosen by HCFA or the State would use the financial information he or she would acquire in the facility to the facility's disadvantage, the facility may raise this concern to HCFA or the State, and HCFA or the State may attempt to locate a temporary manager that is more acceptable to the facility. Should a temporary manager acceptable to the facility not be located, the facility may exercise its right to refuse to relinquish control to the temporary manager and face termination of its provider agreement. Comment: One commenter proposed that the temporary manager should neither have been an employee of, nor have been associated with an employee of HCFA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or any State licensing or survey agency. Response: We do not believe that a past affiliation with the aforementioned organizations would reduce a temporary manager's objectivity or effectiveness in any way. On the contrary, it is likely that the temporary manager would be more knowledgeable about Medicare and Medicaid participation requirements after having had exposure to the agencies that set and enforce the Medicare and Medicaid requirements, and we expect that the facility at which the temporary manager is imposed would benefit from this knowledge. Comment: A couple of commenters believed that the State must compile and update a list of people or organizations that meet the qualifications of temporary manager, and they asked that this list be available for public inspection. Another commenter proposed that the State or HCFA maintain a list of substantiated complaints or allegations concerning the performance of temporary managers.
