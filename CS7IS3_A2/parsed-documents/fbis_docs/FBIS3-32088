Voges, is unsuitable for his task of combatting the administrative chaos on the Netherlands Antillean island. His checks on the government apparatus, which has become derailed, are a failure. Also he has not proved able to play the pioneering role which could lead the St. Martin Government to a healthy future. This was the conclusion of the Joubert commission, one year after Justice and Antillean Affairs Minister Hirsch Ballin put the island under legal restraint when he introduced his Higher Supervision regime. Voges reacted furiously to the recommendations, which could cost him his job because Hirsch Ballin has in the meantime let it be known that he wanted to adopt Joubert's proposals. "I completely reject this attack on my person," Voges said. "I have not failed, but I have been abandoned by the civil service apparatus in St. Martin at every stage. I was given completely insufficient support in my attempts to restore order." Hirsch Ballin also received some indirect criticism: His controversial policies for fighting the considerable financial disorder, administrative chaos and faulty checks on government policies have not achieved the desired results one year after they were started, the advisory committee under the leadership of E.L. Joubert noted. Joubert is rector-magnificus of the University of the Netherlands Antilles. Joubert suggested a number of far-reaching measures, the most important of which was to put St. Martin under a new period of legal restraint of at least two years using a general Measure of Central Government Administration. Last summer Hirsch Ballin announced his Higher Supervision regime, which included strict financial curbs on the island (to be carried out by Voges, the person in charge who has now been challenged). These policies had produced only meagre results, according to Joubert. The worst evils had been removed, but as yet little improvement could be seen, the advisory committee said. Joubert and his camp now want to intervene in three ways: The civil service should be drastically reorganized and strengthened under the leadership of an interim manager with exclusive powers, who will be appointed for a period of two years to succeed Voges. St. Martin's Island Council should also be forced to set policy plans within one year in the fields of the economy, welfare, traffic, tourism, town and country planning, environmental management and public health. The Island Council, if necessary under pressure from the Netherlands Government, should also pass provisions to increase government income (there is still a budget deficit of many tens of millions of guilders), improve financial management and guarantee effective and democratic decision making procedures. The Island Council is accused of taking a wide range of decisions and approving expenditure, despite Hirsch Ballin's Higher Supervision regime, without providing any adequate justification of these decisions. In a reaction to the report, Hirsch Ballin spoke of "proper recommendations" which he "would adopt in general lines." In the near future he will present them to the central government cabinet and parliament and hopes to be able to take decisions on 18 February under the slogan "Now Let's Get To Work."
