[Strak] Yes, it is. I suggest that the government have its own time slot on public television a few times a week and at an appropriate time. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Meaning? [Strak] Meaning a time when information programs are broadcast. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] What kind of program is it supposed to be? [Strak] It would be the kind of program where the government would be able to portray itself the way it wants. In the program, the government would speak about itself and its responsibility. This way, we will prevent situations such as on "Wiadomosci" [main television newscast] on 17 May, where I had spoken a sentence out of which television people selected only half, thus completely changing the meaning of the statement. We continue to be the target of unprofessional or intentional maneuvering. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So, in this government program, there will be just the camera and a minister? [Strak] I can guarantee you that we will utilize experts. After all, it was precisely GAZETA WYBORCZA that said that the Polish Peasant Party's election campaign on television was one of the best. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] And where were your experts when the prime minister decided to fly to Italy with his wife and two children, when the government insisted it did not have enough money to transport war veterans? [Strak] Let us not go back to that. Everything has already been said on the subject. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So you want to have your own "Directly from the Office of the Council of Ministers"? [Strak] The name is irrelevant. It is going to be like in the case of election programs... [GAZETA WYBORCZA] ...Polish Television is not responsible for the program's contents? [Strak] Exactly. I am hoping that a program like this will ease tensions between politicians and television reporters. For instance, "Wiadomosci" on Tuesday showed clips of the prime minister visiting the pope, and, of course, neither his wife nor his children were shown. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Is that a terrible mistake? [Strak] Yes, it is because the prime minister repeatedly explained that he was taking the family along with him on the Italian trip precisely because of the meeting with the pope. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So, in this government time slot, the prime minister would be shown along with his wife and children? [Strak] Exactly. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Such government programs do not enjoy enormous audiences. [Strak] I am not saying this is going to be a "Dynasty," but those who are interested in politics will definitely watch the program. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So the government wants a time slot for itself because it does not like "Wiadomosci"? [Strak] There is a popular view that the media portray the government in a biased way. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Why is that? [Strak] There are three possible reasons: both we and the journalists are not professional enough; we differ in our political views; or there is bad will. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] How do you think the "Wiadomosci" people should have reacted when the prime minister sent over his two-page communique? [Strak] That was the first case in which the government wanted its communique to be read. Strikes were in progress and the situation was abnormal. The point was to ease the tension. At such points, journalists must not arbitrarily select certain parts from the prime minister's speech. They think they are holding just a gun in their hands, whereas, in fact, it is a cannon. The force of influence that "Wiadomosci" has is enormous. In my view, a professional journalist should consult the government over what he will read on the program. I am absolutely certain of that. This is what would have happened in any civilized country. [GAZETA WYBORCZA] But this was a very poorly written text. Besides, it would have taken four minutes to read it. [Strak] She could have said: "We are not responsible for what is in the text, and we are hereby extending this edition of `Wiadomosci' by four minutes." How is the prime minister supposed to rule the country if it is journalists who decide what he is supposed to say? [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Does this "government time slot" idea mean that the government intends to give up its fight with the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council [KRRiT]? [Strak] There are some who think that personnel replacements would be the answer to the current problems... [GAZETA WYBORCZA] You mean, for instance, replacing Polish Television's Chairman Wieslaw Walendziak as well as KRRiT? [Strak] Exactly. But, as for myself, I tend to lean toward the idea that it would be enough just to design a decent television program for the government.
