Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told a regular press conference that official predictions of cutting the huge surplus as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) provide a reference figure but cannot be construed as a trade target. The agency's prediction that the current account surplus will fall to 2.8 percent of GDP in the fiscal year starting April, from an expected 3.1 percent in the current fiscal year, can be an indicator of effort, but "it's impossible to use as a precondition" in trade talks, she said. A senior Foreign Ministry official said Monday that achieving the target for cutting the overall current account surplus is important in reducing the black ink with the U.S. as well. The comment by Koichiro Matsuura, deputy foreign minister, was interpreted as implicitly accepting the prediction as a trade target. But Kubota said the current account, affected by such factors as exchange rate fluctuations, "is not Japan's problem alone." Kubota, noting that Japan's current account surplus is declining in yen terms, said the government should endeavor to achieve its recently stated goals of deregulation, promoting trade and investment, improving competition through stricter antitrust enforcement and simplifying the government procurement system. To help achieve those goals, she said, the EPA should support spurring domestic demand through planned incomes tax cuts and increased housing investment and public works spending. The agency should also effectively use its ombudsman's office to improve foreign access to Japanese trade and investment and should form plans to reduce the gap between high domestic prices and those overseas, Kubota said.
