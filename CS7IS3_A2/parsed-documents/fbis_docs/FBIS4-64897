[Herzog] I will put it in very simple terms: I love the German people -- with their many good sides and great mistakes. For me the state is a tool created by man to solve certain problems. I find it less easy to identify myself with the state than with the people. For me the state is only one part of society -- a subsystem, to use a term from political science. [passage omitted] [FOCUS] You are in favor of dual citizenship. Would it be more consistent to introduce the ius soli [citizenship determined by place of birth] in Germany, according to which anybody born here would be German? [Herzog] I do not want to comment on the ius soli here. Dual citizenship has to remain the exception for me, particularly in the following cases: second-or third-generation foreigners who were born here and live here are hardly any different from Germans. They have to be offered German citizenship. If accepting German citizenship were impossible because their country of origin would not release them from their inherited nationality, then one should at least consider the possibility of giving them a German passport as a second passport. Those who do not want to become Germans should be conceded a generous amount of time to make a decision. If they decide against German citizenship, we should tell them: We expect you to return to the country that you obviously regard as your home country. This is the same situation that Germans and Poles faced when they emigrated to the United States. [passage omitted] [FOCUS] One of the major debates of our time is about Europe. Is the European nation state a desirable vision? [Herzog] No, because I do not see such a state for the rest of my life or for the lifetime of my children. I do not think that nation states, whose sovereignty has long since disintegrated into thin air anyway, will disappear completely. I do, however, regard it as possible that a stronger feeling of belonging together will emerge in the European countries, not least as a result of the challenges that our European culture is facing from countries that do not share our way of coexistence. Islam, for example, is challenging us to justify our own lifestyle anew. [FOCUS] So European patriotism, too? [Herzog] If you want: yes.
