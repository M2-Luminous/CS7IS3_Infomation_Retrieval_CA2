FR940916-2-00073 FR940916-2-00064 Upon approval of the joint relocation project and pursuant to an agreement between SP and HB&T, the parties will grant the following trackage rights: (1) SP will grant HB&T rights over the SP Shreveport Branch northeast from Quitman Street, a distance of approximately 9,440 feet; (2) HB&T will grant SP rights over the relocated HB&T East Main between the Brooks Street Connection and Quitman Street, a distance of approximately 3,500 feet; and (3) HB&T will grant SP rights over the additional HB&T East Main trackage between Quitman Street and Collingsworth Street, a distance of approximately 3,550 feet. The line relocation project will improve operating efficiency by alleviating traffic congestion in the HB&T/SP interlocker at Tower 26. The construction of the Connecting Track will enable HB&T to consolidate two separate crossings of the SP Main line at a single location. The relocation of the HB&T East Main line and the grant of trackage rights will enable HB&T and SP to retire the rail crossing of the HB&T West Main line and the SP Shreveport Branch at Quitman Street, and the rail crossing of the HB&T East Main line and the SP Shreveport Branch at Collingsworth Street. The relocation of the HB&T East Main line adjacent to the HB&T West Main line and the SP Shreveport Branch will enable MP to remove track from the HB&T East Main line between a point north of the Carr Street Connection and Campbell Street, thereby improving public safety by eliminating eight at-grade road crossings. The Railroads state that no shippers are located on any of the line segments to be abandoned. The Railroads assert that this joint project will not change service to shippers, expand the operations of any of the Railroads into new territory, or alter the existing competitive situation. The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment or construction components of a relocation project, and require separate approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. See generally Denver & R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation Over BN , 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may embrace trackage rights transactions such as the one involved here. See D.T.&I.R._Trackage Rights , 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental abandonment, construction, and trackage rights components require no separate approval or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt service to shippers and thus qualifies for the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5). As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected by the conditions in Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN , 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate , 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: John C. Pruetz, Houston Belt & Terminal Railway Company, 501 Crawford, Room 203, Houston, TX 77002&hyph;2192; Gary A. Laakso, Southern Pacific Transportation Company, One Market Plaza, San Francisco, CA 94105; Michael A.

Anthofer, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, NE 68179&hyph;0830. Decided: September 8, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22993 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
