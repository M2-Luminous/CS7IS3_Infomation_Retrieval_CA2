He announced that the North Korean delegation had held talks with deputy foreign ministers Igor Ivanov, Aleksandr Panov and Georgiy Mamedov. To quote Karasin, the talks dealt with the establishment of inter-parliamentary contacts, with the resumption of the work of the inter-governmental consultative commission for economic, scientific and technical problems, with the creation of joint ventures, with broadening direct contacts between Siberian and Far Eastern regions, and with the drafting of a new agreement on joint lumbering in the Khabarovsk Territory and Amursk Region. Karasin stated that nuclear problems had been discussed in great detail. "Russia favors tougher observance of the nonproliferation regime in Korea in accordance with the nonproliferation treaty and with the agreement on guarantees between North Korea and the IAEA," he said. Moscow also welcomes North Korea's latest steps to facilitate the IAEA inspection of the north Korean nuclear facilities which began last March. The possibility of replacing the armistice agreement with a peace agreement which North Korea would like to sign with the U.S. was also discussed. "Russia believes that at the current stage, armistice is the only way of safeguarding peace in Korea. It can be replaced, though, on the basis of mutual agreement of all the parties concerned," he said. He said that the North Korean delegation had expressed a positive attitude to the Russian proposal on convening an international conference on the settlement of the situation in the Korean peninsula. "Both parties are convinced that the problems facing the Korean Peninsula must be settled peacefully, through talks, without pressure and with due account taken of the interests of all states," said Karasin.
