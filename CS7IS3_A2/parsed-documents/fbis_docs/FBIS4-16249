The republican government stresses in a statement, released on Thursday, that the "Belarus Republic again declares its consistent adherence to peaceful methods for settling the conflict. In light of the recent positive tendencies towards the solution of outstanding problems through negotiations, any escalation of armed interference will by no means contribute to the stabilisation of the situation on the Balkans and may entail unpredictable consequences. "Belarus holds that it is the prerogative of the U.N. Security Council to make decisions on the use of armed force to settle differences among the conflicting sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "Taking into account the dangerous consequences of the armed confrontation," the statement says, "Belarus urges all the sides involved in the conflict to stop hostilities and to continue negotiation in order to achieve peace on the territory of former Yugoslavia," according to the document.
