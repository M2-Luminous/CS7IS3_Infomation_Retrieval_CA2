Pregnant women, children and patients finding themselves in hospital resuscitation, oncological or hematological departments, as well as persons in the ``risk group'' are subject to testing. Besides medical workers and donors, hotel workers and diplomats are now among those who are obligated to undergo testing in view of the particular features of their occupations (diplomats will do so only with their consent).
