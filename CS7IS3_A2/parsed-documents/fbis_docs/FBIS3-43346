The three, all MK commanders based in Ncala Section, were executed while visiting the family of slain "Commander Boja," whose body was found at the mortuary earlier on the same day, witnesses said. Boja had disappeared on New Year's Eve. The last time he was seen was in the company of the three "commanders," a neighbour said. A resident, who was part of a group that marched on the SDU's office in Mavimbela Section yesterday to protest against the clashes, was shot dead. Police confirmed the incident. Police said yesterday the death toll in Katlehong since New Year's Day stood at 16. Residents said hostilities between the SDUs and foreign-trained MK members based in Mavimbela and Ncala sections peaked on Sunday afternoon. The two sides, despite having fought heavily side by side in their "war" with members of the Inkatha Freedom Party, reportedly converged on their boundary -- Motaung Street -- and fired at each other. "They fought from 11AM until 6PM, when members of the Internal Stability Unit came with reinforcements," a witness said. Concerned residents spoke of kangaroo courts, in which suspects were tried and sentenced, even in their absence. Boja is alleged to have been killed by fellow commanders after he called for self-discipline. Most residents were concerned that the "war" was largely seen as ANC [African National Congress] against ANC in that the SDUs in both sections were run by MK commanders. But MK PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional chief of staff Mr. Viva Mkhonto yesterday said claims of MK soldiers leading the SDUs were not true. He said while MK members were part of the communities, they did not necessarily control the controversial township neighbourhood watch groups. Senior MK officers had by yesterday not gone to investigate the claims, which he said he knew about only from rumour. "We cannot act on information that is not verified by our commanders," Mkhonto said.
