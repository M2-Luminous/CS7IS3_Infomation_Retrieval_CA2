Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Chaisit Kanchanakit did not identify their nationalities. A one-ton bomb made from ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer and C-4 explosive was found in mid-March in a six-wheel truck that had been seized by police and parked in front of the Lumphini police station since it was involved in a minor traffic accident near the Israeli Embassy on March 11. Chaisit said that he had no idea if the two foreigners were still in Thailand. Police have said they suspected foreign terrorists, in collaboration with local people, were behind the unsuccessful terrorist attack. No identities of the suspected terrorists had been revealed although police said they had collected intelligence information about them. A Muslim man was held by police in Narathiwat's Muang district on Wednesday on suspicion that he was a member of a southern separatist group preparing to carry out an act of sabotage in the South. Ma-ae Buraheng, 27, from Narathiwat's Bacho district, was held after police stopped a taxi at a checkpoint in Ban Khao Tanyong area, Narathiwat police chief Panya Thiansat said. Police found a membership card of the Pattani United Liberation Organization (Pulo) in his underpants, Pol Col Panya said. In a search of his camouflage backpack, police found military fatigues, a pair of jungle boots, an alarm clock, a bag of rice, a needle and number of electric wires, he said. He said police had not yet filed charges against Ma-ae. The suspect may be charged with either organized crime or being a rebel, as suggested by his Pulo member card, he added. The suspect was being held at Tanyong police station pending further questioning, which would be jointly conducted by police and military officers, he said. In another development, Songkhla Governor Yuwat Wutthimethi dismissed press reports that he had approved a request to arrest 13 additional suspects for involvement in a series of violent incidents in the South. "Up till now, I have never seen such a request from the police, Yuwat told reporters.
