TURAN says the meeting took place in Echmiadzin (Armenia) at the end of 1993. "It was for the first time when I knew about such a meeting and my participation in it from TURAN reports issued on February 12", Mr. Melik-Shakhnazaryan told SNARK. The report mentions that the result of the as if [i.e. supposed] meeting was the as if partial move of the PKK Headquarters from Turkey to Armenia and the appearance of 600 Kurd mercenaries within the Armenian detachments fighting in Azerbaijan. "Official Baku is for numerous times trying to play the `Kurd game' to justify his unprecedented military failures at the Karabakh fronts", Mr. Melik-Shakhnazaryan underlined. According to him, the Azerbaijani authorities sometimes announce the Lachinskiy, Kubatlinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy regions which are under the control of Karabakh forces to be "Kurd lands", sometimes accuse Armenians of the cooperation with Kurds. The fact that the Echmiadzin town was elected by them as a place of the as if meeting is not occasional, Levon Melik-Shakhnazaryan considers. It's known, the Echmiadzin town is the center of the Armenians' spiritual life. So, Azeris make their provocation report the religious coloring. Nevertheless, such statements are of the aim to justify the Afghan mujahedeens' participation in clashes against Armenians, the Azerbaijani Army's training of military instructors from Turkey, the USA and some states of the CIS. But such statement can't mislead the world community.
