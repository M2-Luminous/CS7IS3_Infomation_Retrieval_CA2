According to LA RAZON, Chavarria's arrest was announced by a "source close to the U.S. Embassy in La Paz." The Interior Ministry announced that it will summon a news conference within the next few hours to provide details about the antidrug operation that led to Chavarria's arrest. The Santa Cruz police department has reported that 18 persons have been arrested over the last few hours in antidrug operations conducted in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz Departments. During these operations the police confiscated several of Chavarria's properties in Okinawa, a town settled by Japanese immigrants located 40 km from Cochabamba. Chavarria, a private pilot who is around 45 years old, was involved in the "narcopictures" and "narcovideos" political scandal that occurred at the end of the 1980's, which compelled political parties to achieve agreements and bury investigations on the alleged connections between political leaders and drug traffickers. [passage omitted] According to U.S. Embassy sources in La Paz cited by LA RAZON, Chavarria became one of the largest drug traffickers after Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez was arrested, and is presumably one of the main suppliers of cocaine to the Colombian cartels.
