You also refuse to take part in the Palestinian authority. What is the reason? [Al-Najjab] I did not attend the Executive Committee meetings, which were devoted to endorsing decisions that were made without consultation with the Executive Committee. I announced that I would not take part in the Palestinian authority under the agreement recently signed in Cairo. This authority would remain under the control of the Israeli military government, and it is rather similar to a civil administration. That is why I refused to participate in this authority. [Mu'addi] What is the solution, and what should Yasir 'Arafat do in this phase? Why does the minority not comply with the majority's decision? [Al-Najjab] Many Executive Committee members are not attending the meetings being held in Tunis. I am fully convinced that this agreement will not succeed in achieving any of the Palestinian people's national objectives. This agreement will not improve the Palestinian people's living conditions. Our people will continue to adhere to their goal regarding national independence and solving the refugees' issue in accordance with UN resolutions. [Mu'addi] You are the [Palestinian] People's Party's representative in the Executive Committee. What is the alternative to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement? [Al-Najjab] As you know, I believe that we have long been demanding a peaceful settlement of both the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian-Israeli dispute based on implementing the pertinent UN resolutions, particularly the Security Council resolutions. This agreement is not a phased or final solution. The solution, or the alternative, is to hold more serious negotiations, which should be based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and which should seek their implementation, rather than to avoid the implementation of, or commitment to, these resolutions. What is required is to secure Israeli withdrawal as stipulated by the Security Council resolutions. The Gaza-Jericho arrangements, or agreement, have nothing to do with implementing the UN resolutions. This agreement, rather, seeks to entrench the current situation. [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab: There are Palestinian figures from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who refuse to join the future Palestinian authority. What is your comment? [Al-Najjab] What you indicate proves that this agreement has not convinced anyone that it will secure even a temporary solution. The alternative is to search for a solution that will secure the Palestinian people's rights. Such a solution can be achieved if the Israeli side commits itself to Resolution 242 and to the fact that any phased settlements are only preparations and steps on the path of implementing Resolution 242. [Mu'addi] But there is an agreement signed by the two sides regarding the transitional phase. [Al-Najjab] If the Palestinian people, or their majority, do not accept this agreement, then it cannot be implemented. There are many examples in this regard. The fate of any solution that does not secure both the Palestinian people's rights and the actual interests of both sides would... [sentence incomplete as heard] [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, Executive Committee member, currently in Amman: Thank you very much. [Al-Najjab] You are very welcome, Sa'id.
