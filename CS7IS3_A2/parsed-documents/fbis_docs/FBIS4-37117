FBIS4-37117 "drnes117_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 SYRIA Paper Urges `Tangible' U.S. Pressure on Israel Paper Urges `Tangible' U.S. Pressure on Israel JN1706075694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 17 Jun 94 JN1706075694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] In a commentary today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH discusses the regional tour U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will make soon in order to activate and promote the peace process since it has been stalled by Israel's intransigent policy. AL-THAWRAH says: No doubt, the success of Christopher's new tour depends on the new things he carries. In other words, his tour depends on effecting the required change in the Israeli position on the peace process in a way that makes this position fully serious and committed to promoting this process and securing its objective in terms of a just and comprehensive peace. The paper notes that the peace process is now facing a difficult impasse due to Israel's insistence on rejecting peace according to the bases set for it in both the Madrid formula and its international terms of reference, and also due to Israel's attempt to replace the principle of a comprehensive solution with separate deals and partial solutions that would enable Israel to perpetuate its occupation of the Arab territories. AL-THAWRAH also notes the four regional tours that Christopher has made in one and a half years. None of these tours achieved its objective in terms of promoting the peace process and realizing the required breakthrough. The paper adds: The failure of the U.S. efforts is entirely due to Israel and its policy which rejects peace. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Thus, the pressing task for the U.S. secretary during his next tour is to address Israel with new language that is primarily based on tangible political and material pressures in a way that will force Israel comply with international legitimacy, respond to the U.S. efforts, and meet the peace requirements without delay or hesitation. In another commentary on the same topic, AL-THAWRAH says: The success of the efforts by the head of U.S. diplomacy during his new mission depends primarily on the ideas and proposals that Secretary Christopher will carry and whether they promote the peace process and rectify its course according to the bases and terms of reference of the Madrid conference. Christopher's mission also depends on the possibility of changing the Israeli position, which is still far from the requirements and conditions of a just peace. AL-THAWRAH urges the U.S. Administration to compel Israel, by all means of pressure, to comply with the resolutions of international legitimacy and acknowledge the Arab territories and rights because this is only the road to peace.
