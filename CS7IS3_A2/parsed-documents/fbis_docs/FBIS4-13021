The participants, who included the Sudanese Government delegation and that of the rebel movement, as well as the representatives of the four mediating IGADD states and the official in charge of Operation Lifeline Sudan, suspended the meetings after the delegation of Garang's faction refused to sign the draft agreement in its final form, having expressed some reservations. The participants in the meetings had concentrated on discussing various views on the ways by which relief aid could be dispatched to a number of areas, protecting and supervising the routes to be taken in sending the aid and vaccinating children in the south against infectious diseases. A diplomatic source stated that the Sudanese Government delegation had shown great understanding during the negotiations on cooperating with the mediating team on most of the proposals put forward by the latter. The government delegation made it clear right from the beginning that it had no objection whatsoever to any citizen in the south being given food, irrespective of his orientation.
