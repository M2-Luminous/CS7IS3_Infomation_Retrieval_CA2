FBIS4-20640 "jpjst015__l94019" JPRS-JST-94-015-L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 12 April 1994 AEROSPACE Status of SFU-Borne EFFU Development Status of SFU-Borne EFFU Development 43070064B Tokyo NASDA REPORT in English Fall 93 pp 7-8 43070064B Tokyo NASDA REPORT English CSO [First paragraph comment by NASDA REPORT] [Text] Experiment Missions Defined; System Experiment Completed and Compatibility Between EFFU and Core System Verified: The Space Flyer Unit (SFU) is being developed jointly by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The Space Flyer Unit (SFU) core system is being developed by ISAS in cooperation with NEDO. NASDA is responsible for launching SFU by the H-II launch vehicle, supporting SFU tracking and control operation by ISAS, and developing SFU-borne Exposed Facility Flyer Unit (EFFU) which is the NASDA experiment mission. The SFU is scheduled to be launched with the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5) in the season of January-February 1995 by the H-II Launch Vehicle Flight No. 3 from Tanegashima Space Center. It will be retrieved by the NASA Space Shuttle in the summer of 1995 after operating for six months on-orbit. NASDA selected as its SFU experiment mission the validation experiment of the component model of the "Exposed Facility" for the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) for the international Space Station "Freedom" and the "Vapor-Phase Growth Fundamental Experiment," a common experiment. They were developed and assembled into the EFFU as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Structure of EFFU The main purposes of validating the component model of the exposed facility are to verify the operation of the separation and connection mechanism used for replacing experiment equipment in space, to establish an active thermal control system with fluid heat transfer loop, to establish microgravity measuring technology in microgravity conditions, and to evaluate the characteristics of the materials exposed to space environments. Homogeneity of plasma generation in microgravity is observed and the diamond substrate growth in the plasma environments is verified using the Gas Dynamics Experiment Facility (GDEF) to conduct the Vapor-Phase Growth Fundamental Experiment. The test of the EFFU itself was completed in the summer of 1992 and the EFFU was assembled into the SFU core body. The one-year SFU system test was to verify the compatibility of the EFFU with the SFU core system was completed.

As shown by the schedule in Fig. 2, EFFU will be brought back to the manufacturing plant where the plasma generation electrodes of GDEF will be replaced, reacting gases (hydrogen and methane gases) will be reloaded, and the thermal shield materials covering the exterior of EFFU will be checked. The EFFU will be transported to Tanegashima Space Center in the autumn of 1995 after completing the checkout and servicing. The materials for the exposure experiment will be assembled into the dedicated holder installed on the exterior of EFFU at Tanegashima Space Center just prior to launch.
