Asked in a BBC interview whether he would pick up the recent suggestion of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, that Sinn Fein requests for clarification of the declaration might be considered by London, Mr Adams said: ``We're exploring that, and I won't say I am hopeful. ``I have always said we would be flexible in allowing them to get off the hook which they got themselves on to on clarification. We don't want any big public climbdown by them. We are pursuing the issue.'' It was unclear whether Mr Adams was about to submit a list of questions to the British Government, detailing the points on which Sinn Fein or the IRA wanted clarification. Albert Reynolds, Irish Prime Minister, said last week: ``I would hope that we would be able to draw the process of clarification to a conclusion shortly, because there is, in my opinion, not a great deal more that can be said at this stage.'' That statement was read as a warning to Sinn Fein that Mr Reynolds' patience was running out. The Taoiseach [Irish prime minister] is known to have sent a 16-page letter of clarification to Sinn Fein last February. But London and Dublin sources said last week political talks were going ahead -- with or without Sinn Fein. THE OBSERVER has been told that the Republicans have more or less completed their analysis of the Downing Street Declaration. Those dedicated to assessing it are now working on other issues, according to a senior Sinn Fein source. That disclosure came at the end of a week of bloodletting in Northern Ireland in which 10 people died, four of them killed by the IRA. In the latest incident yesterday morning, the UFF [Ulster Freedom Fighters] shot and critically wounded a 39-year-old Catholic security man at the Valley Business Centre in Newtonabbey. The body of a man, killed by the IRA and dumped on Newry/Omeath Road in South Down on Friday afternoon, was recovered by the security forces yesterday. The IRA named him as Martin Brown, from Downpatrick, and alleged that he was an RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] Special Branch informer. The man, who had his hands tied behind his back and was shot in the head, was the tenth person to be murdered by the paramilitaries in nine days. Until last Sunday, when John McCloy and Alan Smith (both Protestants) were killed in Garvagh, south Londonderry, the IRA had exclusively targeted members of the security forces since the publication of the declaration. One Republican said: "It's back to business as usual for the IRA, I suppose." Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that last week's claim by the Government that the IRA had held secret meetings with the Iranian secret intelligence service, the MOIS, had followed a joint operation involving all three elements of Britain's secret world: MI5, MI6 and GCHQ [Government Communication Headquarters]. It was co-ordinated by MI5, which has had "lead responsibility" for combating Irish terrorism since last year. MI5 directed the operation, with MI6 conducting surveillance in several European cities. It is understood vital parts of a picture described by Whitehall sources as a "patchwork quilt" of intelligence emerged from the bugging of international telephone and fax messages by GCHQ in Cheltenham. The decision to make the intelligence public was taken by politicians on MI5 advice. The service considered the prospects of prosecuting any of those involved were remote: the meetings took place on foreign soil; several of those involved from Iran had diplomatic immunity; and it would have been almost impossible to put together a viable case relating to any specific criminal offence. Therefore it was decided to disrupt the link by publicising it. It is understood Iran has already made cash donations to the IRA through Sinn Fein, but the sums involved are small. In the IRA-MOIS meetings, much bigger donations were discussed, together with weapons shipments. The IRA representatives were known quartermasters with experience in the international arms market. It is believed their work was sanctioned by the Army Council.
