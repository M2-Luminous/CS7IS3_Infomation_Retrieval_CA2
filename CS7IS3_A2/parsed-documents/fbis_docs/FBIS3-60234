Shen Maocheng, vice-minister of the forestry, said that China has no plan to breed more bears and it will close those breeding lots that do not meet minimum conditions. At a press conference hosted by the Information Office under the State Council, Shen said that though China is abundant in bears, it has barred hunting bears since 1989, when the animal came under national protection. He said that most bears living in the country's feed lots were captured before 1989. Since then, China has not approved any hunting of wild bears. Bear gut, obtained by killing a bear, is a traditional Chinese medicine. To protect its bear resources, China began in the 1980's to drain bile from breeding bears. He said that draining a bear's bile in a breed lot saves 44 wild bears. If one bear's bile can be drained for five years, that would save 220 wild bears. He said that the technique is scientific. Moreover, it is not only bearable, but also painless to the bear. And it imposes no negative effects on the growth and reproduction of the animal. "The method not only protects the wild bear, but also provides bile to meet the demands of the domestic market," he said. The method also complies with international norms on the protection of wild animals, according to the official.
