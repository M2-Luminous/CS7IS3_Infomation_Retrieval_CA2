A senior U.S. Administration official, briefing reporters today on the background to the meeting, said the 16-member organization will judge whether Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's tone is "conciliatory or confrontational" when he makes a presentation on Moscow's military doctrine. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is planning a meeting with Grachev, the official said. The official refuted press suggestions that NATO was offering a "special partnership" to Russia, but said the organization would recognize "Russia's strategic weight and interest in European affairs." Russia had agreed to join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" earlier but postponed the move following NATO's threats to bomb the Bosnian Serbs. The official said he was "hopeful" that Russia would still join, although Moscow may choose to have Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev sign the agreement later when he attends a North Atlantic Council meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, in early June. Also attending next week's meeting will be officials from the 18 countries that have already joined NATO's "Partnership for Peace." Besides the partnership, NATO officials will also be discussing the Bosnian crisis and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the official said.
