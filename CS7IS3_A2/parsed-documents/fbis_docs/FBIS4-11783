Not a single Iraqi has even entertained the possibility of kowtowing to the aggressors or conceding their demands. Nor has any Iraqi ever thought of abandoning his people's interests or sovereignty. Our first mechanism was the armed struggle to ward off aggression and rout its first line in the south of the country, where the men of the demanding missions attached to the Republican Guards proved they were not sitting targets for invaders, but men standing ready to defend their land. Iraq did not provide the example of a nation crushed by the United States, but rather an example of a people who, with the benefit of the right leadership and a willingness to sacrifice, can hold out and stand firm. Then came the rebuilding mechanism that proved to the enemies they could not possibly set Iraq back to the pre-industrial age. However, as Iraq patiently pursued the jihad and reconstruction effort, it also followed a political line of its own that fragmented the opposing forces, increased its own supporters, and denied the enemies any justifications for any fresh aggression on its infrastructure. Iraq has proved that it is not a discordance in international relations, but the repository of legitimate hopes. It has shown itself to be a champion of freedom, security, advancement, and peace. The aggressors have been waiting for any false steps by Iraq to justify retaining the sanctions, but they have been denied this opportunity by Iraq's judiciousness. Thus, Iraq is now free to say and do what it will in defense of its security and interests, and has left scope for no one to fault the way it is conducting itself.
