FR940328-0-00026 FR940328-0-00012 On the basis of a collection by Wilhelm Hillebrand, C.B. Clarke (1883) described Cyrtandra polyantha, choosing the specific epithet to refer to the many-flowered clusters (St. John 1966). A description of C. triflora by Hillebrand (1888) is believed to be, in part, a description of C. polyantha (Wagner et al. 1990). Cyrtandra polyantha, a member of the African violet family, is an unbranched or few-branched shrub 3 to 10 ft (1 to 3 m) in height. Its leathery, elliptic, unequal leaves are 2 to 6.3 in (5 to 16 cm) long and 0.7 to 2 in (1.8 to 5.2 cm) wide and attached oppositely along the stems. The upper surface of the leaves is conspicuously wrinkled and usually hairless, with the lower surface moderately to densely covered with pale brown hairs. Seven to 12 flowers are grouped in branched clusters in the leaf axils. The white petals, fused to form a cylindrical tube about 0.5 in (12 mm) long, emerge from a radially symmetrical calyx, 0.2 in (5 mm) long, that is cleft from one-half to two-thirds its length. Each calyx lobe, narrowly triangular in shape, is sparsely hairy on the outside and hairless within. The fruits are white oval berries about 0.6 in (1.6 cm) long that contain many seeds about 0.02 in (0.5 mm) long. Cyrtandra polyantha is distinguished from other species in the genus by the texture and hairiness of the leaf surfaces and the length, shape, and degree of cleft of the calyx. This species differs from C. crenata by the lack of short-stalked glands and by its leathery leaves, opposite leaf arrangement, and radially symmetrical calyx (Clarke 1883, St. John 1966, Wagner et al. 1990). Historically, Cyrtandra polyantha was known from the Kalihi region and from Kulepiamoa Ridge above Niu Valley on the leeward (southwest) side of the southern Koolau Mountains (HHP 1991d2, 1991d3; St. John 1966). Two populations, located farther south on Kuliouou summit ridge and at the northwest head of Hahaione Valley (HHP 1991d1, 1991d4), are approximately 1 mi (1.6 km) apart on private and State land. One of the populations has not been visited within the past 50 years; it is not known how many individuals remain. The most recently observed population, last seen in 1953, consists of one individual. The total number of extant individuals is not known, although only a few are believed to remain on ridges of disturbed mesic valleys in 'ohi'a forests at elevations between 1,600 to 2,000 ft (490 and 610 m) (HHP 1991d1, 1991d2, 1991d4). Cyrtandra polyantha probably grows in association with 'uki, uluhe, Broussaisia arguta (kanawao), Coprosma foliosa (pilo), and Psychotria (kopiko), taxa commonly found in the ’ohi ’a-dominated forests of the Koolau Mountains (S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). The primary threat to C. polyantha is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of remaining individuals and their restricted distribution. Eugenia koolauensis was first described by Otto Degener (1932b) from a specimen that he and K.K. Park collected from Kaipapau Valley in the Koolau Mountains; it is named after its type locality. In 1957, Kenneth Wilson and Joseph Rock described a new species, E. molokaiensis, based upon a collection made by Rock in 1918 from Maunaloa on the island of Molokai (Wilson 1957). Current classification synonymizes the two species (Wagner et al. 1990). Eugenia koolauensis, a member of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), is a small tree or shrub between 7 and 23 ft (2 and 7 m) tall with branch tips covered with dense brown hairs. The leathery, oval or elliptic leaves, 0.8 to 2 in (2 to 5 cm) long and 0.4 to 1.3 in (1 to 3.3 cm) wide, are densely hairy on the lower surface and have margins that curve under the leaves. One or two flowers grow from the leaf axils on stalks 0.04 to 0.3 in (1 to 8 mm) long. The hypanthium (basal portion of the flower) is cone-shaped, about 0.1 in (3 mm) long, and hairy. The four sepals of unequal length that comprise the hypanthium are attached to a circular nectary disk (fleshy, nectar-producing structure). The four white petals, which are oval or elliptic and 0.2 to 0.3 in (4 to 8 mm) long, enclose numerous white stamens and are also attached to the nectary disk. The fruits are fleshy, yellow to red, oval berries, 0.3 to 0.8 in (0.8 to 2 cm) long, that usually contain one round seed. Eugenia koolauensis is one of two species in the genus that are native to Hawaii. It differs from the other species in having leaves that are densely hairy on the lower surface and leaf margins that curve under the leaves (Degener 1932b, Wagner et al. 1990, Wilson 1957).
