This is a major move to change the management mechanism in the industry. The guild will be established in the first half of this year. It will be a medium organization between the government and enterprises and undertake administrative affairs of the non-ferrous metal industry upon the trust by the government. The China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation, which used to control both the administrative and economic affairs of enterprises, will become a holding company to undertake the tasks of managing the state assets of all the enterprises in the industry by way of controlling shares or by participation or by running solely owned enterprises. It will bear limited liability for the losses or bankruptcy of enterprises. The holding company will send directors and supervisors to enterprises to supervise the management of state assets.
