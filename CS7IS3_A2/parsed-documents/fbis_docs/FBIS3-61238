The greatest public danger is characterized by embezzlement with the use of counterfeit advice notes, Rossiya checks, and other payment documents. The first information on embezzlement using fictitious advice notes began to show up in January-May 1992, when 12 forged documents with requisitions of banks of the Chechen Republic turned up within the purview of employees of the Main Administration for Fighting Economic Crimes. Over 1,400 cash centers of the Bank of Russia began to calculate the "Chechen advice notes." The Ministry of Internal Affairs proposed that the leadership of the former Supreme Soviet make it incumbent upon the TsBR [Central Bank of Russia] to verify the payments and report on the results obtained, not to the MVD but to the Supreme Soviet. More than a year passed. In some regions, payments were not yet verified for 1990. V. Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank of Russia, said that somehow employees of the Central Bank of Russia had succeeded in "catching" fictitious payments for 1 trillion rubles [R], but nonetheless, 5-10 percent, on his admission, got through; that is, R50-100 billion was credited this year and the money embezzled. However, the Central Bank is not hurrying to complete the work on verification of payments, as the results obtained will show the ineffectiveness of the bank's activity in regulating money circulation. But to place the blame for what happened only on the Central Bank would be the height of injustice. Evidence was acquired within the scope of specific criminal cases that the organizers of acts concerning crediting resources according to counterfeit documents were sometimes bank employees themselves, and sometimes also the managers of those banks that were experiencing a "credit shortage." In just one of the criminal cases, criminal proceedings are being instituted against Lazarev, who works as the director of the Moscow branch of the KB [commercial bank] Terra-Bank, his deputy, Shchebrev, and the chief bookkeeper of the Moscow branch of the East-Siberian Commercial Bank, Nikishin. In another case, the chairman of the board of the Soyuzprombank, Letunov, was arrested. Evidence was also obtained regarding participation in embezzlement of I. Medkov, manager of the Pragma-Bank, who was killed in September of this year. This sorrowful list can be continued. Sometimes financial swindling happens out of sympathy for, so to say, professional solidarity. The former chief bookkeeper of the RKTs [cash center] of the Main Administration of the Central Bank of Russia for the city of Moscow, Prilepsheva, knew that R2.7 billion being earmarked for a client of the Progressbank commercial bank were not secured by real resources, but she made a temporary credit entry of the indicated sum to a correspondent account of the bank. She explained this with the fact that the bank was in a difficult financial position, and she felt very bad for her good friend who works in this bank as a bookkeeper. The gratuitous use of state resources becomes food for other commercial banks. Thus, for example, out of the 10 commercial banks being studied by our group, more than R20 billion were credited for 45 counterfeit advice notes. The monetary resources were at the disposal of the banks from one to eight or nine months, after which the "forgery" was "suddenly" found and the sums written off. It is perfectly clear that R20 billion in October-December 1992 was nowhere near the same as R20 billion in August-September 1993. The interests of the bank also require criminal-legal protection. A "debit balance" sometimes arises because credits are dispensed but the bank cannot get them back--there are no capabilities. Swindling borrowers know this, and take advantage of it to the utmost. There is only one solution at the stage of forming market relations--intensify criminal-legal repression. If you take bank credit, you return it with interest at the specified date. If you fail to do so--it means jail. Otherwise, order cannot be maintained. As a preventive measure, the Main Administration for Fighting Economic Crimes of the MVD of Russia is developing a mechanism for the Association of Russian Banks to access name and fingerprint reports on individuals. After all, before doing business with a person it is not bad to know at least something about his past, especially if it is a criminal past. The second step in this direction will be the formation at the Interdepartmental Commission on the Coordination of the Actions of Banks and Law Enforcement Organs of a federal report of structures that are parasites on the market economy, and also the same kind of report on persons who work in these structures.
