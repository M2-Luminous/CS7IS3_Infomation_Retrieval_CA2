However, making that project a reality is hampered by the problem of procuring land. A BISNIS source at IPTN revealed that the funding would be used to expand the plant area and to procure equipment and general facilities, including employee housing. "Due to growth in the demand for aircraft and in the number of employees the present site is no longer sufficient," he said here yesterday. However, he believes that making the project a reality will be hampered by the difficulty of finding 500 hectares of land in Bandung. IPTN Inc Director of Planning Yuliswar said that Minister of Research and Technology J. B. Habibie has requested the 500 hectares. As of now, he said, IPTN management has only gotten about 300. He denied that it is difficult to find land because of land speculation. "Procuring land is not a problem. It's true there's a problem of price. The price of land in Bandung is certainly higher." B.J. Habibie, Managing Director of IPTN Inc, has expressed his concern about increased land speculation. He said that the problem is how to find additional sites for IPTN Inc expansion in Bandung because of speculation. "That's why I'm asking provincial heads to stop it. Speculation clearly hampers investment and economic development," he said at the end of last year. Even though land speculation throws a shadow over the site problem, Yusliswar is optimistic that it can be solved. The IPTN Inc expansion will occupy an area adjacent to the old site. "This project will be carried out in stages, in line with production of the N-250 aircraft, due to start in 1995," he told BISNIS and REPUBLIKA yesterday. Plans are for a first-year production capacity of six N-250 aircraft. Capacity will be increased to 52 per year in line with growth in demand. Due to additional capacity and the number of employees, now 15,000, the present 70-hectare site is no longer sufficient. Yuliswar also revealed that although the allocation of PMP [Government Capital Participation] funds for BUMNIS [Strategic Industry State-Owned Corporations] is decreasing, the government has guaranteed that R&D funds and initial working capital will be made available to develop the N-250. "I don't know exactly how much. It will clearly support IPTN Inc's production operations, especially for first deliveries of the N-250 in 1997," he said. He did not say whether funds for changing the aircraft's design are included in the R&D funds which the government has guaranteed. At the same time, Hari Laksono, Director of the Universal Maintenance Center (UMC-IPTN), said that as part of the effort to increase local content, IPTN Inc is pioneering the production of aircraft engine components.
