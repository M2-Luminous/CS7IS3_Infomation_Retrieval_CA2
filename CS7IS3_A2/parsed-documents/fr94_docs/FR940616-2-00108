FR940616-2-00108 FR940616-2-00085 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34179; File No. SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;94&hyph;03] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to Minimum Financial Standards for Bank Netting System Members June 8, 1994. On April 18, 1994, the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;94&hyph;03) pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 The proposed rule change lowers the minimum shareholders' equity standard for GSCC bank netting system members. The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the Federal Register on May 9, 1994. 2 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. section 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33981 (April 28, 1994), 59 FR 23906. I. Description The proposed rule change allows GSCC to change the minimum shareholders' equity standard for bank netting system members. In 1989, prior to the commencement of GSCC's netting system, a minimum admission and continuance standard of $250 million in shareholders' equity was established for banks or trust companies (``banks'') that are, or are applying to become, members of GSCC's netting system. 3 This level was chosen because, at the time, it encompassed roughly the one hundred largest banks in the United States and, thus, reflected GSCC's initial focus on providing its netting and attendant risk protection services to only the largest market participants. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27006 (July 14, 1989), 54 FR 29798. The proposed rule change, however, lowers the minimum shareholders' equity standard for bank netting members to $100 million. This standard will help ensure that each bank netting member, while not necessarily among the largest banks in the country, is still a sizable one. II. Discussion The Commission believes that GSCC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act, 4 and in particular, sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act. Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) require that a clearing agency be so organized and that its rules be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions for which it is responsible and to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible. The Commission believes that GSCC's proposal is consistent with these goals. 4 15 U.S.C. section 78q&hyph;1 (1988). The Commission believes that the proposal will facilitate broader access to the government securities market. Specifically, it will allow a greater number of banks that are active participants in the government securities market to receive the benefits of GSCC's services. The Commission also believes that GSCC has established reasonable financial and operational requirements for the admission of bank applicants. In addition to the minimum shareholders' equity standard, GSCC will explicitly impose in its rules an additional standard on all bank netting system applicants and members. The capital ratios ( i.e., total risk-based ratio, tier 1 risk based ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio) of all bank netting system applicants and members must meet the minimum levels specified by the applicable bank regulatory agency. In conjunction with this change, each bank netting member would be required to report periodically to GSCC each of its capital ratios for which its appropriate regulatory authority has established standards (or the capital ratios that it would be required to report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Fed'') if it were a Fed member bank). III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, and in particular with section 17A of the Act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder. It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 5 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;94&hyph;03) be, and hereby is, approved. 5 15 U.S.C. section 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 6 6 17 CFR ยง200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
