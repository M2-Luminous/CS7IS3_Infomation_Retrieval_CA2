FR941213-1-00028 FR941213-1-00009 Tuesday December 13, 1994 Part V Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Parts 121 and 135 Air Carrier and Commercial Operator Training Programs; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 238␣/␣Tuesday, December 13, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Parts 121 and 135 [Docket No. 27993; Notice No. 94&hyph;35] RIN: 2120&hyph;AC79 Air Carrier and Commercial Operator Training Programs AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to revise the training and qualification requirements for certain air carriers and commercial operators by: (1) Requiring certain certificate holders operating under part 135, and permitting certain others, to comply with part 121 training, checking, and qualification requirements, and (2) mandating Crew Resource Management (CRM) training requirements for part 121 and certain part 135 operators. The FAA has proposed these rules in order to make some part 135 training requirements as comprehensive as part 121 requirements and to incorporate recent knowledge about human performance factors. The proposed rule would also allow certain part 135 certificate holders to take advantage of sophisticated aircraft simulator training technologies presently available to part 121 certificate holders. By increasing the training and qualification requirements for certain operators, the proposed rule is expected to reduce the risk of accidents and incidents. By mandating CRM training for certificate holders required to comply with part 121 training requirements, the proposed rule is expected to reduce the number of accidents and incidents that could be attributed to a lack of crew communication and coordination.
