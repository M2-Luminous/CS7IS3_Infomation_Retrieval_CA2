After the meeting, which ended shortly before our transmission, our correspondent Igor Kubik asked the SDL Chairman Peter Weiss to summarize the meeting's results. [Begin Weiss recording] The Executive Council mainly discussed the present internal political situation and concluded that the way the government was ruling was damaging the country. The Slovak Republic or, rather, its government's image abroad is not good. The economic policy of the government is marred by systematic improvisation and the absence of an overall plan, which is all reflected in the social sphere, where the most threatened are the socially weakest strata, young families with children, and pensioners. And citizens are all the more worried about their security. It is necessary to create such political conditions as would change this state of affairs in a tangible way. The SDL warned almost a year ago that an internal crisis ought to be resolved by democratic means, by early elections. [passage omitted] We are of the opinion that the solution lies in creating conditions for a government that could introduce a planned policy to be carried out within a four-year period. It should be a government formed by political forces intellectually prepared to meet the challenge and, at the same time, carry out a nonconfrontational policy and respect its partners' views and give up the politics of pressure, blackmail, and discrimination against political rivals. We will do everything we can to change the way power is exercised, not to street power, but in such a way that the decision would be made by citizens in democratic, early parliamentary elections.
