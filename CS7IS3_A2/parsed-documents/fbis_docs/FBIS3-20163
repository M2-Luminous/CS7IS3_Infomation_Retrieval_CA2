They argued it was up to each sovereign state to take care of its labour standards, and warned that linking such issues to trade could result in protectionist measures outlawed in the world trade pact concluded here last December. The issue has been pushed by the United States and France, whose 11 partners in the European Union have adopted a more cautious stance, seeking to avoid antagonizing the developing world. Trade negotiators here said they feared the issue could cast a long shadow over the parley, scheduled for April 12-15 in the south Moroccan city to cap the seven-year Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations. Brazil, speaking for the caucus of developing nations in GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), expressed their "utmost concern" about proposals to include "workers rights and international labour standards" on the agenda of the future World Trade Organization (WTO) which is to succeed GATT. Developing nations specifically rejected a United States proposal for a passage referring to this issue to be added to a draft ministerial Declaration to be adopted by the Marrakesh conference. The text proposed by the United States calls for "consideration of the relationship between the trading system and internationally recognized labour standards" to be undertaken even before the WTO becomes operational sometime in 1995. Developing countries considered that this would not be "acceptable," Brazilian ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia told a meeting of GATT delegation heads, one of the last sessions in preparation for the Marrakesh conference. Lampreia said the developing countries "strongly" felt it was not up to the preparatory committee for the WTO to discuss "any substantive issue" which was not part of the final package of the Uruguay Round negotiations, except "trade and environment" which was raised in a specific draft "ministerial decision." The ambassador pointed to a statement by GATT Director General Peter Sutherland last January 20 in which he told delegation heads the Marrakesh conference should "focus primarily on the implementation" of the results of the Uruguay Round. The GATT chief in the same statement warned it would be "unrealistic" to try to negotiate in the run-up to the Marrakesh meeting "new agreements or mandates in areas which were not envisaged" when the Round was closed on December 15. Lampreia noted that Sutherland had underscored in his remarks that the participating ministers would have an opportunity, in their individual statements to the conference, to "indicate their wishes for new areas of activity to be taken up by the WTO." The Brazilian ambassador said it was "the considered view" of the developing nations as a group that "the attainment of higher labour standards is fundamentally a matter of debate within each individual sovereign state." He warned against attempts to establish a link between such issues and trade, "instead of reflecting any legitimate concern for conditions of work in developing countries and the protection of human rights." This, he said, "can actually result in protectionist measures designed to nullify or offset comparative advantage, and jeopardize the efforts being made by governments to raise wages and improve social conditions."
