After more than a decade, and with their rapid development in the last two years in particular, they are beginning to take shape and are flourishing and prospering. They have become one of the hot points in our economic life. The Four Stages of Development of China's Securities Markets The first stage was the beginning stage during the years 1981-1988. At first, they still bore the marks of the planned economy and were haphazard government bond markets. Even though some 45.5 billion yuan's worth of bonds were issued during that period, because they were distributed under the method of government-assigned purchases and were not transferrable, nor could they be circulated, there was never a secondary market for government bonds in the standard sense. It was during this period that enterprise bonds, financial bonds, and stocks began to appear. In regions where reform had begun first, especially, not only were fairly standardized forms of stocks issued to the public -- for example, Shanghai's Vacuum Electronic Apparatus Co. Ltd. and Feiyue Shareholding Co. Ltd. stocks, Shenyang's Jinbei Automobile Co. Ltd. stocks, and Shenzhen's Development Bank stocks -- but Shenyang and Shanghai and other localities also piloted the transfer of enterprise bonds and stocks, accumulating valuable experiences for the opening of secondary securities markets. The second stage was the development stage from 1988 to 1990. The turning point was the opening of the secondary securities markets. In April 1988, with the State Council's approval, Shenyang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan and other localities began testing the exchange markets for state treasury bonds. At the end of that year, the state treasury bond trading business quickly spread to the large- and medium-sized cities across the country. The opening of secondary markets for state treasury bonds not only spurred a large increase in the kinds and the volume of issuance of government bonds but also changed the concept of many purchasers, making the purchase of government bonds purely an act of investment. At the same time, it changed the traditional way many Chinese enterprises raised capital: they began to enter directly into the capital markets to gather funds. In Shanghai and Shenzhen in particular, the stock exchanges really developed. By 1990, Shanghai had seven shareholding companies listing their stocks in the exchange; Shenzhen had five listing companies. Over-the-counter trade was very brisk at that time, but for various reasons, the black market also ran rampant, and stock prices soared because of excess demand. The beginning of the third stage was marked by the opening of the Shanghai Securities Exchange in December 1990. China's securities markets ended their disorganized over-the-counter trade and turned to organized market trading. The opening of the Shanghai Securities Exchange not only brought the trading of securities into the exchange but also introduced computerized match-up and paperless transactions, and in one stroke it caught up the technological development that took the Western stock markets nearly a century and the Asian Pacific region several decades to accomplish. It not only improved market efficiency but also practically eliminated black market transactions, taking the standardization of the securities market a big step forward. Subsequently the installation of the Beijing National Securities Trade Automated Quotations (STAQ) system was put into operation (on 5 December 1990), which was followed by the formal opening of the Shenzhen Exchange in July 1991. The development of China's securities markets entered a new historical phase. As securities trading became increasingly active, the market for securities issuance also expanded. At the end of 1991, special RMB stocks (B-shares) were issued, opening up a new channel to attract foreign investments via the stock market. The fourth stage began in 1992. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's South China speech reaffirmed the reform experiments with the shareholding system and the securities markets. It became a strong force behind the reform and opening up. The securities markets and the entire process of the restructuring of the economic system helped propel each other into a new developmental phase. In early March 1992, the State Restructuring the Economic System Commission and the State Council's Economic and Trade Office convened the "Summary Meeting on the Experiences of the Trial Implementation of the Shareholding System" in Shenzhen. Based on the conclusions drawn at that meeting, the State Council handed down a document confirming the positive nature of the pilot shareholding system. Subsequently, the State Restructuring of the Economic System Commission and other related departments jointly issued the "Suggestions on Standardizing the Shareholding Limited Liability Companies" and more than a dozen of other individually drawn up laws and regulations, which played an active role in putting the shareholding pilot project on a legalized and standardized course. The pace of reform toward the shareholding system clearly picked up. Experimental points set up to issue stocks to the public spread from Shanghai and Shenzhen to Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan. Nationwide, more than 5,000 enterprises converted to the shareholding system, issued stock publicly, or implemented the directional capital-raising system. In 1992, 53 enterprises in Shanghai and 10 in Shenzhen issued stocks publicly, and adding the six kinds of out-of-town stocks from Hainan, Wuhan, and Shenyang traded in the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges, the scope of stock trading further expanded. Meanwhile, many new types of financial goods -- such as investment funds, stock subscription warrants, negotiable bonds, and investment profit bonds -- began to appear in the securities markets. The bond market and the stock market set each other off as both entered a phase of prosperity. The State of China's Securities Markets 1. The scope of the securities markets is constantly expanding: From 1981 to 1992, 381.7 billion yuan's worth of assorted negotiable securities were issued. They consisted of 108.4 billion yuan in state treasury bonds, 39.7 billion yuan in financial bonds, 20 billion yuan in special state bonds and value-guaranteed public debts, 40.7 billion yuan in state investment bonds (including state construction bonds, state key construction bonds, and basic construction bonds), 96 billion yuan in enterprise bonds, 61 billion yuan in financial bonds, and 15.9 billion yuan in stocks. Securities issued in 1992 were worth 128 billion yuan. The bulk -- nearly one-third -- of securities in the securities issuance market were government bonds, and if we add the government-guaranteed state investment bonds, they would exceed 40 percent. The securities circulation market was also extremely active last year. Volume of exchange in the organized markets topped 104.4 billion yuan, among them, bond volume (primarily state bonds) topped 35.1 billion yuan. Volume of trade in stocks was 69.2 billion yuan, 12.4 times more than the 5.1 billion yuan traded in 1991. Specifically, the Shenzhen Exchange's volume was 44 billion yuan while trading in the Shanghai Exchange was worth 24.8 billion yuan. So far, a total of 110 companies are listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. There are 108 A-shares and 30 B-shares. Their combined market value is nearly 300 billion yuan. Transactions in the tw o exchanges so far this year are worth more than 170 billion yuan. 2. An exchange market system is gradually taking shape: China's securities exchange markets are gradually taking on a format that combines organized and decentralized trading. The organized exchange markets include the "two exchanges" and the "two networks." The "two exchanges" refer to the Shanghai Securities Exchange and the Shenzhen Exchange, and the "two networks" refer to the National Securities Trade Automated Quotations Syste m (STAQ) and the National Electronic Trading System (NET). Securities traded on the two Exchanges are mainly personal shares issued by the listing companies. After the STAQ system began piloting the trading of state treasury bonds and legal person shares, the NET system also began trading legal person shares. The decentralized exchange markets refer to the 3,000 securities business outlets around the country. They include securities companies, outlets of the securities business department of trust and investment companies, and securities agencies of banks and credit cooperatives that trade bonds the over-the-counter. 3. A securities market management system is taking shape: The State Council's Securities Exchange Commission (the Securities Commission for short) and the Chinese Securities Supervisory and Administrative Commission (Securities Supervisory Commission for short) were founded in October of last year. The Securities Commission is in charge of the macroeconomic management of the country's secur ities markets. It is made up of leading comrades of the State Council's relevant ministries and commissions. Its basic duties are to formulate laws and draft legal provisions pertaining to the securities markets; to study and formulate general and specific policies and rules and regulations pertaining to the securities markets; to darw up the securities markets' development program and annual plans; to guide, coordinate, supervise, and check the performances of securities market-related tasks of different regions and departments. It is also in charge of the Securities Supervisory Commission. The Securities Supervisory Commission is the executive organ of the Securities Commission. It is made up of experts with professional knowledge and practical experiences in securities. Its main responsibilities, as empowered by the Securities Commission, are to formulate securities market management rules; monitor the way companies in the securities business handle their trade, especially how they handle their stock trading business; legally supervise the issuance and exchange of negotiable securities and the companies that issue stocks publicly; supervise and monitor domestic enterprises that issue stocks abroad; work with the relevant departments to compile securities statistics, study and analyze the securities market and promptly report to the Securities Commission and make suggestions. The State Council's relevant departments and local governments also have specific securities management responsibilities . The State Planning Commission is responsible for formulating and balancing the securities plans. The Financial Ministry is responsible for matters relating to national debt and is in charge of the chartering of accountants and accounting firms. The People's Bank is responsible for examining and approving and managing the securities business companies. Local governments are in charge of securities exchanges within their jurisdiction. The securities industry's self-disciplinary [ZILUXING] organizations consist mainly of the Chinese Securities Trade Association and the Chinese National Debt Association. 4. Securities organizations and intermediaries are growing rapidly: As the securities industry continues to expand, financial institutions that can handle securities business and intermediaries serving the securities industry also continue to increase. At the end of 1992, among the financial institutions approved to manage securities, there were 85 securities companies, 386 trust and investment c ompanies, and more than 1,200 securities departments set up within the trust and investment companies and multipurpose banks. In addition, there were 2,000 outlets set up by banks and credit cooperatives, and we also had more than 500 securities intermediaries, primarily accounting firms, auditing companies, law firms, property appraisal companies, credit assessment companies or offices, securities investment consultation companies and so on. To strengthen the management of intermediary service organizations and improve their service quality, the Chinese Securities Supervision Commission and other relevant departments have evaluated the credentials of intermediaries dealing with securities. In addition, membership in the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges have also been increasing. At the end of last year, the Shanghai Securities Exchange had 171 members and the Shenzhen Exchange had 151 members. 5. Laws regulating the securities markets are gradually being perfected. When stock market pilot projects were first set up in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the main laws we had were the "Temporary Regulations on Managing the Shanghai Securities Exchange," "Temporary Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange in Shenzhen," and the "Temporary Method for Managing the Securities Companies." Here it should be pointed out that socialist China has just promulgated the first set of "Temporary Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange" on 4 May of this year. It was drawn up based on Shanghai's and Shenzhen's and other localities' laws and regulations. It marked the first step toward creating a set of unified national laws and regulations for China's securities markets, and it was also an important result of the restructuring of the economic system. It was no small accomplishment. The "Regulations" starts out from China's actual conditions and also references usual international practices. Its purpose is to protect the interests of the investors and promote the standardization of the securities markets, especially the stock market, so that the stock market has regulations to follow and laws to abide by. Of course, this is just the beginning, and in the future, we still have much work to do with regard to setting up a legal system for the securities markets. Clearly, the birth and development of China's securities markets played and is still playing a positive role in the country's economic reform and development. To sum up, first, they raise capital for economic construction. The securities m arkets' main function is to turn society's scattered funds into long-term capital through the issuance of stocks and bonds; they provide a source of long-term capital to fund the nation's economic constructions. This is more obvious in regards to government bonds and enterprise bonds. However, although the scope of stock issuance is smaller, it is growing rapidly, and for this reason, enterprises that raise capital by issuing stocks are also growing rapidly. Second, they help curb inflation. Generally speaking, stocks and bonds are direct means of raising capital. Compared to indirect means of gathering funds through banks, direct fund gathering does not change the total money supply and does not produce the multiplier effect of increased money supply; instead, by absorbing society's idle funds, they change the mix of society's financial assets and ease the pressure of society's total demand. Furthermore, direct fund gathering puts more stringent demands on enterprises, prompting them to improve efficiency, thus it accelerates the flow-back of credit funds and helps to curb inflation. Third, they promote changes in the state-owned enterprises' management mechanisms and accelerate enterprises' market-orientation process. Conversion to the shareholding system has clarified enterprises' property rights, changed the old situation where nobody would take responsibility for the management of state-owned enterprises' properties, and has brought about the separation of ownership rights and management rights. As a result, enterprises can gradually end their dependence on different levels of government and can make their own management decisions and take responsibility for their own profits and losses. When shareholding enterprises issue stocks and raise capital in society, it means they must accept the supervision of tens of thousands of shareholders, and this forces them to improve management and administration and to diligently improve their economic efficiency. Fourth, they help achieve optimal allocation of resources. The securities markets have smashed the pattern of planned fund allocation and have made the market the basis of resource allocation. Implementing the shareholding system not only subjects the incremental assets to the market's regulation but also puts the existing asset base in the market where they can be readjusted. Today, local governments are very selective and strict about enterprises that issue stocks, and this gives the nation's bottleneck industries and well-managed and efficient enterprises ample opportunity to develop. How well or how poorly the enterprises are managed also determines the flow of society's funds, creating the competitive mechanisms whereby the inferior are eliminated by the superior, and in turn society's funds are guided to the profitable industries and enterprises, achieving optimal allocation of resources. Last, they promote the formation of a socialist market system. A fairly complete market system should be a system that integrates the commoditi es market and the fund market. The securities markets are an important component of the fund market, and their development and improvement not only promote the formation of the fund market but also accelerate the improvement of the commodities market. This is because enterprises are the market's principal players. The better they can compete in the commodities market and the better off they are, the more they can raise capital in the fund market. These are flip sides of the same process. Increasingly , the development of China's securities markets is proving that they can play a positive role in this area. Existing Problems in the Development of the Securities Markets Looking at the course of development of China's securities markets, today, we still have some major problems that need to be considered carefully and resolved. 1. The question of regulating enterprises' conversion to the shareholding system: Enterprises' conversion to the shareholding system must be regulated; their public issuance and listing of stocks must meet very strict standards. This is the cornerstone of the stock market's healthy development. Today, the lack of standardization in enterprises' conversion to the shareholding system is manifested in the following ways: One, in converting to the shareholding system, some enterprises fail to assess their properties accurately, resulting in underestimation of the book value and loss of the state's assets. Two, when they engage in directional capital raising, they often do not limit themselves to issuing shares internally to their own staff and workers, and as a result, "internal shares are made public and legal person shares are sold to individuals," which in turn leads to the black market trading of equity rights. Three, some regions do not follow the central government's legal instructions when they convert to the shareholding system; they do not follow procedure and submit reports as required and often lower the examination and approval standards. Four, share holding companies that have issued and listed their stocks are slow in changing their management mechanisms; their shareholders' meetings exist in name only, and there is no safeguard for the shareholders' rights and privileges. For these reasons, the State Restructuring of the Economic System Commission in conjunction with other relevant departments have issued some documents on standardization, asking the localities and enterprises to comply with their requests and work diligently when enterprises conv ert to the shareholding system. Only when an enterprise is truly ready should it issue stocks and become a listing company; we must not blindly pursue quantity by sacrificing quality. Enterprises' asset appraisal must be accurate; the delineation of property rights must be clear. We must follow the accounting system formulated for the shareholding system when changing enterprises' accounting system. We must set up and perfect enterprises' internal management system. The shareholders' meetings, board of directors' meetings, and supervisory meetings must be organized according to standard proposals. We must truly change enterprises' operating mechanisms and improve their ability to discipline themselves. It should be pointed out that as we open up to the outside world and as enterprises get into the market, the transformation of the shareholding companies should follow international standards even closer to become internationalized. 2. The question of the publicly owned shares: In changing to the shareholding system, we must uphold the primary role of the socialist public ownership system and guarantee the preservation and appreciation of the value of the state-owned assets. This is a fundamental premise. From the point of the scope of the pilot project to set up shareholding enterprises, enterprises involved with national security and state-of-the-art national defense technologies, projects involving the mining of rare metals of strategic importance, and industries and enterprises that must be monopolized by the state should continue to be run by the state. For the energy, transportation, and communications and other fairly monopolistic industries which are the focus of development under the state's industry policy, the state must retain controlling interest when they test the shareholding system. At the same time, we must stipulate that a natural person cannot hold more than 0.5 percent of the stocks of any one enterprise. This will basically guarantee the primary role of the public-ownership system in the national economy. A major problem we are facing today is that the publicly owned shares cannot be traded in the market. The presence of these shares and the fact that they account for a fairly large percentage of all equity rights are important characteristics of China's shareholding system. The inability of large numbers of publicly owned shares to circulate not only violates the principle of equal equity rights and fails to guarantee the preservation and appreciation of the val ue of the publicly owned shares but also hinders enterprises' efforts to change their management mechanisms, making it difficult to achieve the original goals of the shareholding system. But the trading of pubicly owned stocks will involve a host of other reforms -- such as reform of the system of property rights in state-owned properties, and it involves the state-owned properties management and administration system and the question of the stock market's ability to handle those stocks. We must study this matter carefully. 3. The question of the pattern of development of the securities markets: From the point of the internal structure of the securities markets, today, only about 10 percent of the directly-raised capital is raised by stocks. For some time to come, we will still rely mainly on bonds, supplemented by stocks. But currently, the bond market, especially treasury bonds, is in a slump, and we are "crippled." Those involved are working hard to review the experience and are taking effect ive measures to enliven the national debt market. Secondly, from the point of the distribution and the number of exchanges, there is a fairly wide east-west gap and a north-south gap in the development of the securities markets. Currently, the exchanges in Shenzhen and Shanghai are growing very rapidly; other regions are also actively setting up exchanges. Looking at international experiences, securities exchanges are always spread out in the beginning, but gradually they become relatively centralized. International experiences also show that a centralized market facilitates the proper allocation of fund resource, but it also tends to create monopoly and leads to inefficiency. More spread-out markets facilitate competition and improve efficiency, but if they are too spread-out, it can lead to market separatism and improper resource allocation. Thus, we must learn from other nations' experiences and lessons in developing securities markets, avoid detours, and make sure that the markets are neither too centralized nor too spread out. 4. The question of setting up a unified securities monitoring and administration system: To make sure that the monitoring and administration of the securities markets is uniform, efficient, and fair, nations have set up specialized securities monitoring and administration organs. Countries that rely mainly on government departments to administer the stock markets have also set up specialized organs to strengthen market supervision and administration after experiencing stock market disasters. The creation of the State Council's Securities Commission and Securities Supervisory Commission was a first step toward smashing the old pattern of putting too many departments in charge. These two agencies have done much to smooth the relations among different departments and between central and local governments, laying the foundation for our monitoring and administrative tasks. Based on the securities markets', especially the stock market's, characteristics, we must gi ve full play to the self-disciplinary organs. Therefore, we must turn the Securities Trade Association into a bona fide self-disciplinary organ and strengthen the securities business organizations' own administration and monitoring procedure. In particular, we must give full play to the accounting firms, the law firms, and other civilian "economic police," so as to strengthen social supervision. We must give full play to the securities exchanges' functions, strengthen the supervision and administration of the listing companies, stock exchange members, and the exchange process. In short, while we strengthen the government's supervision and administration of the stock market, we must give even more play to the market mechanisms and set up a securities market supervision and management system to oversee the government management organs, the securities industry's self-disciplinary organs, and the intermediaries at separate levels and make them take responsibility for themselves while working together harmoniously. China's securities supervision and administration system will be perfected gradually as the securities markets develop and as we accumulate experience. The preliminary supervision and administration system we have set up today is a major breakthrough, but there are still many problems and contradictions which have not been completely sorted out, and they must be gradually resolved. 5. The question of developing institutional investors to improve the mix of investors: Because it is a relatively young market, currently, most investors in China's stock market are individual households. They know relatively little about risks and can afford to take little risk. They are susceptible to rumors and tend to follow others blindly in and out of the market, making the market more volatile and bringing losses to themselves. As the scope of the stock market continues to expand, developing institutional investors becomes a pressing issue. Today, we are in the process of implementing reform of the social security system. We should permit all kinds of insurance funds to get into the stock market in the form of long-term investment. At the same time, we should develop mutual funds and let professionals invest money for the medium-sized and small investors, so as to lower the risks of individual investors and make more profit for everyone. Institutional investors have special significance in China: Once organized, they will turn into legal entities and will no longer be private investments, thus satisfying the principle of making the public-ownership system the primary system and accelerating the development of the shareholding system and the stock market. Meanwhile, investing funds can effectively combat the rich clients' improper manipulation of the market, and we can make investments less of a gambler's game and turn short-term investments into long-term investments. The development of funds will make it easier for the publicly owned shares to be traded in the market and for the party and go vernment cadres to participate. But we must formulate laws as soon as possible, and fund development must be orderly and gradual. We should not develop closed-end funds, however. Some comrades say that closed-end funds are "more like stocks than stocks," and some say they are conducive to "speculations at both ends": At one end, money can be pooled to speculate on stocks, and at the other end, people can also speculate on the fund certificates which are traded in the market. In addition, issuing funds through internal allocation can cause more serious problems than those created by stock issuance. In my opinion, we should develop open-end funds. People can get in and out; the securities are not traded on the market. This is safer and better. 6. The question of using the securities markets to attract more foreign capital: Since the 1980's, circulation of international capital has been achieved primarily through the raising of share capital rather than debt financing. In the early days of refo rm and opening up, we relied primarily on foreign businesses' direct investments and commercial loans to attract foreign funds. In the wake of the development of China's securities markets, especially with the rise of the stock market, we have been able to adapt to the changing trends and satisfy foreign business's desire to invest in Chinese enterprises through stock purchases, and the issuance of stock to attract foreign capital has been put on top of the agenda since. Generally speaking, the goal of investing in China and sharing the economic fruits and profits can be reached equally through direct investments and stock purchases; the results are basically the same. But buying stocks makes the foreign businesses' investments even more versatile. They can buy and sell stocks as a way to choose their investment style and make more profit. Meanwhile, if China should modify or change its policies (or if foreign businesses believe that things are risky), they can promptly reduce or abandon their investment plans in China. Direct investments are not as convenient. Thus, issuing stocks to attract foreign capital is a new, more versatile way of raising capital. For this reason, in 1991, we began experimenting with issuing B-shares which were sold only to people living outside of Chinese territories. It was the first time we used equity rights to raise foreign capital, and it marked the first step in opening up the securities markets. Looking at the results of that experiment, it was a success. Since last year we have been studying Chinese enterprises that listed their stocks overseas. The merit of this approach is that it helps to make Chinese enterprises better known abroad and encourages enterprises to get into the international markets. It also introduces us to the advanced management experiences of foreign securities industry and helps us improve our own management of the securities markets. Through consultation with the Hong Kong United Stock Exchange and Securities Commission and others, and after reaching a consensus, four companies, including the Shanghai Petrochemical Company and Qingdao Brewery, have gone public in Hong Kong with their H-shares since July. They are traded on the Allied Exchange. This move has successfully opened up a new channel for utilizing foreign funds. Further Developing and Perfecting the Securities Markets As the socialist market economic system develops further, the securities markets must also become more sophisticated in order to adapt to the ever accelerating rate of economic growth. Thus, our main task in the next stage is to perfect the securities markets' many imperfections. 1. Let the securities markets operate within the scope of a complete legal system: It is a long process to draw up securities laws and regulations from scratch, and it is a long process to perfect those laws and regulations. Since the formation of the specialized supervisory and management organs last year, we have immediately worked on the formulation of other relevant laws and regulations. The State Council has just formally promulgated the "Temporary Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange," and the "Trial Method of Managing the Securities Exchanges" has also been announced by the Securities Commission. These are important steps toward standardizing the ways the securities markets operate. But China's securities law and regulation system is still imperfect. In particular, the "Corporate Law" and "Securities Law" and other basic laws and regulations are still being formulated. Today, besides focusing on the formulation of the "Corporate Law" and "Securities Law," we must work on the introduction of the "Method To Prevent Inside Trading and Fraud," "Regulations on the Management of State-Owned Stocks," "Code of Conduct for Securities Industry Personnel," "Method of Managing Domestic Enterprises' Issuance and Listing of Stocks Abroad," and other pertinent laws and regulations and the "detailed rules" of their implementation, so as to he lp the securities markets operate and develop steadily under a perfect legal system. 2. Smooth out the market's operating mechanisms: We must have smooth and coordinated market mechanisms in order to give full play to the functions of the securities markets. To perfect China's securities market mechanisms, we must not only learn from international experiences but also take into consideration China's own conditions. First, we must make the market more transparent, that is, we must make sure that all market information are made public. We did not do this a few years ago. The managing departments only asked that some information be disclosed at the time stocks were issued, and the investors knew very little about the listing enterprises. We did not have a system requiring full disclosure of information about the listing companies. The system of full disclosure is stipulated in the just-promulgated "Temporary Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange" and "Detailed Rules on Disclosure of Information on Companies Issuing Stocks." We must strictly enforce this provision. Second, we must smash separatism and promote the creation of a unified market. We have made great improvements in this area in the last few years, but there are still incidents of regional blockade and disregard of regulations, which obstruct the formation of a unified market. To solve this problem, we must work hard on the system as well as on the technical aspects. For example, we must have uniform laws and reg ulations, improve the exchanges, and acquire the technology and equipment to accommodate out-of-town membership. Third, we must study the question of circulation of publicly owned shares. In the pilot projects in the past, those shares basically could not be traded, and only personal shares could be traded in the market, which made it impossible for the stock market to fulfill its function to make structural adjustments of the state-owned asset base. This problem must be solved, but it is a complicated problem, because it involves the property rights system and the system of management and administration of state-owned properties. Furthermore, we must also reform and unify the listing companies' tax, financial, personnel, and wage systems and so on. We must actively give play to the functions of the intermediaries in the securities markets. We must further improve the securities markets' settlement and trusteeship systems and support the markets with modern technologies. 3. Standardize enterprises' transformation under the shareholding system: The shareholding companies operate very differently from the way the state-run enterprises operate. There are strict requirements put on the formers' internal power structure, profit allocation, reward policy, and administration and management. Today, everybody is going all out to transform enterprises under the shareholding system. They ignore standards, procedure, or requirements when reorganizing enterprises, and they have created many problems. Some enterprises just put a new label on the same old thing; their internal management mechanisms and decision-making structure have not changed. Others conceal important information, and shareholders incur losses as a result. Thus, we must exert some pressure and demand that enterprises follow regulations when converting to the shareholding system and that they truly change their management mechanisms, so that we can be sure that the listing companies are of high quality, and in turn, we can promot e the stock market's true prosperity. 4. Actively but steadily expand the scope of the stock market pilot project: To develop the market economy, we must greatly expand the stock market's capacity to meet the demands of enterprises' diverse fund gathering activities. When we improved the markets' laws and regulations and market mechanisms, we also set the policy to expand the stock market pilot project nationwide. This year, in accordance with the relevant economic growth policies and based on the listing capacity of exchanges, every province (municipality) will have one or two enterprises issuing stocks to the public to raise capital. This is an arduous task, because it is a large-scale, far-reaching, nationwide project, and many localities have no experience. We have a lot of work to do. But it is a very important task. It represents a big step forward for China's stock market experiment. The securities markets will make it increasingly easier for enterprises to gather funds. As far as the securities markets themselves are concerned, expanding the pilot project means an important test and promotion of the development and improvement of their management system, the securities exchanges' operating mechanisms, the securities merchants' services, and other intermediary service organizations. On the one hand, it will help us uncover problems and deficiencies, so that we can promptly make remedies, and on the other hand, it will train different types of professionals and lay a sound foundation for future market development. 5. Continue to explore ways to utilize the stock market to attract foreign investments: So far we have issued 30 B-share stocks. The experiments with B-shares prove that using the stock market to attract foreign capital is both versatile and effective. With regard to some of the problems in the B-shares market, we will step up efforts to come up with measures of improvement and will continue to experiment with the market. The trading of H-shares in Hong Kong has basically been a success. The series of documents on laws, accounting, and joint supervision worked out between us and the Hong Kong Allied Exchange and Securities Commission can be valuable when we make use of the securities markets of other major countries to raise funds.
