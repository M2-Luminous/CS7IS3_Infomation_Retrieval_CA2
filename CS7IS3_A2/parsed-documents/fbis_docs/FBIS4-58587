The morning Persian daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said in its editorial that the entire occupied territories plunged into strike and protest against the treacherous measure. The agreement is so scandalous that even 'Arafat primarily refused to sign its map appendix but eventually he was forced to do so under the U.S. pressures, the daily said. Although the Zionist enemy and its supporters intend to suppress and uproot the Palestine Islamic movement through their bullying methods, they should realize that 'Arafat is not the representative of the Palestinian nation. Lashing out at some of the reactionary Arab regimes for their collective treachery, it said that such regimes are not the guardians of the Palestinian nation. The daily added that the Palestinians have shown through their active presence in the occupied territories that they will not give in to such bullying acts. The paper stressed that the intifadah, the all-out uprising of the Palestinian nation, will have the final word in the occupied territories, adding that, the final word is the elimination of the occupying regime of Qods [Jerusalem]. Liberation of the occupied territories and annihilation of the usurpers is the only option before the Palestinian nation, concluded the paper.
