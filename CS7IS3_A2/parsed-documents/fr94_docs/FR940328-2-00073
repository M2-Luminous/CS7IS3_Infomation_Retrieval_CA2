FR940328-2-00073 FR940328-2-00048 In addition, the conduct of Mr. Dailey raises serious concerns about the adequacy of the NSSI security screening program during his tenure as Security Officer (November 1989 to May 1991). Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that we order NSSI to review security records in which Mr. Dailey was involved to assure that NSSI personnel granted unescorted access to NRC-licensed nuclear plants met access authorization and fitness-for-duty requirements. IV Accordingly, pursuant to sections 62, 63, 81, 103, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182, and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 26.27 and 10 CFR 50.5, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that: A.1. Nuclear support Services, Inc., remove Robert C. Dailey from participation in NRC-licensed or regulated activities for a period of five years from the date of this Order. A.2. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall, if contacted by another person considering employing Robert C. Dailey in NRC-licensed or regulated activities, advise that person of the existence of condition A. 1 of this order as well as the existence and conditions of the Order issued to Mr. Dailey. This condition is to remain in effect for a period of five years from the date of this Order. B.1. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall notify the NRC of the names of licensees who employ or have employed NSSI personnel whose recommendation for access authorization was handled by Mr. Dailey or by NSSI during Mr. Dailey's tenure as NSSI Security Officer between November 1989 and May 31, 1991. B.2. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall complete a review of all NSSI personnel security files processed during the period of November 1989 through May 31, 1991, to ensure that, based upon the information in the files, any NSSI personnel recommended for unescorted access to NRC-licensed nuclear plants during that period met applicable 10 CFR part 26 Fitness-for-Duty requirements and access authorization requirements for unescorted access in accordance with requirements applicable to NSSI's clients' security plans as prescribed in such clients' contracts with NSSI. B.3. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall advise the NRC, in writing, of the results of the review required by conditions B.1 and 2. within 60 days of the date of this Order.
