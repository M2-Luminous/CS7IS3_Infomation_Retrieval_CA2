Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong was talking to reporters at the end of a border inspection visit that took him to Surin, Sa Kaeo and Chanthaburi provinces. The Foreign Minister said the information from the fact-finding trip was very useful and he would do his best to resolve problems with Cambodia. The Foreign Minister was satisfied with the role of Thai authorities along the border, saying "they conducted themselves in accordance with Government policy." Sqn Ldr Prasong was briefed by senior Army commanders during his visit to Chong Chom Pass in Surin, Khlong Luk-Poipet border in Sa Kaeo and Saptari Pass in Chanthaburi. He said the morale of Thai soldiers in the region was high and they wanted to see peace along the border. In Surin, the Foreign Minister was briefed by Maj-Gen Sanan Maroengsit, commander of the Suranari Task Force in Buriram, Surin, Sisaket and Ubon Ratchthani provinces. The commander said a total of 26 artillery shells had landed in the area and the Task Force had evidence to prove that they were fired by Cambodian government forces. "We have pictures to prove our point but they (Phnom Penh troops) have steadfastly denied it," Maj-Gen Sanan told during the briefing. Besides, the commander added, his units had to tackle Cambodian bandits who often crossed into Thailand to steal cars. From there the Foreign Minister proceeded to Aranyaprathet district in Sa Kaeo province where he was briefed by Maj-Gen Niphon Pharannit, commander of the Burapha Task Force there. Maj-Gen Niphon told the Foreign Minister that he had prepared counter measures to deal with any spillover of the fighting between Cambodian government forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas into Thai territory. He pointed out that the conflict with Phnom Penh soldiers arose particularly from the fact that they used a different map to identify the border demarcation line. Thailand and Cambodia use different maps to identify the borderline, he said. In addition, Maj-Gen Niphon added, there was the problem of Cambodians fleeing the fighting into the province, kidnapping and smuggling. The Foreign Minister reiterated that the Government did not think that the problem of Cambodians fleeing the fighting into the province were just refugees and would be returned to their country in a few days when the situation was safe. He said the checkpoint between Khlong Luk and Poipet would not be opened until fighting in Cambodia stopped to ensure the safety of Thais entering the country. In Chanthaburi, the Foreign Minister visited Saptari checkpoint in Soi Dao district and met high-ranking officers of the Chanthaburi-Trat Task Force and senior provincial authorities including Governor Amon Ananthachai. The governor urged the Foreign Minister to discuss the possibility of opening temporary checkpoints to transport logs from Cambodia. Gem traders also sought help from the Foreign Minister to bring back their equipment confiscated by the Khmer Rouge. Meanwhile, fighting between the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge will escalate as both sides are mobilizing their forces in other parts of Banteay Meanchey province opposite Ta Phraya and Aranyaprathet districts, military sources said yesterday. Government soldiers and the guerrillas exchanged fire early yesterday in Thmar Puok, the sources said. The exchange of fire broke out after the guerrillas launched an attack with mortar and artillery shells in an attempt to seize the Seventh Division Battalion headquarters about 20 kilometers inside Cambodia from the Thai border in Ta Phraya. Casualties were not known. People living near a Khmer Rouge base at Phnum Malai are building new bunkers and repairing old ones to prepare for possible artillery shelling from fighting in Cambodia.
