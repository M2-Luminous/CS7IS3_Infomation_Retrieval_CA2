The sad information was reported to us by our correspondent in the Butare-Gitarama region, Wilson Ndayambaje who was present yesterday when the political director of the RPA, Colonel Frank Mugambage, was announcing the sad news to journalists. Before giving you a complete list of all the bishops and priests who were killed, let us see first how things happened. After the fall of Kabgayi at the hands of the RPA, 13 clergymen who were at Kabgayi were placed under the protection of eight soldiers of the RPA. But four of the soldiers who originate from Gitarama, left their comrades with whom they were supposed to ensure the security of the clergymen. They went to execute these clergymen. When the other four soldiers learned about this, they intervened and killed one of the rebellious soldiers while the other three ran away. Currently, a search is being conducted to find them and bring them to trial by a military tribunal. According to preliminary investigations, before evading the vigilance of their colleagues and going to accomplish their dirty job, the four boys, all from Gitarama, said that some of the bishops and priests had participated in the massacres perpetrated against the soldiers' families. The search for the three rebels continues so that they can be arrested and transferred for trial by the RPA. The complete list of those killed is as follows: Bishop Vincent Nsengiyunva, Bishop Thaddee Nsengiyunva, Bishop Joseph Ruzindana, Monseigneur (Innocent Gasabwoya), Father Rwabalinda, Father Ndaberetse, Father Francois Murego, Father Ntamugabumwe, Father [name indistinct] Mutabazi, Father Kayibanda, Father Richard [name indistinct], Father Aime Uwimana and (?priest) (Fidele Gahunzire). God be with them.
