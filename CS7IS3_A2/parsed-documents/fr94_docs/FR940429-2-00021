FR940429-2-00021 FR940429-2-00018 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Bonneville Power Administration DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR Bureau of Indian Affairs Intent To Prepare An Environmental Impact Statement and Floodplain and Wetlands Involvement for the Nez Perce Tribal Hatchery Project AGENCIES: Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Department of Energy (DOE) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of Interior (DOI). ACTION: Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) under section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321) and Notice of Floodplain and Wetlands Involvement. SUMMARY: BPA and BIA intend to prepare an EIS on the proposed Nez Perce Tribal Hatchery (NPTH) Project to try and rebuild naturally reproducing salmon runs in the watersheds of the Clearwater and Salmon River sub-basins. BPA and BIA intend to decide whether or not to provide funding to construct, operate, and maintain the NPTH in these sub-basins. BIA, as trustee for Tribal trust resources, will participate as co-lead agency with BPA. The Nez Perce Tribe (NPT) is the primary cooperating agency. The EIS will evaluate the potential environmental effects of the proposed action to construct and operate the NPTH and alternatives to the proposed action. This action may involve floodplains and wetlands located in the State of Idaho and within Nez Perce, Clearwater, and Idaho counties. In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements (10 CFR part 1022), BPA and BIA will prepare a floodplains and wetlands assessment and would perform this proposed action in a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplains and wetlands. The assessment and a floodplain statement of findings will be included in the EIS being prepared for the proposed project in accordance with NEPA. DATES: BPA and BIA have established a 45-day scoping period (beginning April 29, 1994) during which affected landowners, concerned citizens, special interest groups, local governments, fishery and environmental groups, and any other interested parties are invited to comment on the scope of the EIS. Scoping will help BPA and BIA ensure that a full range of issues related to the proposed action and alternatives to the proposed action are addressed in the EIS, and also will identify significant or potentially significant environmental impacts that may result from the proposed action and alternatives. Written comments should be sent to the address below no later than June 13, 1994. Comments may also be made at two EIS scoping meetings which will be held at: May 24, 1994, 6 to 9 p.m., Red Lion_Downtowner, Teton Room, 1800 Fairview, Boise, Idaho 83702, and May 25, 1994, 6 to 9 p.m., National Park Service, Nez Perce National Historical Park, Highway 95, Spalding, Idaho 83551. At the informal meetings, the NPT, project sponsor and primary developer of the associated NPTH Master Plan, will present information on technical aspects of the NPTH Project. Written information also will be available, and BPA and NPT staff will answer questions and accept oral and written comments. Subsequently, a draft EIS (DEIS) will be circulated for public review and comment, and BPA and BIA will hold public comment meetings at the locations designated above. BPA and BIA will then prepare a final EIS which will consider and respond to comments received on the DEIS. ADDRESSES: BPA and BIA invite comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of the DEIS. Send comment letters, requests to be placed on the project mailing list, and/or requests for more information to the Public Involvement Manager, Lynn W. Baker, BPA&hyph;ALP, P.O.
