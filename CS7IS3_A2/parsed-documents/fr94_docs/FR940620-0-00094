FR940620-0-00094 FR940620-0-00029 4.1.3(8)␣Entrances ADAAG 4.1.3(8) requires that, at a minimum, 50 percent of all public entrances be accessible. In addition, where provided, one direct entrance to an enclosed parking garage and one entrance to a pedestrian tunnel or elevated walkway, must be accessible. The provision also states that, ``where feasible, accessible entrances shall be those used by the majority of the people visiting or working in the building'' (i.e., a principal entrance). The interim final guidelines provide that facilities subject to title II of the ADA must include all principal public entrances when meeting this requirement. This provision does not require that the number of accessible entrances exceed 50 percent of all public entrances or require an increase in the total number of principal public entrances planned for a facility. ADAAG 3.5 (Definitions) defines principal public entrances as any public entrance to a building or facility which is designed and constructed to accommodate a substantial flow of pedestrian traffic to a major function in the facility. For example, entrances of facilities subject to title II of the ADA which are designed to be heavily used by the public and connect exterior facilities with interior amenities and services must be included in the calculation of accessible entrances. This definition includes criteria to consider when determining which entrances are principal public entrances. Comment. A few commenters stated that a clear definition of ``principal entrance'' should accompany the requirement if one were adopted. Response. The guidelines define a ``principal public entrance'' as any public entrance to a building or facility which is designed and constructed to accommodate a substantial flow of pedestrian traffic to a major function of the facility. For example, an entrance with multiple doorways is generally intended to accommodate a greater flow of pedestrian traffic. The definition also provides criteria for distinguishing principal public entrances from other entrances (e.g., the embellishment of an entryway, the size of the doorway or any other design strategy which would make one entrance stand out prominently from another entrance). Comment. The NPRM presented eight options for requiring accessible entrances in facilities which are subject to title II of the ADA. The options ranged from no additional requirements to the existing ADAAG to requiring all entrances to be accessible. The NPRM sought comment on these options and asked that commenters state their preference and justification for a particular option. The majority of comments favored some modification of ADAAG for State and local governments. State and local government agencies and code officials favored options one and two, which are described below. Organizations representing persons with disabilities and State and local government agencies representing persons with disabilities favored options six and eight, which are described below. Design professionals and national professional organizations were divided between these two groups of options. Option one was to retain the requirements of ADAAG 4.1.3(8) as written without any additional requirements for principal entrances. Commenters supporting option one were concerned that providing additional accessible principal entrances would result in problems with site constraints (e.g. sloping streets in urban areas) and increase construction costs. Option two required that at least one principal entrance must be among those entrances required to be accessible by ADAAG 4.1.3(8). Commenters supporting this option acknowledged the importance of at least one accessible principal entrance. These commenters favored this option because it also allowed for greater design flexibility. Option six required all principal entrances to be accessible and allowed those principal entrances to be counted toward satisfying the requirements of ADAAG 4.1.3(8). Commenters supporting this option stated that relegating persons with disabilities to the ``side'', ``back'', or even basement entries does not afford them the same choice in accessing a building as other individuals, and that the use of these other entrances might force them to use a long and isolated route to gain entry to a building. Option eight required that all entrances be accessible. Commenters supporting this option considered it to be the best option to satisfy the intent of the legislation to stop discrimination against persons with disabilities while at the same time improving emergency egress. However, other commenters stated that this option would create difficult design problems when constructing new facilities on existing sites with steep terrain or restricted boundaries. Additionally, commenters pointed out that to require more public entrances to be accessible would decrease the design flexibility in constructing a facility. Response. The Board has adopted option six which requires facilities subject to title II of the ADA to include all principal public entrances when meeting the 50% requirement for accessible entrances in ADAAG 4.1.3(8)(a)(i). This option provides greater assurance that persons with disabilities will have access to the ``front'' entrance and may prevent excessive travel distances along isolated routes. The provision does not require an increase in the number of entrances planned for a facility. The number of planned entrances will be determined by the design of the facility. For example, if a new facility is planned with four principal public entrances, then ADAAG 4.1.3(8)(a)(i) would require only two of the four principal public entrances to be accessible. It would be unreasonable to require all entrances to be accessible in cases where new construction, within existing urban areas, had to contend with existing slopes and other site considerations, such as existing sidewalks and nearby property lines. 56 FR 35419. The legislative history makes clear that not every feature of every building needs to be accessible but rather a high level of convenient access is contemplated. H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, pt.2, at 118. ADAAG §4.1.1(5)(a) describes the conditions when structural impracticability due to terrain would prevent full compliance with requirements for accessibility. Structural impracticability is a very narrow exception and, as explained in the legislative history, does not apply to situations where a building is constructed on ``hilly'' terrain or on a plot of land with steep slopes. H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, pt.2, at 120. This provision will provide a greater level of convenient access as contemplated in the legislative history. Comment. Several commenters thought these options would require expensive remodeling or destruction of historically significant elements of existing buildings and facilities. Other commenters wanted clarification that the existing sections of ADAAG covering alterations and historic preservation would prevail over these options with regard to existing buildings.
