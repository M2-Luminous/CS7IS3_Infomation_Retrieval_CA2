Utkin, candidate of military sciences: "Ambushes in Modern Conditions"] [Text] Ambushes have not lost their importance. The reduction in the personnel strength of the armed forces and the increased demands on their combat effectiveness force them to look for the most effective methods of opposing the enemy. The article by Col N. Utkin on page 20 talks about how to improve the effectiveness of employing ambushes. In recent years, the journal has more than once dealt with the issue of organizing ambushes by small subunits of the Ground Troops. Authors of articles have talked in detail about ambushes of the Great Patriotic War and shared experience acquired in the Republic of Afghanistan. As is clear from the articles, ambushes have not lost their importance today. On the contrary, the reduction in the personnel strength of the armed forces and the increased demands on their combat effectiveness force them to look for the most effective methods of opposing the enemy. Ambushes were widely used in all types of combat. In an offensive they are usually set up on the path of withdrawing enemy subunits, on movement routes of enemy reserves and reinforcements, on supply routes, on sectors of a possible breakout of encirclement by defending groupings, and at sites of planned landing of sabotage-reconnaissance groups and airborne assault forces. In some cases, the goal of ambushes involves making a surprise engagement of the enemy, misleading him as to the true intentions of friendly forces, and disrupting command and control. In other cases, the goal is to ascertain the composition and intentions of units being transferred to the forward edge of the battle area and to perform other reconnaissance measures. In a meeting engagement, ambushes are created in forward units and by reconnaissance bodies on avenues of movement of superior enemy forces. The main task here is to determine their location, composition, and nationality, and, if possible, reduce the pace of reaching a favorable line. In the defense, ambushes acquire special importance in the security zone of defending forces and when conducting mobile combat operations. Small in makeup, they are situated between lines and on the line of withdrawal, in the first and subsequent trenches, at the forward position, at battle outposts, on the flanks, and in gaps. Ambushes are able to use surprise fire in short periods of time to inflict appreciable losses on advancing subunits, which front-line soldiers and Afghan veterans proved repeatedly. In recent years, when the predominant part of power confrontations in the world took on the nature of armed conflicts and local wars, the importance of ambush operations have increased even more. Almost daily information is received about the use of ambushes in one or another region to capture weapons, equipment, or hostages, capture or destroy hostile groupings, and eliminate command and control bodies, politicians, and statesmen. In certain regions of the "near abroad," ambushes have become an almost everyday phenomenon. All this indicates that today one must not be limited to introducing into combat training practice only experienced amassed in the past for organizing and conducting ambushes. This experience must be constantly improved, primarily based on comprehensive use of modern models of equipment and armament. As is known, ambushes are sufficiently effective when well-trained, small subunits are assigned to them. The proportion of ambushes in their tactics is steadily increasing. Therefore, in my view, there is a need (if only from the standpoint of development of theory) to make more precise the concept apparatus as it applies to ambush operations and to define them by type. For some reason, there is the opinion that ambushes are predominantly a sphere of activity of reconnaissance platoons and companies. Scouts, they say, are better trained; moreover, they have special equipment and gear... It seems, to some degree, this is not unfounded, especially if you consider that ambushes are examined in quite great detail when training reconnaissance bodies. At the same time, there are numerous positive examples of operations in ambushes by subunits of other branches of troops as well. Ambush garrisons led by a military governor were created in Rus back in the 11th-13th centuries. Later, ambush regiments existed in the 13th-17th centuries. Surprise and swift attacks by small military units often had a decisive influence on the overall outcome of a battle. A graphic confirmation of this is the effectiveness of employing ambush detachments in the Kulikovo Battle, the events 1812, World War I, the Civil War, and the Great Patriotic War. In our days, the Military Encyclopedic Dictionary gives several interpretations of this concept. The most successful of them is the one defining an ambush as a "military (partisan) subunit located secretly and in advance for making a surprise attack against the approaching enemy." Here, it seems, it is necessary finally to arrange all points relative to typing ambushes according to composition and missions to be accomplished. In my view, according to composition, they may be reconnaissance, motorized rifle, tank, antitank, artillery, flamethrower, aviation (helicopter, aircraft), antiaircraft, and finally special (chemical, engineer, and in the future those based on using weapons with new physical principles--combat robots, electronic, and so forth). Their basis will become individual fire weapons (combat and special), squads (crews), platoons, companies (batteries), or groups specially created for some period of time. Such formations can easily be reinforced with other forces and assets if necessary and made mixed or combined. Ambushes can be broken down according to purpose into antitank, anti-personnel, anti-air, anti-landing, reconnaissance, false, containing, primary, alternate, and special ambushes. As is known, the greatest effectiveness of an ambush is achieved if surprise is possible. The effect of unexpectedness is at work here. Fire from close range and a decisive attack inflict especially noticeable damage on the opposing side. For example, a tank crew under the command of Lieutenant P. Gudzya (later Hero of the Soviet Union and colonel-general) in a fast-moving battle near the village of Nefedovo (Moscow Oblast) in the fall of 1941 destroyed 10 out of 18 fascist tanks, making the rest beat a hasty retreat. Speed of actions is equally important. You see, an enemy that has a several-fold force superiority to the ambush can cope with confusion, and then the situation will take shape not in the "hunter's" favor. In other words, subunits must be able to execute a quick disengagement and withdrawal. Experience amassed also attests to the need to provide (which officers sometimes forget, unfortunately) local security of ambushes so as not to be subjected to a surprise attack themselves. However, I repeat: In addition to the need to take into account in training practice the experience of past years, something new must be added to it, based on a more complete use of the achievements of military science and the combat characteristics of modern equipment and armament. There are quite a few capabilities whose realization would have made it possible to increase the effectiveness of employing ambushes. I would like to call readers' attention to just a few of them. It is no secret that mobile weapons operating, depending on the mission received, on a platoon--company scale or independently are usually used to set up the ambushes. With skilled organization of ambushes, the tanks, infantry combat vehicles, self-propelled artillery mounts, self-propelled antiaircraft mounts, and other weapons making up the ambushes in the vast majority of cases unnoticed by enemy reconnaissance, and their surprise fire from close range prove to be deadly for its main body. At the same time, the effectiveness of engaging the attacking forces will increase if artillery and air subunits enter the fighting. The fire of the senior commander's forces and assets not only will support the operations of those participating in the ambush and inflict even more damage on the enemy but also will to a considerable extent contribute to the successful disengagement and withdrawal of weapons to new positions. Therefore, it seems to me that suggestions about including artillery observers and air controllers with communications assets and means of transport are not unfounded. However, there are a number of problems here. For example, questions of coordinating the ambush not only with artillery and aviation but also with subunits from which it is assigned remain on the agenda. In any event, I dare say that in Afghanistan a different trend was seen. Ambushes there sometimes ended up in a trap themselves, and in fighting a numerically superior enemy could only count on their own forces, since help from the outside was late. Based on the specific tactical situation, it is advisable to allocate some mobile assets to occupy fire positions on the flanks and ahead of the forces defending in the security zone. They are to open surprise aimed fire on the enemy when he approaches effective fire range. When necessary (depending on the importance of the target), artillery and aviation fire is called in. It makes sense to use high-precision munitions for more reliable engagement of the enemy. After accomplishing the mission, combat vehicles withdraw under the cover of the senior commander's assets and take up their places in the dispositions of the subunit that sent them. Further development of this variant of operations involves the participation of other forces in destroying the enemy and in transforming ambushes into complexes of various weapons. A second direction of their improvement is the use of two groups as part of the ambushes: Diversionary and combat groups, and in individual cases a prisoner "snatch" group (Figure 1). Such ambushes operated actively against the limited contingent of Soviet troops in Afghanistan; and unfortunately, not without success. Diversionary groups sought in every way possible to create the greatest noise effect and delay the movement of our subunits with the aid of barriers, manmade landslides (Figure 2 [not reproduced]), and mixed minefields. Figure 1. Organization of ambush based on experience of combat operations in Afghanistan A diversionary group usually opened fire when clearing a passage in obstacles. The main role in engaging the enemy was assigned to the combat group "clearing" the way for the prisoner snatch group. After carrying out their mission, the rebels swiftly withdrew over pre-planned paths (in the vicinity of Feyzabad) or roads (in the vicinity of Ghazni). A further increase in the effectiveness of this method of ambush operations is seen in using improved and advanced armament; for example, infrared sighting and observation devices, combat robots, remote-controlled weapons, and so forth. The enemy can be pinned down by using remote minelaying devices, helicopter mobile obstacle construction detachments, and controlled minefields. Main engagement of the enemy is accomplished by using artillery, army aviation, remotely piloted vehicles, and others. The third direction assumes creation of specially prepared combat assault groups [UBG's]. These groups fought in Vietnam and made a good showing. The composition of each of them during those years was limited to 3-4 people equipped with automatic weapons with silencers, "Mukha" rifle and handheld antitank grenade launchers, special mines, and portable radios. Today, in my opinion, it is quite realistic to create up to 18 UBG's in a motorized rifle company and up to 54 UBG's in a motorized rifle battalion. Operating primarily at night on enemy-occupied territory (in the security zone after it is crossed by the advancing forces), each combat assault group, changing the ambush site two or three times a night, is able to destroy up to three enemy objects such as a tank, infantry combat vehicle, armored personnel carrier, electronic equipment, military equipment, command and staff vehicle, launcher, fuel supply vehicle, ammunition vehicle, and so forth. Consequently, a battalion's UBG's are able to destroy 150-200 pieces of armament and equipment in a 24-hour period. Combat assault groups operating independently or in platoons could also remain in the enemy's rear area for some time after withdrawal of the forward detachment and conduct sabotage operations. To increase their survivability, in the planned area of operation it is advisable to set up in advance a network of bunkers with stores of ammunition, explosives, food, communications equipment, medicines, and also to equip rest areas. In the future, combat assault groups could be part of special subunits intended for conducting ambushes, which, I am convinced, bear a specific nature and require special training. In conclusion, I will note that today Russia's armed forces have amassed a large amount of experience in organizing and conducting ambush operations. Its importance in training troops is certainly very great. However, it will produce the most return only if new methods of operations are developed on its basis, fully corresponding to the modern nature of combined-arms combat.
