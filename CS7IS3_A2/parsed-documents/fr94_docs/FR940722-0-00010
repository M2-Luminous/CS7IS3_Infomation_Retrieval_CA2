FR940722-0-00010 FR940722-0-00002 (A) The agreement shall be for a term of 1 year or longer. (B) The agreement shall be entered into on or before its effective date. (C) The agreement may be amended according to its terms, but no more frequently than annually except in the event that a party to the agreement is merged or reorganized, or in the event of a reallotment pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. The agreement shall include a provision addressing how the agreement will be amended if a reallotment is required by paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. (D) On or before the effective date of the agreement, a certified copy of the agreement, and any amendments thereto, shall be sent to the field office of the Farm Credit Administration responsible for examining the institution. A copy shall also be sent within 30 calendar days of adoption to the bank's other affiliated associations. (E) Unless the parties otherwise agree, if the bank and the association have not entered into a new agreement on or before the expiration of an existing agreement, the existing agreement shall automatically be extended for another 12 months, unless either party notifies the Farm Credit Administration in writing of its objection to the extension prior to the expiration of the existing agreement. (F) In the absence of an agreement between a Farm Credit Bank or an agricultural credit bank and one or more associations, or in the event that an agreement expires and at least one party has timely objected to the continuation of the terms of its agreement, the following formula shall be applied with respect to the allocated investments held by those associations with which there is no agreement (nonagreeing associations), and shall not be applied to the allocated investments held by those associations with which the bank has an agreement (agreeing associations): ( 1 ) The allotment formula shall be calculated annually. ( 2 ) The permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank shall be computed as of the date that the existing agreement terminates, using a 3-month average daily balance, excluding the allocated investment from nonagreeing associations but including any allocated investments of agreeing associations that are allotted to the bank under applicable allocation agreements. The permanent capital ratio of each nonagreeing association shall be computed as of the same date using a 3-month average daily balance, and shall be computed excluding its allocated investment in the bank. ( 3 ) If the permanent capital ratio for the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(F)( 2 ) of this section is 7 percent or above, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association whose permanent capital ratio calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(F)( 2 ) of this section is 7 percent or above shall be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the association. ( 4 ) If the permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(F)( 2 ) of this section is 7 percent or above, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association whose capital ratio is below 7 percent shall be allotted to the association until the association's capital ratio reaches 7 percent or until all of the investment is allotted to the association, whichever occurs first. Any remaining unallotted allocated investment shall be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the association. ( 5 ) If the permanent capital ratio of the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(F)( 2 ) of this section is less than 7 percent, the amount of additional capital needed by the bank to reach a permanent capital ratio of 7 percent shall be determined, and an amount of the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association shall be allotted to the Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank as follows: ( i ) If the total of the allocated investments of all nonagreeing associations is greater than the additional capital needed by the bank, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association shall be multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the amount of capital needed by the bank and whose denominator is the total amount of allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations, and such amount shall be allotted to the bank. Next, if the permanent capital ratio of any nonagreeing association is less than 7 percent, a sufficient amount of unallotted allocated investment shall then be allotted to each nonagreeing association, as necessary, to increase its permanent capital ratio to 7 percent, or until all such remaining investment is allotted to the association, whichever occurs first. Any unallotted allocated investment still remaining shall be allotted 50 percent to the bank and 50 percent to the nonagreeing association. ( ii ) If the additional capital needed by the bank is greater than the total of the allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations, all of the remaining allocated investments of the nonagreeing associations shall be allotted to the bank.
