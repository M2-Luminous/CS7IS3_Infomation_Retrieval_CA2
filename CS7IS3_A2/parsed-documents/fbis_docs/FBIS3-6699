In a meeting with Japanese reporters traveling with him on his China trip, Hosokawa said he is not thinking of calling general elections until a new electoral system formally replaces the old electoral system under which the 511 members have been elected. The new system calls for electing 300 members via single-seat constituencies and 200 via proportional representation. Hosokawa also said he has no plans to release further data or summon witnesses before a parliamentary session in connection with a 100 million yen loan from the now defunct Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin.
