The occasion was to hold an "open hearing" on the atomic energy policy, and this was the first such experience for the commission. The purpose of holding the open hearing was for the commission to listen to views from extensive sectors of the people including those who are opposed to the use of atomic energy, and thus to take wide-ranging views into the long-term programs which will become the foundation for the nation's atomic energy policy. The commission took caution to be "fair" by having a preparatory committee -- consisting of academics and specialists -- select the representatives to speak in the hearing. The open hearing was held in acceptance of critical voices charging that the STA's "policies on atomic energy tend to be decided through maneuverings of officials behind the scenes." Director General Eda, since he was named to the post in August, has emphasized he will conduct "open atomic energy administration," and is known to have "instructed the officials to make open discussions possible." What brought a change to the STA's atomic energy administration was the uproar over the shipment of plutonium in January 1993. When plutonimum was shipped in from France, the government tried to treat it as a secret, and hide, information on the navigation plan and timetable of the plutonimum carrier on the grounds of "needs to assure security" for it. But this caused complaints not only from antinuclear groups but also from the countries, waters of which the transport ship had to pass through. Plutonium is a substance extracted from spent fuel in atomic power stations, and the government thinks the substance will prove to be a long-term energy resource of dependable supply. But the uproar over the plutonium shipment in January was something that betrayed the government's expectations very much, and the incident has since turned into an issue which is likely to impact the fundamentals of the atomic energy administration of Japan. That being the case, it can be said that a key to the success of future atomic enegy administration lies not only in whether the safety of atomic energy and plutonium can or cannot be assured but also in how well the government's intention to use it peacefully can be understood by the people of the nation and other countries. It was for this reason that Japan came to present its own proposal on international control of plutonium in September -- in beginning of the work to build up the atmosphere of the international community toward accepting peaceful use of the substance. The allocation for atomic power projects in the STA budget is whopping, holding 55.6 percent of the total (in 1993) -- way over 27 percent assigned to space projects. The AEC's stand of rejecting "interferences" by any other offices has been a target of criticism. From the first day of its birth, the AEC has been chided as "a commission practicing Monroeism." Of course, Ishida, director of the agency's Atomic Energy Bureau, himself insists "Monroeism is no longer here." In Charge of Science-Related Budget Lately, what has been growing in the agency is the work of coordinating policies on science and technology. The agency is acting as the government's traffic cop on research and development projects initiated by ministries and agencies under their jurisdiction. It is also helping in preparing the groundwork for research efforts and training personnel. The STA holds legal power to regulate policies with regard to making estimates on science and technology-related expenses of the entire government. As such, it has the right to check the contents of budget demands of the government offices, but it does not try to exercise the right. A senior official of the STA Secretariat explained: "We do not want to invite complaints from other government offices by exercising the regulatory right. After all, their increases in science and technology budget contribute to promoting interests of the STA." What the STA considers important is the Science and Technology Conference (chaired by Prime Minister Hosokwa) in which the STA and the Ministry of Education jointly serve as the secretariat. The conference is attended by ministers of science and technology-related offices. Projects supported by the conference are as good as having been approved by the government in fact. Preparing groundwork at the conference is important, and the conference is the arena where the STA carries out its function as a regulatory office. One new task facing the STA is the preparation of the foundation for research projects that transcend borders of government offices. Kinju Atarashi, director of the agency's Science and Technology Promotion Bureau, said a "symbolic project" is the intra-ministry research information network being considered as a new project of 1994. Its aim is to connect the research information networks of all ministries and agencies, and to put the STA in charge of making budget demands on it.
