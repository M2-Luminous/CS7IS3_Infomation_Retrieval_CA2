Florida Gas Transmission Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;653&hyph;000] Take notice that on July 11, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FTG), 1400 Smith Street, P. O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1188 filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;653&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate a new point of delivery in Iberville Parish, Louisiana under FTG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;553&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. FTG states that the new delivery point in Iberville Parish, Louisiana, to be called Lake Chicot delivery point, was requested by Iberville Parish Natural Gas (Iberville), a municipality engaged in the local distribution of natural gas to certain communities in Iberville Parish, Louisiana for the ultimate end-use of commercial, industrial and residential gas consumption. FTG states that the estimated cost to FTG of the proposed construction is $40,000 which Iberville will reimburse. FTG notes that Iberville will construct approximately 850 feet of 2-inch connecting pipe, the meter station, and related appurtenant facilities and FTG will own and operate the facilities constructed by Iberville. FTG proposes to transport and deliver on an interruptible basis under its Rate Schedule ITS&hyph;1, up to 300 MMBtu per day and up to 109,500 MMBtu annually at the new delivery point. FTG states that since the proposed gas deliveries at the new delivery point will be on an interruptible basis, there will be no impact on FTG's peak day delivery but annual deliveries could be affected, up to 109,500 MMBtu.
