Those with foresight should instead use this opportunity to buy shares in large and medium-sized State enterprises which are debt-ridden but promising, said economist Li Yining of Beijing University. His view was echoed by the country's other leading economists and officials at a seminar on Baoan Group's modern enterprise system set up. Profits of the Shenzhen-based Baoan Group, the country's first enterprise to introduce a shareholding system, soared in the past few years thanks to its involvement in real estate. And the real estate industry has enjoyed a great boom since Deng Xiaoping reiterated in 1992 that the economy would speed up. As thousands of foreign firms flood the country, the real estate sector has grown to such an extent that China seems to resemble a vast construction site, with cranes and bulldozers everywhere. When inflation hit double digits late last year, the central government decided to put the brakes on the economy. Though a soft landing was intended, real estate was hit by a slow down in fixed-assets investment. Beijing and Shanghai notwithstanding, the real estate market has hit an all-time low. Many domestic and overseas developers have difficulties selling million-dollar office buildings and luxury villas. "The present situation shows that, though investing in real estate is lucrative, it is a risky business," said Dong Fureng, honorary director of the Economics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Despite the promise of high profits, businesses expecting a stable return on their investment should not spend all their money on real estate, Dong said. The best bet for investors is to look to State industries for good bargains, the economists agreed. And as the country moves from a planned to a market economy, many State firms have been cut from government loans and cheap raw materials. It's reported that more than one-third of the large and medium-sized State enterprises are losing money. Some of the companies are well-equipped and can turn out quality products. What they lack is a ready source of capital. Others are staffed by highly-qualified technical and managerial personnel, but lack the funds to renovate and improve the quality of their products. "This situation has created the best possible opportunity for big investors to take over industries -- through buying and holding shares," said Wang Yuzhao, an economist with Development Research Centre under the State Council. But investors face the difficult task of deciding which industry to invest in. The economists offered some suggestions: -- Select factories or firms which have a potential for further development, said Wu Jinglian, an economist with the Development Research Centre of the State Council. Investors should not focus on single industries like real estate and electronics. Smart ones will carefully study the government's investment policies, development plans and the market rules before deciding the direction of investment, Wu said. What's more, they will benefit from the research experience of Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. -- Special attention should be paid to the industries or trades that are neglected by most investors, suggested Fan Hengshan, deputy director of Comprehensive Planning and Trial Department under the State Commission for Economic Restructuring. It's always too late to start your engine when others are already halfway to the end," Fan said. "To ensure a leading position, one has to look for new destinations that are later on to be targeted by others." -- A breakthrough can be made in the sections that link different industries or trades, Fan said. As the economy develops, many new trades and industries will start. Those who invest in these industries and trades first will have a good chance to dominate them. Some examples are chain stores and express mail service. The seminar participants are also optimistic on the future of investment in the west, which is comparatively underdeveloped but boasts rich natural resources. "The fast development along the east coast has a lot to attribute to the overseas investment, which on the other hand have also benefited the investors a lot," Wang Yuzhao. "Now it's time for the enterprises in the east to transfer their labour-intensive industries to the western part of the country. Such a transfer and investment will benefit both the east and the west." Agriculture is another good bet for the investors. Now that agriculture production, especially in the southeast, is stagnant because a lot of arable farmland has been deserted, investors should step in to take over. Considerable profits can be made by developing modern farming through a combination of planting, breeding and developing concerned industries like farming machinery, fertilizer, pesticide, feed and processing industries. Agricultural strategies guarantee these investors will enjoy long-term preferential policies and farm products can expect a burgeoning market now that living standards are finally improving, the economists pointed out. Hong Yamin, director of the Real Estate Research Institute affiliated to Beijing Economics Institute, however, disagrees with the above economists and officials. "The experience of our more developed neighbouring countries and regions shows that there should be three to five real estate fevers in the process of development," she said. "Whoever can survive the temporary low ebb will come out big winners." She suggested, instead of pouring money into the foreign-oriented luxury buildings, investors should invest in the apartment and office buildings that cater to the needs of common folk and domestic enterprises. "There is a huge market in them," she said.
