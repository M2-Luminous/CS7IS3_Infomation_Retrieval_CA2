[Begin Grachev recording] The fact that Georgia and Abkhazia have now signed inspires optimism, because the Georgian leadership has started acknowledging that the Abkhaz leadership does exist. But, once again, one can sign as many documents as one wants, provided there is enough paper. But the important thing is practical implementation. I personally have occasionally acted as a peace-broker at the request of Armenia's and Azerbaijan's defense ministers, to settle the Karabakh problem. While they are at the negotiating table, everything looks fine: I bring them together, they kiss and shake hands, have lunch together -- but when they get back to their countries, everything starts anew. I have tried three times, and I have told them not to expect me to do it the fourth time round. After all, I am not a peace-maker, I am a defense minister. [end recording]
