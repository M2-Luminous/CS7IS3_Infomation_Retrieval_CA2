Anatoliy Sobchak issued a directive to relieve Vyacheslav Shcherbakov from his duties as the vice mayor. Directive No. 375, dated 20 April says: "In keeping with Minister of Defense Order No. 0831 to place...Rear Admiral Vyacheslav Shcherbakov under the command of the Navy commander in chief, having relieved him of his duties as the vice mayor." Judging by what Vyacheslav Shcherbakov himself is saying, however, the out-of-favor vice mayor has no intention of parting with his office in Smolnyy just like that. "I am amazed at the groundlessness of this document from a legal standpoint, especially considering that its author is a doctor of juridical science," he said. "Leaving aside the fact that the number of the minister of defense's order is incorrect, the mayor distorts in principle the contents of the order. I have been placed under the command of the Navy commander in chief since 28 December. And only he may decide what I am to do. At this point he is convinced that I should continue working in the organs of executive authority because, among other things, it is for the benefit of the Navy. "All of this is even more groundless because on 14 April, with the consent of the commander in chief, I requested to be discharged from the Navy, since I had decided to devote myself to work in the City Assembly." [Tyagniryadno] What will you do next? [Shcherbakov] I will have to challenge the mayor's directive. I was elected vice mayor by the city's population, and I cannot submit to the decision of one person. I will attach my explanations and forward these documents to the procurator. I am sure that the law is on my side. Vyacheslav Shcherbakov still is permitted to come to Smolnyy--yesterday morning he was in his office. This is not the mayor's first attempt to get rid of his recalcitrant deputy: As is known, the former confederates have long had serious disagreements both on the issues of city management and in their political leanings. For a long time the vice mayor was practically in disgrace. During the events of September-October of last year, Vyacheslav Shcherbakov's staff was disbanded and he himself suspended from duties for a while. Nor was he included in the new city government. So far, however, despite all the mayor's efforts, Vyacheslav Shcherbakov unfailingly has been able to keep the vice mayor's suite.
