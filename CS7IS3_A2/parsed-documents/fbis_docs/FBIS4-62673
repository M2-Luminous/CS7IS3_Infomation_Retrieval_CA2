There are no corresponding test sites on the Republic's territory. When there was just one army, Belorussian Air Defense units went to testing grounds in Russia. Yet since the "nationalization" of armies the road there has been closed. According to Lt.-Gen. Valeriy Kostenko, commander in chief of the Belorussian Air Defense Force, this summer Belorussian missile workers can again practice combat firing in Russia. Our countries, he said, do not intend to destroy the integral air defense system.
