The goal of the agreement is to guarantee sufficiently to authorities dealing with foreigners and to the courts that the Kurds are not facing the death penalty in the event of their deportation, Kanther told journalists in Mannheim today. However, the PKK is no "Robin Hood group," but a criminal organization, "and is being treated as such in Germany." Kanther stressed that assurances by the Turkish Government that torture is not used by the state in dealing with people who think differently would be sufficient. The minister reported that after the ban of the PKK at the end of 1993, about 30 affiliated organizations were also forbidden. The overwhelming majority of the Kurds living in Germany do not want to have anything to do with the PKK. Bonn is interested in a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish issue in Turkey and feels sympathy for the maltreated people in the civil war zone. However, this has nothing to do with the prosecution of terrorism in Germany. "I do not care why somebody erects burning barricades on the roads. He is a criminal," the minister stressed.
