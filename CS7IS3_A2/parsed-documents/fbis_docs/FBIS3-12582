The decision by Kuala Lumpur to ban British firms from government contracts worth billions of dollars has set a trend for the rest of the Third World countries to follow. Though these underdeveloped countries have not modern technology for which they depend on the West, they have huge markets which can be used as leverage against the coercive policies of the West. In the past Europeans had used trade as a launching pad for the furtherance of their imperialistic ventures. But the West should understand that this is not the 17th century. The East is now quite capable of protecting its hard earned freedom. The Malaysia-UK row started when the British Press alleged that top government officials in Kuala Lumpur including Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad had received kickbacks form British firms and the revolation of connections between arms and aid donations. The British Government argues that it has been using aid donations to boost weapons sale in order to salvage British ailing arms industry. The Malaysian decison to stop dealing with British should serve as a beacon for the rest of the Asian countries. This should be specially so in case of major nations such as China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan who may not have as sound a technological base at present but are rapidly catching up with the West. China can provide the leadership that is vitally needed in a world where regional trade groups such as European Community are increasingly becoming cartels to protect the interest of its members. It may not be out of place to refer to the EC trade representative's statement warning that his organisation will not allow any country to isolate one of its members for discriminatory trade ban on political grounds. He was commenting on China's threat to impose sanctions on Britain because of the latter's policy on Hong Kong. With the West now realising that its economy and military power is steadily but surely declining, it is desperately searching for new markets. Europe is already united under the banner of European Economic Community and Africa has not enough purchasing power. Thus Asia remains the only continent whose huge markets can save the sinking economy of the West specially the United States which according to one of its former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, is to lose its status of a superpower in a decade. It is not surprising at all that Kissinger has suggested that the United States should assume the 19th century role of the Britain in order to make sure that Asia does not unite under a single power. Kissinger's statements must serve as an eye opener for those who still believe that the proposed new world order means anything less than 21st century equivalent of neocolonialism. Henry Kissinger has even gone to the extent of reminding his countrymen that they have fought two wars to make sure that Eurasia is not controlled by a single power centre implying that the Americans should be ready to go to war again if needed. Kissinger's utterance that the United States has learned to live with a united Europe makes it abundantly clear that the United States should be concentrating on promoting the forces of discard in Asia. [sentence as published] Though Henry Kissinger no more holds an office, he gives expression to the contemporary US policies on Asia. Examined in the context of Pakistan's proximity to the Central Asian states via Afghanistan the civil war in Pakistan's neighbourhood does not seem to be a coincidence. Since Afghanistan provides the closest access to the Central Asia instability in this region serves US interest in the best possible way. It helps Washington to keep the countries of the region specially Iran and Pakistan in a constant state tension and making it difficult for the regional powers to unite in a bloc encompassing Paksitan Afghanistasn, Iran and Central Asian states of the former Soviet Union. For us in Pakistan the lesson is very clear. The policy of staying away from Afghanistan runs counter to our interest. Islamabad will have to double its efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, without whose cooperation the creation of a regional economic bloc will remain only a dream.
