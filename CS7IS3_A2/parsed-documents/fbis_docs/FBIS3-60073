The president said that the drug trafficker, who was deported from Colombia, was one of the leading drug traffickers in Alto Huallaga and his capture is comparable to Abimael Guzman's. [Begin recording] [Fujimori] Chavez Penaherrera moved approximately 30 tons of drugs monthly and had his own airport in Campanilla. Every month he made approximately 40 flights and collected a total of $30 million. He was the main cocaine supplier for the Cali Cartel, which, in turn, exported almost 90 percent of that cocaine to the (United States). In short, this has truly been a harsh blow to the drug trade. [Unidentified reporter] What sentence will he get? [Fujimori] We have passed very timely legislation on drug trafficking. Now we can give El Vaticano the maximum sentence: life in prison. There can be no doubt of that. I believe that for narcoterrorism, El Vaticano's capture is comparable to that of Abimael Guzman. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Fujimori] I repeat, two. (La Calena and Calavera) are brothers who have already been captured. [Editorial note: `La Calena' is Chavez Penaherrera's sister Berta Chavez and `Calavera' is Chavez Penaherrera's brother Humberto] There is an entire network of people who are involved and they have either been captured or are being investigated. This capture constitutes a terrible setback for narcoterrorism. [end recording] This is what President Fujimori said at the closing of the academic year at the National Fine Arts School. The president announced that a new fine arts institute is going to be built.
