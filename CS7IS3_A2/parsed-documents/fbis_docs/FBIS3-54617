In its resolutions, the convention stresses that the Israeli recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan should not necessarily correspond with physical Israeli presence on the Golan, "the extent and duration of which will be determined in the negotiations on the peace accord." The convention resolutions regarding Syria further say that MAPAM views the formula the prime minister coined -- according to which the depth of peace will match the depth of withdrawal -- "as a starting point for the formation of the government's policy on the issue of the Golan Heights. "Regarding the problem of the Golan Heights, Israel's supreme interest is the security aspect, that is preventing the Golan from turning into a springboard for attacks against Israel in general and the Galilee in particular," the resolution says. At the same time, MAPAM reiterates its stand that the Golan settlements will not be an obstacle on the road to peace. On the Palestinian issue, the MAPAM convention calls on the Palestinian leadership "to take into consideration the dynamic developments in the region, and to focus on implementing the Declaration of Principles on both the interim arrangement and the Gaza-Jericho First agreement." The convention calls on the PLO leadership and the Israeli Government to make a joint efforts to enhance the negotiations and attain the desired agreement. Another resolution states that "over the past two decades, MAPAM has maintained that a mutual recognition of both nations' right for self determination lies at the foundation of peace between them. The readiness to accept UN Resolutions 242 and 338, and the willingness to return land for peace are a necessary condition for an Israeli peace policy. MAPAM has always regarded the autonomy as a temporary introduction to the permanent solution that would be founded on those principles." [passage omitted]
