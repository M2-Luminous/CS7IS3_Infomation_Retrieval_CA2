Participants in the meeting which was chaired by President Boris Yeltsin stressed that Russia's policy in the Caucasus should aim at expanding mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries of the region, promoting their social and economic development, reaching civic accord and restoring stability in the region. On the question of state support for Cossacks, the council called for working out as soon as possible a federal programme for their support. At present, the implementation of decisions in this sphere is being hindered by the passivity of federal and local bodies of power, lack of coordination and ineffective legislation. Yeltsin urged the government, concerned ministries and departments to take practical measures to work out and realise Russia's policy in the Caucasus and provide state support for Russian Cossacks. The press service said that the council also discussed the situation in Bosnia and Gorazde. Its members expressed the hope that there is still a possibility of resolving the crisis by peaceful means.
