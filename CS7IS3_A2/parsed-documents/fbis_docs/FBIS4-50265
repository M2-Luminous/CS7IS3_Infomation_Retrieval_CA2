Under a Russia-brokered agreement on cease-fire and disengagement of the two sides' forces, both Georgian government troops and armed Abkhazian separatists are to be pulled back 12 kilometers from the Ingur River to create a 24-km-wide buffer zone where the Russian peacekeepers will be deployed. The security zone will help prevent the conflict in the region from erupting again and create conditions for refugees to return home, the Russian Government said after the signing of the agreement yesterday in Moscow by representatives of the Georgian Government and the rebels after talks through the mediation of Moscow. They will resume negotiations in Geneva next month on the status of Abkhazia. Formerly an autonomous republic in Western Georgia on the Black Sea coast, Abkhazia in July 1992 declared independence from Georgia, a move bitterly denounced by the Tbilisi government. Government troops moved into Sukhumi, capital of Abkhazia, the next month, and war flared up. Last year, Abkhazian separatists drove the Georgian troops out of the region and Tbilisi asked Moscow to intervene in the conflict. Georgia's economy has suffered a lot in the 22-month-old conflict which is still going on despite the mediation of Moscow.
