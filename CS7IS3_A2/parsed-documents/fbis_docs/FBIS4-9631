Regarding some of these issues, certain people have even directed personal accusations against me, charges that I consider neither fair nor correct. [Ivanov] Is there any conflict between the civil Defense Ministry leadership and the General Staff? [Noev] Certain differences do exist in our approaches to resolving the existing problems, but they are far from being as dramatic as some people represent. The bitter pill of the budget served as a catalyst for speeding up the reforms. The need for reforms has been growing for several years and now it has reached a peak. All sociological studies show that tension has accumulated in the Army, and those who are charged with specific responsibilities in the defense field strongly demand that something must be done. The differences mainly concern the speed of the reforms. The delay in passing the new Armed Forces Act and the shortage of funds should not, in my view, provide pretexts for inaction. However, some action is already taking place, despite a certain cooling in relations between certain individuals. In the final analysis, I personally regard the differences in views that are developing as a condition for more correct decisions. [Ivanov] You are singled out for stating figures for redundancies in the Army that are not only arousing anxiety in the officer corps but also conflict with what Defense Minister Aleksandrov has said. Where does the truth lie, in your opinion? [Noev] I have never publicly presented any figures on army redundancies, but the answers that I gave at the closed meeting of the Parliamentary National Security Commission have unfortunately been leaked in distorted form to the press. At the present moment we are only talking about retirements, and these moreover affect only very limited numbers of officers. Minister Aleksandrov lucidly explained what it is all about. There will be no pensioning of majors and lieutenant colonels before September, when the new structures and staffing levels, on which the General Staff is drafting a proposal, are to be approved under Article 71 of the Defense and Armed Forces Act. Later, the General Staff will propose which officers may make up the relevant staff levels and which not. Regarding officers with the rank of colonel, it must be made perfectly clear that there is no question of pensioning off military doctors -- about 200 of them, or officers on the teaching staffs of the higher military educational establishments, or of suspending military education. Nor do the redundancies affect officers in leading posts with direct responsibilities for combat readiness and the functioning of the General Staff as "the Army's brain." There are only 83 such officers in all. However, of the 921 officers of pensionable age, excluding all those holding top positions, about 450 of them will remain in various other posts. They cannot in any way help to resolve the problem of the shortage of young officers at the lower levels of the hierarchy, at platoon and company level. The opposite is true. However, for inexplicable reasons, a certain person is fighting like a lion to keep them in military service, using all available means, including some criteria that I regard as dishonorable. This is being done to the detriment of army morale, at the expense of fellow officers, and, in the final analysis, at the taxpayer's expense. One asks: Why do this just now? Why not wait and see what happens? However, the other side may counter by saying: What is there to wait for? How long does one have to wait? Why put it off yet again? Certain persons are also deliberately manipulating the problem of the monetary compensation that is envisaged. I can state quite categorically that funds for this exist in the budget. If a decision in principle is adopted, every colonel who goes into the reserve may receive 18 monthly salaries in cash, which means roughly 170,000 leva. Even after the deduction of tax, they will be left with a considerable amount of money for our conditions. This amount, if applied in the simplest way, can produce 5,000 leva a month in bank interest, Let the others say if this is "throwing people onto the street." However, ethical standards are also needed for this. This also forms part of the truth. [Ivanov] What do you think about a 55,000-strong army? [Noev] I have already told a large-circulation daily that this is an assessment made by a top military leader who was instructed to investigate what a fully combat-ready army would look like as regards personnel strength within the strictures of the 13 billion leva defense budget. I will have nothing to do with such quantitative assessments. Interestingly, however, they coincide with analyses made by authoritative specialist institutes. [Ivanov] One has the impression that you are at loggerheads with the deputies in the Parliamentary National Security Commission. What are the reasons for this? [Noev] I respect the deputies in principle. At sessions of the relevant parliament commissions I have been asked questions that I gave frank answers to, because I believe that the more clearly one defines one's position, the better is one understood. It is another matter whether every one of my answers was to their liking and whether my answer was the only right one. However, that is what discussions are for. I accept my partners in discussions as collaborators with whom we all resolve national security problems together, within the limits of our responsibilities. No one gains from shilly-shallying. [Ivanov] What do you think should be done to improve officers' motivation? [Noev] Two groups of factors mainly affect motivation: First, pay and living conditions, and second, the opportunities for professional and personal fulfillment. Regarding the former, everything is being done within the strictures of the budget, and pay will rise as the state's macroeconomic parameters improve. There are a number of possibilities for new decisions on social and everyday issues. We are working on them, including housing policy, and I hope to receive proposals soon. Regarding the latter, one of our top priority tasks is to adopt a principled cadre policy with clearly defined opportunities for developing a career and concluding it in a worthy manner. This is precisely what the Defense Ministry leadership is attempting, I emphasize attempting, to do right now. The officer corps in sum total represents the most disciplined and educated stratum of our society, and serves as a bulwark for social stability. It is of key importance in the difficult conditions of the transition. The officers deserve recognition from society for this, and such recognition is itself a strong source of motivation for them. [Ivanov] When will the structural reforms begin in the Army? [Noev] They should start as soon as possible, and I believe that they will be to the troops' benefit. [Ivanov] People have singled you out as President Zhelev's man in the Defense Ministry. What is your comment on this? [Noev] The president has spoken with me on only one occasion. The conversation was brief, but very useful for me. I leave it to the observers to assess who is who's man. Sometimes, such assessments are put forward to achieve certain aims at a specific political juncture. [Ivanov] To return to the issue of the UN convoy, who was right? [Noev] On this issue we have many people who say they were right. As far as I am concerned, I think that I was right. In principle, this was a matter within the powers of the government, and I put forward my arguments to this effect in Parliament. Also right were those people -- which, in fact, included all the deputies, from all the political forces -- who said that, in the current specific situation, when public opinion is highly sensitive, this issue goes beyond procedural and technical considerations. Consultations should have been held in advance, to show respect for the right of every political force to state its position in a timely way in a constructive environment, without descending to the level of politicizing the issue. In my opinion, it was an important and useful lesson for everyone who had a connection with the affair.
