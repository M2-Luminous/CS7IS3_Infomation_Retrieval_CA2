They are making such rows as checking shelters everywhere and checking water pumping facilities. At the same time, they are conducting shelter-taking and fire-extinguishing exercises one after another. Amid these rows, the puppets held the so-called 15th civil defense consultative meeting on 13 June. Repeating the stereotyped allegation of the North's so-called nuclear issue, they issued an instruction that the civil defense organization should be rechecked to prepare for an emergency, that the maintenance of the underground shelters, water-supply facilities, warning facilities, and emergency equipment should be completed by the end of this month. They also stated that they would expand the emergency summons exercise in order to ascertain the manpower to be mobilized in case of emergency. In the meantime, a large-scale war exercise is being conducted in South Korea participated in by millions of civil defense unit members, puppet armed forces, and U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in South Korea. This is a phenomenon that one can see only on the eve of a war, and shows well how desperately the puppets are engaged in the maneuvers for a war of northward invasion. The puppets rave that these war maneuvers are aimed at coping with someone's nuclear issue, but this is nothing but a sophistry to hide the danger of their maneuvers for a war of northward invasion. The North's nuclear issue is the outcome of antisocialist, anti- DPRK maneuvers persistently pursued by the United States, and is a fiction invented to crush [apsal] our republic. Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists are massively assembling the aggressor forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas under the pretext of the North's so-called development of nuclear weapons, raving that they have no alternative but to fight with us and that a preemptive attack on North Korea is an option. In so doing, the U.S. imperialists are watching thirstily for an opportunity to provoke a war. Moreover, the Kim Yong-sam ring, the filthy war servant for the U.S. imperialists, not only placed the entire puppet armed forces in an emergency alert posture in order to put them into a war of northward invasion at any time, but is committed to a major suppression campaign against democratic forces, thus attempting to suppress and obliterate all the forces which stand in the way of their implementing the war policy. The war preparation maneuvers being waged concurrently across South Korea show that the puppets are accelerating at a final stage the preparations for the provocation of the war of northward invasion which the puppets regard as a set course of action. Moreover, not to be overlooked is the fact that the puppets are intensifying the so-called checking of shelters, rechecking of the civil defense organizations, and shelter-taking exercise at the same time when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] adopted an absurd resolution on the suspension of the IAEA cooperation with our country and when the possibility of a UN sanction is being discussed. In view of the international alliance which the puppets have pursued and the war preparations which they accelerated, we cannot but conclude that they are taking advantage of the present opportunity to light the fuse of a war of northward invasion. The Kim Yong-sam ring is comprised of extremely vicious war fanatics who take no account of their fellow countrymen or the well-being of the nation. They are the filthy cat's paw of a war of the U.S. imperialists, and filthy and vicious national traitors. Because of reckless war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique, an urgent situation is created now on the Korean peninsula in which a war could break out at any time, and the people of the world are expressing great worries over it. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's war maneuvers are the foolish rash acts of those who lost reason and whose future is doomed. We have already warned that there is no mercy in war. If the Kim Yong-sam ring undertakes the road of adventure by downgrading us, it will be their own destruction. The puppets should squarely see that all they gain from the war maneuvers is nothing but their own ruin, and they should act with discretion.
