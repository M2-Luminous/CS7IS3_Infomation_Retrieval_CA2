FBIS4-5376 "dreas069_d_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 South Korea Official on Commitment To Sign Uruguay Agreement Official on Commitment To Sign Uruguay Agreement SK0904052794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0451 GMT 9 Apr 94 SK0904052794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will sign the final Uruguay Round [UR] agreement at the three-day 120-nation ministerial conference from April 12 in the Moroccan City of Marrakech, but hold off on inking the mandate for the World Trade Organization (WTO), the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and its annexed protocol, the Government Procurement Agreement, until after parliament approves, a government official said Saturday. The official denied reports that Seoul might hold back on signing the final agreement, which would be construed as a rejection of the total UR pact as the signing is a formal and declarative promise of commitment to the world's largest trade agreement and its future direction by participating nations. But Korea is seriously thinking about waiting on the mandate for the WTO, comprised of bilateral and multilateral negotiations in 17 fields including country schedules in agriculture, industry and services, and its annexed protocol until formal approval by the National Assembly. Signing the two other agreements is not mandatory at the Marrakech conference and countries can choose to do so after parliamentary ratification. The United States and Japan have already decided not to sign the two pacts at next week's conference due to domestic legal procedures. Three agreements will be signed at the Marrakech meeting on April 15. Some nations will sign then while others will wait until after legislative passage, ruling Democratic Liberal Party Spokesman Ha Sun-pong said after party-government discussions.
