Most of them will be headed by representatives of the ruling alliance. The opposition factions opposed this and even walked out of the session saying they had been neglected. The majority, with 39 votes, imposed their will on the formation of the new ordinary commissions, thereby ensuring the ruling party's supremacy in and control of the commissions. The following members of the ruling alliance and allied factions are commission presidents: Carlos Blanco, New Majority Movement, Human Rights; Carlos Torres, New Majority Movement, Constitution and Rules and Regulations; Jorge Velasquez, New Majority Movement, Economy; Marta Chavez, New Majority Movement, Supervision; Cesar Fernandez Arce, New Majority Movement, Justice; Cesar Larrebure, We Are Independent, Agriculture; Celso Sotomarino, Popular Christian Party, Production; Romulo Guerra, Change 90, Health and Family; Jorge Figueroa, Change 90, Budget; Rafael Rey, Renewal Movement, Education and Sports; Carlos Reategui, New Majority, Energy; Genaro Colchado, Change 90, Environment; Ricardo Marcenaro, New Majority Movement, Labor; Luz Salgado, Change 90, Decentralization; Osvaldo Sandoval, New Majority Movement, Foreign Relations; and Andres Reggiardo, Change 90, Defense and Internal Order. The opposition vigorously complained, primarily questioning Roger Caceres' removal from the Human Rights Commission. The ruling party was accused of removing and appointing minority congressmen at will, while ensuring control of key commissions for themselves. The opposition deputies subsequently left the floor. [Begin recording] [First unidentified congressman] The list of commissions has been approved without a quorum. They are lying to the country and have continued the session without a quorum. Whatever is approved here must be rejected, even through legal action. [Second unidentified congressman] I must stress that no congressman has been denied participation in the commission of his preference. The only difference is that the commissions in which they are not chairmen they can be secretaries, but no one has been neglected or denied participation in the commission of his choice. [Third unidentified congressman] I have taken note and there are only three or four problem cases whose solutions depend on agreements to be reached. We are only waiting for the cases to be sent to us, and we will approve whatever is decided. [end recording]
