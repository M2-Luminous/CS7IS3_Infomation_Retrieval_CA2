The book collects important works during the period from September 1982 to February 1992. We had personal experience and took part in the practice during this period. Therefore, we find the selected works intimate and easy to read. Centering closely round the main theme of building socialism with Chinese characteristics from beginning to end, the book expounds a series of creative theoretical viewpoints. It has enriched and developed Mao Zedong Thought with many new ideas and viewpoints and manifests the features of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is China's contemporary Marxism and is a brilliant example of upholding the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. Using historical materialism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has put forward the viewpoint that the productive forces play a decisive role in the development of human society and has given creative Marxist answers to questions such as the nature of socialism, the fundamental tasks of socialism, and the fundamental standard for testing various kinds of work. In studying the Selected Works, we must firmly grasp the viewpoint that the productive forces play a decisive role, abide by the productive forces criteria, and gain a thorough understanding of the essence of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Systematically studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is of great practical significance and farreaching historical significance to further increasing understanding, adhering to the party's basic line, enhancing vigor, doing pioneering work, making progress, and carrying out historical missions. The practice in reform and opening up during the past 10 years and more has shown that the development rate of our country has been fast and that the broad masses of the people are satisfied with the development rate. Viewed from the development of the coal industry, these 10 years and more have been a period for the fastest development in the history of the coal industry. The output of raw coal increased from 618 million tonnes in 1978 to 1.115 billion tonnes in 1992. The average annual increase was 35.5 million tonnes. After 1986, the shortages in coal supplies, which had lasted for many years, eased up. Great changes took place in the coal production technology and the degree of mechanization was raised by a big margin. The degree of mechanization in coal mining in key state mines was raised from 32.5 percent in 1978 to 72.26 percent in 1992. Safety in mines improved annually. The death rate in producing 1 million tonnes of coal was lowered from 9.44 people in 1978 to 5.43 people in 1992, a decline of 42.5 percent. The death rate in producing 1 million tonnes of coal in key state mines was lowered from 6.94 people in 1978 to 1.06 people in 1992, a decrease of 84.7 percent. Relatively great achievements were also made in opening up to the outside world and coal exports were increased by a big margin. All this has clearly proved that Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the policy of reform and opening up we have adopted are entirely correct. The coal industry is an important basic industrial sector of the national economy and is also the basic industrial sector which is most seriously affected by the traditional planned economy structure and which has least vitality among state enterprises. At a time when the economy is shifting to the new economic structure, a large amount of problems left behind by the traditional planned economy structure are woven with new contradictions and new problems cropping up in the course of entering the socialist market economy. This has put coal enterprises in a very difficult position. Affected by the traditional planned economy structure over a long period, coal mines have been run only by coal departments and only coal has been produced in coal mines. In the construction of coal mines, the scale has been stressed and economic results have been belittled. This has led to the emergence of a serious imbalance and many other major problems in the total supply and demand of coal, production structure, product mix, and the economic results of coal enterprises. Such problems mainly include: 1) The coal industry lacks the capacity for further development. By the end of this century, there will be a big contradiction between the available coal production capacity and the needs of the rapid growth of the national economy. 2) A big contradiction exists between the production structure of the coal industry and the demand structure of the national economy. The proportion of rural coal mines has become larger and more and more newly-increased coal output is produced by scattered, small-scale, and nonregular coal mines. This is not in keeping with the gradual concentration of coal consumption on power, steel, and chemical enterprises and the direction of the development toward large scale and stability. It is impossible to have a long-term and steady supply of coal to meet the needs of the national economy. 3) There is a big contradiction between the possible coal industry output and the railroads' and transportation department's possible capacity for coal. Since the layout of coal resources and that of the productive forces of the national economy are developing in opposite directions and the product mix of coal is unitary, the coal produced cannot be converted locally, the problem of coal transportation has remained unresolved for a long time and many coal enterprises do not have the basic conditions for production and operation. 4) Key state coal enterprises have an excessive number of workers, low productivity, and heavy losses. At present, key state coal mines produce over 480 million tonnes of coal and have a total of 3.6 million workers. However, Australia produces more than 200 million tonnes of coal, but has 30,000 workers. The difference is nearly 40-fold. The gap between our level and the world's advanced level is too big. Although these existing contradictions and problems in the coal industry at present are expressed as problems of total supply and demand, structural readjustment, and economic results. In essence, they reflect in a concentrated manner the drawbacks of a complete set of policies for production and construction in coal mines, investment policies, and the operational mechanism of coal enterprises formed in the planned economy structure. In resolving these contradictions and problems, it is necessary to formulate policies and find a way out in reform and to restudy and redesign new ideas, a new framework, and new mechanisms for the coal industry to move toward the market in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the general demand on the establishment of the socialist market economy structure put forward in the decision on several questions on the establishment of the socialist market economy structure made at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and using as reference the experience in the development of the coal industry in foreign countries. I would now like to put forward some reformative thoughts and tentative views on how the coal industry in China should move toward the socialist market economy. I. Break the Barriers in the Industry, Mobilize the Strength of Various Quarters To Run Coal Mines Running coal mines should not be limited to one industry, locality, or country and transindustrial, transregional, and transnational comprehensive mining companies should be organized to carry out comprehensive development and operation. In the coming 10 years, the national economy will enter a new period of rapid development. How much coal will be needed and what will be the production capacity of the coal industry by the end of this century? Many domestic and foreign specialists and scholars are constantly studying and exploring these questions. The Ministry of Coal Industry is also studying and formulating development plans. According to tentative views on revitalizing the coal industry, put forward by comprehensive state departments in 1992 after Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his important remarks during his southern tour, the ministry has put forward the target of producing 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by the end of the century. At present, the coal production capacity of the whole country is about 1.1 billion tonnes. By the end of this century, the decrease caused by the decline in coal production capacity will be about 100 million tonnes. To attain a production capacity of 1.5 billion tonnes, more than 400 million tonnes of newly added production capacity is needed. In the short period of seven years, it is not at all easy to increase the production capacity by 400 million tonnes and it will be difficult for the state to provide the financial resources. There is a serious insufficiency in strength for further developing the coal mines. Therefore, in addition to a number of key mines, built with state investment in a planned way, the strength of various quarters should be mobilized and funds from various quarters should be pooled to build coal mines. Coal mines run by collectives in townships and towns should be developed continuously and with great efforts. To consolidate, support, reform, combine, and raise to a higher level collective coal mines in townships and towns, and to comprehensively improve the quality of coal enterprises, have become strategic tasks which brook no delay in the development of the coal industry in the coming 10 years. Proceeding from the reform of the coal distribution system and in accordance with the principle of benefiting those who make investment, it is necessary to encourage the electricity, metallurgy, chemical industry, and railway departments, and enterprises under these departments, to make investment in running coal mines and to encourage localities which have a shortage of coal to run coal mines in localities where coal is abundant. It is necessary to welcome and attract foreign coal enterprises, commercial companies, and financial firms to make investment and run coal mines in China in the form of joint ventures and cooperation. Industrial departments should provide high-quality services in terms of geology, design, construction, technology, equipment, and management, for departments, localities, and domestic and foreign enterprises and companies which make investment in coal mines and should carry out management by the respective trades. It is necessary to make use of the market economy structure to resolve the contradiction of the coal industry's lack of strength for further development. II. Break Away From the Traditional Practice of "Allocation of Levels" of Construction Scales in Central State-Owned Coal Mines; Proceed From the Actual Layout of Coal Resources; Pay Attention to the Principle of Economic Results; and Use State Funds for the Construction of State-Owned Coal Mines in a Relatively Concentrated Manner The state should mainly grasp several key coal export provinces and areas and build a number of large energy bases which can support the whole country in despatching both coal and electricity from regions where coal reserves are abundant, conditions are favorable, and the input-output results are good. The development, production, and operation of key state-owned coal mines in provinces and regions where there is a shortage of coal or where coal is for their own use, should, in principle, be managed by the provinces or regions. Support should be given to provinces and regions which despatch coal in the construction of local commodity coal bases, sales of locally produced coal on the market, and supply of coal power plants, steel works, and other consumers which need large quantities of coal. III. Break Away From the Traditional Mode That Coal Mines Can Only Be Run by Coal Enterprises; Develop Industry for Local Processing and Converting Coal to Reduce the Pressure on Coal Transportation Because of the imbalance between the location of the coal resources and that of the productive forces in the national economy, and because of the planned economy structure in the past 40 years and more since the founding of the republic, coal enterprises can only run coal mines, their product mix is unitary, little of the coal produced is converted locally and, as a result, the amount of coal transported into or out of provinces and regions has increased annually and more and more coal is transported out of central and western provinces. In 1990, the net amount of coal transported out of the central and western areas accounted for 80 percent of the whole country's total and there has always been a shortage in the coal transportation capacity. Therefore, all mining areas with the relevant conditions should construct power plants and coking plants and should develop other chemical products with the coal. Some may make unified plans for coal, electricity, railway, and seaports and carry out unified development and comprehensive management so that most of the coal can be converted locally, the pressure on coal transportation can be reduced, and the basic operational conditions for the coal industry's entry into the market can be created. IV. Get Rid of the Traditional Concept of Paying Attention to the Scale of Construction While Belittling Economic Results and of Spending Money Without Paying Off Debts; Lay Stress on Economic Results In building new state-owned coal mines, including major technical transformation, it is necessary to use new modes, new mechanisms, and a high technological level of equipment, to use less people and to obtain better economic results. Coal mines with poor conditions or economic results, or without the ability to pay off debts, should not be built. In this way, the level of the coal-mining equipment and economic results of key state-owned coal mines in China will reach, or come close to, the international level in 10 to 20 years as a result of our efforts. V. Make Great Efforts To Readjust the Industrial Structure; Establish the Strategic Position of Diversified Management The establishment of the socialist market economy structure has enabled the coal industry to enter a historical period of changes and the problems of an excessive amount of people employed, low productivity, poor economic results, and great losses are confronting severe challenges. Because of this, the coal industry must persistently regard coal as the foundation, optimize the industrial structure, and make great efforts to develop diversified management and tertiary industry. It is necessary to reduce the number of people employed and increase economic results. The surplus personnel from the enterprises can be used for diversified management and tertiary industry. Diversified management covers a wide scope, including production and operational activities of the first, second, and third industries. For example, processing in depth and conversion of coal and the comprehensive development and utilization of the resources of mining areas; the development of tertiary industry which requires less investment and provides more job vacancies; and the development of industries other than the coal industry. This is a major strategic measure in the development of the coal industry. Not only old mining areas should develop diversified management and blaze new paths, new mining areas should also develop diversified management and take the road of comprehensive development, change the face of operations in the coal industry as soon as possible, and increase economic results so that coal enterprises can extricate themselves from a difficult position. VI. Change the Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Enterprises, Establish a Modern Enterprise System Which Is In Keeping With the Requirements of the Socialist Market Economy, and Effectively Integrate Enterprises Under Public Ownership With the Market Economy In carrying out experiments on establishing a modern enterprise system it is necessary to select a number of coal enterprises which have a more favorable geological position, better conditions in terms of resources, and better economic results. Experiments on companies with limited liability can be carried out in some of these enterprises and experiments on joint-stock companies can be carried out in others. On the basis of the experience gained, management and operation by companies should be gradually practiced in state- owned coal mining enterprises. Relations in property rights should be put in order and the ownership of investors should be separated from the property rights of legal persons. The ownership of investors includes stock ownership, that is, the investors are entitled to: Benefit from assets according to law in the capacity of stockholders; participate in the selection of managers; participatin in major policy decisions; the right to transfer stock ownership; and entitled to other rights. The legal person property rights include the possession, utilization, benefits, handling, and allocation of the property of the legal persons according to law and the legal persons are responsible for their own operational activities with their independent property. Enterprises have the legal person property rights and, through the establishment of the capital system and the assets management responsibility system, the system of assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses can really be implemented in enterprises. It is necessary to enable enterprises to manipulate, utilize, handle, and operate their assets, to make good use of deposited funds, and to effectively bring about added value in accordance with the relationship of market supply and demand and the law of value. In this way, enterprises can put an end to the situation of mixing up the duties of the government and those of enterprises, lay a foundation for enterprises to stop being appendages of government administrative organs, and create the basic conditions for government departments to practice management by respective trades. Coal enterprises which are not selected for experiments should continue to resolutely implement the "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations on Industrial Enterprises Under the Ownership of the Whole People Changing Operational Mechanism," reform the internal management system, and practice replica legal person operation in units under them so that these units are entitled to the rights of legal person enterprises within the enterprises, undertake the responsibilities of legal person enterprises, and embark on the orbit of development "on their own in four aspects." Nonproductive and nonconstruction units should operate independently, assume sole responsibility for profits and losses, find their own way out, and strive to survive through moving toward the market. VII. Increase Coal Exports In 1992, China produced 1.115 billion tonnes of raw coal, of which 20.2 million tonnes were exported, accounting for 1.8 percent of the coal output. This is far from being in keeping with a big coal-producing country with an output of 1.1 billion tonnes. A major cause is the problem of the export structure. The export of coal is only managed by the China National Coal Import and Export Corporation and the enthusiasm of various other major enterprises, or major coal-producing provinces, is not given full play. This situation must be changed and coal exports should be a chief source of foreign exchange. It is necessary to formulate, in accordance with the requirements of the socialist market economy, a set of policies for coal exports which are in keeping with our national conditions, and which can arouse the enthusiasm of various sectors, and to smash the coal export structure which does not conform with the market economy laws and in which only one corporation operates. It is necessary to remove restrictions in an appropriate way, gradually give key coal enterprises the right to make decisions on exports, and increase the export volume of coal to earn more foreign exchange for the state. To avoid confusion in coal exports, to coordinate work in various aspects of coal exporting enterprises, and to unify policies toward foreign countries in coal exports, the establishment of a China Coal Imports and Exports Commercial Chamber can be taken into consideration. This chamber can study and formulate policies for coal exports, fix the lowest price limit and the range of price fluctuation, collect and provide information on the international coal markets, and investigate and study the operational activities of domestic coal exporting enterprises to increase the competitive power of our coal exports, supervise and maintain normal trade order, and do a good job in coordinating coal trading activities with foreign countries by coal exporting enterprises and in providing services for them. At present, we are living amid deep changes following the development in reform, opening up, and modernization. The faces of the social relationship and social economy are undergoing tremendous changes. So long as we earnestly study and use Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, constantly raise our consciousness and firmness in implementing the party's basic line, deepen reform, and speed up development, the coal industry will certainly have flourishing and prosperous prospects.
