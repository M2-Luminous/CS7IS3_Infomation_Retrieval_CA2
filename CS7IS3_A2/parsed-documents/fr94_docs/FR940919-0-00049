ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This action corrects the final regulations which were published Tuesday, August 31, 1993 (``Hazardous Waste Management System; Testing and Monitoring Activities; Final Rule'', 58 FR 46040). This action corrects the unintended removal of text from 40 CFR 268.7(a), which sets out the generator waste analysis and recordkeeping requirements of the land disposal restrictions under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective as of August 31, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information about this correction contact Kim Kirkland at (202) 260&hyph;4761, Office of Solid Waste (Mailcode 5304), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. For information about 40 CFR 268.7(a) requirements, contact the RCRA Hotline on (800) 424&hyph;9346 (toll-free) or, in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, (703) 412&hyph;9810. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The final regulations that are the subject of this correction (August 31, 1993, 58 FR 46040) amended the hazardous waste regulations for testing and monitoring activities by replacing the Second Edition, Updates I and II, of the EPA approved test methods manual ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, by incorporating by reference the Third Edition of SW&hyph;846 and its Update I into §260.11(a) of the RCRA regulations. In addition, the final rule also made a technical amendment to §268.7(a) (concerning waste analysis and recordkeeping requirements) whereby the reference to the appendix IX of Part 268 was revised to reference SW&hyph;846 Methods 1311 and 1310. The Agency intended to revise only the introductory text of §268.7(a) and to retain without change all of the subparagraphs following the introductory text. However, due to an inadvertent administrative error in incorporating the August 31, 1993 rule into the 1994 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the subparagraphs following the introductory text were unintentionally removed. This action clarifies that subparagraphs 40 CFR 268.7(a)(1)&hyph;268.7(a)(10), as set forth in this action, remain in effect, and are regarded by EPA to have been in effect continuously in the form published in the Code of Federal Regulations revised as of July 1, 1993. It should be noted that 40 CFR 268.7(a) as published in this action, as well as other regulations implementing the land disposal restriction (LDR) program, have been amended in a final rule that is published elsewhere in today's Federal Register . The regulatory text set forth in this action does not include the amendments to §268.7(a) made by that LDR final rule. The purpose of this action is to make clear that the August 31, 1993 rule was intended only to modify the introductory text of §268.7(a), and was not intended to delete paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(a)(10). Therefore, the complete version of §268.7(a) as it should have appeared since the August 31, 1994 Federal Register is set forth in this action. Readers are urged to refer to the LDR final rule, published elsewhere in today's Federal Register , for the full and current text of §268.7(a).
