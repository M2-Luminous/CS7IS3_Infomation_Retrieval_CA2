Comrade Le Phuoc Tho, member of the Political Bureau, secretary of the party Central Committee, and head of the party Central Committee's Organization Department, chaired the conference, which was attended by nearly 500 delegates from 53 provinces and cities and various ministries and sectors. Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi attended and addressed the conference. We invite our friends to listen to this report by a Radio Voice of Vietnam correspondent outlining the main points of the conference: [Begin recording] Dear friends: It has been two years since the party Central Committee's third plenum resolution and nearly 10 years since the party Central Committee Secretariat's directive on a number of urgent matters relating to female cadres. Le Huy Ngo, deputy head of the party Central Committee's Organization Department, presented a report reviewing the party's renovation and rectification over the past two years. The report mentioned the situation regarding the deployment and implementation of this resolution and pointed out that in general the party's renovation and rectification efforts have correctly met the everyone's aspirations because attention has been given by the entire party, people, and Army. Party activities in various establishments have attracted participation by 80-90 percent of party members. These activities reflect unanimity in policies and great effort in activities. They have produced a number of initial yet important results in certain respects and have won the sympathy and support of the people. These results are: 1. Ideologically, we have been able to further consolidate our unity of mind and improve the confidence of a large number of party cadres and members and people regarding the party's renovation stance. On this basis, we have improved the sense of responsibility of party committee echelons and every party member toward the implementation of the party's renovation line. 2. As for organizational rectification, we have paid attention to: Complying with various principles and stipulations in the party statutes, especially the principles on democratic centralism, the system of collective leadership among party committee echelons, and broadening democratic principles; overcoming disunity; and improving criticism and self-criticism activities. Over 50 percent of the grassroots party organizations have already been able to establish correct working procedures. In certain provinces, 100 percent of grassroots party organizations have been able to establish new working procedures. Various sectors and localities have kept in mind on the need to focus on the grass roots in organizational rectification. They have consolidated poorly performing grassroots party organizations and have satisfactorily resolved various flashpoints, such as such as those in Hai Hung, Hanoi, Yen Bai, and Tay Ninh. According to reports from 28 provinces and cities and from the party Central Committee Military Commission, the average number of clean and steadfast party organizations has increased 7.8 percent, while the average number of poorly performing party organizations has dropped 2.5 percent. The number of poorly performing party organizations is still high in the mountain regions, however. 3. Regarding work related to party members, analysis shows that the number of qualified party members making good efforts is usually 30-40 percent. The number of poor party members accounts for only 5-10 percent, while the number of disqualified party members constitutes only 1-5 percent of the total. Worthy of note in the work relating to party members is that we have not just analyzed the qualities of party members; we have also dealt with poor performers. Party organizations have developed programs and objectives for training party members so they can strive to surge forward and perform their assigned missions. As a result, some localities have assigned 60-70 percent of their party members with specific duties. In 1993 alone, the party as a whole took disciplinary action against 48,499 party members, or 2.3 percent of the total number of party members in the country. Many of these party members held high positions. While resolutely removing disqualified members from the party, party organizations have also stepped up party development. That is why the number of new party members has increased annually. In 1993, the number of new party members increased 30 percent over 1992, with youths and intellectuals making up a large part. This shows that along with the results obtained from the renovation process, the party has really been able to attract the younger generation and the intelligentsia. 4. Regarding the cadre-related and mass mobilization tasks, our initial achievements have been encouraging, thus satisfying the people's desire, promoting the unique characteristics of regions inhabited by ethnic minorities, and strengthening female cadres' activities. In commending female cadres, we should consider their political background and ethics, their efforts in observing party discipline, their relations with the masses, and their capability in carrying out tasks to meet the requirements of the renovation process. 5. There must be further changes in the party leadership in order to implement the main task of developing the socioeconomic situation to strengthen the market economy. It is necessary to mention here that we have attached importance to the countryside and taken grass-roots party organizations as a basis for implementing various party resolutions and official lines and policies. The report of Comrade Truong My Hoa, secretary of the Central Committee, stressed efforts to renovate and revamp the party while presenting a general assessment on the causes of the shortcomings experienced by female cadres in carrying out party tasks and activities. This was due to less attention paid by leaders of party committees to planning, training, and helping female cadres to develop. The conference discussed and made concrete proposals aimed at strengthening the renovation and rectification of the party, while enhancing the role of female cadres to meet requirements of the new situation, especially after the midterm national party conference. Regarding the efforts to continue revamping and renovating the party, the conference established the following essential tasks to be carried out during the next two years: 1. Efforts to make grass-roots party organizations a basis for building pure and strong party units and efforts to implement the socioeconomic development program from the central to grass-roots levels. Only by satisfactorily developing the party role at the grass-roots level, will we be able to effectively implement party and state resolutions, lines, and policies. 2. Regarding cadre-related tasks, we must strive to create favorable conditions for each party member and organization to take the lead in all tasks so as to encourage people to participate in various activities. For female cadres, local leaders must formulate better plans to recruit and train them to increase their number and enhance their capabilities. The quality of cadres rests with their background knowledge, ethics, and capability in fulfilling assigned tasks. Various party organizations may apply the transfer system to train and foster responsible cadres and party members to enhance their skills and capabilities. 3. Party members must pay attention to the mass mobilization work, while participating in tasks to renovate the party leadership and promote the market economy. The conference also discussed and called for efforts to concretize and resolve various issues. These include issues on allowing party members to engage in economic activities, restoring party affairs committees of various organizations, and improving party organizations at state and private enterprises. Efforts must also be made to perfect the echelons of party committees and strengthen party building in almost 3,800 hamlets where no party members have been admitted. Dear friends, in his address to the conference, General Secretary Do Muoi stressed the significant role of our party line and policy on renovating and revamping the party. He said that the people have placed firm confidence in our party and its renovation policy. As a result, during the past several years we have continued to overcome numerous difficulties and scored encouraging achievements. We still face numerous acute ordeals, however, and we must strive to continue to renovate and revamp the party. The comrade general secretary stressed: This is a major and difficult task. To build a pure, firm, and strong party worthy of the people's love and trust, we must firmly maintain and strengthen the proletarian characteristics while eliminating all forms and concepts of coercion and oppression. Our fundamental party ideology rests with Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. Many party members during the past several years have taken the lead and set a good example in implementing the renovation process. Given the current requirements, however, we must strive to renovate and revamp the party more vigorously while effectively carrying out concrete tasks set by the midterm national party conference for the next two years. Comrade Do Muoi also analyzed the necessity to broaden democracy within the party and the relations between democracy and centralized leadership. He said that efforts must be made to enhance the intelligence of each party committee echelon to score achievements in the socioeconomic development program. We must pay special attention to strengthening the party building task at the grass-roots level, while maintaining close relations with the people and motivating them to participate in various revolutionary movements. This is the most basic task of our party and state, through which we will score concrete achievements in the socioeconomic development program and foil the peaceful evolution schemes of the hostile forces.
