Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "A special economic zone is a window on technology, management, and knowledge as well as a window on foreign policy. From the special economic zones, we can introduce technology, acquire knowledge, and learn management skills, which are also a kind of knowledge. The special economic zones can function as bases for opening up, thus not only enabling us to gain benefit in the economic field and in the field of training competent personnel but also in expanding our country's foreign influence." Comrade Xiaoping's brilliant thesis on special economic zones gave a scientific expression to the position and functions of the special economic zones in opening up and their significance in our country's four modernizations and also directly guided the construction and development of the special economic zones in our country and promoted the great practice of reform, opening, and modernization in the whole country through the exemplary role of the special economic zones. The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was China's first special economic zone founded and developed according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's personal design and guidance. Over the past 14 years, under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- especially his idea about building special economic zones -- Shenzhen has developed from a backward border town into a modern metropolis, in which the productive forces have been growing rapidly and the people's living standards have been enhanced substantially. Between 1979 and 1992, the city's gross domestic product increased from 196 million yuan to 28.43 billion yuan, or multiplied 147 times; the gross income of the people [guo min shou ru 0948 3046 2392 0354] increased from 160 million yuan to 19.35 billion yuan, or multiplied 121 times; the gross industrial output value increased form 70 million yuan to 37.138 billion yuan, or multiplied 531 times; the annual export volume increased from $9.3 million to $5.097 billion, or multiplied 548 times. The gigantic achievements in the construction of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone fully demonstrated the strong vigor and dynamism of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on building special economic zones. First, Going All Out To Develop an Outward-Oriented Economy and Accelerating the Process of Internationalizing Economic Life Comrade Xiaoping instructed that "the orientation of the special economic zones' economies should be shifted from the domestic market to the international market." That is to say, the special economic zone should go all out to develop an outward-oriented economy, and this is a major criterion for judging whether the special economic zone is being run successfully. According to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's instruction, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone went all out to develop an outward-oriented economy. Through its efforts over more than 10 years, Shenzhen has formed an outward-oriented economic structure which takes industry as the main component and is composed of industry, agriculture, trade, and technology. The zone has made great progress in the two aspects of introducing foreign funds and technologies and exporting products to earn foreign exchange. In 1992, Shenzhen concluded more than 10,000 agreements and contracts for using overseas funds with more than 30 countries and regions and had actually used $4.5 billion in foreign funds. In the aspect of using foreign funds, Shenzhen had gradually upgraded from the stage of processing materials, assembling parts and components supplied by external clients and processing materials according to external buyers' samples, and conducting compensation trade to the stage of establishing the three types of foreign-funded enterprises and moving from labor-intensive projects to capital-intensive and technology-intensive projects. In addition to the use of external funds, Shenzhen also attached importance to importing equipment, technology, and intellectual resources. At the same time, Shenzhen made efforts to develop its overseas markets, actively advanced transnational operations, and boldly participated in international competition and cooperation. In 1992, Shenzhen had developed trade relations with 122 countries and regions throughout the world, and its import and export volume was close to $8 billion. In particular, the volume of exports exceeded $5 billion, taking second place among all large and medium cities in China. In 1992, exported products accounted for 56.8 percent of the total industrial output value. Shenzhen had also gradually become an "entrepot" for the vast interior of the Chinese mainland, as it exported products from the interior and imported materials, equipment, and technology needed by those areas. Facts have shown that breaking the closed economic pattern, continuing to open up, going all out to develop an outward-oriented economy, and realizing the internationalization of economic life are the fundamental requirements for giving play to the "window" functions of the special economic zone and is also the only way to successfully conduct economic development in the special economic zone. In the course of developing its outward-oriented economy, Shenzhen brought in foreign capital to establish three types of foreign-funded enterprises. This used to be a controversial issue in the past. Some people maintained that this would develop capitalism and would affect the socialist public ownership system. During his inspection of the south in 1992, Comrade Xiaoping gave an explicit reply to this question by citing the facts in Shenzhen as an example. He said: "We should not fear the establishment of more foreign-funded enterprises, as long as we keep ourselves sober-minded. We have advantages, as we have large and medium state-owned enterprises and township and town enterprises. More importantly, political power is in our hands." He added: "The three types of foreign-funded enterprises are constrained by the political and economic conditions of our country, and they are a useful supplement to the socialist economy. In the final analysis, they are conducive to socialism." This is a scientific conclusion drawn from reality, and has great guiding significance in both theory and practice for the formation of the ownership structure with public ownership as the main body and with the individual economy, the private economy, and the foreign-funded economy as supplements, in which a variety of economic elements will coexist and bring about common development in the long term. Second, Boldly Carry Out Economic Structural Reform and Establish a New Socialist Market Economic Structure The special economic zone should not only play a role as a window and a base in the course of opening up to the outside world, but should also play an experimental and sampling role in the course of reform and opening up to other domestic areas. Comrade Xiaoping emphasized many times: "The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone is an experiment." During his inspection tour to the south in 1992, he warmly affirmed that "Shenzhen's major experience is that it dared to make breakthroughs and break new ground [gan chuang 2413 7068]." This required that the special economic zone be courageous enough to carry out reform experiments and to make explorations and innovations by breaking through the old systems and conventions that hindered the development of the productive forces. In the past more than 10 years, Shenzhen persistently carried out market-oriented economic structural reform and carried out bold and advance tests in many fields, thus providing a great deal of important experience for the in-depth development of economic structural reform throughout the country. In the field of reforming the enterprise property rights system and transforming the enterprise operational mechanism, Shenzhen took the management system in the foreign-funded enterprises as a point of reference in the course of transforming the management system and the operational mechanism of the state-owned enterprises. In 1987, it took the lead in the whole country in setting up the state-owned assets management organ -- an investment management company -- thus separating the function of managing state assets from the economic functions of the government. This was a useful experiment in exploring ways to separate management power over state assets from state ownership. At the same time, Shenzhen also took the lead in the whole country in carrying out pilot schemes for the adoption of the joint-stock system. At the end of 1992, there were more than 150 share-limited companies in Shenzhen, and 24 of them had been listed on stock exchanges. Because their operational mechanism underwent rapid changes, the companies that had been listed on stock exchanges substantially increased their net assets, profits, and tax-profit contributions. Practice shows that the joint stock system is a good model for the reform of the enterprise property rights system. It is conducive to the clear definition of enterprise property rights, represents the separation of the ownership over the enterprise assets from management power over such assets, and remolds the enterprise into a commodity producer and dealer that operates on its own, bears sole responsibility for its own profits and business losses, has the ability to make development on its own and to exercise self-control. In the field of cultivating the market, Shenzhen has basically formed a comprehensive market system full of dynamism. In Shenzhen, there are markets for consumer goods such as farm produce and manufactured goods for daily use; markets for producer goods such as building materials, mechanical and electrical equipment, electronic assembly parts, and nonferrous metals; service markets providing storage, transportation, communications, tourist, and cultural services; and also the auction market for movable property, the market for property rights transfers, and the futures market. Many of these markets have developed on a considerable scale. Various types of markets have become rather mature, and the degree of their openness is quite high. The market rules are almost perfect, and the competition is rather fair. Market operation has basically moved onto a healthy and orderly path. At the same time, prices are basically free, and price control is exercised on only a small number of goods and services. The prices of most commodities are determined according to the law of value and the supply-demand relationship on the market. The market-determined pricing mechanism has basically taken form. In the area of transforming government functions and reforming economic control patterns through vertical and horizontal power devolution, government functions in Shenzhen have been gradually changed from direct to indirect economic control. Such economic means as financial and taxation policies, banking policies, foreign trade policies, and industrial policies have been used increasingly to regulate and control the market and guide enterprises. The economic functions of the government have been changed, and the enterprises have been basically separated from the government. Over the past 14 years, Shenzhen constantly promoted development through reform and promoted economic growth at a high speed and in high efficiency through the transformation of the economic structure and the economic operational mechanism. Violent economic fluctuations were prevented. The vivid practice proved the correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's brilliant thesis that "reform is also the emancipation of the productive forces." Third, Correctly Using the Useful Achievements of Capitalism to Serve Socialist Construction Opening up to the outside world, developing an outward-oriented economy, reforming the old structure, and establishing a new market economic structure are all related to the correct use of the useful achievements of capitalism for our own purposes. Comrade Xiaoping explicitly pointed out: We should adopt and use all achievements of advanced civilization, including those made by the developed capitalist countries, to develop socialism. In a certain sense, a major point in the experiments of reform and opening in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone is how to use the useful achievements of capitalism to serve socialist construction. This includes the development of foreign economic and trade relations, the adoption of foreign funds, the introduction of advanced technology and various types of professionals, the adoption of the advanced operational forms and management methods prevailing in the capitalist countries as they reflect the general laws governing modern socialized production and the commodity economy, and taking as reference some economic policies and legislation in the capitalist countries that reflect objective economic laws. Being limited by the space, this article will only talk about how Shenzhen has used the effective capitalist practice in pursuing the market economy to serve the purpose of establishing the socialist market economy. Over the past several hundred years of capitalist development, a whole set of market organizational forms, operational mechanisms, and "game" rules have taken form. They represent the achievements of human civilization. Shenzhen boldly adopted and creatively applied them according to the needs of economic structural reform. For example, in the area of reforming the enterprise management system through running three types of foreign-funded enterprises, Shenzhen creatively adopted and applied the operational mechanism and management experience of Western enterprises, trained a large number of managerial personnel, and enhanced the level of enterprise management. The joint stock system that was adopted by enterprises in Shenzhen was also first developed in the West. By learning from the Western experience in developing joint stock companies, Shenzhen took the lead in China in transforming the state-owned enterprises according to the joint stock corporate system. Practice has shown that the joint stock system is not exclusively applicable to capitalism; rather, it is also an effective form of transforming our enterprise operation mechanism. Shenzhen also adopted the Western practice of handling enterprise mergers and bankruptcies, and thus established the enterprise property rights transfer system and the enterprise bankruptcy system. This promoted the flow of production factors to enterprises that achieve good economic results and increased effective supply in society. In the area of organizing and building markets, Shenzhen boldly adopted the Western countries practice of distributing resources through the market and commercializing the factors of production and took the lead in the whole country in establishing the labor and real estate markets. Land was transferred on a paid basis or was openly put up for auction. Shenzhen also adopted Western marketing methods, used Western market channels and sales networks, adopted international market regulatory mechanisms, and sold large quantities of products to the international market. In the area of economic control, Shenzhen also adopted the economic management methods of Hong Kong, Singapore, and other capitalist countries and regions. The original government departments responsible for managing various trades were transformed into enterprises, and a series of trade associations were set up to play a coordinating and intermediary role. The government of the special economic zone formulated a series of local laws and regulations with reference to the legal system in Hong Kong and other places and according to international practice, thus ensuring the orderly operation of the market mechanism under the control of the "game rules." It can be said that a major reason why Shenzhen could rapidly and smoothly move onto the path of the socialist market economy was that it dared and was good at adopting and absorbing the effective capitalist practices in developing the market economy. When using the useful achievements of capitalism, Shenzhen adhered to the principle of "mainly applying elements to serve our own purposes," always proceeded from the realities, selectively adopted and introduced those elements that were useful according to our own needs, and creatively applied these elements. Practice has shown that, as long as we have adhered to this principle, we would be able to correctly use the civilization achievements created by capitalist society in order to promote the development of the productive forces in socialist society. Fourth, Constantly "Using Both Hands to Grasp" the Work, and Actively Exploring the New Way To Develop Spiritual Civilization Under the Conditions of the Market Economy Comrade Xiaoping's instruction that the special economic zones are special "economic" zones rather than special "political" zones determines that the special economic zones must maintain the party's leadership and adhere to the socialist road. Therefore, in the course of building the special economic zones, we must always pay attention to properly handling the relationship between persisting in reform and opening and adhering to the four cardinal principles and must use both hands to grasp the work. Comrade Xiaoping said: "In the early 1980's, when establishing the special economic zones, I told the leading comrades in Guangdong that we should use both hands to grasp our work. That is, one hand should be used to grasp reform and opening, and the other hand should be used to severely crack down on economic crimes and to handle the ideological and political work. This is the two-point outlook [liang dian lun 0357 7820 6158]. During his inspection tour to the south, he once again stressed: "Guangdong should catch up with the `four little dragons' in Asia. Not only should it boost the economy, but its public order and public conduct should also be improved. It should catch up with them in the construction of both civilizations, and only this can be called socialism with Chinese characteristics." Will Shenzhen be able to maintain the socialist spirit while carrying out reform, effecting opening, and making rapid economic development? This is an important question about which many people are concerned. We should say that such concern is not uncalled-for. Shenzhen is effecting a high degree of opening and is also adjacent to Hong Kong. It is situated at the marginal point of the two social systems and is undergoing changes brought about by the rapid pace of reform and the comparatively developed commodity economy. All these special conditions have indeed brought many new contradictions and problems to the construction of spiritual civilization. The party committee of the special economic zone was always soberly aware of this and attached great importance to strengthening the construction of socialist spiritual civilization while advancing reform, opening, and economic development. At the same time, it also actively explored the new way to build spiritual civilization while dealing with new issues under the new conditions of reform, opening, and the market economy. While building spiritual civilization, the special economic zone mainly gave guidance to people's values and enhanced people's quality in order to cultivate people with a lofty ideal, with moral integrity, with good education, and with a strong sense of discipline. The measures in this regard were rather concrete and effective. For example, the activities of "being good citizens and advanced units, and making Shenzhen a civilized city" were carried out consistently over a long time to promote Shenzhen's spirit of "pioneering, creation, unity, and dedication." Advanced individuals and institutions were elected regularly in the whole city on a large scale. Such activities played a positive role in giving value guidance to the people in Shenzhen. The party committee of the city also dialectically analyzed and treated the changes and influence brought by the commodity economy on the people's mentality. For example, the concepts of equality, competition, and efficiency are positive and progressive and should be promoted. Comrade Xiaoping also affirmed the slogan that "time is money; efficiency is life," which first appeared in Shekou. This idea has now taken root in the people's minds. On the other hand, Shenzhen was also soberly aware of the negative impact of the commodity economy on the people's thinking and mentality and effectively resisted money fetishism. In this regard, opinion media played a positive guiding role. Shenzhen also made great efforts to develop the cultural, educational, sports, and public health undertakings. In the 11 years between 1980 and 1991, Shenzhen's investment in educational undertakings accounted for 15.7 percent of the city's total expenditure. At present, there are all types of large and modern cultural, education, scientific and technological, sports facilities in Shenzhen. This is a major achievement which makes the people in Shenzhen proud. Another important measure for building spiritual civilization in Shenzhen was to seriously carry out anticorruption struggle among cadres and party members, and always take anticorruption as a major task in ideological and organizational building. Shenzhen successively adopted a series of regulations and rules and adopted anticorruption measures such as the "two openings and one supervision." It took the lead in the whole country in setting up the administrative supervision bureau and the complaint centers against economic crimes in order to intensify management and supervision over party and government cadres. At the same time, it strengthened the comprehensive control over public security,and severely cracked down on various economic crimes and other crimes. All this played an important role in maintaining good public order and public conduct in the special economic zone. Practice shows that, as long as we use both hands to grasp the work, the special economic zone will certainly be able to maintain the socialist spirit and simultaneously develop both material and spiritual civilization while making rapid economic development.
