Can the T-72 Stand Up to the M1A1?"] [Excerpts] Tanks have been used in many limited wars since the end of World War II; however, in terms of quantity, quality and intensity of combat, the 23-27 February 1991 ground warfare in the Gulf War may be rated the mother of all tank battles. Admittedly, the combat reports published today are explanations that the United States Department of Defense makes to Congress and the public; thus, they are bound to be biased. Nevertheless, it is still possible to make an evaluation of the tanks on the basis of these reports and a technical analysis. This article seeks to use technical analysis to find ways to remedy shortcomings in existing tanks and to develop technology for future combat tanks. [passage omitted] Battlefield Performance of M1A1 and T-72 Compared After the Gulf War was over, the Soviet-made T-72 and the American-made M1A1 tanks became an object of much verbal sword-crossing both in China and abroad. The main focus of remarks was on the following four things: Sighting and Aiming Equipment. If the decisive factor in the M1A1 tanks destruction of the T-72 tanks were to be listed in order of priority, the high performance thermal imaging sighting and aiming device would have to be placed first. This is also the reason that the American forces do a lot of night fighting, and even pick bad weather when visibility is very poor to fight surface warfare. The M1A1 tank's thermal imagining sighting and aiming device is a passive sighting and aiming device that can be used both during the day and night that the Hughes Corporation produces. It employs a single target periscope. Not only does the device provide images of targets, but it also displays range and various kinds of firing data that a laser range finder figures out. Night performance characteristics are as follows: Ten-fold magnification when the field of vision is 5 degrees; three-fold magnification when the field of vision is 16 degrees; and an effective night-sighting distance of 2,000 meters under ordinary circumstances. During serious sand storms, the sighting distance falls to 900 meters. The Iraqi Army's newest model T-72M1 tank uses an Iraqi-manufactured aiming device whose performance is substantially identical with that of the Soviet-manufactured TPN-1-49-23 infra-red night sighting and aiming device. The TPN night-sighting and aiming system employs an active infra-red system in which in the infra-red rays from an infra-red searchlight are reflected back from the target on which they shine. The receiving device for the TPN system, which is mounted to the left front of the gun turret, processes the reflected infra-red image to lock the aiming device on the target. Under ordinary weather conditions, its effective night-sighting distance is between 600 and 800 meters (at a 5.5-fold magnification), which is one-third that of the M1A1. In a severe sand storm, when visibility with the naked eye is less than 200 meters, the effective sighting distance declines to around 300 meters. Its most fatal weakness is that the infra-red rays that its infra-red searchlight emit amount to giving the M1A1's passive thermal imager a target to shoot at. Clearly, the T-72 is vulnerable day or night. Of course, the M1A1 tank's thermal imaging aiming device is not the acme of perfection either. For example, the thermal imagining device's image may darken at times; thus regulations provide that it is to be used a maximum of 8 hours per day. Furthermore, the thermal imagining system is unable to identify friend from foe. This resulted in American army tank's regularly damaging each other by mistake during the Gulf War. Long Distance First Round Hit Rate. The first round hit rate is of crucial importance in live warfare. This was amply demonstrated in the Gulf War. According to American Captain Jibeina [phonetic], company commander of D Company of the 1/35 Armored Battalion, First Armored Division: "Our company's 14 M1A1 tanks can unerringly hit T-72 tanks." A report from A Company of the 2/4 Cavalry Battalion of the American 24th Mechanized Infantry Division said: "Our company is equipped with 12 M1A1 tanks and 14 M3 cavalry tanks. During an engagement with an Iraqi Army T-72 tank, Corporal First Class Sinide's [phonetic] M3 Bradley cavalry tank came under attack from a T-72 tank at a distance of 600 meters. A shell from the T-72s 125 mm gun landed 10 meters away from the M3 without hitting it. The M3 only received a shock wave from it. Next, the Iraqi T-72 tank was destroyed by a shell from an M1A1 tank that was supporting the M3 tank from the rear." This is a classic example of what can happen when the first round fails to hit. During the Gulf War, the poor performance of the Iraqi tanks' fire control system, which led to inability to aim and fire quickly, provided the American tanks with opportunities. Reportedly, it takes an M1A1 tank 6.2 seconds to fire its first round. Although we do not know how long a T-72 takes, British Chieftain tanks, which are of the same generation as the T-72s, take 13 seconds. An American army report said that two M1A1 tanks that T-72 tanks hit could have been repaired, but the American army destroyed them on the spot for security reasons. It should be noted that these two tanks were hit at a range of less than 1,000 meters and that their armor was not penetrated. An American army investigator verified that most of the Iraqi army tanks that M1A1s hit with the first round were at a range of between 2,000 and 3,650 meters. Armor Piercing Power. The American M1A1 tank's gun fires an M829A1 armor piercing, fin-stabilized, descending sabot (APFSDS). This shell weighs 18.7 kilograms. Its core weighs 7.16 kilograms (including the sabot). The core is made of a low-grade uranium alloy, is 24 mm in diameter, and has a 20:1 length to diameter ratio. Its muzzle velocity is 1,675 meters per second, and the muzzle energy is slightly higher than 9 megajoules. At a range of 1,000 meters, it can pierce armor to the equivalent of 600 mm thick rolled homogenous steel armor. At 2,000 meters, it can pierce the equivalent of 550 mm thick armor of the same kind. The Soviet-made tank's 125 mm, long APFSDS has been developed for at least three generations. This includes the first BM-12, which had a total projectile weight of 29.9 kilograms, whose core was made of tungsten alloy, and whose diameter was 44 mm. Since the weight of the core is somewhat lighter than of the American-made armor piercing core (4.5 kgs), muzzle velocity is also somewhat higher (1,720 meters per second). However, because the core is light, muzzle power is also less at only 6.6 megajoules, and projectile velocity falls off fairly rapidly. This is particularly disadvantageous for long-range combat. In addition, the length to diameter ratio of the BM-12 is only 10:1, and the core diameter is greater. Therefore, core mass is less per unit of armor area, meaning that armor piercing energy per unit of area is less. At a range of 2,000 meters, its vertical armor piercing ability is only equal to 400 mm thick homogeneous steel armor. The shells that the Iraqi army used in the Gulf War may have been either the old BM-9s (whose production was halted in 1973), or the old style BM-11 armor piercing shells. The BM-9s core weighs 3.6 kgs; the shell's velocity is 1,800 meters per second, and its shell core length-to-diameter ratio is 9:1. Their remaining velocity capacity is poor. At a range of 1,000 meters, their velocity falls to 142 meters per second. At a range of 2,000 meters, the loss of projectile energy is even greater. Their armor-piercing power is much less than that of the BM-12, being only 24 mm. The BM-11 shell's armor piercing strength is 300 mm. It should be strongly emphasized that there is still room for improvement of Soviet-made 125 mm gun ammunition. Nevertheless, even the old BM-9 ammunition's muzzle energy is greater than that of the west's 105 mm gun's armor-piercing shells. The Middle East War showed that when an American-made second generation tank such as the M-60 was the adversary, all it took was the T-62's 115 mm gun to deal with it. The war in the Bakka Valley also showed that Israel's Merkava tank, which was designed with extremely close attention to survivability, likewise was unable to escape destruction from the T-72's 125 mm gun. These circumstances show that the APFSDSs that are used today are capable of dealing with an adversary that does not have the most up-to-date composite armor. Armor Defense It may be inferred that a material such as a fine mesh nylon fiber is placed between two layers of titanium high quality, double strength plates to make the M1A1 tanks' composite armor. The low-grade uranium material mixed into the M1A1HA tank's armor is 2.5 times as dense as steel. Unlike the composite armor of the traditional M1A1 tank, the new armor of the M1A1HA uses new materials, and it also uses a new form of construction. The new generation of composite armor no longer consists solely of layers of different materials with space in between, but adds a separating layer that is able to absorb shock or reduce damage. This layer is made up of extremely elastic honeycomb or corrugated material. It can absorb the shock energy of kinetic energy ammunition. It has a cushioning effect, and it can diffuse the kinetic energy throughout the entire construction material that braces the armor plate. No longer are the materials that form the composite armor plane joined by a bonding agent or welded together. Instead, layers of different materials simply overlap, each layer being able to move. This serves both to break up the core of the kinetic energy ammunition and to diffuse the explosive shell's metallic jet flow. By using this kind of construction, when a damaged piece of armor is changed or a new kind of composite armor is used, all that is required is to open the composite armor's external weld. The enter process of changing a piece of armor takes less than 15 minutes. Furthermore, this replacement of the low grade uranium armor can make the most of modern armor's best protection capability. By inference, the protection capability of an M1A1HA tank's armor against an APFSDS is equal to approximately 600 mm thick steel armor. In dealing with a high explosive squash head, it is equivalent to 1,300 mm thick steel armor. Therefore, a BM-11 armor piercing shell that a T-72 tank fires, which can only penetrate 300 mm of armor plate, naturally cannot penetrate the front armor of an M1A1 tank. Even a BM-12 cannot penetrate it. Reportedly, the front of the T-72M1 tank's turret has not only the main armor consisting of rolled steel armor plate, but also several layers of special armor having a maximum thickness of 280 mm. This special armor consists of three layers. The outer layer is armor steel; the second layer is glass fiber/ceramic material; and the third layer is also armor steel. According to an American army analysis, the T-72M1's armor not only can be penetrated by an American M829A1 shell, but it has no defense against a 125 mm shell.
