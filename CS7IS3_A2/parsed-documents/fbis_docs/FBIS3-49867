[Dimitrov] There really is such a decree and it is not such a terrible thing. It is not a secret. The head of state does not issue secret decrees. If it has not been published up until now, it is a result of the Presidency's internal order. [Denov] Why did you write the letter that explains the prerogatives of the Military Office to the Army chiefs? [Dimitrov] It was a high time to specify the status of the Military Office. Since we mainly work with the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, Minister Aleksandrov and General Petrov had to be informed. Democracy requires elements of organization, order, and discipline. The decree outlines the prerogatives of the Military Office, while the letter defines the order of mutual relations between the working entities of the two institutions. If someone is disturbed by regulating relations, then let him say so publicly and explain himself. [Denov] Was this coordinated with the prime minister? [Dimitrov] I find it difficult to answer this, because I did not attend all the meetings between the president and the prime minister. [Denov] Did you seek the opinion of the defense minister and the General Staff chief on the matters invoked in the letter? [Dimitrov] Of course. We had a joint discussion before the president signed the letter. Different opinions were expressed during the discussion about various formulations of the draft letter. Afterward, the disputed elements were eliminated. [Denov] Is it true that the chief of the General Staff sharply reacted against this letter? [Dimitrov] You must ask General Lyuben Petrov about that. This way, we, too, would learn what his objections are regarding anything related to the prerogatives of the president's Military Office. [Denov] Do you have a good relationship with Minister Aleksandrov and General Petrov? [Dimitrov] In their activities, the minister of defense, the General Staff chief, and the Military Office must be guided by the Constitution and the country's laws. [Denov] Does it mean that the president's Military Office obtains leading functions in anything related to the Army? [Dimitrov] Of course not. The speculations about the prerogatives of the Military Office date back to the first day of its establishment. We have refuted various rumors several times. You only have to look at the letter to become convinced. It explicitly points out that the Military Office has no leading and control functions vis-a-vis the General Staff and the Bulgarian Army. In addition it points out that the Military Office assists the president as a supreme commander in chief in implementing his prerogatives by collecting, analyzing, and summing up information. [Denov] According to the letter, is the information that the Military Office will receive from the Army leading entities not too serious in anything related to its scope and secrecy? Does this information provide the opportunity to practically activate the Army above the heads of the Defense Ministry and the General staff? [Dimitrov] No. At first glance, the information that the letter specifies is voluminous, but the frequency of preparing and sending it varies. Please note that the letter talks about copies of documents circulated in the General Staff and the Defense Ministry. Not a single document will be specially prepared for us. The hint that such information could be utilized in order to activate the Army is food for naive people. Placing the Army in various degrees of combat readiness is strictly regulated in the military's hierarchic structure and is absolutely impossible as someone's self-initiative. This also applies to the president's Military Office. Only specific members of the General Staff can place Army units in a state of combat readiness. [Denov] What document regulates the existence of the president's Military Office? [Dimitrov] The Military Office was established on the basis of Article 102, Paragraph 3, Item 5 of the Bulgarian Constitution, which allows the president to determine the order and organization of the services that act next to him. [Denov] Since you say that the information about the letter was released in a biased manner, could you say who is behind this affair? [Dimitrov] Those are people who do not care about the country's security, democracy, or proper relations between the state institutions. This is another attempt to drive a wedge between the state institutions' working entities. Those people compromise themselves and demonstrate elementary incompetence and legal nihilism. I think that this is another attempt to destabilize the situation in the country.
