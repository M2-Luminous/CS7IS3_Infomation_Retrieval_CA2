FR940927-0-00013 FR940927-0-00002 This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983. The Office of General Counsel has determined that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in subsections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12788. The provisions of this rule will preempt state and local laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions located at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought. This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. This rule will provide one policy form for insuring corn, grain sorghum, and soybeans and provide insurance for corn intended to be harvested as silage and corn intended to be harvested as grain without the previously required corn silage option. Using one policy for these three crops will: (1) Substantially reduce paperwork by issuing one policy form rather than the three separate policies previously used; (2) reduce the time involved to amend or revise the provisions by eliminating repetitious review processes; and (3) continue to allow insured the flexibility to elect any of the three coarse grain crops they wish to insure. By separate rule, FCIC will revise and later remove the corn, grain sorghum and soybean endorsements contained in 7 CFR 401.111, 7 CFR 401.113 and 7 CFR 401.117 and the Corn Silage Option contained in 7 CFR 401.112. These regulations will be amended to restrict the crop years of application to those prior to the crop year for which this rule will be effective. On Tuesday, May 31, 1994, FCIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register at 59 FR 28016 proposing to revise the Common Crop Insurance Regulations by adding new provisions for corn, grain sorghum, and soybean crop insurance. Following publication of the proposed rule, the public was afforded 30 days to submit written comments, data, and opinions. Comments were received from the crop insurance industry. The comments received and FCIC responses are as follows: Comment: Two comments suggested that the crop provisions should not be implemented for the 1995 crop year because: (1) Crop insurance reform will require many policy changes. Implementation of these crop provisions should be tabled until reform decisions are reached because impacts on policy terms are not yet clear. Delaying common policy implementation until it can be implemented in an orderly fashion should be beneficial to everyone concerned; and (2) The Common Crop Insurance Policy should be thoroughly reviewed and revised as needed before any additional crop provisions are implemented under it. Response: Program changes necessary to comply with crop insurance reform will have the same effects on either the existing policies or these Coarse Grains Crop Provisions. Any necessary changes can more easily be made to the Coarse Grains Crop Provisions as to the existing policies since only one policy will need to be amended. FCIC has recently completed a review of the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (ยง457.8). Any necessary changes required to be made to the Basic Provisions as a result of this review or as a result of reform will be required whether or not the Coarse Grains Crop Provisions have been implemented. Therefore, FCIC does not find it necessary to delay implementation for either of the reasons stated in the comments. Comment: Two comments were received regarding the proposed definition of ``Planted acreage.'' This definition requires the crop to be planted in rows far enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, or allowed by written agreement. (1) One comment stated that drilling soybeans is a widespread practice and that the definition should include drilling as an insurable planting practice for soybeans. The comment also suggested that the Special Provisions could contain restrictions for any counties where drilled soybeans are uninsurable unless a written agreement is requested. (2) One comment assumed that the Special Provisions will continue to allow for drilling the crops in the same areas as in the past. Response: FCIC acknowledges that planting of soybeans and grain sorghum with a grain drill rather than a row planter is a common practice in some areas. The definition has been modified by removing the requirement to plant soybeans and grain sorghum in rows far enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation. Since the crop provisions allow insurance for drilled soybeans and grain sorghum, it will not be necessary for the Special Provisions to specifically allow such practice. If necessary, the Special Provisions which are provided to the insured could restrict the insurability of this planting method in a particular area. Comment: One comment questioned requirements contained in the definition of ``Practical to replant.'' This definition indicated that the replanted acreage must have the potential to produce at least ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee. Late planting provisions provide production guarantees much lower than the ninety percent (90%) potential requirement contained in the definition even though the late planted and replanted crop may be planted at the same time. The comment recommended removing the production potential requirement from the definition of ``Practical to replant.'' Response: FCIC agrees that the production potential required by the definition of ``Practical to replant'' and the production guarantee for late planted acreage may be inconsistent depending on the time of planting. Acreage initially planted twenty-five (25) days after the final planting date would have a production guarantee equal to sixty (60%) of the guarantee for timely planted acreage, while the definition of ``Practical to replant'' would require acreage replanted at the same time to have a production potential equal to ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee. However, expected yield does have an effect on whether it is practical to replant. The ninety percent (90%) production potential requirement has been removed from the definition of ``Practical to replant''. However, the expected yield must be sufficient to cover production costs and must be at a level that growers in the area would normally care for and harvest. Comment: One comment recommended changing the term ``approved yield'' to ``approved APH yield'' in the definition of ``Production guarantee'' to correspond with terminology in underwriting procedure. Response: Underwriting procedure contains several methods which may be used to determine approved yields. These include the use of yields which may not represent actual production history (APH). Using the term ``APH'' could be misleading to readers not familiar with administrative procedures, and, therefore will not be used in the crop insurance policy. Comment: Three comments disagreed with the definition of ``Written agreement.'' This definition required written agreements to be requested at least 15 days prior to the sales closing date. (1) One comment recommended keeping the current deadlines for written agreements as specified in procedures. These procedures require that requests be made not later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date for most types of written agreements. Setting a deadline 15 days prior to the sales closing date will either force insureds to submit requests for written agreements they may not need, or result in uninsurable acreage if requests are not made for all possible situations. Unnecessary requests will increase paperwork for the insured, agent, FCIC Regional Service Office and company. The comment also recommended deleting the last sentence of the definition, which required written agreements to contain all variable terms including, but not limited to, crop variety, guarantee, premium and price election. The comment did not believe it was necessary to include this information on every written agreement because many written agreements do not alter these items. (2) One comment recommended keeping the deadline of 15 days after the acreage reporting date because there are many instances when it is not known that a written agreement is necessary until the acreage is reported. The comment stated that the change would be an unreasonable requirement and would create difficulties since the sales closing dates will be 30 days earlier than in prior years.
