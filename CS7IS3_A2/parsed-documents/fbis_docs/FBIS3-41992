By 6 February INB expects all 40 new fuel rods will be in the plant. Angra-1 will be undergoing its fourth fuel replacement process, an operation that is usually made every 18 months. The plant, which discontinued operations in 1993, will be started in the middle of February according to the latest decision by the directorate of Furnas, which operates the nuclear plant. Fuel rods are assembled at INB's Fuel Elements Factory (FEC) in Resende (Rio de Janeiro). Transportation between this city and Angra doe Reis (Rio de Janeiro) takes approximately six hours. During this first stage two fuel rods are being transported in each container, in four trucks.
