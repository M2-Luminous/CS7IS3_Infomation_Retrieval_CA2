The results showed that under appropriate combinatons of expression vector and host HIL3 yields approached 30-40% of total cell protein. Such optimal combinations were represented by E. coli HB101 and pTEIL3, and E. coli TG1 and pTOTE2L3. Precipitation, ultrafiltration and purification via HPLC provided IL3 preparations with a purity of > 98% and a specific activities on the order of 5 x 10E6 U/mg.
