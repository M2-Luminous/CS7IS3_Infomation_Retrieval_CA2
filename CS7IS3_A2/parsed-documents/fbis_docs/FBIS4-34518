FBIS4-34518 "drlat119_l_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-119 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Bolivia Clandestine Radio Stations Spreading Clandestine Radio Stations Spreading PY2006135194 Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 7 Jun 94 p 10 PY2006135194 Santa Cruz EL MUNDO Spanish BFN [Text] The Santa Cruz Chamber of Private Communications Media sent a letter to Telecommunications Director General Raul Campero Paz in which it regrets the proliferation of clandestine radios in this department despite the expressed commitment of the director general, who on 18 May conveyed his decision to use "all legal and technical means to prevent the emergence of new stations disregarding the requirements that rule the national broadcasting system." Enrique Roda Bush, chairman of the private communications media, referred to the creation and opening of radio "Amazonas 107.9 MHZ," which is already on the air in Santa Cruz. This proves that officials in the area have been overpowered in their effort to put an end to the operation of clandestine stations. He demanded an order that should work to fulfill the law's provisions. Campero Paz two weeks ago said he would personally order the DITER [expansion unknown] regional agent to prevent broadcasting by Radio Creativa, which did not have anything, not even a copy of the license application request form. He then reaffirmed his commitment to act in all cases that could emerge concerning radios that have not complied with the technical and legal reorganization of the radio broadcasting system.
