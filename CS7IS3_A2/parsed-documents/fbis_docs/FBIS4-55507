The government proposes that former owners be given coupons instead of property or cash on the condition that the owner in question used to hold Polish citizenship. The government's draft law on compensation for real estate seized illegally on the basis of provisions enacted in the years 1944-58 envisages that reimbursement be paid out and that nationalization be finalized. Sixty-five percent of reimbursement claims submitted to date apply to returning agricultural real estate and forests, 17 percent pertain to urban real estate, 5 percent to units dealing with services and trade, 2 percent to industrial enterprises, and 6 percent to other types of premises. The Ministry of Ownership Transformations estimates that all of the claims together total approximately 300 trillion zlotys [Z]. According to Kaczmarek, paying out such an amount or returning all of the property would endanger the state budget. He described the governmental reprivatization draft law as relatively safe, one that alleviates financial tensions and does not arouse new social conflicts. Reimbursement is to be in the form of compensation coupons--that is to say, securities that reflect the value of the claims. Only individuals with Polish citizenship--at both the time the property was seized and currently--would be entitled to such coupons. They will also be distributed among owners of property left on the territory of areas that currently are not included within the Republic of Poland. The draft does not allow for the possibility of returning a piece of property partially in the form of coupons and partially in the original form. The coupons' value will be determined according to the principle of regression. If a claim does not exceed Z1 billion, 100 percent of the value of the property would be returned in the form of coupons. In the case of claims worth between Z1 and 3 billion, 1 billion would be returned, plus 10 percent of the remainder, while, in cases of property valued at Z3 to 10 billion, Z2.5 billion would be returned, plus 10 percent of the remainder. For property worth over Z10 billion, it would be Z4.1 billion plus 10 percent of the remaining amount over Z10 billion. The reprivatization law would become effective three months after its publication. Applications would be collected over a year's time. Coupons would be valid for 10 years and would be valorized by having their value increased by 10 percent for every calendar year. With these coupons, one could purchase real estate and movable property being sold by the State Treasury, by gminas [small administrative units], and by self-governmental associations. Five percent of shares of each company being introduced onto the stock market would be reserved for owners of the coupons. The draft law, which applies to reimbursements associated with loss of property in the years 1946-58, was approved by the Council of Ministers' Economic Committee on 6 May, while, on Friday, it was debated during a session by a Council for Reprivatization that operates as attached to the ownership transformations minister. "The governmental draft reprivatization law was written in a hurry and in accordance with the worst examples of the Polish People's Republic," said Krzysztof Laszkiewicz, the council's chairman. In his view, the coupons that are being suggested by the government as compensation for property lost will be conducive to corruption. These coupons, for which nobody will be willing to sell anything, will be losing their value with every passing month. But, most probably, so-called skillful people will emerge, who will begin purchasing the coupons for pennies while the rightful owners will be left with what they have had for the past 40-something years, which means they will be left with nothing. "Only foreign countries will know that, because a law is in force, the problem of reprivatization has already been resolved in Poland. I think that is the only intention here," Laszkiewicz added.
