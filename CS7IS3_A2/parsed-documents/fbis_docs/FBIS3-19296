In his statement from NATO headquarters here, Supreme Allied Commander General George Joulwan gave no details as to when the handover would take place. The commander in chief of the southern European sector of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's forces is responsible for the alliance's operations in former Yugoslavia. These include Operation Deny Flight, which enforces the no-fly zone over Bosnia, and the seaborne Operation Sharp Guard, carried out in conjunction with forces of the Western European Union to ensure the embargo is not violated from the Adriatic. Boorda was named Monday by President Bill Clinton as commander in chief of the U.S. Navy. Smith is currently Washington's deputy chief of naval operations.
