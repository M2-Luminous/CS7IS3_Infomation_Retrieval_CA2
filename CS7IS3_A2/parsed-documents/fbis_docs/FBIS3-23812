FBIS3-23812 "jpusr021___94019" FBIS-USR-94-021 Document Type:JPRS Document Title: FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 4 March 1994 CAUCASUS AZERBAIJAN Azerbaijan Publications, Moscow Subscriptions in Trouble 944K0686B Baku VYSHKA in Russian 5 Jan 94 p 1 944K0686B Baku VYSHKA Language: Russian Article Type:CSO [Unattributed article: "Will We Be Reading Newspapers?"] [Text] The first business days of the new year were marked by numerous calls to the editorial office from both our readers and subscribers to various Moscow publications. All of them were concerned about the same issue--will they receive the newspapers to which they have subscribed in the current year, or does an information vacuum lie in store for them yet again? The editorial office has already informed our readers about the reasons for the irregular publication of VYSHKA in the last two months of last year. The lack of special plates for newspaper printing at the "Azerbaijan" publishing house is the reason. The management of "Azerbaijan" has now promised to ensure the publication of our newspaper once a week--on Saturday. The editorial office itself "arranged" the plates for today's issue. We understand that this report cannot make our readers happy in any way. However, such is the situation. As far as the Moscow publication to which the residents of our republic have subscribed, the situation is not particularly happy, either. The press distribution company Gasid has informed us that they have still been unable to transfer to Moscow the funds received for subscriptions. However, Moscow has promised to send publications printed there to subscribers, so to say, on credit in January. As for other newspapers that should be printed at the printing plant of the "Azerbaijan" publishing house, the situation is unclear for now, because of a shortage of the necessary quantity of the already mentioned plates.
