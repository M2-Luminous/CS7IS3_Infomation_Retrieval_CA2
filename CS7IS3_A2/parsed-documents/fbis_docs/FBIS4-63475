Speaking on Russian television on Saturday [21 May], Meshkov said that "we recognise our responsibility both to the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia" for possible consequences that the current developments may entail. He stressed that the Crimea's "willingness to work things out" must be "supported and guaranteed by all sides." He described as "understandable" the situation when "the most acute problem of the Black Sea Fleet" based in the peninsula "is being solved without the participation of the Republic of Crimea." Meshkov emphasised that the problem "affects residents of the Republic of Crimea" and their interests. He confirmed his intention "to solve all disputes on the basis of mutually beneficial and mutually acceptable terms." Meshkov said that at first the Crimea and Ukraine must sign an agreement in order to stabilise the situation and create conditions for signing an agreement between Russia and Ukraine. He stressed that this must be done in exactly this order, not vice versa. The president warned that the opposite may put the Crimea outside the settlement process and have a negative impact on the talks.
