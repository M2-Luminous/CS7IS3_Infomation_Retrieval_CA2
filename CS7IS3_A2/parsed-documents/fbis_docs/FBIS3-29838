A government source said the proposal aired Tuesday by ruling coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, "is one idea." "What is important is not to make (the targets) binding," said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Ozawa, the de facto head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), the key force in Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, said Tuesday he believed Japan could accept "endeavor targets" to assess its compliance with trade agreements. Ozawa made the comment in a meeting with foreign journalists, according to the associated press. The AP [ASSOCIATED PRESS] report quoted Ozawa as saying Japan only should agree to such targets only if the United States agreed not to penalize Japan for failing to meet them. "If we weren't able to meet the goals and the U.S. side quickly turned to trade sanctions, that wouldn't be right," he was quoted as saying. Earlier this month, Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton met in Washington but failed to strike a deal on ways to slash Japan's trade surpluses with the United States. At that time, Japan rejected a U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure the openness of its markets to imports.
