One can observe his dexterity in keeping everyone satisfied and avoiding any scandal. However, for some time, the unchallenged president of the Chamber of Deputies has been going through difficult times. He is being forced to change his tune. The first sign that should have warned him was his mini-conflict with Ion Iliescu at the Crans-Montana forum. The suspicions of some observers who, at the time, risked declaring that the "punch" Ion Iliescu gave his favorite was directed by other persons in the background have now been confirmed. Well-informed sources from the Cotroceni Palace admitted that, during that period, the president was poorly advised by his advisers. The most frequently repeated advice was: "It is too dangerous for you to propel Nastase forward so much." At that time, Nastase was supposed to mediate in the 'Arafat-Perez dialogue. Iliescu only sacrificed his pupil for something for which Ceausescu would have sacrificed his own right hand. What Iliescu did not know, but his advisers suspected, was that Adrian Nastase would react so violently. Once the ground was prepared, the rest was child's play. Convinced that the executive chairman had to be taught a lesson for his impertinence, Iliescu gave his advisers and their men in the party the green light. Shortly after that, reports on Adrian Nastase's houses appeared in ADEVARUL. The file was urgently taken over by "jack of all trades" Ioan Gavra, secretary of the Investigation Committee. Initially disappointed by this attack which, according to persons in his entourage, he suspected would come, but did not believe would be "so mean," Adrian Nastase declared a general mobilization in the party. According to people in the know, the pacifist and mild chairman proves to be extremely rude. However, his enemies have a great advantage, namely they are one step ahead of him and they also enjoy Ion Iliescu's support. In addition, they have been preparing for this confrontation for a long time. All recent speculations about reformers and conservatives in the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] proved to be more than empty words, and the latest compromise actions of Adrian Nastase are the best proof for this. But, as we know, communists do not forgive, no matter how much proof of loyalty one gives them. Their greatest fear is that Ion Iliescu might change his mind. He recently gave some signs in this direction, and caused panic among his advisers, who urgently warned their party colleagues. Dan Martian [former president of the Chamber of Deputies], who wants to regain his position of president of the Chamber of Deputies, and Ioan Solcanu, who dreams to become the party chairman, have accelerated the pace and it seems that they have just arrived at the last 100 meters. A very well informed person told us that the recent changes of direction in the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party (National Salvation Front]) are actually the aftershocks caused by the upheaval in the PDSR. Apart from a few loyal men in the party, Adrian Nastase seems to have no one else. He must form alliances. And whom could the former foreign minister think about first if not his former colleagues in the cabinet. The latest developments in the PD(FSN) are the extension of those in the PDSR. The following statement of the man who told us all this, naturally interested, is much too audacious to be ignored: "There is only one small step from here to an alliance between PD(FSN) and a possible faction of the PDSR." In any case, what seems to be certain is that we will have a series of surprises during the parliamentary vacation. The first surprise will emerge at the PDSR National Council that will begin deliberations as early as next week.
