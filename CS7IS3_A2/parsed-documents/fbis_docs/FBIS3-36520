This attitude, he said, was absolutely positive, showing the world community's appreciation of the historic step taken by Ukraine. The minister noted that the resolution adopted by the Supreme Council of Ukraine yesterday [3 February] was especially significant, in that the Supreme Council appreciated the steps made by the president and the government to follow the Supreme Council's recommendations contained in the 18 November 1993 resolution. "It is worth stressing," Anatoliy Zlenko said, "that the Supreme Council, having withdrawn its reservations on Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, thus confirmed Ukraine's intention to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as soon as possible, as a state that does not possess nuclear arms. This way, failure to make a decision on joining the NPT should not be regarded as the Supreme Council's negative stand on the treaty, but only as the Supreme Council's intention to examine this issue at a separate Supreme Council session." The minister then said that the Supreme Council's decision clears the way for exchanging instruments of ratification and thus completing the process of the ratification of the START Treaty. Anatoliy Zlenko told journalists that bilateral and trilateral talks between experts will be held in the near future with regard to the practical implementation of the principles laid down in the trilateral statement and its appendix signed on 14 January in Moscow. In the minister's view, the Supreme Council's decision makes it possible to speed up talks with international financial organizations, the European Union, and the leading Western states on the granting of effective aid to Ukraine for its economic reform. In reply to journalists' questions, the foreign minister said that only three nuclear warheads had been transferred from Ukraine to Russia so far, due to their unsatisfactory technical condition.
