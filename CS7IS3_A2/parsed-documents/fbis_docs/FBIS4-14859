Yeltsin might participate in the next elections for head of state not as a voter but as a contender has sparked a succession of statements from prominent politicians that they have no ambitions for the presidency. F. Fedorov and V. Chernomyrdin, in particular, have told the public so. Meanwhile, at Saturday's fifth congress of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] V. Zhirinovskiy was declared as the party's presidential election candidate. At the same time, the Liberal Democrat chairman received virtually unlimited powers from his comrades in arms and now has the opportunity to personally decide all party problems, including those which are the exclusive responsibility of the congress. "When we say the leader we mean the party, and when we say the party we mean the leader," V. Zhirinovskiy stated. The LDPR congress graphically demonstrated that a vigorous aggressive political force is rapidly taking shape in Russia and that the opposition's main problem, as a result of which it has constantly been defeated in the struggle against the president, seems to have been resolved. And this in turn is creating the preconditions for attracting into the LDPR's orbit not only an increasing number of rank-and-file supporters but also additional social groups and political movements. The presence of V. Achalov, who recently left Lefortovo, on the congress platform and of A. Lukyanov and Sterligov on the platform of the Congress of Slav Peoples is ample illustration of this. In brief, the congress slogan "The LDPR -- Heading for Power" should be taken extremely seriously. The political situation currently developing in Russia is beginning to increasingly resemble the situation which existed in the USSR in mid-1991. Now, following the adoption of the new Constitution, the president has finally moved from being a leader of the populist, democratic type to being the leader of the nomenklatura. He has become this both in his (constitutional) capacity as head of state and in his (de facto) capacity as head of the executive. But, despite everything, the state apparatus remains the most powerful political and economic force alike in our country. Thus, the president does not need his own party, talk about which is now into its second year. If B. Yeltsin enters the next elections, he will do so as the leader of the party of the nomenklatura. And it is no coincidence that the main theme of his message to parliament was the problem of strengthening the state. And the steps we are now seeing to strengthen and bolster the state apparatus are the logical continuation of his report. But it is at this point that an inevitable contradiction arises. The more powerful the state nomenklatura, the greater its leader's apparent chance of winning the election. But the strengthening of the nomenklatura constrains a civil society, which in this situation is bound to move across to opposition to it. You see, as we all remember, B. Yeltsin won precisely as the leader of the anti-nomenklatura opposition, and on the road to victory he had to pursue a policy aimed at weakening the nomenklatura and, as a consequence, weakening the state machine. Furthermore, since in our country the state is still more powerful than civil society, it is the head of state who bears the responsibility for the state of affairs in the country, and first and foremost the state of the economy. And although it is well known that the state of the Russian economy reflects the state of society as a whole and is largely independent of the president and that the present crisis is inevitable, and that one of the main reasons for it is Russia's shortage of skilled cadres capable of working actively in market conditions, it is nevertheless B. Yeltsin who will have to carry the can. The greatest likelihood, therefore, is that unless there are some real changes for the better in the country's economy before the next presidential elections, B. Yeltsin will find himself in the same situation as M. Gorbachev in 1989-1991, while a rival will find himself where B. Yeltsin was at that time, since his future rival will speak out against the state machine, which, furthermore, is much weaker than it was under the first president of the USSR. This is another reason why the hints from the top echelons of power that they will not allow an undesirable figure to come to power look somewhat unconvincing. Just how can you prevent the legitimate winner of presidential elections coming to power? Another attempted putsch? There is little reason to believe that if such an attempt failed in 1991, when the putschists had all the power of the empire available, it would be successful now. By announcing through his press secretary the possibility that he might participate in the next presidential elections B. Yeltsin has put himself in a pretty difficult position. On the one hand, the intensification of nomenklatura power lessens his chances of winning the election. But on the other, the weakening of this power leads to the weakening of his party. The president therefore has an extremely difficult task to resolve: How to regain the status of a political leader while also remaining the leader of the nomenklatura. There appears to be only one possible solution: Going into the elections as leader of all the democratic movements while at the same time gambling not on strengthening the state but on reducing the state apparatus to the optimum size, democratizing it, bringing the apparatus into line with the requirements of a market economy and the new conditions taking shape in the regions, and reforming local self-government (including the holding of elections of leaders of local administrations). That is, following the path of strengthening a specifically democratic state, which means strengthening those state institutions which are based on a civil society. At the same time the developments currently taking place in the state apparatus provide grounds for concluding that what we can see there is, on the contrary, an intensification of the trend toward restoring the administrative system which existed in Russia for decades -- a rigidly centralized executive hierarchy. But in general this is natural if you consider that state apparatus cadres consist mainly of members of the party and soviet nomenklatura. They have moved up from the number three or number four jobs to the top jobs. But their psychology and mentality are still the same. There is a perfectly obvious desire to transform the President's Administration into an analog of the CPSU Central Committee and recreate an administrative model of the Central Committee-oblast committee-rayon committee type, relying in the regions on governors linked tightly to the center. This model is already beginning to come into conflict with Russia's embryonic civil society. Maritime Kray Governor Ye. Nazdratenko fired the legally elected mayor of Vladivostok. Soon after this, Mayor D. Bednyakov of Nizhniy Novgorod, who had every chance of making the transition from an appointed to an elected mayor, found himself removed from his post. The head of St. Petersburg is demanding Moscow's permission to put military patrols on the streets. Here they all invoke the need to establish iron discipline. All the indications are that the state apparatus is approaching the limit of its potential for simultaneously resolving -- as it has been doing these past two years -- the two tasks of implementing reforms (taking account of its own interests, of course) and strengthening its own power. The contradictions are becoming unsurmountable, and a choice has to be made: reforms or power. Taking account of the fate of all Russian reforms this century -- Stolypin's, the New Economic Policy, Khrushchev's -- it is not hard to guess what the choice will be.
