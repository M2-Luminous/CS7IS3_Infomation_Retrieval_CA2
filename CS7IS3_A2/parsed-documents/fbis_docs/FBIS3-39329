And yet, the Commission of the European Union (EU) does not want to listen to the call for a crisis cartel in either the steel sector or in other industrial sectors that are experiencing difficulties. On 15 February, the European Commission will hold talks with Eurofer [European Steelmakers Association] on a further reduction of the production capacity in private steel companies. EU Commissioner Karel Van Miert, who is responsible for competition policy, is extremely pessimistic. "We will never reach the proposed objective of attaining a reduction of 30 million tonnes in the output of raw steel and of 20 million tonnes in rolled steel." The steel industry is currently enjoying a slight upswing. Moreover, it is using the ponderous decisionmaking within the EU on subsidies for the public sector steel industry as a pretext for leaving everything as it was before. A number of companies are requesting that the EU Commission itself intervene in the mechanism of the market by declaring a crisis situation, as happened in the 1980's. However, Van Miert does not want to hear of any such proposal. Meanwhile, the Germans are pushing for the establishment of crisis cartels. Here, too, Van Miert has pitifully little understanding for this idea. "We had a good steel plan. We are not going to replace it with a bad one," he said. However, mergers between steel companies will be allowed, provided they do not give the companies concerned a leading position on the market for specific products. If the sector fails to table any plans for further reductions next week, the European Commission will have to review its policy, said Van Miert. For instance, imports from East Europe would no longer be slowed down, and individual consultations on the prices of products would be stopped. Zinc The call for crisis cartels has never been so clamorous before, said Van Miert. Various sectors which are currently experiencing difficulties -- such as the paper industry and the chemical sector -- are knocking on the door in Brussels. The zinc sector will also shortly present its agreements for a 10-percent reduction in production. "As a matter of principle I am extremely reluctant when it comes to cartel agreements of this kind," said EU Commissioner Van Miert. As far as possible, Brussels is refusing to commit itself, unless the crisis in the sector is all too clearly the result of external factors. However, the European Commission did tolerate similar agreements between European aluminum producers, for the crisis in that sector had been caused by massive Russian exports.
