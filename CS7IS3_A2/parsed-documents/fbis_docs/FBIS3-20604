Analysts hold that recent changes in tax policy will have a great impact on foreign investors and have expressed their preference for a relatively long consultation and adaptation period, which they believe is necessary. Wu Lianfeng, assistant general manager of the Nanyang Commercial Bank, noted that China is only now preparing to reform its taxation system after more than 10 years of implementing the reform and opening up policy. However, he also pointed out that the value-added land tax, the consumption tax, and other laws and ordinances introduced early this year only provide a framework and that many specific procedures need to be worked out and improved. He noted that different interpretations of the new laws and regulations by the central and local governments have already caused a certain degree of confusion and disorder in their implementation and have disrupted investment projects by foreign businessmen. Chim Pui-chung, a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council who represents the banking and finance functional constituency, also urged China to give consideration to foreign investors' legitimate interests while continuing to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control. He warned that as other Asian countries were making efforts to improve their investment environment to attract foreign investors, China should follow suit; otherwise foreign funds could move elsewhere.
