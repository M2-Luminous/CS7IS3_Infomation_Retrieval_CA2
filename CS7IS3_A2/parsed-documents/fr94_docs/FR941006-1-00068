These regulations implement the provisions of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, which establish eligibility requirements for Presidential candidates seeking public financing and indicate how funds received under the public financing system may be spent. They also require the Commission to audit publicly financed campaigns and seek repayment where appropriate. The proposed rules reflect the Commission's experience in administering this program during the 1992 election cycle and also seek to anticipate some questions that may arise during the 1996 Presidential election cycle. The Commission is requesting comments on the draft rules set out in this Notice, and is also seeking comments on several issues for which no specific regulatory language is proposed at this time. No final decisions have been made by the Commission on any of the proposed revisions in this Notice. Further information is provided in the supplementary information which follows. dates: Comments must be received on or before December 5, 1994. addresses: Comments must be in writing and addressed to: Ms. Susan E. Propper, Assistant General Counsel, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463. for further information contact: Ms. Susan E. Propper, Assistant General Counsel, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463, (202) 219&hyph;3690 or (800) 424&hyph;9530. supplementary information: The Commission is considering revising parts of its regulations governing public financing of Presidential campaigns, 11 CFR Parts 9001 et seq. and 9031 et seq., in order to more effectively administer the public financing program during the 1996 election cycle. The Commission is publishing this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to invite comments on the proposed revisions. The areas in which the Commission is considering possible revisions are described in this portion of the Notice in narrative form. Those revisions that would affect both primary and general election campaigns are described in the first section of the narrative. The revisions that would affect only primary or general elections, respectively, are set out in the next two sections. The fourth section summarizes other miscellaneous and technical amendments the Commission is proposing for the public financing rules. The Commission has prepared proposed regulatory language for many of these revisions, and included this language in the last section of the Notice. However, the Commission is also interested in receiving comments on other possible changes for which no regulatory language has been prepared. The narrative describes these approaches and highlights the issues to which commenters are encouraged to direct their attention. Please note that the narrative discussion is arranged by topic, whereas the draft rules are set out in numerical order. Readers should use the citations contained in the narrative to locate the corresponding proposed language in the draft rules.
