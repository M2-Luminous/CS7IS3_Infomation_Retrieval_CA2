The decrease in recent years in the acreage of such important crops as grain, cotton and vegetables must be reversed, said State Councillor Chen Junsheng. Chen, who is in charge of China's agricultural and rural affairs, was speaking to more than 300 agricultural officials attending a national conference on agriculture that ended on Saturday. He said it is of strategic importance to national stability and the smooth implementation of a series of crucial reform measures this year to ensure adequate supply of farm produce. China has decided to plant at least 110 million hectares of grain and 6 million hectares of cotton this year to reach its 1994 target of 450 million tons of grain and 4.85 million tons of cotton. Even though the acreage of grain planted last year declined by about 666,700 hectares from 1992, China managed to reap another bumper harvest with a slight increase over the 442.6 million tons of grain harvested in 1992. In 1992, about 1.86 million hectares of grain fields were used to plant cash crops or for non-farming purposes. Chen criticized the rush to enclose and occupy large sections of farmland, including vegetable fields in suburbs, for development of real estate markets, industrial projects and other purposes. "Stimulated by quick profits, many areas, especially those in coastal regions, have abandoned agricultural production," he added. Some former grain-exporting provinces have become grain-importing ones, Chen noted. And output in former grain-importing provinces, including Guangdong, has declined further. Guangdong, with the country's most vibrant economy, has seen its farmland reduced by some 310,000 hectares since 1991. Its grain yield was 16.3 million tons last year, down 1.796 million tons, or 9.9 percent, from that in 1992. Its 1992 grain output was 3.4 per cent less than in 1991. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, most of the provinces in South China have experienced a decrease in output of grain and cotton. Chen laid the blame on less profitable farming, which has forced more and more farmers to leave farmland uncultivated, and the issuing of IOU notes --failing to pay farmers in cash when purchasing farm produce -- and increasing financial and labour burdens on farmers.
