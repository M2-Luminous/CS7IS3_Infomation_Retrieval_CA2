This morning, it was the senior military officers' turn to be received by the president. The meeting, which took place at the presidential palace, centered around only one subject -- the devaluation of the CFA franc and the accompanying measures. For three hours, senior officers of our Armed Forces listened attentively to President Soglo's message. The head of state explained at length the reasons for this unavoidable devaluation. He also stressed the effective taking of our destiny into our hands since Africa has ceased to be political pawn now that there is an end to the division of the world into blocs. Finally, the head of state stressed the need to consume locally produced items. To this end, he announced his plans to rehabilitate certain abandoned projects, such as the corn mill at Bohicon, the Save sugar factory, and Adjarala dam. The head of state did not announce any spectacular measures, but his message went down well. The officers understood the head of state's explanation. [passage omitted] The military officers used this occasion to present some of their grievances to the head of state. The meeting took place in a calm atmosphere. Concluding, the head of state expressed confidence in the future of Benin and Africa. We have the capacity to manage the situation, he said. [Begin Soglo recording] We have acquired the habit of consuming what we do not manufacture. We must produce the things in our country that we can consume, whether it is sugar produced locally or in the subregion, whether it is horny....[pauses] There are a lot of things that we have which, either through snobbishness, by habit, or by laziness because somebody was buying it for us, we continue to consume. These are things that we do not produce in our country. Now we are being asked to look around us, to find out what we can consume locally. Little by little, we will take off again. I think this is the real problem we have to solve. If we decide on the spur of the moment to create our own currency in this period of disorder, we can do that, but we should have done that earlier so that we would have been used to devaluation. In countries like those in Latin America, there is devaluation practically every year. People are used to it and act accordingly. We have not known this for 46 years. That is why we have this traumatic feeling about devaluation. I think that the whole of Africa will have a reawakening, and I think we have the capacity to bear it. [end recording]
