Is it a fact that, as asserted by these mass media, a Ukrainian delegation is also taking part in the talks in Washington? Will Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk participate in the Moscow summit? Our correspondent asked the chief of the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry's Information Directorate, Yuriy Serheyev, to comment on these reports. [Begin Serheyev recording] A delegation of Ukraine, led by Mr. Shmarov, is indeed in Washington, where the topics of consultations are the same old topics, i.e. the questions of balancing our mutual relations with the United States and having them concentrate on the sphere of the economy, rather than just on military and political negotiations and military and political cooperation -- this is a topic known to you and is also one of the principal aims of our delegations and the task that it is faced with, and of course continuing the consultations, that have been in progress for a long time and were stepped up in December, precisely on nuclear arms elimination issues [sentence as heard]. So this topic is well-known, the consultations are going on, and so far we cannot add anything new. The delegation will return and perhaps something new will be added which might be described as a working version which could then be tabled before higher-level delegations. As for the report that you quote as saying that a meeting in Moscow is possible, circulated by INTERFAX and some other agencies, there is indeed a certain mutual relationship between facts, events, and necessity. When presidents or high-ranking statesmen meet to talk, they have to have documents tabled before them to be looked at and signed by them. Up till now, we have only said that consultations and negotiations to work out possible documents are under way. I do not know what is the source of information about the possibility of such a meeting. What I do know is that a document has to be prepared to be considered at any meeting between presidents and any meeting between prime ministers. So it may yet be premature to talk about such documents having already been made ready now for the dates cited by INTERFAX, which are 14-15 January. At least, our delegation has to return from the United States, possibly for Mr. Shmarov and possibly for the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the president's administration to be asked that question. Perhaps this would provide a more logical situation for comment on a future meeting. What everything rests on is that nobody has sought and worked for a meeting for the sake of a meeting although, you know, much speculation has been made on this: In the past, whether Kuchma would or would not be allowed in the United States, and now, whether there would or would not be a meeting with the President of the United States. All this, as it were, is emotional. The main thing and the main topic, however, and the main answer will be where common interests and common, compromise decisions will be found. Then, perhaps, what you intended to say in your question will be implemented. Perhaps, this is how it is. That is why, I am not in possession of any information that I can provide you with, for me unequivocally either to confirm or deny the possibility of such a meeting. However, what I can do is to comment on this in this way, since the consultations and talks are still in progress. [end recording]
