(?Following) the statements of Joao de Matos, chief of General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces on 2 February 1994, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] broke the unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuito that had been in force for more than four months. a. Parachutes have been supplying their troops for four months, and this allowed them to get reorganized. b. MPLA aircraft were active the whole day on 5 February 1994, coming in waves of two bombers against UNITA lines. 2. Once more the MPLA has deceived the Angolan people and the international community. a. The MPLA claims victory in Cuito because it attacked -- it was not defending. Therefore, in less than five hours it occupied positions held by UNITA Armed Forces in Cuito. b. All authorizations for the air raids on UNITA lines were issued in Luanda. 3. UNITA's Political Commission and its General Staff have been holding a meeting since 1100 [1000 GMT] on 5 February 1994 to assess the situation. It has resolved to: a. To try to reestablish the cease-fire unilaterally proclaimed by UNITA on 20 September 1993. b. To explore possibilities of continuing with negotiations in Lusaka, taking into account the significant progress already achieved. 4. UNITA condemns France's invitation to the MPLA chairman to visit that country to buy weapons in exchange for oil instead of assisting the United Nations in its efforts to mediate the talks in Lusaka, because this encourages the MPLA to wage war. UNITA will once more be ready to face all challenges, the biggest of all being the universal cease-fire and peace in Angola. [Dated] Huambo, 5 February 1994. [Signed] UNITA's Political Commission.
