Until that time the rate of supply was 8 Mn cubic meters a day. Officials of the Azerigaz state-owned company told Interfax that the cause was that Azerbaijan had not pay the $50 Mn it owed for supplies in the first quarter of the year. That amount had to be paid with oil products, machinery and consumer goods. The Azeri government has not, however, set the export quotas. Turkmenistan was supposed to supply to Azerbaijan 3 Bn cubic meters of gas evaluated as $240 Mn. Since the beginning of the year 956 Mn cubic meters have been supplied and partly paid for in kind.
