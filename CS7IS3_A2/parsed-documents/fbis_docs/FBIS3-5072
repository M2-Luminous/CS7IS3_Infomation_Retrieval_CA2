This marks its single biggest commitment in a direct investment fund so far. Called AIG Asian Infrastructure Fund L.P., the fund could eventually reach U.S.$1 billion in three to four months, when more subscribers are drawn in, officials said. Singapore's investment is being made through the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), which has contributed U.S.$200 million, and Temasek Holdings, which has injected U.S.$50 million. This makes a total of U.S.$250 million (S$400 million). "This will be the single biggest commitment and direct investment for GIC and Temasek," GIC's deputy managing director, Dr Teh Kok Peng, said yesterday, following the fund's contract-signing ceremony. The other major investor in the fund is American International Group (AIG), which has committed U.S.$100 million through its wholly-owned subsidiary American International Reinsurance Company. The partners hope to attract other Singapore investors, who must contribute a minimum of U.S.$10 million each. The fund has already caught the interest of major American pension and endowment funds, which account for most of the remaining U.S.$411 million invested. Subscribers include General Electric Co, the University of California and Princeton University. China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) -- one of Beijing's biggest conglomerates -- has invested U.S.$25 million. State-owned Citic and the Bank of China will give advice on the fund's investments in China. GIC and Temasek will co-manage the fund through their newly-set up affiliate, Singa Infrastructure Management. The other co-manager is AIG. Pakistan's former caretaker prime minister and ex-World Bank chief of operations, Mr Moin Qureshi, will be the fund's chief financial adviser. It is believed that Mr Qureshi's credentials helped persuade the Singapore Government to participate in the fund, when it was approached initially by AIG several months ago. Another factor was the high potential financial returns. As much as half of the fund is expected to go to projects in China. The balance will be invested in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines Taiwan and Thailand. However, other Asian countries may receive up to one-fifth of the fund. Said Mr Qureshi yesterday: "China and ASEAN offer the most attractive opportunities for foreign investment over the next decade." The fund will focus on power, telecommunications and transportation projects. It can, however, invest in other resource developments, property or environmental services projects. Officials said they hoped to give investors a 20-25 percent return on equity. The 10-year fund is allowed to invest up to U.S.$80 million in any single project. The fund is considering investing in projects in Thailand and China first. China alone is forecast to need between U.S.$55 billion and $60 billion to develop its power facilities. Asia's cash-starved infrastructure sector has emerged as a red- hot investment target for global funds. In early February, billionaire financier George Soros's Quantum Industrial Holdings teamed up with GE Capital to set up a U.S.$2.5 billion global fund for power projects. Mr Soros had also announced plans to link up with Hong Kong brokerage Peregrine Investment to launch a U.S.$1 billion Asian Infrastructure Fund. Officials said the success of these infrastructure funds could spark off a flow of capital into the region on an unprecedented scale.
