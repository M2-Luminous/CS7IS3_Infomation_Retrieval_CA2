FR940804-0-00043 FR940804-0-00019 47 CFR Part 24 [GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, FCC 94&hyph;195] New Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz Band AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this Further Order on Reconsideration , the Commission adopts a multiplier for use to determine whether interests in cellular and broadband PCS licensees held indirectly through intervening corporate entities should be attributed for purposes of the Commission's broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and broadband PCS spectrum cap rule. This action is taken so that these rules can be more effectively enforced consistent with their intent, which is to ensure that broadband PCS licensees lack any incentive to impede the development of full competition with the cellular licensees or with other broadband PCS licensees in the same geographic area. EFFECTIVE DATES: September 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jonathan Cohen, Office of Plans and Policy, (202) 418&hyph;2030. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This Further Order on Reconsideration is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch, Room 230, 1919 M Street N.W., Washington, D.C.

Further Order On Reconsideration In the matter of: Amendment of the Commission's Rules to Establish New Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz Band. Adopted: July 22, 1994. Released: July 22, 1994. By the Commission: 1. In the Commission's Memorandum Opinion and Order in this proceeding, FCC 94&hyph;144, 59 FR 32830 (June 24, 1994) (`` Memorandum Opinion and Order ''), we reaffirmed our bright-line cross-ownership attribution standards, which apply to common ownership of licenses in the Domestic Public Cellular Radio Telecommunications Service (``cellular'') and the Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband PCS''). We also ruled that no entity would be permitted to hold broadband PCS licenses comprising more than 40 MHz of spectrum in a particular PCS service area. The purpose of both the broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and the broadband PCS spectrum cap rule is to ensure that broadband PCS licensees lack any incentive to impede the development of full competition with the cellular licensees or with other broadband PCS licensees in the same geographic area. 2. We determined that an interest of 20 percent or more in a cellular license will be attributable, 1 and that an interest of 5 percent or more in a broadband PCS license will be attributable. See Memorandum Opinion and Order at ¶¶109&hyph;110. Under the broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule, entities with attributable ownership of a cellular license covering 10 percent or more of the population of a broadband PCS service area are limited to holding one 10 MHz broadband PCS license in that broadband PCS service area until January 1, 2000. See 47 CFR 24.204. Under the broadband PCS spectrum cap rule, parties are not permitted to hold attributable interests in licenses covering more than 40 MHz in the same PCS service area. See 47 CFR 24.229(c). In determining how to calculate a party's interest in a cellular licensee when it is held through multiple tiers of entities, we stated that the interest of a subsidiary is attributed in full to the parent. See Memorandum Opinion and Order at ¶116. The same rule would apply to interests held in broadband PCS licenses through multiple tiers of entities. 1 Certain entities are permitted to hold up to a 40 percent interest in a cellular license without attribution. See 47 CFR 24.204(d)(2)(ii). 3. Herein we reconsider, on our own motion, the issue of whether to use a ``multiplier'' to determine how interests in cellular and broadband PCS licensees held indirectly through intervening corporate entities should be attributed. A multiplier is currently used by the Commission in our attribution rules in the broadcast context. See 47 CFR 73.3555, note 2(d). To determine the ``true'' ownership interest of a party whose interest in a broadcast licensee is held through intervening entities, each non-majority, non-controlling interest is multiplied together. For example, a party that owns a 25 percent non-controlling interest in a corporation that has a 10 percent non-controlling interest in a licensee would be deemed to have a 2.5 percent interest in the licensee. As we concluded in adopting a multiplier for broadcast attribution, use of a multiplier allows the Commission to accurately take account of a party's ``actual involvement with the ultimate licensee'' as well as its ability to exert control over the actions of the licensee. See Reexamination of the Commission's Rules and Policies Regarding the Attribution of Ownership Interests in Broadcast, Cable Television and Newspaper Entities, 97 FCC 2d 997, 1018 (1984), recon. , 58 RR 2d 604 (1985), further recon. , 1 FCC Red 802 (1986), 52 FR 1630 (Jan. 15, 1987). We concluded that ``use of a multiplier would more realistically reflect a party's attenuated interest in a licensee where there are intervening corporations, than does the present practice of fully attributing any interest above the benchmark through each intervening corporation.
