Shaymiyev at special 20th session of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan; date not given] [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies! Probably no one needs to be persuaded that there will be economic reforms in the Republic of Tatarstan only if there are the corresponding social and political prerequisites. If the social processes occurring in the republic are considered from this viewpoint, an unequivocal conclusion may be drawn: All the necessary prerequisites for a resolution of the economic problems in Tatarstan are today to hand. We are talking primarily about the increasing trend toward a strengthening of civil peace and interethnic harmony. We had also noted the positive nature of this factor in constitutional development earlier. Reality is confirming its value by the day. Everything that contributes to a stable atmosphere and the formation of the civil society and a multiparty system will receive the maximum support from us. It is a question of respect for the sovereignty of the multinational people of Tatarstan and the priority of human rights, regardless of nationality, sex, or religious belief, and the assurance of the rule of law and constitutional legality. Today, more than ever, especially as we move toward the 50th anniversary of Victory Day, we all need the organic connection of the generations and their mutual responsibility to one another and the creation of a kind of association of patriotic forces and the incorporation in them of all those who love their native land and work on it and all those for whom the words "I am a citizen of Tatarstan" have profound moral meaning. Proceeding from this, I deem necessary an acceleration of the elaboration and adoption of a republic program of patriotic upbringing based on the best traditions of our people. The creation of new mechanisms and procedures for notifying the public of the most important events of domestic and foreign policy occurring in the republic also is pertinent. And mention has to be made of an increase within the framework of the law in the responsibility of the news media and an improvement in the work of radio and television. In a word, reforms need to be given the go-ahead in the ideological sphere. A most important condition of economic transformations in the Republic of Tatarstan is the development of relations with Russia. The strategic goals in this direction are clear, they have been set forth both in the republic constitution and in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan treaty of 15 February 1994. I believe that it is possible to speak with a full sense of responsibility about the consensus of the public, which has recognized this treaty, that has taken shape. The past three months have shown in various aspects--constitutional, personal, national--the soundness of our policy and the absence of any alternative to it. No, the treaty has not automatically removed all current problems. But its role lies elsewhere--being the instrument of their solution. There was a most active debate on this and other matters in the course of the working visit of B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, to Tatarstan. The visit was essential for both the Russian and the Tatar sides. And the fact that this trip took place following the signing of the Social Accord Treaty lends the visit particular political significance. The range of problems discussed, raised largely on our initiative, and of the decisions on them was quite broad. The economic and financial theme was represented by plans pertaining to the Kama Truck Plant and the Yelabuga Automobile Works--in respect to which decisions have already been adopted--and the defense and oil-refining complexes. Agreement was reached on the Russian side's participation in the restoration of the Kazan Kremlin historical and architectural monument. Assistance to representatives of the Tatar diaspora in Russia and an expansion of the international relations of the Republic of Tatarstan were discussed specifically and fruitfully. We thereby succeeded, aside from the solution of political questions, in involving the Russian Federation Government in the current implementation of federal and joint programs on the territory of our republic. And the central place in the negotiations was occupied by the question of the effective realization of the Russo-Tatar accords, of course. Attaching importance to the realization of the treaty and the intergovernmental agreements, Boris Yeltsin and I formed a bilateral commission composed of representatives of the supreme executive of both parties for supervision of the progress of fulfillment of these agreements. Members of the commission, which is headed on our side by M. Sabirov, prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, include V. Likhachev, vice president of the Republic of Tatarstan, R. Muratov and F. Khamidullin, deputy prime ministers, and Sh. Arslanov, minister of foreign economic relations of the Republic of Tatarstan. On the Russian side the president entrusted leadership of the commission to O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government. This commission has been instructed to draw up proposals for the decentralization of the economy of the Russian Federation on the basis of the example of the Republic of Tatarstan. This is a continuation of the agreements that we achieved at our suggestion immediately following the signing of the treaty. This attention to the treaty is perfectly explicable. The innovative role of the Republic of Tatarstan in the reform of Russia and its contribution to the building of a renewed federation today is a generally recognized fact. The recent meetings between the leaders of the Republic of Tatarstan and the leadership of Turkey, Poland, and Austria and business circles of the United States, France, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, and the CIS countries and numerous publications in the national and foreign press point to this. The treaty has evoked interest also as a possible approach and procedure for the settlement of regional conflicts in Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia and in Russia itself. Esteemed people's deputies! Throughout the second session, the economic situation has been discussed keenly and with concern by the people's deputies and by the entire population of the republic, I would say. The spectrum of positions and opinions is most wide--from acceptance of the measures presented by the government through their complete rejection. This is understandable since even venerable scientists and experienced practical experts have proven incapable of making a precise analysis of what is happening in the Russian economy and in the CIS as a whole at this time and of presenting a prescription for recovery. Each speech heard here today, therefore, whether it be liked or not, should be perceived as a set of proposals geared to the recovery of the republic's economy. They will undoubtedly be studied and adopted, as far as possible, for the formulation of the appropriate anticrisis documents. There is on the part of certain deputies an aspiration to politicize the situation and to attempt to discern in the explorations of the president, the government, and its individual members insurmountable contradictions in an evaluation of the course of the reforms that should, in their opinion, bring about the immediate fall of the government or something else besides. To expect such an outcome and to connive at this in every possible way is to utterly oversimplify the ways of extrication of the economy from the pre-crisis state. Yes, indeed, the situation is very complex, and it requires of all of us an objective appraisal and a balanced, skilled approach in trying to overcome it. Whereas the government has thus far succeeded by half-measures in mitigating or eliminating the emergent problems of the transitional period, it is now necessary in a number of areas to fundamentally alter our approach, advancing the reforms, and to adapt to the market. Having opted, as distinct from other regions, for the path of a gentle entry into the market, we have in these years created a sparing regime for the entire populace of our republic, and the state authorities have undertaken here reforms with a human face in a more stable economic situation. And what we have all encountered today, the absolute majority of regions of the Russian Federation, if not all, encountered two years ago. And the population of these regions is experiencing the costs of the mistakes made in the course of the reforms. We told the people honestly that the difficulties of the transitional period would confront us also. We have thus far tried to push them away as far as possible. But how, since we are all in a single economic space, can it be otherwise. And this day has now come. In their politicized speeches some deputies are interpreting the ongoing processes in their own way, unfortunately. They proposed that the economic reforms be conducted otherwise, they say. But they were not heeded, and this is the result. But they are for one reason or another silent about the results where reforms have been undertaken in accordance with analogous proposals. And it is, after all, roughly according to their format that the reforms have been undertaken in almost all regions of the Russian Federation. And? We are today expressing discontent at the mistakes that have been made and because of which, being in a single economic space, our economy also is suffering. If you have something to say, therefore, you should say it objectively, not one-sidedly. In a word, this means urging us on toward a worse situation, that to which, according to their logic, we should have aspired and that which we should have reached more rapidly. No, we did not do this. And the people understood us and understood us right. What, then, is happening at this time? The peak of the arrears crisis, which has exposed all commodity producers, having shown the extent to which they are prepared for survival under the conditions of a reduction in the timeframe of the transitional period, has now arrived. The entire economy faced the dilemma: to consent to a wholesale mutual offsetting of accounts and via hyperinflation alleviate the position of the commodity producers and, through them, facilitate the accomplishment of many current social tasks, preserving here, and also for the future, many inefficient works, on which practically everyone relied and still relies; the second path is a strict policy of curbing the rate of inflation within the framework of that promised the IMF and, via radical measures, putting the commodity producers under survival conditions. It is now clear to all that it is this version that has been chosen. There is no doubt that the uncertainty in terms of time in the actions of authorities of all levels and the inevitability of the attempts to combine these two versions made the position of the basic commodity producers even worse. Today's situation in the economy is not an individual Tatar phenomenon, it is a phenomenon that has encompassed without exception all of Russia and the CIS. In a word, the entire basis of the USSR. When an arrears crisis hits, it affects first and foremost, naturally, territories with a powerful industrial-energy potential and specific works. The slump at major works means not only a shortfall in tax revenues, it signifies primarily the reduced incomes of the huge number of people employed there. There is no doubt that this is causing a deterioration in the social position of a large part of the population, of the industrial regions particularly. The decline in production is substantial everywhere. The decline here in Tatarstan in the period January through May amounted to 30 percent; production constituted 70 percent of last year's level. In Nizhniy Novgorod--66.9 percent, Penza--64 percent, Mordvinia--55 percent. Production in the period January through April in Tatarstan was at the level of 70.2 percent, in Saratov--61.1 percent, Udmurtia--70 percent, and Chelyabinsk--64.7 percent. In Bashkortostan, it was 78 percent--somewhat lower [as published] because it managed to maintain oil production thanks to the existing large oil-refining capacity. This is what is happening in the national economy and economics as a whole. There is no doubt that unless inflation is subsequently permitted to a moderate extent and there is selective support for the agro-industrial complex and individual sectors of the economy, the situation as a whole could prove not only critical but profoundly critical. And a real crisis in the economy could erupt in our republic also. The edicts of the Russian president that we discussed during the meetings of heads of the republics proceed, therefore, from a recognition of the situation that the Russian economic space as a whole has now encountered. I believe that as a result we succeeded in speeding up somewhat B. Yeltsin's adoption of a number of edicts on the economy. But this does not indicate that there will be wholesale payments and that inefficient works will be preserved. There will be nothing of the sort because these edicts are being accompanied by the implementation of measures pertaining to the bankruptcy and the sale of inefficient enterprises. No one state and no one person is in a position today of continuing to support unprofitable production. There is no other solution. We speak a great deal about the problems of the military-industrial complex, yes, there truly are such, and they need to be studied, but the decline in production in four months of the current year is connected primarily with the reduction in production in the oil and petrochemical sectors. They account for 39.4 percent of the decline and the military-industrial complex, on the order of 7 percent of the total decline, although the military-industrial complex also experienced a reduction in volume in the four months of 47 percent. Arrears in the petrochemical complex constitute approximately R1.5 trillion, and if we consider that in the first quarter this complex accounted for almost [figure illegible] percent of the republic treasury receipts, thus also the problem of the tardy payment of the wages of persons in the publicly funded sectors, the shortfall in the receipt of monies for support of the agro-industrial complex, and much else. This is to what attention needs to be paid first and foremost. This is an example that shows how important it is for the government to know, on the basis of a more in-depth analysis, how to find the key aspects on which the fate of the budget and the resolution of social problems depends. I believe that this is understood and that purposive work will be done. Speaking of the priority measures for economic recovery, I agree entirely with Deputy T. Abdullin, who proposed an investigation into the movement of finances and their resources in the republic. There was virtually no mention of this in the report, unfortunately, yet this question is at this time fateful for the economy of Tatarstan. If we wish to abandon the high lending rate and concentrate within the republic our own credit resources and make efficient use of the finances that are formed on the territory of the republic, the study and resolution of the movement of finances is a key, urgent measure of economic recovery. There are questions of a strategic nature here also, and I will speak of these later. Deputy A. Yefremov spoke in his speech about the drain of money to other regions. These questions are all interlinked and require very serious, skilled, and competent intervention. Or take the circulation of bills: First, it is largely thanks to its introduction that we have in recent years succeeded in having the least decline in production--in the period 1991-1993 it constituted 36.8 percent for the Russian Federation, 28 percent for the Republic of Tatarstan. We managed to provide for the turnover of mutual payments in the amount of R500 billion via bills of exchange in 1993 alone. Much can and needs to be done via bills of exchange in the current year also. We are already into the sixth month, but a fundamental approach to a further expansion of the sphere of the circulation of bills has yet to be formulated, unfortunately. The prime minister and government members are not managing to overcome the psychological barrier connected with the work with securities. Is there really any explanation for the scandalous fact of the nonpayment for a medical diet in medical institutions adduced by Deputy I. Mustafin, whereas there is this entire turnover within the republic, and bill circulation is being ignored. For according to information from the minister of health, it is a question of debts of the Ministry of Health to the Public Catering Administration of R32 billion, no more, no less. It is about such specific measures, of decisive significance, that we should be speaking when we deal with the priority steps of stabilization of the economy. The bill of exchange system is a very useful financial instrument performing an important role in an economy in which the banking and financial systems are insufficiently developed as yet. It should undoubtedly be under the control of the National Bank of the republic, and care to ensure that it not contribute to a sharp rise in inflation should be taken here. I believe that the adoption of a program in support of enterprises has been dragged out unjustifiably. It is the third time that I have spoken officially on this problem, which is one of the most urgent. There is some rejection of that to which we must aspire since we have embarked on the path of a market economy. This being what we should arrive at via all-around support for medium- and small-sized business and enterprise, and we should, via this, secure the well-being of the rest of society. Note the percentage increase from year to year in the proportion of income tax from individuals. Two years ago it constituted 6 percent, last year, approximately 11 percent, and now it constitutes 17.5 percent of our tax base on the revenue side. This is the part of the tax base that the treasury is confident it will receive. It is growing and will continue to grow. In four months we received on average as income tax from individuals in the republic an average [as published] R11,000 from wages. From the persons that are employed in the entrepreneurial structure this figure constitutes R53,500. Economics requires calculation, profound analysis, and an ability to determine priorities. We are talking today about measures for the recovery of the republic's economy. And the administration chiefs should be clear in their own minds that the main source of the formation of local budgets should be for many of them income from enterprise, medium- and small-size business, not subsidies. Enough of soliciting subsidies. When it comes to allocating subsidies, the government must act differently. We need to make provision for the direct dependence between the amount of subsidies, which we give many cities and districts each year, and the extent of the development of market structures and how they are developing enterprise and medium-and small-size business. Look, the Kama Truck Plant has suffered a big disaster, but Naberezhnyye Chelny continues to live, and lives pretty well. Count up what the income from entrepreneurial activity is there. Everyone needs to bolster and increase the revenue side of his budget. Yes, whether some people like it or not, the real estate market has, as M. Sabirov's report said, to begin to operate at full strength. There is no market economy without a real estate market. A change in the nature of the work of the banks and financial services is needed. I have dwelt merely on certain aspects concerning urgent measures--there are many of them, unquestionably. The main thing now, having adopted them, is to concentrate on their immediate solution [as published]. The government needs to be afforded an opportunity to realize what it is proposing. We cannot permit ourselves a lengthy warm-up period. I believe, therefore, that the deputies will support the government and permit it to realize all that it has devised with regard to the observations made during the discussion of this matter. I believe that this is at this time the front of activity and, simultaneously, the fate of the government. A program of Tatarstan's socioeconomic progress, which will require in-depth study and time, if only until the fall, is undoubtedly needed for determination of the prospects of our development. After all, it is not the question of a program as we have become accustomed to understanding it but of a clear, precise, and practical program, specific for all executants, which we should follow every day. All our actions should be undertaken in accordance with this long-term program of republic economic and social progress. We have thus far succeeded, thanks to the Program of Social Protection of the Populace, in holding back the process of a decline in the living standard of our population. The main indicator of determination of the living standard of society as of this time is the ratio of per capita income to the magnitude of the subsistence level. In April of this year it was as follows: 1.99 for the Republic of Tatarstan, 1.55 for the Russian Federation. These indicators vary by the month, but the difference has never yet been less than 0.5 in favor of the Republic of Tatarstan. This indicates that the living standard in Tatarstan is 20-25 percent higher than in the Russian Federation on average. A social consequence of the transitional period of the economy en route to the market is the stratification of the population in terms of income level. The main mechanism of realization of this policy also [as published] is the program of targeted social assistance, which has been in effect in our republic for more than a year. Today the deputies have been asking: What have we gotten from "an increase in the minimum wage in the republic to R30,000 compared with the R14,600 for Russia." It is said here that the average monthly wages of a person working in the national economy in Russia are approximately 20 percent higher than in Tatarstan. I also have to make things clear in regard to what comes next. These are not comparable figures. It needs to be considered that the level of the average wage for Russia is greatly influenced by the regions of the Far East and the Far North, the high amount of the earnings in which is determined by weightings and extra payments. If, however, we take the Volgo-Vyatskiy and Volga regions, the level of the average wage among the 13 territories in Tatarstan is in second place, whereas the prices of bakery and meat and dairy products with us are lower, except for Ulyanovsk. And you know that our cities come second and third among 110 cities of the Russian Federation in terms of cheapness of the consumer basket. The public should know this. How are we to act today, when the economic situation is becoming increasingly complicated and the government is proposing that minimum pay be established in the amount of R50,000. We need to get a clear picture first and foremost of whether we will adhere to the policy of prevention of the wholesale impoverishment of our society or not. Our methods have been justified thus far. Here are the figures of the Center for Information Science, Administration, and Forecasting for 28 May: The subsistence level according to the procedure for our republic is R46,500, according to the procedure for the Russian Federation, R49,000--this on our territory. Whatever, the minimum wage must be in the range of this amount. Otherwise the living standard of society will decline even more. The terms "poor" and "destitute" have appeared in the press frequently as of late. There have been attempts to exacerbate the social situation in this way. Nonetheless, it is a warning signal, and the government must remember this. It has submitted its proposal concerning a rise in the minimum wage. This matter has been framed correctly, I believe. Who are the main opponents of an increase to raise minimum wage to R50,000? The leaders of enterprises that are operating inadequately, I believe. We are putting this condition to the commodity producers: The Supreme Soviet and the government do not agree that some of them cannot pay those whom they have hired the subsistence minimum. It is our people that are working there! In this case we must tell them; you do not have the right to deprive them of the subsistence minimum. And if you are not in a position to provide people via their wages with the minimum without which it is impossible to manage, thought needs to be given to the competency of such commodity producers. I agree that there are many issues here, particularly in respect to the publicly funded organizations. The budget deficit is considerable, as it is. I believe that the difference in respect to the payment of pensions that has come about should be assumed by the Retirement Fund, and in respect to the unemployed, by the Employment Fund, which should begin to operate properly. The enterprises, on the other hand, should look after those whom they have hired. Unemployment is a particularly important problem. But the market society in which there is no unemployment does not exist. There is a greater or lesser number of unemployed, but this is a somewhat different issue. Unfortunately, some people are exaggerating this matter, as though the phenomenon were typical only of Tatarstan. Here are recent figures: Unemployment in Tatarstan constitutes 0.36 percent, in Bashkortostan--0.82 percent, in Mariy El--3 percent, in the Chuvash Republic--4.3 percent, in Udmurtia--3.9 percent, in Nizhniy Novgorod--1 percent, in Samara--0.67 percent, and in the Russian Federation--1.6 percent, of the total size of the able-bodied population. Yes, there is, in addition, concealed unemployment. But account has to be taken of one fact: If the enterprises cannot give their employees the minimum, this should be done via the employment authorities in the procedure established by law. Such are the laws of the market, and such are the functions of the state under the conditions of the market. Catering for the subsistence level is our duty. We are organs of state power. We could, I believe, support the proposal of Deputy G. Kobelev and, having modified it, put the question of the minimum wage on the agenda of the next session. But a law on the minimum consumer budget must be adopted today or tomorrow. Otherwise we would be binding the government hand and foot because the subsistence level includes expenditure on public utilities, transport, food, and much else. In conclusion I would like to say this. The government has proposed urgent measures for economic recovery and has simultaneously submitted for your consideration a list of all the enforceable enactments that it needs to realize these measures. I have calculated that we will have to draw up and adopt 15 bills, 12 decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers, and two presidential edicts. But time is pressing. I believe that, in accordance with the government's request, you will entrust to the president the adoption of the edicts legislatively enshrining the realization of the urgent measures pertaining to economic recovery in order for the government to have something to take as a basis prior to the Supreme Soviet's adoption of the corresponding laws. Commissions of the Supreme Soviet should join in the elaboration of these legislative instruments also. I would like to make particular mention of the Program of Socioeconomic Progress. This program is essential. The republic needs a medium-term comprehensive and balanced program of embarkation on the path of socioeconomic progress. The long-term goal of the program is a rise in the living standard of the average inhabitant of Tatarstan, and for this, the creation of a healthy market economy with growing potential. To this end it is essential: --to preserve the state's capability for maintaining law and order, ensuring the safety of the citizens, and defending property; providing for the transfer of state property to as great an extent possible to the private sector; and, what is particularly important, providing for the necessary minimum living standard for the transitional period. This program should ensure the creation in Tatarstan of a mixed economy with a large and stable private sector and a solvent public sector. May this proposition be the answer to the question: What kind of republic economy do we ultimately envisage? A great deal of work is being performed on the creation of the program. Foreign specialists and well-known scientists and practical experts of Tatarstan are working on it. I believe that we will be able to offer it for your consideration by the fall. Thank you for your attention.
