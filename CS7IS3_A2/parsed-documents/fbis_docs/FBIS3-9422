[Jarcevic] Good day. [Stankic] How did the talks at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb go, and have any results been achieved? [Jarcevic] The biggest result lies in the fact that the negotiations have begun and are being held in the building of the Russian Federation in Zagreb. We have achieved several good results. The first is that the delegation of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] went to Zagreb and that the fear that is always hanging over us whenever we go somewhere has disappeared because the RSK delegation does not necessarily have to betray the interests of its people and its state, even if it travels to Zagreb. It can hold talks with the Croatian authorities on an equal footing. Another important fact is that we heeded the demands of the two biggest powers -- the Russian Federation and the United States -- to meet with the Croatian representatives in the Russian Federation's building, because these two countries said that the world community is fed up with the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia and that they are inviting us to come to the negotiating table because they want to see the end of hostilities, they want to see peace, and that after that relations between the RSK and Croatia normalize. They guaranteed that in this way they would prejudice the political solution and that they are not interested at all in the kind of life the ethnic communities of the former Yugoslavia would establish in the future. They asked us to believe that they sincerely want to help us stop the suffering of all peoples. We accepted this message and went to Zagreb. [Stankic] The end of hostilities and the cease-fire assume a clear demarcation line. Did you discuss this? [Jarcevic] The line of demarcation was the main topic of our talks. You know we are talking about a border of some 1,600 kilometers. Because the border of such a length is varied, it was not easy to agree on one simple principle that could be applied on every kilometer of the border. This is so because in some places the border passes through populated areas, in other places it is near populated places, in some places it is near industrial plants, or goes over the fields rich with ore or oil. It is particularly interesting that the border passes near Jasenovac [World War II camp], which is a sacred place for the Serbian people. For these reasons, we could not apply a single principle. The greatest part of the talks were spent looking for possibilities to meet the demands of the Croatian side in some areas, and the demands of the Serbian side in other places. I think that we have come to the conclusion that in withdrawing our armies, we should apply symmetry. This means that when we require their withdrawal for no more than 100-200 meters, we will give the same opportunity to the Croats to require our withdrawal where they need it. I think that this is one of the most important results of the talks held yesterday. Furthermore, it is also important that the Croatian delegation has given us guarantees that they would no longer use the military means to accomplish the programs of their government, but that, regarding relations with the RSK, they will do it only through negotiations. [Stankic] Since you are talking about the military means, we should also say something about the interpretation, about how the borders are set in the areas in which the Army of Croatia has invaded the territory of Krajina. [Jarcevic] Of course, had it not been for the parts which the Croatian Army had occupied, there would be no problems and we would have most certainly signed an agreement yesterday on the cease-fire and the end of hostilities. It is in fact in these territories that we are experiencing the greatest problems. We returned to Knin to consult the government and other authoritative bodies in the RSK. One of the reasons as to why the negotiations could not continue is the imprecisely drawn position of both armies on the maps provided by the United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. Moreover, UNPROFOR showed these maps to both delegations only shortly before the meeting began. This is why we need seven days to study the maps and to mark the actual situation on the line separating the two armies. [Stankic] It was also decided at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb to continue the talks. [Jarcevic] The talks will continue and this is a good sign that the RSK has been accepted as an equal partner in talks with the Republic of Croatia, especially since we were brought to the negotiating table by the two biggest powers in the world -- the United States and the Russian Federation. In addition, the talks were also attended by the deputies of the cochairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia, top UNPROFOR officials, and representatives of the European observer mission. Let me again repeat that no one exerted pressure on the RSK delegation. We held the talks in a relaxed atmosphere that was not disturbed by anything.
