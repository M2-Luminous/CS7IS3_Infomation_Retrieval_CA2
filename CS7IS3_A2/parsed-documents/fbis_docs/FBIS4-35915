Deputies said the draft law, which was endorsed by the Lower House of Parliament Saturday, only applies to commercial "sports training centres" and was meant to regulate this mushrooming industry which includes body building and martial arts training centres. Former Minister of Youth, Deputy Salih Irshaydat told the JORDAN TIMES Monday that the draft legislation will not thus "change anything on the ground since sports training centres were built with the knowledge that they will be segregated." "The youth welfare law has nothing to do with sports activities at clubs, hotels and touristic sites because the Ministry of Youth has no jurisdiction over these place," Dr. Irshaydat said. Tney are governed by separate laws and regulations, he said. Islamic Action Front (IAF) Deputy 'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur agreed with Dr. Irshaydat, saying the Islamists were only concerned with having training sports centres including swimming pools segregated. "People who coach swimming should be of the same sex but we are not concerned with swimming pools at hotels and touristic areas," Dr. al-'Ukur said. "We are aware of coeducation at universities and we are not trying to stop that or to segregate sexes at touristic sites," said Dr. al-'Ukur. Echoing Dr. Irshaydat and Dr. al-'Ukur, Deputy 'Abdallah al-Nusur, confirmed that it is not within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Youth to decide how hotels and touristic sites operate. The House Sunday voted down an amendment by the Upper House of Parliament (the Senate) to delete the clause requiring the segregation of sexes at sports training centres. Thirty-seven out of 64 deputies present at a session of the House Saturday voted in favour of maintaining the clause, which was introduced to the draft law by the Muslim Brotherhood bloc at the 11th Parliament in 1992. Deputies said the Senate amendment was defeated because many of the "liberal deputies" who would have supported it were absent from the session. But they expected the clause to be dropped when the two houses meet in a joint session no later than two weeks to settle the issue. The two Houses convene in a joint session when the Lower House turns down amendments by the Senate and the Upper House insists on its decision. Resolutions are taken by a two-third majority of the two Houses and it "should not be difficult to obtain this majority," 10 lawmakers said.
