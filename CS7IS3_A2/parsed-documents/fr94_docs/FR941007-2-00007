FR941007-2-00007 FR941007-2-00005 [A&hyph;475&hyph;703] Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin From Italy; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: In response to requests by petitioner, respondents, and a domestic interested party, the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on granular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resin from Italy. The review period is August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Ausimont S.p.A. As a result of this review, the Department preliminary has determined that dumping margins exist for this firm. We preliminarily have determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the FMV. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles Riggle or Michael Rill, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 3, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 41239) of the antidumping duty order on granular PTFE resin from Italy (53 FR 33163; August 30, 1988). On August 27, 1993, E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company, petitioner in this case, requested an administrative review of this order in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(1993). On August 31, 1993, Ausimont S.p.A. and Ausimont U.S.A., respondents in this review, and ICI Americas Inc., a domestic interested party, also requested an administrative review of this order. On September 30, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of initiation of this review (58 FR 51053), which covers the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. The Department is conducting this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The final results of the last administrative review of this order were published in the Federal Register on November 15, 1991 (56 FR 58031). Scope of the Review Imports covered by the order under review are shipments of granular PTFE resin. This order also covers PTFE wet raw polymer exported from Italy to the United States ( see Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Italy; Final Determination of Circumvention of Antidumping Duty Order (58 FR 26100). This merchandise is classifiable under item number 3904.61.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions in water and fine powders are not covered by this order. The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of Italian granular PTFE resin to the United States, Ausimont S.p.A. The review period is August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. United States Price The Department based United States price (USP) on exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act, because all sales to unrelated parties were made after importation of the subject merchandise into the United States. We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We adjusted these prices for billing adjustments and rebates. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight and ocean freight, marine insurance, brokerage and handling charges, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight from port to warehouse, and U.S. inland freight to customers, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act. We made further deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses, warranties, technical services, and indirect selling expenses pursuant to section 772(e)(2) of the Act. For sales of granular PTFE resin finished in the United States from PTFE wet raw polymer imported from Italy, we also deducted, pursuant to section 772(e)(3) of the Act, the value added in the United States, which consisted of the costs of further processing in the United States and that portion of the profit on sales of further processed merchandise attributable to the additional processing. When comparisons were made to home market sales to which a value-added tax (VAT) was added or in which a VAT was included, we made an addition to USP for the VAT not collected or rebated on export in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act and our practice as set forth in Silicomanganese from Venezuela; Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 59 FR 31204 (June 17, 1994) ( Silicomanganese ). Foreign Market Value Based on a comparison of the volume of home market and third-country sales, we determined that the home market was viable. Therefore, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Act, we based foreign market value (FMV) on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated customers in Italy or, where appropriate, on constructed value (CV).
