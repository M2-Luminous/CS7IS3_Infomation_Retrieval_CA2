Taking part in the Pecat Vremena program on Kragujevac Radio, Jarcevic said that the Serbian Council nongovernmental organization has established that 14,000 Serbs have been killed in Croatia by personnel of the Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs. This fact speaks of the most serious form of state terror. "The United Nations and the international community do not see or do not want to see what has been happening on three-quarters of the Croatian territory. As far as they are concerned the source of all evil in the past four years is one-quarter of the territory -- the RSK -- which clearly shows that the Serbian-Croatian conflict has not been approached in a just manner and that a just solution to the conflict between these two ethnic communities is being avoided." Jarcevic said that the UN Security Council will be informed about Croatia's state terror against the Serbian people outside the RSK over the next few days. Asked to comment on the new U.S. plan and the Double K formula which conditions the solving of Krajina's autonomy to Kosovo's autonomy, Jarcevic said: "That is yet another confirmation that people from developed countries do not understand our problems or are trying to realize their strategic goals in the Balkans with that move. No autonomy should be granted to Kosovo because it has been developing since 1945. The Albanians were granted all minority rights guaranteed and recognized in the world, but they did not want to exercise them; they wanted secession from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia." "That situation cannot be compared with the situation in the RSK because it was the Serb people who created the AVNOJ [World War II government in Yugoslavia] in Croatia and who entered into an agreement with the Croatian ethnic community in 1944 for both nations to join their territories and create a single union in the federal Yugoslavia; it was stressed that the borders must not sever the link between all Serbs in Yugoslavia, as it was called in 1944 and 1945." [as received] "We can cite many more examples which will not equate the problems of Kosovo-Metohija with those of the RSK and Croatia, but at the moment everyone is turning a deaf ear to those facts," Jarcevic said.
