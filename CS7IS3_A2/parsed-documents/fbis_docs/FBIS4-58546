While British press and the government have added fuel to London's latest smear campaign, other European official sources have ignored the matter. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman Tuesday told IRNA that his government can not comment on British accusation against Iran. According to Swiss "NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG" the British Government's allegation is based on MI6 intelligence service of that country. The paper also said that the British intelligence service has provided a Greek paper with the information on Iran's aid to the IRA, to give London the pretext to take diplomatic measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
