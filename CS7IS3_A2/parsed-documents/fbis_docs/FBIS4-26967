He also said that the parties had failed to reach an agreement in the routine talks because "whenever the talks are approaching the end, the mainland always advocates taking mainland laws and regulations as the basis for handling things." As this figure has distorted the concrete situation in the routine cross-strait talks, confounded right and wrong, and put the blame on others, we must refute what he said to clarify matters for the public. I. The Taiwan Authorities Exploit the Routine Cross-Strait Talks To Set Out Political Demands The first formal meeting between high-ranking figures across the straits in their unofficial capacities for over 40 years, materialized through the Wang-Koo [Wang Daohan, chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Straits (ARATS), and Koo Chen-fu, president of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF]) Talks, which built a system for future contacts and talks between the two associations and set various items on the agenda in the routine and economic talks. Moreover, with the efforts made by the two associations and the parties concerned across the straits, both parties stated their consensus in the words that "both sides of the strait uphold the one-China principle," thus evading the politically sensitive question of "the meaning of one China" and, at the same time, defining the nature of cross-strait affairs as China's special affairs which are different from interstate affairs. Meanwhile, working according to the spirit of "mutual respect, seeking truth from facts, consultation on the basis of equality, and seeking common ground while reserving differences," the two associations reached two agreements, namely: The "Agreement on Using and Verifying Cross-Strait Notarized Documents" and the "Agreement on Inquiry Into Cross-Strait Registered Letters and Compensation Matters." If both parties could still uphold the abovementioned principle and practice, contact and talks between the ARATS and the SEF after the Wang-Koo Talks should have taken on a new aspect conducive to promoting cross-strait economic and trade cooperation and multisided exchanges and contact. However, soon after the Wang-Koo Talks ended, the Taiwan authorities concerned violated the unofficial, economic, and routine orientation of the talks and willfully put off discussion of the economic and scientific and technological agenda listed in the Joint Agreement from the Wang-Koo Talks. Meanwhile, in the routine talks, they raised political questions such as those concerning "judicial jurisdiction" to orient the so-called "splitting, divide-and-rule, and reciprocal" cross-strait relations, thus seriously obstructing the several rounds of talks called since last August and bringing the routine talks, in which the two associations had achieved initial success, to a dead end. For example, in the Taipei Talks held last December, the authorities concerned in Taiwan engaged in double-dealing. On the one hand, they shouted for "laying aside the controversy over sovereignty and jurisdiction" and, on the other hand, they asked for the realization of the so-called political demands, such as "not repatriating people of our side" and "having 24 nautical miles of jurisdiction," in routine agreements concerning the "repatriation of cross-strait hijackers" and the "handling of fishing disputes" under the guise of "divorcing legal issues from political issues." After failing to realize the political demands they imposed on the routine talks, the authorities concerned in Taiwan declared once again that "both sides of the strait are still in a state of discord and divide-and-rule" and that the "mainland does not respect Taiwan's judicial jurisdiction" to mislead the public and deceive Taiwan compatriots. Last February, leaders of the ARATS and the SEF met in Beijing and reached the following consensus: "In the routine talks, our two associations should evade political questions in a down-to-earth manner." On this basis, they also discussed their specific differences of opinion on three agenda items, including one on the "repatriation of personnel who violate relevant regulations and enter the other's territory," and made joint efforts to sum up the consensus discussed and the train of thought for solving problems. However, in the fourth routine talks, the Taiwan authorities concerned openly repudiated the consensus reached between the leaders of the two associations and raised questions of divergence again which had been settled. They even broke certain promises made in the Taipei Talks and kept arguing about sensitive issues. Consequently, the agreements which should have been reached fell through again. This not only damaged the solemnity of authorizing the talks by leaders of the two associations but also undermined sincerity in the talks between the two associations, thus making an extremely bad impression among compatriots across the strait. Following the occurrence of the "Qiandao Hu Incident," the Taiwan authorities concerned unilaterally laid aside talks held between the two associations and once again broke the agreements reached between the two associations, which was strongly criticized by the media in Taiwan. At that time, a high-ranking figure who had just wantonly railed against the mainland and made separatist remarks, was still saying that "the CPC's sovereignty does not cover Taiwan," thus continuing to obstruct the progress of the two associations' routine talks and high-level talks. II. ARATS Consistently Suggests That the Two Associations' Talks Should Avoid Politically Sensitive Issues The mainland authorities concerned and ARATS have been consistently striving to uphold the consensus and basis of the two associations' talks. Following the close of the Xiamen Talks, the ARATS immediately sent a letter to the SEF and pointed out that "both parties should continue to observe the consensus that both sides of the strait uphold the one-China policy; keep upholding the unofficial, economic, routine, and functional nature agreed on by the Wang-Koo Talks; and avoid political issues so that the two associations' talks can proceed smoothly." When leaders of the two associations were exchanging views on issues of divergence in the routine talks, Tang Shubei further elaborated the ARATS' stand on the routine talks and its views on settling differences: First, no party should impose its political demands on the other side through routine agreements and the mainland is against the idea of working through agreements to regularize the state of a temporary cross- strait split to reflect the so-called "split and divide-and-rule." Second, in order to help us settle concrete issues in cross-strait exchanges and contacts, the two associations should not be involved in cross-strait political differences and should not bring politically sensitive issues into the two associations' routine talks. As for the fact that clauses about the content of judicial jurisdiction and legal jurisdiction are not written in the agreements between the two unofficial groups, it neither implies any changes in the current stand by the Taiwan authorities nor any changes in the mainland's consistent stand. Third, the ARATS is not empowered to indicate its stand on "judicial jurisdiction" and other issues of a political nature when holding talks with the SEF. Hence, the differences between the parties in the talks neither concern the question of "respecting or not respecting" Taiwan's "judicial jurisdiction" nor the question of how to consider Taiwan's "judicial jurisdiction." If the Taiwan side explicitly authorizes the SEF to discuss the question of "judicial jurisdiction," the ARATS is willing to pass on the news to relevant departments so that they can authorize the ARATS to hold special talks in this respect under the prerequisite of the one-China policy. At that time, the mainland side will also raise political questions about which it is concerned. The ARATS' abovementioned position is one which entirely differentiates political issues from routine matters and which fully shows respect for the current state of cross-strait relations and for the other side's practical and effective stand in solving problems. The cliche of the so-called "stifling" Taiwan is simply groundless talk which confounds right and wrong. During the talks, the ARATS always insisted on taking the method and thinking of solving routine problems to try to reach an agreement. The ARATS suggested that hijackers should all be repatriated and handled by the side to which hijacked civil airliners belong; however, it also gave full consideration to the essential coercive measures applied to hijackers by relevant departments in Taiwan and agreed to repatriating hijackers after dealing with special situations. Moreover, the ARATS also agreed to let the Taiwan side handle the cases wherein Taiwanese people hijack mainland civil airliners to Taiwan. As far as the repatriation of illegal emigrants is concerned, the ARATS, while taking the limitations of Taiwan's current policies into consideration, took the initiative in rearranging the examination and verification site and the repatriation route. In handling fishing disputes, the ARATS suggested that cross-strait arbitration organs should arbitrate disputes through consultation and implement the result while ensuring its enforcement. As for the question of what form should be taken, each side should deal with its own case and the practice of any side should never be considered as the standard for the other party. While making certain suggestions on the key questions of the abovementioned three agreements, the ARATS never "called for taking mainland laws and regulations as the handling basis." On the contrary, the practice of the Taiwan concerned authorities precisely "makes it impossible to solve even very simple routine problems." For example, in handling fishing disputes, if we settle disputes between fishing boats first, the problem will be much simpler; but the Taiwan side insisted on putting the disputes between public service ships and fishing boats, as well as the role of public service ships in fishing disputes, on the agenda, thus trying to engender the political controversy of "the jurisdiction of waters." According to the "Jinmen Agreement" and the consensus reached between the two associations on the issue of repatriating hijackers, it is entirely possible for the Taiwan side to, technically speaking, enforce repatriation but the Taiwan authorities use these as counters to strive to achieve certain political goals. In this connection, the common people in Taiwan have a very clear understanding. Soon after this high-ranking Taiwan figure made his remarks, a Taiwanese compatriot wrote an article in LIEN HO PAO on 7 June and pointed out: "As far as the legal aspect is concerned, if our side take a more pragmatic stand, we can actually hold that the hijacking cases occur and end in the CPC's civil airliners" and we "can avoid the question of judicial jurisdiction in terms of legal principle." "After going through a preliminary investigation of the facts, hijackers must be repatriated immediately." If the Taiwan authorities do not give up their political attempts and take a pragmatic stand, it will be difficult for the routine cross-strait talks to achieve any concrete results. III. The Taiwan Authorities Should Take Practical Actions To Help the Two Associations Discuss Development As cross-strait relations are developing, the Taiwan authorities concerned fantasize about using the two associations' talks to control or obstruct cross-strait exchanges, contacts, and development but such a practice has aroused Taiwan compatriots' strong discontent. Likewise, the Taiwan authorities are using their "mainland policy" as a means of "foreign policy" and relying on the two associations' talks to create "two political entities" and "two Chinas" but their conspiracy is being attacked by men of insight, including those inside the Taiwan authorities. They criticize the Taiwan authorities' routine talks policy as a "policy of putting off or rejecting the policy of cross-strait communication" and as "trying every possible means to strive to build a new Cold War system." They made an appeal to the high-ranking figure from the Taiwan authorities," saying that, as he "is trying so hard to promote pragmatic diplomacy, we wish he would also set up the mainland policy." They also called on the two associations to hold high- level meetings and communicate with each other to solve problems. Recently, the increasingly fierce conflicts between Taiwan's SEF and the "Mainland Affairs Council [MAC]" in the idea and strategy of cross-strait consultation, as well as the differences between the "Economic Ministry" and the "MAC" in cross-strait economic and trade policies, reveal the fact that the Taiwan authorities' existing "mainland policy" is unpopular and incompatible with present needs. We advise the Taiwan leaders to give up their unrealistic illusions and change their rigid and conservative state of mind so that the two associations' talks can return to the spirit of the Wang-Koo Talks and to the consensus reached at the talks held between the leaders of the two associations. After taking routine methods to reach the three agreements, we should open talks on economic and scientific and technological matters as soon as possible and fully implement the Wang-Koo Agreement. In particular, as Chairman Wang Daohan, Mr Koo Cheng-fu, and scholars and the media on both sides of the strait have jointly proposed holding the second Wang-Koo Talks as early as this year, we should take concrete actions to bring about the second Wang-Koo Talks and to give an impetus to the progressive development of cross-strait relations.
