He said the measures have not been eased, adding that food and medicines as part of humanitarian aid are the only exception. Venizelos described the delay in the United States establishing diplomatic relations with Skopje as a positive element. Asked to comment on yesterday's remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher urging all the countries in the region to show an interest in Macedonia, as he referred to Skopje, the spokesman said: Greece is the friendliest country toward Skopje and is interested in its viability and development. But [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's continuing intransigence does not help it. Referring to an interview with Gligorov in an Athens newspaper [paper not identified] today, Venizelos said he saw some calm, moderate statements. He added that despite the carefully expressed views, the Skopjean president does not deviate from his basic position. Venizelos said: With careful political dialogue, Gligorov appears as a victim. But the international community must also realize that Greece took the counter measures because of Skopje's provocative and untrustworthy behavior.
