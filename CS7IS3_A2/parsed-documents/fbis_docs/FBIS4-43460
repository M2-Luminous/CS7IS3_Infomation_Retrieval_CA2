On board the frigate Fatih during the Sea Wolf-94 exercise, Demirel said that a forcible solution on Cyprus would lead to turbulences on the island and would also reopen deep wounds between Turkey and Greece. After the conclusion of the exercise, Demirel told a press conference that the Turkish nation felt great security because of its strong army. `Our Armed Forces will fulfill any duty given to it by the people and the state,' Demirel said. `Both exercises were carried out excellently. Everyone can easily notice the great discipline and high-level of training the Army members have.' Answering a question about Cyprus, Demirel said that peace was established on the island ever since the 1974 Peace Operation in Turkey. `However,' he added, `a solution has been sought since then. A conclusion was not reached yet on a bi-zonal, bi-communal federated state based on political equality.' `In fact,' he added, `the actual situation on the island is a solution. It has ended the bloodshed and the fighting between the two communities.' He also stressed that the Greek Cypriot Administration in the south was recognized by the world as the Republic of Cyprus while the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] was recognized only by Turkey. `The 150,000 Turks in Cyprus are being treated by the world as if they were in a hostage camp in the eastern part of the Mediterranean,' he said. Demirel went on to say that the world was still hostile against the Turkish presence in northern Cyprus. `The per capita income in south Cyprus is 10,000 U.S. dollars while this figure is 3,000 dollars in the TRNC,' he said. `It is necessary to seek a viable solution in Cyprus, rather than trying to impose a non-operative one,' he said.
