FR941110-0-00011 FR941110-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;41&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9061; AD 94&hyph;22&hyph;11] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model ATP Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes, that requires modification of the power supply for the communications system. This amendment is prompted by reports of loss of power to the communications system due to an electrical fault in the ground crew jack box or the handset of the public address (PA) system. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the inability of the flight crew to communicate with passengers via the PA system and with air traffic control due to loss of power to the communication system, which may lead to unsafe operation of the airplane. DATES: Effective December 12, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Incorporated, P.O. Box 16029, Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC 20041&hyph;6029. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24382). That action proposed to require modification of the power supply for the communications system. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. Since issuance of the notice, Jetstream has issued errata sheets Numbers 1, 2, and 4, pertaining to Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;23&hyph;21&hyph;35288A. Erratum No. 1 was issued March 14, 1994, and adds an additional part number to the list of pertinent cable looms that appeared in Revision 2 of Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;23&hyph;21&hyph;35288A. Erratum No. 2 was issued April 25, 1994, and corrects certain editorial errors that appeared in that same service bulletin. Erratum No. 4 was issued June 1, 1994, and includes an additional reference to the fuse and circuit breaker index that appeared in that same service bulletin. The final rule has been revised to add a note referencing the existence of these errata sheets. These errata sheets do not require any further work by operators who have previously complied with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;23&hyph;21&hyph;35288A, Revision 2, dated February 15, 1994. After careful review of the available data, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 30 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $18,000, or $1,800 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
