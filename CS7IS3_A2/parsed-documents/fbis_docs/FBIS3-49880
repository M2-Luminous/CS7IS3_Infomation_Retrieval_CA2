According to the Prague-based newspaper LIDOVE NOVINY today, production will halt at the refineries from tomorrow. According to Vladimir Krasa [name as received], head of the Czech state company Benzina, the interruption is "administrative." For unknown reasons, the private Russian oil exporters have not received new export licenses from the responsible ministries. The Czech refineries in Litvinov, Kralupy, and Pardubice are currently working by using reserves belonging to the Slovak firm Transpetrol. These, however, will last four days at most. After this a crisis staff will have to decide whether oil from the state reserves is to be used or imported from other countries. Krasa assumes that there will not be a crisis as the Russian side has so far always fulfilled its obligations. Regardless of this, both the government and the Chemapol company, which imports 90 percent of the Czech Republic's oil, are pressing for deliveries to be restarted. The successors to the CSFR [Czechoslovak Federal Republic] normally receive 82,000 tonnes of oil a day through the "Druzhba" pipeline, of which each state receives around half. The situation at both countries' refineries has been difficult for around two months because of irregular supplies.
