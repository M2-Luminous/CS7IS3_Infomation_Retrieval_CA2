Even those who came under fire at the House of Soviets last October are also complaining about the people -- they did not rise, they did not defend. Yet you are saying that they have awaked, and shifted to the left.... Have you felt this during your tours, has this awakening reached a sufficient depth? [Zyuganov] Valentin Vasilyevich, I have the benefit of quite extensive personal observations. Following the party congress, I made 25 tours covering 45 of the largest centers. Essentially they covered the entire social spectrum. Furthermore, the contacts took the most diverse forms, right up to and including open-door meetings which could have been attended by any voter walking in from the street. Only very recently we counted more than 30,000 persons in the halls where I had occasion to speak. I can confirm the following: People wish to know what is actually happening, how they are being duped, which forces are in opposition. Let me be frank: There was a watershed on 3-4 October. Meetings are different nowadays. The stupor has worn off. Everyone realizes that they are being deprived of everything -- jobs, social guarantees, leave entitlement, medical treatment, even the possibility to move away from Vorkuta.... I first encountered this in Vorkuta -- elderly passersby stopping in the streets and crying their eyes out about the state to which they have been reduced. You have someone who has spent 25 years working in the polar regions, and everything he has ever earned has been reduced to nothing, he has no opportunity to move away or send away his children or elderly parents.... [passage omitted] At the same time, there is no longer any room to maneuver. Misfortune is already affecting not just the elderly but also the children. Mentally, whenever a Russian sees that misfortune is affecting children, he behaves more energetically and becomes stauncher. The opposition is now living through an exceptionally important period, a time when it has to analyze developments, regroup, and accurately define the main lines of action. A weighty word can be spoken here by the "Accord for Russia" movement. Real cooperation must be achieved between all patriotic forces on a broad platform of preserving the country's integrity, peace in it, and prosperity in each home. There must a structural preparation of the movement in all Russian regions. Therefore, special importance attaches to regular visits to the provinces, meetings with the aktiv, consolidation of ties with it, and support for it. Especially since, in 70 out of the 88 regions, representative organs have been joined by people who are perfectly well aware of the meaning and spirit of the patriotic movement, reflecting the interests of broad strata of voters, and capable of collective actions for the sake of their people and their fatherland. It is perfectly obvious that now there are two trends developing somewhat in parallel; the question is which one will take the lead -- the destroyers and annihilators of Russia or the people's patriotic forces which are already perfectly well aware of what is happening. [Chikin] In this context, we have the question of State Duma deputies' responsibility to the people for the country's future. Last December all parties contested a single federal district -- so, whose is it now, how confident do Communists and their allies feel in the Duma? [Zyuganov] On the whole I am satisfied with the position, composition, and abilities of my colleagues from the deputies' faction. The faction now has a highly representative professional and national composition, the voters' instructions have been used to compile a sound package of draft laws, and many of them are already in the works. Even our opponents have been forced to admit that the Communist Party faction has a strong collective potential and is capable of working with all sectors of the Duma, attracting many allies whenever necessary. We are grateful to the Agrarians with whom we share complete mutual understanding, we act jointly with the women's faction and the Democratic Party of Russia on a whole series of issues, and regional deputies quite attentively heed our position. Whenever a question of principle has been at stake, we have garnered 230-260 votes. On the other hand, all-out attempts are being made to depict the Duma's activity as being limited only to the radical position of "Russia's Choice" and some of its allies. Any proposal for stabilization is either boycotted or rejected by them. Everything to do with stabilizing the economy, halting the disintegration, safeguarding security, or struggling against crime -- everything is boycotted.... Even the Law on Struggle Against Corruption, which demands the establishment of elementary norms adopted in practice by the West a long time ago -- like declaration of income and the impossibility of combining state service with trade or commercial activity -- even this is being boycotted by these people because they have chosen the position of hindering the Duma's work as much as possible. We can see that a mighty and concerted march has been launched against the representative power as such. This takes the form of loathsome articles and insinuations about individual factions, of attempts to denigrate opponents. Nonetheless, the healthy nucleus in the Duma is getting stronger. As regards our own faction, each month the deputies spend one week in their electoral districts and report back to their voters. Let me say that the last round of visits showed that our deputies had visited at least five to seven labor collectives and received a powerful charge of fresh ideas and interesting proposals. We initiated the introduction of proposals to urgently examine the question of the emergency in the country's socioeconomic situation jointly with Federation Council deputies, and invitations were issued to the government and the president's representatives. Work is now under way to prepare this meeting, and I assume that it could prove exceptionally fruitful and could lead to serious and impartial assessments of the president's course in today's conditions. I can foresee a very powerful opposition to this sitting. On the other hand, we have planned a meeting between the faction and voters from the capital at the Parliamentary Center so that we could report back to them, and then to travel across the Russian Federation's regions, submit joint reports with the party aktiv on the results of our work over the last six months, and define our strategy and tactics for the immediate future. [Chikin] It goes without saying that, for the chairman of the Central Executive Committee, all these routes also lead right across the party structures. How is the party's organizational development progressing now? What features are more noticeable in its image: those of Zhukov and Korolev, those of Brezhnev and Gorbachev, or some others?... [Zyuganov] The past 15 months have brought radical changes to the party's life. Here are just the statistics of major events. We held one congress, two party conferences, six plenums, eight zonal conferences (and a whole series of new ones is about to begin), and five major scientific-practical conferences on key questions concerning the economy, stable development, the party's organizational development, activity with workers collectives and trade unions, and so on. The party's entire vertical structure was restored during this period. We now have party organizations in all major settlements, cities, republics, krays, and oblasts. The following result was summed up at the party conference: Now we have 550,000 party members concentrated in more than 20,000 party organizations. The leadership structure was rejuvenated during the last report and election campaign by 10 years on average, and ties have been restored with more than 100 left-wing parties and movements all over the world. We held several meetings with our colleagues from communist parties revived on the territory of the former USSR which, incidentally, already count more than 1 million Communists in their ranks. Meetings were held in Orel, Minsk, and the Moscow region. Leaders of 19 parties gathered recently at Lenin Hills and adopted what I believe to be some very important documents: On the concept of restoring a renewed union state, which was adopted unanimously; on the 50th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War and on Zhukov's 100th birth anniversary; on Lenin's 125th birth anniversary; on protection of our associates languishing behind bars, primarily in the Baltic countries.... On the whole, we succeeded in reviving a union of sufficiently combat-capable organizations. At the same time, a renewal of the philosophy of ideology is also under way. Unless our ideology is backed by the ideas of great power status, statehood, and patriotism -- in addition to the ideas of social justice, brotherhood of people, and friendship among peoples -- the party will hardly be able to perform its historic mission, because the main crisis today is the crisis of patriotic awareness. It is, after all, no secret that the country and the CPSU produced an unbelievably large number of traitors and turncoats. People like Zhukov and Korolev were brought up on the spirit of the feats by Aleksandr Nevskiy, Dmitriy Donskoy, Suvorov, and Kutuzov -- those who gave unsparingly of themselves for the fatherland's sake. [Chikin] But these new ideological acquisitions can also be interpreted as a repudiation of the classical dogmas of Marxism -- proletarian internationalism, class struggle, revolutionary aims.... [Zyuganov] People are trying to oversimplify the situation and reduce it to primitivism.... On the subject of proletarian internationalism. Look at the situation: Virtually the entire machine building industry is at a standstill. ZIL and Rosselmash, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and Kirovskiy Zavod are up in arms.... What was the response by workers in Kharkov and Minsk, by the proletariat of the Ruhr and Detroit? Did they go out in the streets in protest against growing unemployment in Chelyabinsk and Rostov? Did they halt the trainloads of Snickers being shipped to our country?... Did they, indeed! The current regime is skillfully dividing professionals and workers even within the same specialized field.... A driver in one place earns 70,000 rubles, another driver somewhere else earns 700,000 -- a 10-fold discrepancy, which is absolutely impermissible in principle. A stratification, a destruction of professional ties is under way. You cannot apply the same class yardstick to everyone. The class approach is exceptionally important when analyzing social phenomena but, in today's conditions, it must unfailingly be combined with a cultural-historical, a sociopsychological approach. Only then can objective conclusions be drawn. I would like to say that all our scientific research centers are now working on the elaboration of new parameters -- in Moscow, in Leningrad, in Novosibirsk.... Many contemporary questions would be impossible to answer by applying only the class approach. This is why all parties, movements, and streams find it so difficult to produce new programs. Programs must reflect the qualitatively new realities which have emerged both in our own country and all over the world. Incidentally, our adversaries are not so hampered by tunnel vision. For example, following a careful study of the entire psychological profile of Russian man as manifested since the times of Batu Khan, Napoleon, and Hitler, they conclude: Russian man cannot be defeated in open face-to-face battle. They start seeking different methods. We found ourselves unprotected from above. The absolute majority of people were unable to believe, for example, Gorbachev's treason: How could the supreme statesman betray allies, friends, the Army, the party, all and sundry.... Apparently he could.... A ramified fifth-column structure was created, which fragmented our entire nationwide organism. The split followed not straightforward social lines but a more complex path. There were times when Rus was being split along religious lines; nowadays we not only have preachers from overseas attacking our faith, but also attempts to effect splits along national and territorial lines. And if they succeed in splitting Russia and Ukraine or the Orthodox and the Muslim beyond all reconciliation, it will be virtually impossible to bring society together again. With all this information in our possession, my colleagues and I spoke on television, asking people to refrain from provocative actions in any direction, I spoke on several occasions to an audience of many thousands at the House of Soviets in an attempt to persuade them: Any move from here could be used by the authorities as a pretext to open fire and finally destroy the Soviet power. The regime was eagerly seeking a pretext to open fire for effect. The majority accepted my point of view. Many people, by the way, did not know that the state of emergency had already been introduced at 1600 on 3 October, at a time when the demonstrators had not yet marched on City Hall and had no plans to move to Ostankino. Nor did people know, of course, that several hundred Spetsnaz troops were already in place along the approaches to Ostankino, lying in wait for the demonstrators. Had the regime not wanted a bloodbath, it would have been enough to get one armored personnel carrier out in the road, fire a few blank rounds, and avoid mass murder. Many people do not know that the snipers, who were shown every day on television being rounded up, suddenly vanished from our side and disappeared whence they had come. Thus, the absence of full information gives some people an opportunity to interpret this address today any way they fancy. Would it not be better to admit that this warning saved hundreds of innocent people? [Chikin] How do you feel now in the circle of Communist opponents and oppositionists? Can you reach mutual understanding? Are personal sympathies maintained? [Zyuganov] It is obvious that everyone has reassessed his values and relationships over these years. I am grateful that I was not betrayed by my friends -- whether people from my native region who supported me during the difficult year, fellow journalists, or my friends from the alliance of people's patriotic forces. Even though I was frequently the target of critical fire -- sometime deservedly, sometime not. But I am an advocate of pooling the efforts of the broadest and most diverse political streams and of all my comrades from the left-wing bloc for the creation of a mighty state-patriotic organization. I maintain weekly contacts with friends and close associates from Belorussia [Belarus], Ukraine, Crimea, the Transcaucasus, and Central Asia and, as a rule, we reach complete mutual understanding on all main issues. There is a narrow group of individuals here in Moscow, who are trying to imply that they hold the ultimate truth and they alone are ardent revolutionaries. But the number of their supporters is dwindling day by day. For the simple reason that it is virtually impossible to succeed just with bombastic phrases and speeches, without powerful structures, without coordinated policy, and without soundly considered tactics. [Chikin] The situation in the country is extremely difficult. Each hour is precious when it comes to turning the helm and avoiding disaster. Say an opportunity to join the government were to arise tomorrow, would you accept? On what conditions? [Zyuganov] I believe that, from the viewpoint of administration, the main evil is the new pyramid of power. The incumbent presidency is rule by general secretary and czar rolled into one. The general secretary feared the congress, the czar feared God's anger, but the power here is neither accountable to nor monitored by anyone. There is no government in the normal sense of the word. You could even say that there are four governments. There is a government which works around Yeltsin, which decides everything and is in command of those bearing arms. There is Chernomyrdin's government which runs the Gazprom and another two or three economic structures. There is Kozyrev's government which, basically speaking, is guided by instructions from the U.S. Department of State. There is also the mass media government controlled by "Russia's Choice" -- the democrats will hold onto this mighty power, which orchestrates Russia's troubles, until the very last.... Thus, I would like to say that if these governments continue to function in the same way, no one -- not even the most talented person -- will be able to resolve a single issue. Generally speaking, this is not a question of who should join the administration, but rather of changing the structure and nature of power, of subordinating this power to the interests of the people, to the national-state interests. In my report to the conference of the "Accord for Russia" movement I actually spoke of the nature of state power and submitted a whole series of specific proposals which, it seems to me, could transform the way the country is being run.
