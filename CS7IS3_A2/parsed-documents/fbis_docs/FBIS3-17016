Those are people who are unable to vote on 27 March and who can, according to the law, vote now. Thus, the election has begun. Tell us, please, can Ukraine survive such a multi-round election? The first round is unlikely to yield a full house; the second round has been mathematically predicted to result in [?one-third] of deputies elected. And then what, third, fourth, fifth? [Kravchuk] First of all, no third round is foreseen by the law. Elections would then have to be postponed, extended, or deferred until next year. This problem is not a simple one. But still, I hope that people will vote for worthy candidates. Somehow I believe they will, because they should know that this is an important stage in the reform of the entire political system. If we get a new parliament, and if the new parliament at once passes a law on the local power structure, on the powers of local executives, their functions and their relations with the center, the Supreme Council, the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers, and finally passes a law on the president and what kind of president we are to elect, then the presidential election can take place in June. But if this election fails to take place, and these laws are not passed, we will wind up in a very tight corner, as I said before, a situation that is dangerous from the point of who is to govern the state and how it will be done. Locally, we have authority: There are presidential representatives, administrations, councils, and executive structures [word indistinct]. They govern the processes locally. In the center, there is the Cabinet of Ministers, the president, and the Supreme Council, which is about to be elected. According to the Constitution, the council can extend its powers, but this article of the Constitution was passed dozens of years ago, when nobody had any idea that such a situation may occur during elections to the first and second Supreme Council. That is why it's just written there this way, but how do you implement it now, when a constituency can wind up with two deputies, one elected in 1990, and the other in 1994? [Correspondent] And their relations are not stipulated in the law? [Kravchuk] Not stipulated anywhere. So it's not a simple thing. Not a simple thing at all. We shall see another way out when the new Supreme Council is already elected. But what will happen is difficult to predict. [Correspondent] But 27 March will be even a more difficult day for the residents of Crimea than for the rest of Ukraine, because Crimea's top executive, President Yuriy Meshkov, plans to conduct a poll on 27 March. There has been a lot of talk about this poll on the air. [Kravchuk] I talked about it, too. [Correspondent] And about your decree which abolished some of its premises. But a lot will depend on -- and I quote the U.S. Embassy press statement -- Kiev's considerable self-control. Does Kiev have that considerable self-control, Leonid Makarovych? [Kravchuk] Of course it does. Because, first of all, this self-control needs to be understood in the way that we are acting in accordance with the constitution and the laws of Ukraine. It is very important. Whereas the president of Crimea has exceeded his powers -- that is, has ignored the law, both the Ukrainian one and his own -- the Ukrainian president is acting clearly within the framework of the law. Thus, if you put both of these documents on the scales, then you will see that we are acting clearly in accordance with the law, while the president of Crimea has violated the norms of both Ukraine's and his own law. And that is dangerous. Our self-control shows in the fact that we are staying always within the law. The Crimean president's lack of self-control in this case shows in the fact that he wants to break the law and he is breaking it. I already said this, and I want to say once again that the main thing that needs to be done in Crimea today is to solve economic problems. A group of Crimean [word indistinct] led by the vice premier worked here for a long time together with our law experts. We met them half-way with a new formula for the Crimean budget. Crimea needs to contribute 6,000 bn [billion] karbovantsi for general Ukrainian needs. But to give them an opportunity to balance out their income and expenditure, we allowed Crimea to contribute only 2,700 bn; that is less than half the amount. And the rest of the money will stay in Crimea, so there will be a balance between income and expenditure. Besides, Ukraine is contributing over 100 bn for the Crimean-Tatar problems, out of its own budget. I understand, and we said this at the meeting, that we should focus our attention on economic problems and start solving them. As for powers, or other things, they are being considered now as proposals and will be gradually solved, and even some borderline cases concerning the division of powers will be solved to some extent in favor of Crimea, not in favor of Ukraine. But this poll, I think, is aimed at getting the Crimean population politically charged. So as not to merely talk, but to quote figures and facts, saying, this is what the public wants, and Ukraine is withholding that. I think if the president is a legitimate one, and this is being claimed today, that he is legitimate and must act within a legitimate framework. This is the main road. A legitimate president cannot break the law. [Correspondent] There is a famous quote, which was also recalled by former U.S. President Richard Nixon after a meeting with you, which is your phrase: The president of Crimea may not obey the president of Ukraine but he must obey. [Kravchuk] Please, don't. You know, I am very careful about subordination. I am very keen to see that people subordinate to me, whom I am responsible for, are people capable of meeting that responsibility. Then I am not worried. I am not keen to rule over people who can break the law any time or bring about unpredictable developments. Therefore, I don't even want to put it this way in this case. And there is no need for that. But the law, the Constitution, is beyond my will -- it is the will of the law. [Correspondent] You know, Leonid Makarovych, this U.S. Embassy press statement also says that if one is to believe that the new political leadership of Crimea aims for Crimea's economic well-being, it would be better ensured by Crimea's active participation in the program of all-around economic cooperation the United States is starting together with Ukraine. This statement was made after your official visit to the United States. [Kravchuk] By the way, there is one fine point here. We understand that Crimea has an [?informal] status of a resort, a recreation center, etc. It can become an attraction for ideas, capital, and so on, to turn it into a world-famous recreation base. It is possible. When Crimeans speak of a free economic zone, certain economic problems, of giving them more rights and opportunities for attracting capital, they have our support. But there is one point. And it must be understood in Crimea. Nobody will make a step without Ukraine's consent. If you talk about serious investment, the involvement of international financial structures, the European Bank, World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and others, these organizations will not make a single step in relation to Crimea without Ukraine's consent. Thus, this can happen only within the framework of Ukraine. We regard Ukraine as a system and Crimean problems within this system. If someone should think today that the government or the president of Crimea can directly approach international financial structures, international state structures, other states' governments, it is an illusion. Nobody will do anything in this respect without Ukraine. And everyone must understand and be aware of that. [Correspondent] Ukraine, it is an obvious fact, adheres to the principles of the CSCE and other international legal norms in international relations. And if Meshkov is violating our constitution and our laws, he is violating the CSCE principles; therefore, this is extended to the extraterritorial level. [Kravchuk] There was a program [words indistinct] saying there are problems of security in Europe, there are established international principles, there are norms. And the most painful problem of all is that of territorial integrity and sovereignty. This is the dividing line. This line determines whether there is to be peace or confrontation. No one oversteps this dividing line. (?If you) [word indistinct] (?with) common sense and realistic policy, you do not overstep it. You know (?where this will lead to). (?So) I would like to emphasize this so that everybody understands: Ukraine does not set itself the task of obtaining something from Crimea at all costs. We want (?both) Crimea and (?Ukraine) to tackle their problems. We shall help Crimea so it tackles them itself. That is what I would like most of all. It primarily applies to the economic issue. But whereas it was stated at the outset that it was the economic problems that were the basis...[pauses] (?They say) [word indistinct] political confrontation and the question of where to go and for Crimea who to be with and so on and so forth. First, this will not make it possible to settle economic issues and, second, this will not yield any results. Everybody [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, I thank you very much for taking part in our program. [Kravchuk] Can I raise a question myself? [Correspondent] Please. [Kravchuk] I found this, by the way, when looking at the questions given to me today at Ostankino. One of them -- I forget the name of our citizen from Lugansk Oblast -- this is what this citizen -- or was it she? -- asks me: Leonid Makarovych, I voted for you, the citizen says. I voted for you. In our oblast now rumors are being spread around that you have built yourself a dacha in Switzerland. Tell us whether this is true. I was asked this question, incidentally, by a trade union leader from Zaporozhye last year. I officially answered that the president had no dacha in Switzerland. He is not building it and is not going to do this. I use all the conveniences of life that the Supreme Council provided me with. (?I would like to repeat that) there was an official resolution adopted by the Supreme Council, on (?27) minimum wages, a state dacha in Koncha-Zaspa, transport, medical treatment, and everything that is written there. There is nothing else. I know, however, this: (?Under) the system of ideology that you and I studied, there even used to be groups which were called groups (?on the distribution of interdepartmental finances). It is known how painful this detail is as perceived by the people. You see, they say he came to power and at once builds a dacha in Switzerland. They even say I transferred it to my mother. She died thirteen years ago in 1981. There was such a question and this is my answer to it: The Ukrainian president has no dacha in Switzerland. He is not building it, was not building it and is not going to do this.
