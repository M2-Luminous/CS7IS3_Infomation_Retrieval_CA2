The meeting between the Colombian Catholic Church bishop and FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] commanders and spokesmen of the Francisco Caraballo Group and the ELN [Army of National Liberation] was scheduled for 1900 on 26 January, assistants to the meeting and state security spokesmen have told EL TIEMPO. The meeting was held in building T-2, Zone 7, eastern Havana, and ended after 0100. It was attended by Ivan Marquez, Alfonso Cano, and Alberto Gutierrez Bermudez on behalf of the FARC; Leonel Pardo, on behalf of the Francisco Caraballo dissidents; a labor leader and a rank and file church activist who identified themselves as ELN spokesmen; and the controversial Colombian bishop. Marquez arrived in Cuba via Cancun accompanied by a man surnamed Velasquez, who claimed he is a leader of the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] in Mexico and one of the EZLN's activists with close ties to the newspaper EL PREGON. Moreover, Alfonso Cano had arrived in Havana on 25 January aboard a Viasa, the Venezuelan airline, airplane. Several witnesses saw him in the airplane, "but I do not know if he boarded in Caracas or if he came in transit from Buenos Aires," one of them has said. Gutierrez Bermudez, an FARC activist charged with coordinating operations in the Magdalena Medio area, had arrived in Cuba several weeks earlier, reportedly to organize the meeting. The labor leader and the rank and file church activist, who later identified gvthemselves as ELN spokesmen and representatives, left Santa Fe de Bogota on 22 January aboard a Cubana de Aviacion flight. The main topics reviewed during the meeting between the prelate and the guerrilla spokesmen are well known by the country: They reiterated the bilateral character of the conflict, the need for a joint truce, and the need to sponsor regional dialogues with the government. Altogether, 31 Colombians--including Communist Party members and spokesmen of labor unions and facade movements that are charged with comprising the FARC and ELN urban intelligence network--left for Havana. They had been invited to participate, between 23 and 28 January, in the "Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Congress for Our People's Solidarity, Sovereignty, Self-determination, and Life." The topics for the meeting were the situation in Latin America; the popular forces' new tendencies for the construction of new democratic alternatives; the foreign debt as an instrument of infiltration and domination; the United States' economic policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean; and new forms of mechanisms for infiltration and domination, among others. Other topics included th lack of an effective democracy for the peoples; U.S. policies on the threshold of the 21st century, and hemispheric influence within its permanent goals of world domination. "This was a facade meeting, because it was actually a Colombian guerrilla group summit and a prolongation of the Sao Paulo Forum," a source has said. According to other sources, the Sao Paulo meeting is a forum that has been held four times (Quito, Santa Fe de Bogota, Sao Paulo, and Havana), and it was always attended by spokesmen of the most radical leftist organizations in Latin America. This time the forum was used by the Colombian guerrilla groups to identify themselves and distribute their manifestos. "The Colombian participants' election was so secret each person's passport was photocopied beforehand to guarantee an adequate selection. We were not given a visa, only a special invitation card so there would be no record in the passport," explained another source consulted by EL TIEMPO. Another source has said: "Secrecy was necessary, because not everyone who attended the Latin American meeting was elected to participate in the private meetings." "In fact, the bishop did not participate in the Latin American meeting, only in the other meetings." EL TIEMPO was able to learn two private meetings were held: one, the summit held in Eastern Havana between spokesmen of the Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board and the church prelate. The other one was an extension of the Sao Paulo forum. The Sao Paulo forum was the main reason for the meeting, aside from the summit. The forum was held on Saturday and Sunday once the Latin American meeting had concluded. The Colombian prelate was the guest of honor and, according to the sources, Fidel Castro's Government actively participated in it. One of the sources has said: "It was an extension of the Sao Paulo Forum. The Mexican surnamed Velasquez identified himself as an EZLN activist, and the Peruvian whose surname is Castillo said he was Shining Path's political organization secretary. [no closing quotation mark as published] "That is where the FARC leaders, the labor spokesman, and the rank and file church activist who claimed he was an ELN member identified themselves." Another participant revealed to EL TIEMPO yesterday Gutierrez, Pardo, and the ELN activists were the ones who distributed a pamphlet entitled "Political Declaration of Our VII Summit: Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board" once the summit had ended. What did the proclamation say? Signed by the FARC, the ELN, and the Caraballo Group, the one-and-a-half page document read: "The national security doctrine, an arrogant Presidency, and an aggressive militarism still comprise the state's backbone with the 1991 Constitution...." "We state our solidarity with the heroical Cuban people in their struggle against imperialism, their defense of socialism, and the homeland's dignity...." (See annex) Editor's note: EL TIEMPO tried many times yesterday to contact the prelate who attended the meeting, but he could not be located, so his name is omitted in this edition.
