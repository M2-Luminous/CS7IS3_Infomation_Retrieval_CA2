Background Under Medicare, hospitals are paid for inpatient hospital services that they furnish to beneficiaries under Part A (Hospital Insurance). Currently, most hospitals are paid for their inpatient hospital services under the prospective payment systems for operating and capital costs in accordance with sections 1886(d) and (g) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and 42 CFR part 412. Under these systems, Medicare payment is made at a predetermined, specific rate for each hospital discharge based on the information contained on actual bills submitted. Section 1886(f)(1)(A) of the Act provides that the Secretary will maintain a system for reporting costs of hospitals paid under the prospective payment systems. Section 412.52 requires all hospitals participating in the prospective payment systems to meet the recordkeeping and cost reporting requirements of §§413.20 and 413.24, which include submitting a cost report for each 12-month period. The hospitals and hospital units that are excluded from the prospective payment systems are generally paid an amount based on the reasonable cost of services furnished to beneficiaries. The inpatient operating costs of these hospitals and hospital units are subject to the ceiling on the rate of hospital cost increases in accordance with section 1886(b) of the Act and §413.40. Sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act provide that no payments will be made to a hospital unless it has furnished the information, requested by the Secretary, needed to determine the amount of payments due the hospital under the Medicare program. In general, hospitals submit this information through cost reports that cover a 12-month period. All hospitals participating in the Medicare program, whether they are paid on a reasonable cost basis or under the prospective payment systems, are required under §413.20(a) to ``maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payable under the program.'' In addition, hospitals must use standardized definitions and follow accepted accounting, statistical, and reporting practices. Under the provisions of §§413.20(b) and 413.24(f), hospitals are required to submit cost reports annually, with the reporting period based on the hospital's accounting year.
