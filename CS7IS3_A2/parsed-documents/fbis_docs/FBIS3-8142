Most criticism regarded the "roadsign bill" on bilingual names of communities, parliament did not pass, as well as the an amended bill on names and surnames requiring the Slovak suffix -ova for Hungarian female names, said Fico who represented Slovakia on Tuesday's [1 March] meeting of the CE Committee. "The law is good, but its interpretation is disputable," Fico said, adding that "the atmosphere in the Committee was orientated unequivocally against Slovakia." The controversial issue of referendum on the loss of mandates of the deputies who quit their parties was not officially raised, Fico reported. There was, however, certain fear "at least" at the unofficial level of the CE. The bilingual roadsigns and use of Hungarian names and surnames are the most frequent demands of ethnic Hungarians which are supported even by Slovak President Michal Kovac.
