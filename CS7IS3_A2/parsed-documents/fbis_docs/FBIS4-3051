The meeting aims to make plans for carrying out the current tasks in accordance with the guiding spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress, which emphasizes the division of labor and the importance of defining responsibility. Governor Wan Xueyuan spoke at the meeting. After analyzing the current situation and defining the major points of this year's work, he put forward the following requirements for carrying out the work. First, continued efforts should be made to improve the division of labor as well as the supervision and inspection system. Each department should further divide its tasks and assign such tasks to specific units and personnel. The work responsibility system should be strengthened. Particularly important is the establishment of the responsibility system for major leading personnel. It is necessary to carry out routine supervision and inspection, as well as routine feedback to ensure work accomplishment. Such work should be integrated with an evaluation conducted by each organization so as to ensure each and every public functionary will conscientiously work hard to achieve Zhejiang's goals and tasks. Second, it is necessary to strengthen our investigation and research in a bid to find out new situations and problems. Leaders of each department should determine the topics of their investigation and conduct research in the light of their own work. They should focus their studies on special issues and current trends. Particularly, they should study various new situations and problems that appear during the course of reform. In conducting such investigation and research, they should try to achieve results applicable to the real work. During their investigation and research, they should try to determine various work models. In this way, they can push forward all kinds of work by showing such exemplary models. Third, it is necessary to tighten administrative disciplines and ensure that such administrative disciplines are unified and are universally observed. Many reform measures will be introduced this year. During the course of reform, interests involving many factors are bound to be readjusted. Consequently, the interests of some localities and departments will be affected to some extent. All departments concerned should have a correct understanding and firmly foster an awareness of the overall interest so as to ensure that partial interests will be subservient to overall interests and current interests will be subservient to long-term interests. They should never use various excuses to delay the implementation of the central authorities' policies and measures because of the interests of their own departments or localities. Leaders at all levels should conscientiously become a supporter for the unification of administrative disciplines and ensure that all policies and measures introduced by central and provincial authorities will be carried out smoothly. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the unity among all leaders so as form a great force in carrying out our tasks. Great efforts should be made to maintain unity in our leading groups. To achieve unison among all leading personnel, we should pay more respect to others' opinions, have more discussions with others, give more support to each other, and advocate criticism and self-criticism. We should further uphold and improve the responsibility system for administrative leaders, have a rational division of labor, clearly define the responsibility, and be more coordinated in our work. Meanwhile, we should pay attention to ideological and political work among our workers and staff personnel. Wan Xueyan said: Building a socialist market economy is a completely new subject to us. Cadres at all levels face a tremendous task of learning this subject. In this year, we should pay particular attention to theoretical studies, particularly Volume Three of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." We should try to have a profound understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should study well recently-promulgated economic laws and regulations as well as economic policies and improve our knowledge about market economy. [passage omitted]
