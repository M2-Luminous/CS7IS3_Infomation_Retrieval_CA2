Every Soviet Person Could Receive a Russian Passport"] [Text] Let me introduce my interlocutor. Abdulakh Mikitayev was born in 1942 in the village of Malka, in Kabardino-Balkaria, 30 km from Pyatigorsk. After secondary school he went to the Mendeleyev Chemical Technical Institute in Moscow. As a postgraduate student he defended his candidate's dissertation. Then, as a young "mature" academic, he went to Nalchik to teach at the Kabardino-Balkaria University. He soon became a senior lecturer and head of a department and took a doctorate. He created a whole scientific school in the field of polymer chemistry. On a voluntary basis he chaired the Kabardino-Balkar Republic Committee for the Defense of Peace. In the last Russian Supreme Soviet he was head of the science subcommittee. In March 1992 he became chairman of the Russian Federation President's Citizenship Commission. [Musiyenko] Abdulakh Kasbulatovich, we are not going to look now for those to blame for the disintegration of the USSR or discuss whether that could have been prevented. Unfortunately, the fact remains that the Soviet state no longer exists and tens of millions of Russians and those who consider Russian their native language suddenly found themselves in a foreign country, albeit a "neighbor." Their fate in many former Union republics is, to put it mildly, unenviable. [Mikitayev] You are right, the disintegration of the Soviet Union was a tragedy for many people, very many people. In recognizing the newly independent states formed from the republics of the former USSR, Russia proceeded from the premise that their governments, in accordance with the norms of international law, would fulfill their duty toward Soviet citizens and not allow their ethnic, linguistic, religious, or other rights to be infringed. Such principles are enshrined in a number of international conventions as well as in treaties between the Russian Federation and the states which have achieved independence. But what happened was that real sovereignty went to the heads of the ruling politicians there to such an extent that they got carried away and embarked on a course of driving the Russian language out of use in society and offended the Russian-speaking population in every way possible. That is true above all of the Baltic countries, but in some CIS states, too, people hailing from Russia are now living in a state of spiritual oppression. You have noted, of course, that the Russian Federation as the successor in law to the USSR is trying to defend the rights of former Soviet citizens and to that end is employing diplomatic channels and the authority of various international organizations. With some success. But unfortunately by no means total success. Because even within the framework of the CIS there is still no efficient mechanism for implementing treaties and agreements signed by the heads of states. Nor are there any mandatory sanctions which follow inevitably if accords are not observed. I hope that these shortcomings will be eliminated in due course. [Musiyenko] Let us clarify whom precisely you are concerned about. Those who have officially been given Russian citizenship but are continuing to live in, for example, Uzbekistan? Or those who are Russian by blood, irrespective of whether they hold citizenship of the Russian Federation? Or citizens of the former USSR of any nationality who have been refused citizenship of the states on whose territory they are now living? [Mikitayev] All three categories. The Russian Federation Law "On Citizenship" allows Russian citizenship to be granted to anyone who has retained a USSR citizen's passport regardless of their place of residence. But of course, we pay greater attention to emigrants from Russia and their offspring. Russians have been living for centuries in many republics -- Kazakhstan, for instance -- and have long been part of the indigenous population. In the past they occupied vacant lands and did not force anyone out. Now, although N. Nazarbayev denies that there are interethnic problems in Kazakhstan, what we are seeing is an exodus of Russians from that republic to Russia. I think the reason why is clear: Russian has lost the status of an official language there and it is primarily Kazakhs who are being appointed to leading posts even in oblasts where Russian speakers predominate. Admittedly, mutual understanding has emerged between Russia and Kazakhstan on these problems recently, as is demonstrated by the memorandum on the fundamental principles of resolving questions connected with the citizenship and legal status of Russian Federation citizens permanently resident on Republic of Kazakhstan territory and of Republic of Kazakhstan citizens permanently resident in Russia, signed by B. Yeltsin and N. Nazarbayev. [Musiyenko] There is a great deal of talk today about dual citizenship, but many people clearly do not understand what it is. [Mikitayev] I also get the feeling that certain heads of state have still not grasped the essence of this problem and do not understand what moral advantages their states stand to gain from the conclusion of dual-citizenship agreements with Russia. Clearly they believe that such an agreement will infringe their countries' sovereignty. Nothing of the kind. No one would claim that France, for example, has ceased to be an independent state because it has concluded a dual citizenship agreement with Canada, a country with many French-speaking inhabitants. I can also quote a positive example from the CIS. At the end of December 1993 an agreement of this type was signed between Russia and Turkmenistan. There have been no dire consequences. We did not see hordes of Russians resident in Turkmenistan hurrying off at the crack of dawn to get an earlier place in the waiting line outside the Russian embassy. Why worry, if everyone knows that if they need a second passport they can get one at any time -- or in five years, or 10.... I would put it this way: The institution of dual citizenship is a symbol of trust between two states, evidence that they want to live with one another in peace and good-neighborliness, without harboring grudges. Incidentally, dual citizenship has long been a reality regardless of whether Russia has signed a corresponding agreement with another state. Russian legislation does not require that you relinquish citizenship of your country of residence on receipt of citizenship of the Russian Federation. We did that deliberately in the interests of our fellow countrymen. Furthermore, the laws of some CIS states grant their fellow countrymen the same opportunity (Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan). [Musiyenko] Is it difficult for someone living in, say, Ukraine, to take out Russian citizenship? [Mikitayev] Legally and technically there are no problems here. The problem is that Ukraine does not yet have a network of Russian Federation consular establishments. This means that in order to take out a Russian passport you have to go all the way to Kiev. And that takes time and money. However, in the next few months Russia plans to open several consulates on Ukrainian territory, including one in Simferopol. [Musiyenko] What advice would you give to those who have nevertheless made the difficult decision to leave their old haunts and start a new life back in the motherland -- in Russia? [Mikitayev] If you have no family, housing, or work there, the best thing to do first is to apply to the Russian Federation embassy or consulate, where there are bound to be representatives of the federal migration service. They will help you choose your future place of residence, obtain a loan, and process all the documents. But what often happens is that people gather up their possessions, buy tickets, and head for Moscow, where they have no accommodation to go to and instead camp out in front of various official institutions.... [Musiyenko] I am aware that a concept of Russian Federation state policy with regard to fellow countrymen living abroad was formulated recently. [Mikitayev] Yes, our commission participated directly in its preparation. It covers the most diverse aspects -- from efforts aimed at restoring citizen status to the "non-indigenous" inhabitants of Latvia and Estonia and the enshrinement of the institution of dual citizenship in law to the preservation of a single information area on the territory of the former USSR and of the Russian language as the means of communication among the different nationalities. Based on international law and the wealth of world practice we are also going to help Russian communities and other associations of ethnic Russians in the neighboring foreign countries and give those who have decided to migrate to Russia help in settling down here. [Musiyenko] Will this concept not remain on paper alone? [Mikitayev] I do not think so. In any event, our commission, with the president's support (it was he who, concerned for the fate of our fellow countrymen, instructed the commission in the fall of 1993 to submit proposals on the protection of their rights and interests), will constantly monitor the work of the government, the federal migration service, and other state organs charged with putting this concept into practice. The program for the protection of the ethnic Russians in the neighboring foreign countries is already near to completion at government level, and a financial basis is being prepared for it. [Musiyenko] Is this not going to be another pretext for people to accuse Russia of harboring imperial designs? [Mikitayev] Let those who express that opinion have it on their conscience. We are acting in the interests of our country and of the newly independent states equally. Russia does not need another "great migration of the peoples" -- it is simply in no position to provide tens of millions of refugees and migrants with everything that they need. But the republics of the former Union do not need a mass exodus of top-class specialists and manpower either: That will inevitably cause them tremendous economic harm and will prove to be a time-bomb placed under those states. But all this can be avoided; all it needs is for discrimination against ethnic Russians [russkiye] and Russian speakers to be ended and for their civil rights to be recognized in full. Russia, in turn, recognizes the right of other states to take care of their fellow countrymen living in the Russian Federation. In the long term however, I am confident that we will surely arrive at a new union of the European type -- with single citizenship and complete freedom of movement, both for the workforce and for goods. This will happen not in 50 years time but much sooner, because we have not yet forgotten the experience of mutual relations among the peoples in the economy, culture, and everyday life. The first signs of the approaching integration are already in evidence....
