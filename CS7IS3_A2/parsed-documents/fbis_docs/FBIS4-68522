It is possible to call this concept of the Soviets "mankurtism" on a conditional basis. This concept was a basic weapon for making more than one hundred nations and peoples living in the Soviet Empire live in one barracks. This weapon was needed to uproot the nations from their historical roots, in order to make the nations feel themselves as a "Soviet people," and to chop out all their roots outside the empire. The history of these nations was older than the history of the colonizer nation. It was difficult to create a "Soviet people" because it was difficult to eliminate a mentality which had a strong tradition. Thus the empire in the first phase decided to create new nations from these ancient nations. In this manner Turkestan was divided into five nations and five "new" national names were given to these republics. The most ancient of the nations, the Turks, lived in Turkestan. The Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Turkmens, and Kyrgyz -- these are descendants of one ancestor -- are Turks. The unity of the Turkic peoples was always seen as dangerous to the neighboring nationalities. In ancient history the Chinese followed a "divide and conquer" policy against us. After Turkestan became a Russian colony, tsarist Russia, and then Soviet Russia, also followed this policy. Today we have become independent, thank God, and the flags of the Turkestan republics fly at the UN, not as one flag, but as five. No one believes in a single political Turkestan, but our neighbors still see themselves as living in danger. As for some leaders of the republics of Turkestan, they are evidently thinking of eliminating this "danger." They are even prepared to repudiate the history of their own nation in order to ingratiate themselves to our former "lords." The article "The History of the Origin of the Uzbek People" which appeared in the 20 January issue of UZBEKISTON OVOZI was written to comfort our former "lords" and, at the same time, in the spirit of toadying before them. The authors of this article, written at the order of the leadership of Uzbekistan, are saying: "Lords, fear not, the peoples of Turkestan will never unite, we are Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Turkmens, and not Turks!" In this article they view the opinion of writers and poets with sarcasm; in discussing their discussion of history and the nation, they stamp their opinions as "non-scientific." "Unfortunately," they say, "this situation (calling the Uzbeks Turks) manifested itself in the 1920s in Central Asian history, in the years of reconstruction...in the years when ideas were free." In other words, the logic of "thank God, these years of free-thinking are over." It does not matter, this logic pervades the consciences of the authors. There are things in the article more important than this. Our scholars wrote the following: "The Uzbeks are not Turks, they are turkophones, in contradiction to the ideas advanced by a few people." Not even our most terrible enemies have put forth a more mistaken idea. Even they have been compelled to say that the Uzbeks are of Turkic origin. If the Uzbeks were not Turks, the Russians would not have begun their campaign against pan-Turkism in Uzbekistan. Let us mention anti-scientists: even the chauvinist turkologist Zhirinovskiy who is well known for his nonsense knows Uzbek history better than our academicians. In his interview Zhirinovskiy said: "There is no nation called Uzbek, there are tribes of Turks in Uzbekistan that have stopped fighting with each other, and now everything is in order." Certainly, Zhirinovskiy meant to insult we Uzbeks with the word "Turkic tribe." But the word "Turk" is not an insult, but an honor. This certainly does not testify to the intelligence of the chauvinist-turkologist. Does it testify to the intelligence of Uzbek intellectuals? Thank God, it does. Discussion of the identity of the Uzbeks did not begin today or yesterday but, perhaps as our academicians wrote, in the 1920s. But the academicians were afraid to mention the names of the intellectuals who discussed this in the 1920s because their names are names which are loved in our nation. The fact that the Uzbeks are large branch of the Turkic tree was stated by our Jadids [jadidism was a modernization movement in Central Asia]. For this reason, Abdulhamid Sulaymon Cholpan, Mahmudkhoja Behbudi, Munavvar Kori, Mustafa Chokay, and Abdurrauf Fitrat were called "pan-Turkists" by the Russian colonialists and were punished accordingly. But the discussion about whether the Uzbeks were Turks or not was not started by the Jadids, but by the Russian colonialists. In fact, for the Jadids the Uzbek identity was never a secret. We have a nationalist intelligentsia that talked about the Uzbek identity both in the Soviet period and even today. Turning the identity of the Uzbeks into a mystery was, as we stated above, an ideology of colonialists. Academicians A. Askarov and B. Ahmedov, who are prisoners of this ideology, began their article in order to prove that the Uzbeks are not Turks with the opinion of the Russian scholar S. Tolstov: "Many of the Central Asian peoples not go back to ancient ethnic groups but have found their reflection in indigenous local people and other peoples nomadising through." Fine, respected academicians, but do you mean to say that there is any other nation which has not mixed with other stock in the world? That today the nations called the English, French, and Germans have not mixed their blood with the blood of others? And what about the blood of the Turks of Turkey? Find us a "pure-blooded" tribe. You will not find it. Even the Japanese nation which lives on an island was not devoid of external ethnic influences. But racists define the nation with blood. In our opinion, a nation is not defined by blood, but by other factors: nation means there is a unity of language, a unity of culture, a unity of customs and traditions, way of life and way of thought. Five centuries ago our ancestor Navoi said it in this way: If there is one tribe, there are a thousand, And the Turk tribe is mine. Navoiy does not say, as do our academicians, that it is a "Turkic-language people," but that it is a Turkic people. Because Navoiy was a poet, did that make him "sensitive?" If "sensitivity is nonscientific," let us mention the words of a less sensitive historical personage: "We, whose land is Turan, Our prince is Turkestan. We, who are the most ancient and largest of nations, We are the main flank of the Turks." Our ancestor Prince Temur said these words. Our ancestors did not say we are "Turkic-speakers," they said we are Turks. The academicians consider their readers to be so uneducated that when they say "Turk", they only wish them to understand it to mean the Turks of Turkey. Finally, it does not mean that the Uzbeks descended from the Turks of Turkey; on the contrary, it means the Turks of Turkey came from Turkestan. The academicians also make oversimplified statements about the Uzbek language: "Uzbek is not a pure Turkic language." We give to following response to them in the words of Navoiy: "I have pondered much in Turkic poetry, I have turned a fortress into a state." The present Uzbek language constitutes the center of the great Turkic language. Why? The Kipchak dialect is at the foundation of the modern Kazakh and Kyrgyz languages, the Oghuz dialect is at the basis of modern Turkey Turkish, Azeri and Turkmen, the basis of modern Uighur is the Karluk dialect. At the foundation of the modern Uzbek language are elements of the Kipchak, Oghuz and Karluk dialects. For this reason, our present-day Uzbek is at the center of the Turkic languages, respected by scholars. In other words, it is not as you said, a new language "shaped on the foundation of the Turkic languages," but the Turkic language itself. One must recognize that after accepting the Cyrillic alphabet our language was damaged perceptibly and the laws of vowel harmony which are special to the Turkic languages were violated, but our language did stay secure. One does not have to be an academician to understand this, it suffices to read and write. Abdulhamid Cholpan never traveled to Turkey, but he wrote dozens of poems in the Turkish of Turkey. Had our academicians read these poems, they would have known that the only difference between Turkish and Uzbek was in accent and certain newly-created neologisms. But they did not wish to read these poems, they studied instead the works of colonialist ideologists Tolstov and Yakubovskiy. In addition to this, there are a number of strange things in the article by Askarov and Ahmedov. The historical sources they used, instead of proving that Uzbek is not Turkic, but use many documents to prove that it is Turkic. Other than the utterly false statement that "Uzbeks are not Turkic, they are turkophonic" at the beginning of the article, they do a disservice to a number of authors. But one can shatter this false claim with a number of questions: "You say that the Uzbeks are a tribe which came in with Sheybani Khan and they mixed with the indigenous population of Turkestan. Good, what was the name of the local population? Who say "turkophonic" but is there not such a nation in history?" "You use the word "sart." But the sarts were not a nation, it is a title given to city-dwellers." ""And another aspect: you connect the word "Uzbek" with Uzbek Khan, a khan of the Golden Horde. But where did the word "Uzbek" come from?" "Some people think that "Uzbek" does not derive from a phrase meaning "masters of themselves," but from "Oghuzbek", or a late manifestation of it meaning "bek of the Oghuz." This means that the history of "uzbek" is even older than the history you mention. It is possible for us to go even deeper into this history: the Greek historian Herodotus used both "ancient Uz" and "Ughuz." Finally, what name did the nomadic Uzbeks and the indigenous population (Turkestani Sarts) who later took their name use? Soghdian, Massagetian, Saka, Farsi -- which do you prefer? Give us a name so we do not dangle in the heavens! Yes, it is possible that we have in our blood the blood of Soghdians, Massagetians, and Sakas. But the primary element in our blood is that of the ancient Turks, the blood of the Huns and Kok Turks. You know this well. In order to prove their point, our academicians talk about the physical characteristics of the Uzbek. In the physical type of our people one finds both the Andronov and the Mongoloid type. But the nation is not defined by the shape of a man's head. The Andronov and Mongoloid types are a racial question. The concept of a nation is broader than that of race. We have spoken in a national language called Turkic for two thousand years, we have lived with its national customs and traditions, we know ourselves to be Uzbek Turks and take pride in it. We could bring up our ancestors who considered themselves to be Turks -- Alisher Navoiy, Emir Temur, Zahiriddin Boburshah, Mahmud Kasghari, and others -- and speak out against the ideology of mankurtism, but this is not an honorable business because to enter into such a discussion would be like comparing the sun to a candle. If you want to conceal the fact that the Uzbeks are Turks, then you should demolish the statue of Emir Temur which stands in Tashkent because Emir Temur also thought he was a Turk. If you would escape the Turkic family, do not call Ahmed Yassavi "our poet" because he thought he was a Turk; you must also destroy the works of Alisher Navoiy because Navoiy took pride in his turkdom. You have to ban our entire classical literature and all our ancient history because this classical literature and ancient history clearly talked about its own turkishness. Create a new nation with only Tolstov and Yakubovskiy, write a "history of this new "nation," and call it "The History of the Mankurts," and you yourselves will be the heroes of this "new history." Only, do not try to hang curtains on our windows to conceal the identity of the Uzbeks because our nation' history cannot be covered with a rotting curtain remaining from the Nikolays, or not even with an iron curtain. That is how brilliant our history is.
