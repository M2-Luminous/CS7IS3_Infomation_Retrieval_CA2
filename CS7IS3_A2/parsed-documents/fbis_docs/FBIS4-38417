Zhirinovskiy Faction's Innovations Run Up Against `Russia's Choice'"] [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democrats, outraged by television journalist Nikolay Svanidze's statements that the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] has not submitted a single draft to the Duma, told the public about their lawmaking activities and their economic research efforts. LDPR deputies explained that all of their innovations run up against "Russia's Choice" opposition in the Duma Council and at plenary sittings. For this reason the draft laws "On Regulation of Ownership in the Russian Federation," "On Russian Federation Property Abroad," "On Trust," "On the Restoration of Property Rights of Russian Federation Citizens Violated in the Period 17 March 1917 through 12 December 1993," and "On the Brain Drain From the Russian Federation" have not become full-fledged state acts after all. The journalists' close attention was drawn to the first three draft laws. The law "On Trust" was drafted by Deputy Aleksey Zuyev, who, before his election, was adviser to the president of the "GMM" trust company, whose activities drew complaints from the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. The other two laws are devoted to the implementation of the party's economic program. The one regulating the rights of ownership puts an end to the voucher privatization that is nearly completed anyhow. Instead of this robbery, all citizens of the Russian Federation are supposed to open Savings Bank accounts marked "NP" (National Property), "PP" (Privatized Property), and the "RNP" (Regional National Property). The various owners -- the state, the regions, and private owners who have snapped up their share of the generous LDPR handouts -- are supposed to put their earnings in these accounts. It has been decided to name this process privatization. That, the Liberal Democratic innovators have calculated, would make for a comfortable life for 60 percent of Russia's citizens. It is even easier with investments in industry -- one only has to mortgage all Russian Federation property abroad in Japanese banks, to pour all the earned yen into the needy enterprises, to ban without fail liberalization of external trade, to stir the concoction and have Mr. Zhirinovskiy and his economic advisers drink it up with a feeling of deep gratitude. A sudden drain of healthy brains, if the program gets implemented, can be prevented by the corresponding law drafted in the committee on geopolitics.
