The haul ranged from handy, light arms for ladies to ultramodern, fully automatic Uzi's. At the same time, the German justice authorities expressed severe criticism of the liberal Belgian arms legislation. The house search action, "a raid on law-abiding citizens who arm themselves," resulted in more than 750 apartments being searched. A total of 2,247 agents were deployed throughout Germany, bringing hundreds of people out of their beds from 0500 GMT Wednesday [9 March] morning. The largest number of holders of illegal firearms live in the border area, just a 30-minute drive away from Liege. However, major caches were found in Berlin, too. "It is curious that someone should drive 600 km there and back to buy a weapon," noted the BKA. In all, 1,049 weapons were found in the searched houses. They included revolvers, rifles, and automatic machine pistols. However, the lion's share of the arms haul comprised rifles and handguns. The BKA believes that it only discovered the tip of the iceberg during this haul: "We think that the arms discovered during this action represent 15 to 20 percent of annual illegal exports," said Commissioner Ulrich Kamp, who led the investigation. Kamp thinks that his service missed another 250 weapons: "We did not find any at addresses where there should have been some." One day after the arms haul, it became apparent that more than 30 weapons had been used in armed raids, shooting incidents, and suicides. The people in possession of illegal weapons risk prison sentences of between six months and six years. Arms Tourism "Germans are arming themselves via Belgium on a massive scale," was the conclusion reached by Cologne prosecuting attorney Egbert Buelles. He was concerned about how easy it is to acquire weapons in Belgium. Buelles has been entrusted with taking care of the criminal prosecutions arising from the case. "The problem caused by the different regulations governing arms ownership that apply in various European countries has become a burning issue from today," he announced. According to Buelles, the Belgian legislation plays right into the hands of this kind of "arms tourism." "I hope that the Belgian authorities will recognize one fact, namely that the bearing and using of firearms must simply be banned." In Germany, the arms legislation in application is highly restrictive. The BKA claims it is the strictest in Europe. Even the purchase of weapons for self-defense is inadmissible. Anyone wanting to come into consideration for a permit must take a shooting test. Investigation chief Ulrich Kamp emphasized that the Belgian state police passed on the details of the searched addresses to the BKA of their own accord. In Belgium, anyone purchasing weapons must show their identity card, and it was those details that the BKA used: "The purchasers were not aware that we could get hold of the information." None of those responsible for the action wanted to say so in as many words, but there are major difficulties concerning the exchange of information with France. As a result, the question concerning the next raid in search of weapons of French origin was merely met with a broad smile. Ostend During the presentation, the BKA did not give any details on where in Belgium the weapons had been purchased. The arms were neatly displayed on a table and commented upon by an arms expert wearing a spotless white coat. Subsequently, Commissioner Kamp wanted to make it known that the main centers involved had been Eupen and Liege. Because of their location, close to the German border, many Germans go there to buy weapons. However, weapons are purchased in Antwerp and, remarkably enough, even in Ostend. According to Ulrich Kamp: "During the summer of 1992 and 1993 we noted peak sales in Ostend. Perhaps people combined their holidays with the purchase of a weapon." According to Volker Rehm, the head of the organized crime division of the BKA, there are no indications of commercial arms trading between Belgium and Germany: "However, that is certainly an area which we will be keeping a close eye on." Rehm emphasized that the action by the German police had been of a primarily preventive nature. "We want to warn all those law-abiding citizens that they cannot simply go to Belgium to purchase a weapon there," he concluded.
