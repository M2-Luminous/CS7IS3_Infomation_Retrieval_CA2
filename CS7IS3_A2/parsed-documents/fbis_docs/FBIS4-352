This sums up the reaction of the international community after the unleashing of violence following the deaths of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi the day before yesterday. Yesterday, armed rival factions fought in Kigali, where armed men carried out a veritable cleansing of political circles and those in favor of democratization. Priests also paid the price in this settling of scores, as well as Belgian soldiers. The spokesman of the UN force in Rwanda -- 2,000 soldiers in all -- this morning released the names of 10 Belgian peacekeepers shot dead by Rwandan soldiers. The soldiers, all Belgians, were responsible for ensuring the safety of the prime minister, Madame Uwilingiyimana. [passage omitted] Listen to what Colonel Marchal, who leads the Belgian contingent in Rwanda, has to say about it. [Begin Marchal recording] The soldiers were part of the mortar platoon of the battalion, which was carrying out escort duty for ministers and VIPs, it was a security escort. Yesterday, during the day, some of them were separated from their ministers, because the ministers were either killed or abducted, and they found themselves in the midst of the Rwandan armed forces. They were disarmed, taken to a district in the center of town, the Kigali camp [as heard], and there, apparently, they were maltreated by certain soldiers and shot dead. [passage omitted] [end recording] Apart from the prime minister, the speaker of the National Assembly and the chairman of the Constitutional Court were also murdered, as were several leaders of opposition parties, along with their families. The president of the Human Rights League was shot dead by soldiers while she was speaking on the telephone to a Belgian interlocutor. [passage omitted] The Belgian reaction was rapid: A meeting of the cabinet was held yesterday evening until 0100 this morning. The prime and foreign ministers, Dehaene and Claes, who are visiting abroad, have been recalled to Belgium, and a further meeting of the cabinet is due to be held this morning. The king and the queen, who are also visiting abroad, are also returning to Belgium.
