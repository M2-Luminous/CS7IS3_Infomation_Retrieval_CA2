FR940526-0-00026 FR940526-0-00010 The Committee's final estimate of 1993&hyph;94 production of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins is 384,501 tons. Dividing the computed trade demand of 282,909 tons by the final estimate of production results in a final free percentage of 74 percent and a final reserve percentage of 26 percent. Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's recommendations and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the Federal Register on March 17, 1994 [59 FR 12528], will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
