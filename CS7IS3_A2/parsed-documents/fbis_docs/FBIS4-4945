While briefing business leaders on his recent visits to Japan and China over lunch at Chongwadae, President Kim said, "more than 90 North Korean laborers in Russia have applied for asylum in South Korea through our consulate-general or embassy but the government is not accepting them in order not to get on the nerves of North Korea." "The government's position on the matter remains the same as before and the government is not considering bringing in the North Koreans at the moment," the chief executive was quoted as saying.
