Korean `National Security Law' Must Be Scrapped Immediately" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Voices strongly urging the abrogation of the "National Security Law [NSL]" in South Korea are ringing out from different countries. J.O. Adeloju, chairman of the Nigerian Committee for Supporting the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, said in a press statement that the "National Security Law" of South Korea is the fascist law which defines North Korea as "an anti-state organization", barring free travels and exchange between the North and the South. If the North-South dialogue is to progress successfully and peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula to be achieved at an early date, it is necessary to immediately and unconditionally scrap the NSL, he contended. The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said in a statement that the South Korean authorities must know clearly that they can never evade the blame for their treason in blocking the national reunification, if they refuse to repeal the "National Security Law" despite warnings from the world people. The Indonesian paper IN O SIAN OTSERVER carried an article branding the "NSL" as an obstacle to the materialization of democracy in South Korea.
