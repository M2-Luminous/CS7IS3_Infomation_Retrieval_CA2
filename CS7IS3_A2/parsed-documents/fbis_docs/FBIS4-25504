Leaders of the group, Mr. Gao Shangquan and Mrs. Nellie Fong said in a press conference that today's meeting centered on the work report for the first half of this year and had made preparations for a concluding meeting to be held in July. The session also discussed work set for the second half of the year. Members of the group were convinced that the group would be divided into six smaller teams in the second half of the year in a bid to smooth the work. The sub-groups are the large-scale project and contract study team, the study team for coordination of large basic construction in Hong Kong and China, the land and housing policy study team, the financial and economic study team, the foreign economic relations study team, and the study team for economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and China after 1997. Mr. Gao said that the latter two teams were newly created in a bid to validate agreements and treaties signed by the territory with foreign countries before 1997. As economic relations increasingly grow closer and bigger between Hong Kong and China, a clear picture should be defined for further development of such links. Establishment of the two teams can help achieve this end and are aimed at maintaining stability during the transition period and for the long-term prosperity in the territory after 1997.
