The document was submitted to the government session by the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic. [passage omitted] Radioactive waste is currently being stored on the premises of individual nuclear power stations and the existing capacities are about 50 percent full. Spent fuel is being stored in storage pools of the wet type [skladovacie bazeny mokreho typu] and, in the best possible case, existing storage capacities will last until 1997. Dominant among solid waste are a large quantity of contaminated soil (1,900 cubic meters) and scrap metal (1,980 tonnes) stemming from the dismantling of some technical installations. According to the Ministry of Economy document, radioactive waste from nuclear power stations is being stored in various storage systems that represent a fairly big risk from the viewpoint of potential environmental impact. The devices needed to handle, pack, and transport radioactive waste to the storage site have been secured. The long-term safe storage of radioactive waste, however, including the storage and definitive depositing of spent fuel, has not been secured so far, the Ministry of Economy document states.
