It was Qing Ming festival yesterday [5 April]. The primary school in Huzhen town, Jinyun County organized over 140 students from grade four and five to go on a spring outing. Three classes went on a water tour on a reservoir in Yanmen Township, five km from the town. Over 80 students came to the assembly place. At around 1030, the students embarked at the designated place. Ten minutes later the first boat capsized, and, after four or five minutes, the second boat also capsized and sank. Teachers on the scene and some other people who rushed to the scene on hearing the news threw themselves into rescuing the students from the water. The large rescue operation ended in the early hours of today. It was finally confirmed that 44 students, all of whom were around age 10, had drowned. Both of the sunken boats were concrete boats [the hulls are constructed from concrete formed around a steel frame]. The preliminary police investigation suggests that the accident was caused by serious overloading. After the accident, Xu Zhichun, the vice governor of Zhejiang Province, together with persons in charge of the administrative office in Lishui Prefecture, rushed to the scene to supervise the rescue operation and the handling of the aftermath. The provincial government education committee issued a notice to all primary and middle schools in the province advising them to draw a lesson from this accident and to take substantial measures to ensure the safety of spring outings. The cause of the accident is under further investigation and the repercussions are being dealt with.
