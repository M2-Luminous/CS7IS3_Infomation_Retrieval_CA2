Spreng and F. Weckbach-Mara in Bonn; date not given: "What Will You Do When You Are Retired, Mr. President?"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [BILD AM SONNTAG] What are the political issues that you will be dealing with in the future? [Weizsaecker] The priority of my political work has always been connected with overcoming the division of Berlin, Germany, and Europe. After the unification of Germany, the next item on the agenda will be the inclusion of the free and democratic nations of Central, Eastern, and southeastern Europe. It is no coincidence that my last trip as president will be to Warsaw. Poland is among the countries whose history, culture, and values are just as European as that of our western neighbors and ourselves. The unification of Europe will take a long time, but it is a very significant historic process. I feel particularly committed to that process. Another priority is the future of the United Nations. [BILD AM SONNTAG] It has been said that you have been specifically asked by the UN secretary general.... [Weizsaecker] Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has asked a group of 12 people to present proposals for the reform of the United Nations in the summer of 1995 on the occasion of the organization's 50th birthday. I am chairman of that group with former Pakistani Prime Minister Qureshie. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Are you also dissatisfied with UN peace missions, like the one in Somalia, and with inaction in the case of Rwanda? [Weizsaecker] At the moment, the world community does not have the necessary instruments to fulfill its peace task. But who is responsible for this situation? Not the organization of the United Nations but the lack of political will, especially on the part of important member countries. The secretary general very emphatically asked for means to help Rwanda, yet in vain. This is just one of the examples that have made him demand that the United Nations should have forces at its disposal when needed. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you share this view and do you expect Germany to participate in the future? [Weizsaecker] I share the secretary general's view. As to our country, we have to take the obligations of a member state seriously. We cannot expect the United Nations to be capable of acting and responsible for peace on the one hand while refusing to participate in enforcing it on the other. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will Germany then be given a permanent seat on the UN Security Council? [Weizsaecker] First, Germany will probably be voted into the Security Council as a temporary member for two years as of 1 January 1995. The future permanent composition of the Security Council will then have to be decided in a reform of the United Nations, which will certainly not be restricted to Germany. [BILD AM SONNTAG] What sort of reform? [Weizsaecker] First of all, the United Nations must be strengthened in terms of funds, supplies, organization, and logistics. The Germans are providing much more support in these fields today than other important countries. Of course, the United Nations is not heading toward a world government with a world police force. Conflicts will not stop nor will violence. Events like the ones in Rwanda, where we as a community of states have failed, are no reason to condemn the United Nations. They are a signal to wake up in order to enable it to act more efficiently than it has done in the past. I would, however, warn against seeing the activities of the United Nations exclusively against the background of avoiding or ending military conflicts. Living conditions in the north are still completely different from the south. In addition to a lack of justice, deprivation, and starvation, overpopulation and the dangers to our environment are the major tasks of today. They will determine the course of the reforms.
