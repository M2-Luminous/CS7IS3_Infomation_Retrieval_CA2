FR941205-0-00063 FR941205-0-00018 21 CFR Part 558 New Animal Drugs for Use in Animal Feeds; Monensin and Bacitracin Methylene Disalicylate AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Elanco Animal Health, Division of Eli Lily and Co. The NADA provides for use of two separately approved Type A medicated articles, one containing monensin sodium and the other containing bacitracin methylene disalicylate, to make combination Type C medicated feeds for the prevention of coccidiosis, for increased rate of weight gain and for improved feed efficiency in growing turkeys. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James F. McCormack, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;128), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1602. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Elanco Animal Health, Division of Eli Lilly and Co., Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285, has filed NADA 140&hyph;937. The NADA provides for use of separately approved 45 and 60 grams per pound (g/lb) monensin and 10, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 g/lb bacitracin methylene disalicylate Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds containing 54 to 90 g per ton (g/t) monensin and 4 to 50 g/t bacitracin methylene disalicylate. The feed is used for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by Eimeria adenoeides , E . meleagrimitis , and E . gallopavonis , for increased rate of weight gain, and for improved feed efficiency in growing turkeys. The NADA is approved as of November 8, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 558.355(f)(2) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. Certain limitations currently required on the monensin turkey feed labeling are not in the regulations. At this time, FDA is adding these limitations to the regulations. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of 21 CFR part 20 and 21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)), this approval qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning November 8, 1994, because the application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) or human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(ii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 558 Animal drugs, Animal feeds. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under the authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 558 is amended as follows: PART 558_NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR USE IN ANIMAL FEEDS 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 558 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b, 371). 2. Section 558.355 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) and (f)(2)(iii) as paragraphs (f)(2)(i)( a ) and (f)(2)(i)( b ), respectively, by revising newly redesignated paragraph (f)(2)(i)( b ), and by adding new paragraph (f)(2)(ii) to read as follows: ยง558.355 Monensin. * * * * * (f) * * * (2) * * * (i) * * * ( b ) Limitations . For growing turkeys only; as monensin sodium; feed continuously as sole ration. Do not allow horses, other equines, mature turkeys, or guinea fowl access to feed containing monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses and guinea fowl has been fatal. Some strains of turkey coccidia may be monensin tolerant or resistant. Monensin may interfere with development of immunity to turkey coccidiosis. (ii) Amount per ton . Monensin, 54 to 90 grams, and bacitracin methylene disalicylate, 4 to 50 grams. ( a ) Indications for use . For prevention of coccidiosis caused by Eimeria adenoeides , E . meleagrimitis , and E . gallopavonis , for increased rate of weight gain, and for improved feed efficiency. ( b ) Limitations . For growing turkeys only; as monensin sodium; feed continuously as sole ration. Do not allow horses, other equines, mature turkeys or guinea fowl access to feed containing monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses and guinea fowl has been fatal. Some strains of turkey coccidia may be monensin tolerant or resistant.
