Other sources stressed that the visit was directly linked to the peace process and the writing off or reducing the Jordanian debts, which was the most important issue on the agenda of last week's summit between Husayn and Clinton. While press sources stressed that the visit by the U.S. commerce secretary resulted in a government promise to end the Jordanian boycott of Israel, acting Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n Abu-Nuwar stressed to AL-BILAD that ending the boycott was not at all raised by the Jordanian or U.S. parties in the recent talks in Amman. He also said the reports published on this issue are totally unfounded, especially since the Americans know full well the true Jordanian firm stand on this issue -- that there should be a joint Arab position on the boycott. In another development, the visit by a group of 83-rabbis, who toured Jordan from Amman to Petra, has drawn various reactions. Most people voiced concern that the normalization period has started already before any genuine guarantees to return the occupied Jordanian territories have been obtained and away from the comprehensive solution emphasized by the Jordanian Government. This was denied by Minister Abu-Nuwar, who stressed to AL-BILAD that this delegation was a tourist group, just like any other tourist group that visits Jordan. He said the competent authorities dealt with the delegation in that capacity, especially since members of the group were carrying U.S. passports that did not show any link to Israel or contain stamps to indicate that they had previously visited Israel. Regarding the official receptions accorded to this delegation, Minister Abu-Nuwar stressed that they were not received by any official. Away from Abu-Nuwar's statements, various Jordanian parties and public figures issued strong statements warning the government against falling into the trap of normalization with Israel and calling for confronting that normalization, which was started by the government and which means full submission to the Jewish state.
