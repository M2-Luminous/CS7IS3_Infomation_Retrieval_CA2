Faced with a grim prospect of being found out for playing a game of lies and half-truth that would have led to a defeat of its motion had it been voted upon, Islamabad had dropped the paragraph calling for a UN factfinding mission to visit Kashmir from its resolution on Tuesday [8 March]. This paragraph was substituted with one that called upon India to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir. This was obviously done in the hope that there would be more takers for the resolution and it would be carried through. India, of course, had repudiated this latest maneuver, and as much was evident when Dr. Farooq Abdullah, articulating New Delhi's response to the latest twist in Islamabad's devious gameplan, told the delegates that no resolution touching any aspect of Kashmir was acceptable to India. Obviously, the Indian message had more takers than Pakistan's misadventurism, because by yesterday it was clear that 43 of the 53 members of the UNHRC had decided not to have anything to do with the resolution. As for the remaining 10, obviously the majority were poised to vote against the motion. India owes its moral victory to various factors, including the excellent work done by its delegation in Geneva. The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, who stationed himself in Geneva, valiantly fought against each and every charge that was leveled by Islamabad and its agencies masquerading as NGO's [nongovernmental organizations]. Back at home, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, made it clear that the Government of India is not lacking in resolve as far as protecting Kashmir from predators is concerned. The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan's spirited defense of India's case on Kashmir and its pledge to stake everything to defeat the Pakistani gameplan also contributed toward weakening Islamabad's resolve. Credit should also be given to China and Iran for finally convincing Pakistan about the folly of its action. Will Pakistan learn a lesson from the humiliation it has suffered in Geneva? The outcome of the conference shows that while rhetoric as resorted to by the Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, may sound fine, it does not yield results. India believes in peaceful coexistence with its neighbors and has consistently reiterated its commitment to bilateral dialogue. Hopefully, Pakistan -- having traversed the path of defeat -- will now realize that there is no substitute for peace, truth, and honesty. It is also hoped that Pakistan will stop stoking the fires that it has lit in Kashmir and honor India's territorial integrity. However, it remains to be seen if Ms. Bhutto's government has the political courage to accept defeat and mend its ways.
