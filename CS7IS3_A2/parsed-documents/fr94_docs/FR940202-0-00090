FR940202-0-00090 FR940202-0-00010 effective date: February 2, 1994. for further information contact: Mr. Mack A. Storrs, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Family Assistance, Fifth Floor, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447, telephone (202) 401&hyph;9289. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking On July 15, 1991, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register relating to updating the statutory disregards in regulations for the AFDC program, and adult assistance programs in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Discussion of Regulatory Provisions and Responses to Comments The final rules implement the disregard provisions of several public laws and revise existing regulations to require the disregard of bona fide loans as discussed below: Disregard of Student Financial Assistance Provided Under the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Higher Education Amendments of 1992 Public Law 102&hyph;325, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, enacted July 23, 1992, amends the Higher Education Act of 1965. Effective July 1, 1993, section 471(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;325 revises section 479B to provide that any student financial assistance received under programs in title IV of the Higher Education Act, or under Bureau of Indian Affairs student assistance programs, shall be disregarded in determining the need or eligibility of any person for benefits or assistance, or the amount of such benefits or assistance, under any Federal, State, or local programs financed in whole or in part with Federal funds. Some examples of student financial assistance authorized by title IV of the Higher Education Act are: the Pell Grant Program, the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) Program, the National Direct Student Loan (NDSL) Program, the PLUS Program, the Byrd Honor Scholarship Programs and the College Work Study Program. We are adding a new ยง233.20(a)(4)(ii)( p ) to implement Public Law 102&hyph;325. Since the regulatory changes related to section 479B of the Higher Education Act do not involve administrative discretion, but simply implement statutory requirements, we believe that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), good cause exists for waiver of a notice of proposed rulemaking on the grounds that it is not necessary. In the NPRM, we proposed to include in regulations the disregard authorized by the former section 479B, as added by section 14(27) of Public Law 100&hyph;50. The former section 479B limited the disregard to student financial assistance made available for the attendance costs defined in that section. Child care and living expenses were not defined as attendance costs. Therefore, we proposed that assistance for such costs would not be disregarded under this regulation unless the educational institution provided for them as part of miscellaneous personal expenses. We received comments from three State agencies, one County agency, and one legal advocacy group on the proposed rule. The comments are discussed below: Comment: The commenters recommended that we disregard all of the educational assistance, including amounts provided for child care and living expenses, because counting any part of the educational assistance may inflate State error rates and may be a severe disincentive to the continuation of post-secondary education.
