FBIS3-48555 "dreas017_a_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-017 Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan More Reports on Reform Bill Rejection Aftermath Kaifu Interviewed 22 Jan OW2601053694 OW2601053694 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese at 2332 GMT on 22 January, in its regularly scheduled "News 2001" program, carries a live interview with former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The program begins with a brief introduction of Kaifu as the man who holds the key to whether the LDP stays together or further breaks up with tension expected to mount between LDP groups having differing views on the political reform bills as a result of the rejection of the bills in the upper house of the Diet on 21 January. The program also seeks to have Kaifu explain what he has in mind to have the bills enacted during the current Diet session. Asked what he feels was the greatest cause of the defeat of the political reform bills in the upper house, Kaifu says although ruling coalition parties and the opposition LDP held last minute talks to reach a compromise, they failed. He stresses: "They should have tried to move just one step closer to arriving at a compromise." Regarding the reemergence of arguments that the political reform bills be treated separately and that bills on preventing political corruption be taken up first, Kaifu points out that past efforts at preventing political corruption have been unsuccessful. He says that the LDP worked out its political reform outline during his term as prime minister. Bringing out papers on which the outline has been laid out, he explains that the current election system is at the root of political corruption. He says a problem can only be solved by attacking it at its roots, not just at its limbs, citing a college professor under whom he once studied. He thus asserts the political reform bills should be taken up as a single package. Kaifu then points out that since the parties which formerly opposed the LDP political reform outline are now agreeing to bills which basically agree in principle with this outline, the LDP should also try to move toward a compromise. He feels the ruling coalition parties and the LDP should work out a compromise and that he believes this can be done. He further points out that since the leaders of Sakigake (Harbinger) and Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) worked together with him in drafting the political reform outline, they should be well aware of the principles involved, and, therefore, things can be settled by holding a thorough discussion at a joint meeting of both houses of the Diet. Asked how he would act in case the political reform bills were put to the vote again in the lower house, Kaifu says this is undesirable and unlikely since there is the option of working out a solution at a joint meeting of both houses. Freelance commentator Kenichi Takemura says ruling coalition party officials should refrain from suggesting that the coalition is willing to accept the LDP-proposed bills "in whole" (marunomi) so that political reform bills can be enacted during the current Diet session. He warns they should be wary of using delicate terms which could decisively determine the fate of the political reform bills, pointing out the use of the term "marunomi" could anger many coalition members since it would offend their pride to accept the opposition's proposals. At 2341 GMT, Hirotaka Akamatsu, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), is called up via remote hookup to comment on what has been said so far in Kaifu's interview. He says it is the responsibility of all politicians to have political reform brought about during the current Diet session, and, therefore, a compromise should be worked out at a joint meeting of both houses where representatives of the various parties will be present. Asked to say a few words to Kaifu, Akamatsu points out that comments LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori made earlier in the program indicate that the LDP leadership wants to put off the political reform bills rather than work out a compromise at a joint meeting of both houses. He asks that Kaifu exercise his leadership to bring together pro-reformist LDP members for a joint cooperation toward bringing about political reform during the current Diet session. Akamatsu vows that he and his associates would do their best. Kaifu is asked what he intends to do. He says immediately after the bills were rejected at the upper house, he and his associates held a discussion and decided to ask the LDP leadership to promptly take steps toward holding a joint meeting of both houses of the Diet to work out a compromise. He says this is necessary since Japan is in the midst of an economic slump and this matter also warrants immediate attention. He says as soon as a compromise is worked out on basic points, then the government can start working on other problems. On reports that some LDP members plan to demand the resignation of the party leadership if it agrees to a joint meeting of both houses, Kaifu denounces such moves, saying that the party adopted its political reform outline in 1989 and has campaigned in subsequent elections with this outline as a party platform. He mentions that, at the time, he was the leader of a task force on political reform and current LDP President Yohei Kono was acting leader then. He says they both toured the country to explain the party's political reform outline. He says since this has been the party's platform, it is only proper that the party's leadership seek a compromise with the coalition that would bring the political reform bills as close to the party's proposals as possible. He says this can be accomplished by holding a joint meeting of both houses, and, therefore, it is improper to denounce the party leadership for agreeing to holding such a meeting. Asked how he feels about some people calling for a top-level meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Kono to resolve the situation, Kaifu stresses the problem should be solved by holding a joint meeting of both houses to work out a compromise. Regarding rumors that some junior members of his group may leave the LDP should the situation fail to be resolved, Kaifu says the Federation of Dietmen for Political Reform members have resolved to concentrate all their efforts now on political reform, not more and not less. The interview concludes with Kaifu stating his continued determination to help bring about political reform, calling for utmost efforts by all politicians toward this end.
