A delegation headed by General Teoman Erkan, under secretary at the Ministry of National Defense, is visiting Russia for that purpose now. Minister of National Defense Mehmet Golhan said the delegation will try to establish whether or not the two sides can reach a reconciliation in the military field. It has been ascertained that Gen. Erkan and his delegation have already begun their contacts in Russia. It has also been ascertained that Russia will propose to sell MiG-29, MiG-31, and SU attack aircraft to Turkey in addition to Kalashnikov automatic weapons, various types of helicopters, and BTR-60 and BTR-80 armored combat vehicles. Turkey is interested in acquiring helicopters, Kalashnikov weapons, and armored combat vehicles from that country. However, Ankara prefers that Turkey manufacture them under patent. Replying to CUMHURIYET's questions on the visit, Mehmet Golhan said: "Attention will be focused more on bilateral agreements than on arms purchases. Russia has economic problems. Compared with the prices in other countries, several items required by the Turkish Armed Forces cost less in Russia. Nevertheless, the delegation has not visited that country to buy arms. Its objective is to establish whether or not the two countries, which were members of two different blocs for many years, can cooperate on military issues. We are making an effort to establish whether we can reach an agreement for cooperation in the military field. That may provide an opportunity to the two sides to dispatch observers to follow each other's military exercises or exchange students to study in each other's war colleges. Meanwhile, the purchase of interesting products or the establishment of installations in Turkey to manufacture them under patent is also possible." A source in the Russian Embassy in Ankara has assessed the delegation's contacts in Moscow as follows: "We attach importance to Russia's neighborly relations with Turkey. We trust Turkey. In view of that, we can cooperate with Turkey on defense in two fields. We can jointly realize several defense industry projects. The manufacture of armored vehicles or helicopters can be the first step in that direction. We can also sell ammunition and firearms to Turkey. In fact, we are already selling Kalashnikov automatic weapons. Meanwhile, we have proposed to sell MiG-29 and MiG-31 aircraft, which are superior to the F-16's, and SU-type planes, which are used in air-to-surface operations."
