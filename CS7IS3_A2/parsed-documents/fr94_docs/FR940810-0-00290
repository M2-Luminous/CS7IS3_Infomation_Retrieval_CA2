FR940810-0-00290 FR940810-0-00021 ( 3 ) The spray shall collide to form a fine aerosol which provides a liquid barrier between workers and the ACM and PACM. (B) Work Practices: ( 1 ) The system shall be run for at least 10 minutes before removal begins. ( 2 ) All removal shall take place within the water barrier. ( 3 ) The system shall be operated by at least three persons, one of whom shall not perform removal, but shall check equipment, and ensure proper operation of the system. ( 4 ) After removal, the ACM and PACM shall be bagged while still inside the water barrier. (vi) A small walk-in enclosure which accommodates no more than two persons (mini-enclosure) may be used if the disturbance or removal can be completely contained by the enclosure with the following specifications and work practices. (A) Specifications: ( 1 ) The fabricated or job-made enclosure shall be constructed of 6 mil plastic or equivalent: ( 2 ) The enclosure shall be placed under negative pressure by means of a HEPA filtered vacuum or similar ventilation unit: (B) Work practices: ( 1 ) Before use, the minienclosure shall be inspected for leaks and smoke tested to detect breaches, and breaches sealed. ( 2 ) Before reuse, the interior shall be completely washed with amended water and HEPA-vacuumed.. ( 3 ) During use air movement shall be directed away from the employee's breathing zone within the minienclosure. (6) Alternative control methods for Class I work. Class I work may be performed using a control method which is not referenced in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, or which modifies a control method referenced in paragraph (g)(5)of this section, if the following provisions are complied with: (i) The control method shall enclose, contain or isolate the processes or source of airborne asbestos dust, or otherwise capture or redirect such dust before it enters the breathing zone of employees. (ii) A certified industrial hygienist or licensed professional engineer who is also qualified as a project designer as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, shall evaluate the work area, the projected work practices and the engineering controls and shall certify in writing that the planned control method is adequate to reduce direct and indirect employee exposure to below the PELs under worst-case conditions of use, and that the planned control method will prevent asbestos contamination outside the regulated area, as measured by clearance sampling which meets the requirements of EPA's Asbestos in Schools rule issued under AHERA, or perimeter monitoring which meets the criteria in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B)( 2 ) of this section. (A) Where the TSI or surfacing material to be removed is 25 linear or 10 square feet or less , the evaluation required in paragraph (g)(6) of this section may be performed by a ``competent person'', and may omit consideration of perimeter or clearance monitoring otherwise required. (B) The evaluation of employee exposure required in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, shall include and be based on sampling and analytical data representing employee exposure during the use of such method under worst-case conditions and by employees whose training and experience are equivalent to employees who are to perform the current job. (iii) Before work which involves the removal of more than 25 linear or 10 square feet of thermal system insulation or surfacing material is begun using an alternative method which has been the subject of a paragraph (g)(6) required evaluation and certification, the employer shall send a copy of such evaluation and certification to the national office of OSHA, Office of Technical Support, Room N3653, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20210. (7) Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class II work. (i) All Class II work, shall be supervised by a competent person as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. (ii) For all indoor Class II jobs, where the employer has not produced a negative exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, or where during the job changed conditions indicate there may be exposure above the PEL or where the employer does not remove the ACM in a substantially intact state, the employer shall use one of the following methods to ensure that airborne asbestos does not migrate from the regulated area; (A) Critical barriers shall be placed over all openings to the regulated area; or, (B) The employer shall use another barrier or isolation method which prevents the migration of airborne asbestos from the regulated area, as verified by perimeter area monitoring or clearance monitoring which meets the criteria set out in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B)(2) of this section. (iii) Impermeable dropcloths shall be placed on surfaces beneath all removal activity; (iv) All Class II asbestos work shall be performed using the work practices and requirements set out above in paragraph (g)(3) (i) through (v) of this section. (8) Additional Controls for Class II work. Class II asbestos work shall also be performed by complying with the work practices and controls designated for each type of asbestos work to be performed, set out in this paragraph. Where more than one control method may be used for a type of asbestos work, the employer may choose one or a combination of designated control methods. Class II work also may be performed using a method allowed for Class I work, except that glove bags and glove boxes are allowed if they fully enclose the Class II material to be removed. (i) For removing vinyl and asphalt flooring materials which contain ACM or for which in buildings constructed no later than 1980, the employer has not verified the absence of ACM pursuant to paragraph (g)(8)(i)(I) of this section. The employer shall ensure that employees comply with the following work practices and that employees are trained in these practices pursuant to paragraph (k)(8): (A) Flooring or its backing shall not be sanded. (B) Vacuums equipped with HEPA filter, disposable dust bag, and metal floor tool (no brush) shall be used to clean floors. (C) Resilient sheeting shall be removed by cutting with wetting of the snip point and wetting during delamination. Rip-up of resilient sheet floor material is prohibited. (D) All scraping of residual adhesive and/or backing shall be performed using wet methods. (E) Dry sweeping is prohibited. (F) Mechanical chipping is prohibited unless performed in a negative pressure enclosure which meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(5)(iv) of this section. (G) Tiles shall be removed intact, unless the employer demonstrates that intact removal is not possible. (H) When tiles are heated and can be removed intact, wetting may be omitted.
