Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council; and Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission [CMC] and director of the General Logistics Department; met with representatives to the conference. Li Lanqing said: The party Central Committee, the State Council, and the CMC have shown concern for and attached great importance to the supply of Army provisions, which is an important basic task guaranteeing the Army's modernization and regularization. Jiang Zemin, CPC Central Committee general secretary and CMC chairman, has made important instructions on Army provisions work many times. All localities and departments have long conscientiously implemented the instructions of the party Central Committee and the State Council. They have coordinated with one another in doing everything possible to ensure the supply, to improve the quality, to adjust the variety, and to increase financial subsidies for Army provisions, thereby raising the standard of Army provisions supply and winning the appreciation of PLA and Armed Police officers and men. Li Lanqing emphasized: Army provisions supply is a serious political task. Ensuring the supply of Army provisions is of great significance to stabilizing and developing Army building and guaranteeing national security. Governments at all levels and all departments concerned should, as always, do a good job in ensuring the variety, quality, quantity, and timeliness of Army provisions supply. In his speech, Bai Meiqing, vice minister of internal trade and director of the State Grain Reserve Bureau, emphasized the necessity of reforming the Army provisions supply system. He said: Reform of the Army provisions supply system will begin in April this year. Specific points of the reform are as follows: The existing method of procuring grains at the state fixed price shall be replaced by procurement at negotiated prices and supply to Army units at the fixed price. Subsidies for price differentials in grains, edible oil, and soybeans supplied to the Army shall be shared by both central and provincial-level financial resources. Financial affairs related to Army provisions shall be managed under special projects, special accounts, and special bookkeeping; and funds related to Army provisions shall be delivered collectively to the provincial-level finance departments for management. After the introduction of the reform, state-owned grain enterprises shall continue to be responsible for Army provisions supply. Grain departments shall be the functioning departments of Army provisions supply; and, Army grain supply stations (stores or depots) set up by grain departments in various localities shall be the special outlets of Army provisions supply. Grain departments shall be responsible for arranging and ensuring the supply of grains, edible oil, and other provisions for the Army.
