It is expected that the increased energy requirements associated with operation at uprated power will require an increase in the reload fuel enrichment and will result in increased burnup. The NRC previously evaluated the environmental impacts associated with burnup values of up to 60,000 MWd/MT with fuel enrichments up to 5% 235 U (published in the Federal Register , 53 FR 6040 dated February 29, 1988). The staff concluded that the environmental impacts associated with Table S&hyph;3 of 10 CFR 51.51, ``Uranium Fuel Cycle Environmental Data,'' and Table S&hyph;4 of 10 CFR 51.52, ``Environmental Effects of Transportation of Fuel and Waste,'' are conservative and bound the corresponding impacts for burnup levels of up to 60,000 MWd/MtU and 235 U enrichments up to 5 percent by weight. In the September 30, 1994 submittal, the licensee indicated that while fuel burnup and enrichment levels may increase as a result of operation at uprated power, the burnup and enrichment will remain within the 5% enrichment and 60,000 MWd/MT value previously evaluated by the staff. Based on the above cited environmental assessment and the licensee's statements regarding expected burnup and enrichment values, the staff concludes that the environmental effects of increased fuel cycle and transportation activity as a result of operation at uprated power levels are not significant. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's re-evaluation of the potential radiological and non-radiological environmental impacts for the proposed action. On the basis of the review described above, the NRC staff finds that the radiological and non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed small increase in power are very small and do not change the conclusion in the FES that the operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, would cause no significant adverse impact upon the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological or non-radiological environmental impact. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not significantly reduce the environmental impact of plant operation but would restrict operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3 to the currently licensed power level and prevent the facility from generating the additional 60 MWe that is obtainable from the existing plant design. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement related to the operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3,'' dated April 1973. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Bureau of Radiation Protection, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official had no comments regarding NRC's proposed action. Finding of No Significant Impact Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action. For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated June 23, 1993, as supplemented by letters dated April 5, May 2, June 6, June 8, June 29, July 6 (two letters), July 7, July 20, July 28 (two letters), September 16, 1994 and September 30, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the State Library of Pennsylvania, Government Publications Section, (REGIONAL DEPOSITORY) Education Building, Walnut Street and Commonwealth Avenue, Box 1601, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17105.
