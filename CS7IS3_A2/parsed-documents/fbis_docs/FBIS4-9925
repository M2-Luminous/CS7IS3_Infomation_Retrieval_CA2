A few days ago a specific issue led to the discussion of a very important subject for Chile: the definition of a national defense policy. During the academic meeting held last week at the University of Chile Political Sciences Institute to discuss the possible purchase of Mirage combat planes from Belgium, one of the participants stated -- and the other agreed -- that Chile lacks a defined national defense policy. He added that national objectives have not been established and that this is essential for a united community of interests that intends to stay united in the future. A nation state is organized on the basis of a human group with homogeneous characteristics, having similar principles, values, and believes that will be projected into the future. Otherwise, there is no sense in having a true contract between the state and citizens with reciprocal duties and rights. Moreover, a political community is established to achieve these goals and to project them into the future. One of the relevant issues on this subject is the establishment of a national defense policy. It can be said that the prevailing situation during the current times, the so-called age of post-modernism, is different and that the possibilities for armed conflicts have diminished. This may be so. In addition, it also can be alleged that the world powers are downsizing their armed forces. This is also true. Nevertheless, everyone is aware that international ties are measured by influence of power and in no other way. Moreover, only a few developed countries have implemented a downsizing of their armed forces. Chile, which holds a privileged position in Latin American because of its economic process, has emerged with a flourishing economy and a stable political system. In general, this situation is usually accompanied by a well-structured dissuasive policy. To do this, it is necessary to start at the basic level, that is, to establish national objectives and on this basis design an overall national defense policy. This issue, which was raised again last week at the University of Chile Political Sciences Institute, is a cause of concern for current defense officials.
