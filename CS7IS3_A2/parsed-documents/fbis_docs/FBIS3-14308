According to our correspondent in Paris, he called for strengthening the original arrangements with the aim of preserving peace and security and reducing tensions. The head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation to the 91st conference of the Inter-parliamentary Union held the big powers responsible for regional conflicts. He said: Just world bodies belonging to the nations are needed to prevent and stop these crises. Mr. Yahyavi said: This is the responsibility of the UN but, unfortunately, the decisionmaking Security Council and the Secretary General often act under the influence of the big powers. He said: A clear example in this connection is the dual policy of the Security Council vis-a-vis the Bosnian issue and the prevention of the despatch of peacekeeping force from the Islamic countries on the hollow pretext that it will be siding with the Bosnian Muslims, and that too at a time when troops from other countries that have close ties with the Serbs have been despatched to Bosnia. The head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation stressed that the different ways in which the Security Council has dealt with the Iraqi aggression against Islamic Iran and that country's aggression against Kuwait are the other examples of the Security Council's dual performance. Mr. Yahyavi said: The Security Council's decisions should be made in an open climate and by being away from behind-the-door collusions.
