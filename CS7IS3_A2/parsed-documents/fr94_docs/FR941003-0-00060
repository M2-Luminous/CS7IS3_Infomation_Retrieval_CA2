FR941003-0-00060 FR941003-0-00013 Several comments addressed the scope of new drug exclusivity. Two comments said FDA should grant exclusivity for any change to an approved drug product or, alternatively, should grant exclusivity based on specific types of studies, such as studies intended to reduce drug dosing or drug efficacy study implementation (DESI) upgrade studies. One comment disagreed with the preamble to the proposed rule, which stated, ``FDA expects that only those changes in an approved drug product that affect its active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, route of administration or conditions of use would be granted exclusivity'' (54 FR 28872 at 28899). Two comments asked FDA to clarify whether a clinical investigation establishing new risks could be eligible for exclusivity. The preamble to the proposed rule had indicated that such studies would not qualify for exclusivity because ``protection of the public health demands that all products' labeling contain all relevant warnings'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28899). One comment said FDA should accept an applicant's claim of exclusivity alone. Two other comments sought to limit exclusivity or clarify its scope. One comment argued that the rule was too broad, would confer ``an unearned windfall,'' and stifle generic competition. The comment explained that some variations, such as reductions in dosage, require little effort but would nevertheless qualify for exclusivity. The comment suggested that the rule define what types of changes would qualify for exclusivity. The second comment agreed with the preamble that DESI upgrades should not qualify for exclusivity but asked FDA to create a procedure whereby parties could contact FDA to determine whether exclusivity information was accurate. The comment said this would enable third parties to decide whether to challenge decisions to grant or deny exclusivity. FDA disagrees with those comments that would grant exclusivity for any change to an approved drug product or accept, without question, an applicant's claim that it is entitled to exclusivity. Under the statute and this final rule, certain drugs or changes to drugs can receive 3 years of exclusivity if the application or supplement to an application ``contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval *␣*␣*'' (see section 505(j)(4)(D)(iii) and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act). The phrase ``essential to the approval'' suggests that the clinical investigations that warrant exclusivity must be vital to the application or supplement. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``to qualify for exclusivity, there must not be published reports of studies other than those conducted or sponsored by the applicant, or other information available to the agency sufficient for FDA to conclude that a proposed drug product or change to an already approved drug product is safe and effective'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28900). For example, the agency would not consider studies to support a switch from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status to be ``essential to approval'' if the agency already had sufficient information to conclude that the OTC product would be safe and effective. (In OTC switch situations, FDA encourages applicants to consult FDA to determine whether clinical investigations or any other actions are necessary to permit FDA to approve a switch in a product's status.) FDA declines to define in the regulation the kinds of supplemental applications that, if supported by clinical investigations, would warrant 3-year exclusivity. Although the preamble to the proposed rule identified certain types of changes in a product that would normally warrant exclusivity (changes in active ingredient, strength, dosage form, route of administration, or conditions of use), the agency did not intend to suggest that other types of changes would not qualify. For example, changes in dosing regimen have resulted in grants of 3-year exclusivity. Changes that would not warrant exclusivity are, as discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, changes in labeling that involve warnings or other similar risk information that must be included in the labeling of generic competitors. Applicants obtaining approval for such changes in labeling would, in any event, have no valid interest in precluding such information from the labeling of other products. Furthermore, FDA does not consider a study to be ``essential to approval'' simply because the applicant conducted it and submitted the study for agency review (Ref. 1). FDA's interpretation is supported by statements that were made during the congressional debates surrounding the 3-year exclusivity provisions. Senator Orrin Hatch described the 3-year exclusivity provisions upon approval of certain supplemental applications as protecting ``some changes in strength, indications, and so forth, which require considerable time and expense in FDA required clinical testing'' (130 Congressional Record S10505, August 10, 1984) (statement of Senator Hatch)). Representative Henry Waxman said 3-year exclusivity was intended to ``encourage drugmakers to obtain FDA approval for significant therapeutic uses of previously approved drugs'' (130 Congressional Record H9114, (September 6, 1984)). Thus, an applicant is not entitled to 3-year exclusivity merely because it supplements an approved application based in part on a clinical investigation or because it certifies to FDA that the clinical investigation is essential to approval of the application or supplement. FDA also declines to create a new procedure whereby a party could contact FDA to determine whether exclusivity information is accurate. Interested parties can obtain information on exclusivity decisions through the Freedom of Information Act process (21 CFR part 20). Parties who wish to challenge an exclusivity decision can utilize the citizen petition procedures (21 CFR 10.30).
