Yilmaz announced that there will not be any quest for a new government and his party is definitely not a candidate for partnership in the government. Yilmaz reiterated his demand for early general elections. Yilmaz held a news conference at the end of the ANAP Chairmanship Council meeting. He noted that according to the results of yesterday's elections, his party is the second biggest party. Yilmaz explained that before the elections he refrained from making statements with false claims and said that the party may not receive the expected results because the citizens are not fully aware of the economic problems. Political division causes concern at a time when the country most needs political stability, Yilmaz remarked. Given this situation, he said, the proposal to implement an election system with two rounds in smaller regions has become a necessity. Yilmaz reiterated his demand to hold early general elections and added: [Begin recording] In these general elections, parties will present themselves to the citizens not only with their polished candidates, but with solutions to the basic problems currently facing Turkey. We believe that Turkey needs such elections now. Such an election will not only urge the citizens to choose in connection with the local authorities, it will also display their will regarding solutions to the main problems of the country. I believe that if the necessary step is taken to hold early elections and change the election system, it will be possible to erase this excessively divided political picture. [end recording] Replying to questions during his news conference, Yilmaz said that the government must now implement economic stability measures without any delay and the country must be led towards early general elections in a reasonable time. Asked to comment on Prime Minister Ciller's previous statement that his leadership will be disputed if the party fails in the elections, Yilmaz said that he does not take any note of this view. He pointed out: There is no need for Mrs. Ciller to make such an appeal. I would make this assessment myself. Noting that he was elected ANAP leader through the will of the party's grassroots, Yilmaz said: If I believe that there is a person who will take the party further than myself, then I would make every possible sacrifice for my party. He expressed the belief that the coalition government will remain in power, adding that under the circumstances there will not be any quest for a new government and his party is not a candidate for such a partnership.
