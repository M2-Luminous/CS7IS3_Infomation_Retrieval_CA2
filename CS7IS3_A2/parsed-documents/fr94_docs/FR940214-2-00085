Relating to the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 February 7, 1994 Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on November 8, 1993, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On January 13, 1994, the BSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposal. 2 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). 2 See letter from Karen A. Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE to Sandra Sciole, Branch Chief, Exchange Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated January 13, 1994. The BSE submitted a letter to the Commission adding language to the proposal and its corresponding exhibits which clarifies that the BSE's insider trading rules are designed to require members and associated persons to attempt to detect securities transactions which they reasonably believe may have involved the misuse of material, non-public information. In this regard, this letter amendment makes nine changes to the proposal and its exhibits. This letter amendment deleted the last sentence in paragraph 1 of Exhibit 4 which stated, ``This list shall be updated as associated persons leave or join the firm.'' It also added ``trade confirmations and'' after the word ``duplicate'' in the first sentence in Exhibit 4, paragraph 1a, and it changed the date in Exhibit 3, the Sample Membership Bulletin, from March 31, 1994 to April 30, 1994. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The BSE seeks to amend its rules to supplement the provisions of the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (``ITSFEA''). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to supplement section 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and the ITSFEA, by requiring every member organization of the Exchange to establish maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by such member and any person associated with the member. In addition, it requires that all members who are required to file SEC Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5 (``FOCUS Reports'') with the Exchange on an annual basis must submit with their FOCUS Reports a signed statement of compliance with this rule. Finally, it establishes minimum standards for compliance with the record-keeping requirements of this rule, and requires disclosure by members and associated persons to the Exchange's Surveillance Department of any securities transaction that the firm reasonably believes may have involved the misuse of material, non-public information. Supplementary Material .02 defines conduct that would constitute the misuse of material, non-public information, including, but not limited to, (1) trading in any securities, or in any related securities, options or other derivative securities of a corporation while in possession of material non-public information concerning that corporation; (2) trading in any underlying security or related options or other derivative securities concerning imminent transactions in the underlying security or related securities; and (3) disclosing to another person or entity information described in (1) or (2) above for the purpose of facilitating the misuse of such material, non-public information. The scope of the aforementioned definition is intended to be consistent with the goal of section 15(f) of the Act and ITSFEA to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information. This definition should be broad enough to encompass frontrunning, trading on the basis of material corporate inside information, tipping and misappropriating material corporate inside information.
