In view of the scope of the work on the modernization projects, it will be impossible to announce the future demands of the Army of the Czech Republic before the end of July, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said at a news conference yesterday. Priorities are already known, however. They are computer systems, communications, the unification of command, the modernization of T-72 and T-55 tanks, the modernization of the MiG-21 plane, the development of a light multipurpose plane, the L-159. Technical details have not been specified as yet. The minister strongly emphasizes the modernization of the Army's technical equipment because the costs linked to modernization amount to 25-30 percent of the costs for developing or buying new technology. According to Baudys, all top firms in the world that are engaged in transforming older military technology into modernized versions or are manufacturers of this equipment have shown an interest in cooperation. When asked about the possibility of cooperation with Israel, Baudys described Israel as a country that has exceptional combat experience and whose philosophy of building the army and weapon systems is very close to ours, but he adopted a cautious stance on relations with Russia. "As regards cooperation with Russia, we were offered the possibility of our claims being compensated by arms deliveries. But, the Army and its arsenal cannot become dependent on a country whose development can be very complicated. Weapons systems, which are acquired for decades, have to be bought in countries that provide a guarantee of economic and political stability," the minister said.
