Commenting on the situation on the Crimean peninsula, Grachev told journalists that although hazardous developments in the Crimea are Ukraine's internal affair, the situation on the peninsula is extremely complex and the political turmoil is becoming worse. At the same time, Grachev expressed the hope that the developments in the Crimea will not turn into major and serious conflicts. In Wunsdorf, the Russian defence minister will meet commanders of Russia Western troops and later in Berlin, will have talks with representatives of the Deutsche Bank to discuss financial aspects of the troops' withdrawal. Grachev attaches great importance to his talks with German financiers since this credit and financial organisation successfully cooperates with Russia in terms of financing the troops' withdrawal. According to Grachev, there are no problems in this respect. Besides, he intends to discuss with German bankers problems of the final stage of the troops pullout and outline prospects for further cooperation, including in the field of training Russian specialists who will work in structures of the Armed Forces in line of the banking business. On Tuesday, the Russian defence minister will fly to Brussels. On Tuesday evening he expected to make a report to NATO commanders and heads of defence departments of NATO member-states, outlining basic principles of the Russian military doctrine. On May 25, Grachev will have a series of bilateral talks with NATO defence ministers, and in particular, with the U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Grachev will take part in a joint session of defence ministers of NATO member-states to discuss problems of ensuring European security and prospects for NATO's cooperation with countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS in military and political fields. During the session Grachev is expected to outline Russia's stance on the Partnership for Peace Programme. "Russia has thoroughly prepared for this session," Grachev told journalists on Monday. He pointed out that Russia's position on the matter had been fully approved by President Boris Yeltsin and coordinated with the Russian Foreign Ministry. On board the plane carrying Grachev to Brussels there will be defence ministers of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia and Georgia who had been given an opportunity to fly to Brussels on board the Russian plane. During the flight to Wunsdorf Grachev had no contacts with his CIS counterparts and was reported to have been studying documents. However, it is not ruled out that he will have such contacts in Brussels. Upon completion of the NATO part of the programme, Grachev will begin an official two-day visit to Brussels on May 26 during which he will meet the Belgian defence minister and familiarize himself with every-day life of Belgian servicemen.
