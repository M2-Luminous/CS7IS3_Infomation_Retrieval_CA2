Before the talks, Kazimirov visited Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh with a new Russian peace initiative on the Karabakh conflict. Yesterday, our correspondent Islam Kuliyev asked Gasan Gasanov to explain this especially for Mayak Panorama listeners. [Begin recording] [Kuliyev] Gasan Azizovich, several days have passed since your talks with the Russian president's personal envoy, Vladimir Kazimirov, but unfortunately we have not yet received exhaustive information about the fate of the new peace initiative proposed by the Russian side. Could you please tell us about this in more detail? [Gasanov] In fact, what one means by the Russian initiative is an initiative on settling this conflict by peaceful political methods. In this respect we totally and fully support the Russian initiative and believe that Russia must, without fail, participate in this settlement process. The point is that in addition to this overall settlement process, Kazimirov also had the idea that a ceasefire should be concluded immediately. We gave our consent to Azerbaijan and Armenia urgently concluding a truce on a cease-fire. [sentence as heard] Azerbaijan was even willing not to place any terms on the cease-fire. However, the Armenian side set the condition that Nagorno-Karabakh should also sign this, as an equal partner. For Nagorno-Karabakh to sign as an equal partner would, in practice, have meant that they were, so to speak, a third party in this conflict even though they are not an equal third party. We very much regret the failure to persuade the Republic of Armenia to sign a cease-fire agreement with us. [Kuliyev] As you see it, is there a chance that they might agree to the Armenian community in Nagorno-Karabakh playing some part in this whole talks process? [Gasanov] That is precisely how we understand it, namely that Nagorno-Karabakh has two communities -- the Azerbaijani community and the Armenian. Of the 150,000 population living in Nagorno-Karabakh, 100,000 are Armenians and 50,000 are Azerbaijanis. The Republic of Armenia totally ignores the rights of the 50,000 Azerbaijanis of Nagorno-Karabakh. [Kuliyev] How do you see this conflict developing in the future? [Gasanov] I see only one path, the path of a peaceful political settlement. We need to sit down at the negotiation table and to talk and talk and talk and not to expect instant results from these talks. We reckon on them being long-term but successful talks. Moreover, of course, I do not rule out the possibility that when we do sit down at the negotiation table, the Armenians will realize that talking from their position of strength does not have the effect it used to. And and having realized that it is not as effective to speak from a position of strength as it used to be, they will probably behave more realistically at the negotiation table. [end recording]
