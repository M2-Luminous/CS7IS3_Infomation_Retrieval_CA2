The two latest "firework displays" took place in central Moscow, not far from IZVESTIYA. Both explosions occurred at night, which, according to the experts, rules out the possibility of an attempted killing. More than likely, specialists from the Main Internal Affairs Administration say, they were warnings or attempts to intimidate. At the Main Internal Affairs Administration press center information was extremely thin on the ground, as ever: The first explosion took place in the early hours of Saturday in the branch of the "Stolichnyy" bank that is being constructed at 22/2 Chekhov Street: An explosive device of an unknown type went off at 0245 hours. Three windows were shattered, but there no casualties. At 0125 hours on the next night, not far away, near 30/2 Tverskaya Street, a Mercedes 230 car exploded. The bomb, of an unknown type, probably homemade, exploded under the rear right wheel of the Mercedes and the car was turned over by the blast onto the car next to it. The privately registered 6-series Zhiguli was burned out as a result. All that is known about the owner of the Mercedes is that he is 30, he does not work anywhere, and he lives on Bolotnikovskaya Street in Moscow. According to the established practice, there will be a long search for the bombers, with special crime investigation centers being set up at the Moscow militia's 108th and 64th stations. For the time being Muscovites living in the center can only pray at night or go to their dachas for the weekend.
