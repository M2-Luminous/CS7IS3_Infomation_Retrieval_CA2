President Kim, visiting an unidentified ROK Air Force combat- fighter corps this morning, was briefed on the status of the corps. He said that "North Korea is in an extremely difficult situation which we can hardly imagine," and asked officers and men of the corps to assume a firm alert posture for an emergency. President Kim revealed that "North Korea has suspended the operation of many plants and closed them. Their number exceeds what we had estimated. Besides, electric power is supplied to farms only three hours a day. The voltage is so low that it is difficult to watch television. Many soldiers are ill-fed due to food shortages, and the unit composed of soldiers suffering undernourishment is being managed separately." President Kim also emphasized that "despite the shortage of food and oil, North Korea is staging Air Force exercises frequently and its flight training extended even to areas close to the armistice line. Peace on the Korean peninsula can be maintained only with our power, and if we fail to have it, peace can never be maintained." President Kim revealed that "about 15,000 North Korean loggers are working in Russia, and 100 of them sought political asylum at our embassy." Following his visit to this combat fighter corps, President Kim inspected a certain ROK Army division in the eastern front line and the headquarters of a certain naval fleet.
