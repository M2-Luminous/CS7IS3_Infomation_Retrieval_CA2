Therefore, several national dailies published the latest prognoses in today's issues. The daily NEPSZABADSAG summarizes the analyses of four public opinion research firms -- Szonda-Ipsos, Median, Modus, and the Hungarian Gallup Institute -- concerning the first (May 8) round of the general elections. According to the paper's summary, the number of Hungarian citizens planning to vote has increased recently: Two of the institutes expect a 70 percent turnout for the elections. All four surveys show that the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) retains first place in popularity so far. Three surveys place the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) in second, followed by the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz) and the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), vying for third with a equal number of points. The Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP) and the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) come next, with only a small difference in their popularity level. According to the polls, besides the above six, no other party is likely to reach the 5 percent limit -- the minimum for obtaining a mandate in Parliament. The last research of the Hungarian Gallup Institute was carried out between April 22 and 24, taking a nationwide sample of the over-eighteen electorate. On the basis of the answers they received, participation in the elections will approach or might even reach 70 percent. The analyses of the Gallup show only slight changes in the proportion of party adherents. According to the sample, general support for the MSZP has increased from 19 percent in March, to 20 percent currently; for the SZDSZ it has increased from 9 to 11; for the MDF, from 6 to 8; while for the Fidesz it has dropped from 10 to 9 percent. However, these results apply to the whole of the population, not only to those intending to cast their ballots. According to Gallup: 31 percent of the citizens who will vote and have already decided for a party, wish to cast their ballots for the MSZP; 16 percent will vote for the SZDSZ; 13 percent for the Fidesz; 12 percent for the MDF; 9 percent for the FKGP; and 7 percent for the KDNP.
