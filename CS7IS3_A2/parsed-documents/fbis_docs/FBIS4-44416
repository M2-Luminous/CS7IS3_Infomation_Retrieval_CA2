Plans to develop China's infrastructure and basic industries Infrastructure chiefly refers to transportation and telecommunications facilities. Basic industries generally refers to the energy and vital raw materials industries. In the past few years, the Chinese Government has given much attention to adjusting the industrial mix and speeding up construction of the infrastructure and basic industries. With the exception of the steel and nonferrous metals industries, where the pace has lagged behind a bit, the growth rate for infrastructure and investment in renewal of the transportation, posts and telecommunications, and energy industries has been as high as or higher than the growth rate of fixed capital investment throughout society for the same period. A group of large scale infrastructure and basic industry key projects has been established and put into production. The posts and telecommunications industry has developed the most rapidly. Over the past five years the growth rate for infrastructure construction and investment in technological transformation has averaged over 40 percent annually, and reached as high as 83 percent in 1992. Despite the great achievements attained in building the infrastructure and basic industries, it is far from what is required for national economic development. The elasticity coefficients (which is their growth rate compared to the growth rate of the domestic economy) of railway transportation, energy resources, and steel production have been quite low in recent years, and moreover are in a declining trend. Since 1992, with accelerated economic growth, the restrictive "bottle necks" of the infrastructure and basic industries have become increasingly prominent. At present, the transportation capabilities of principal railway lines are saturated, their goods transport volume capable of fulfilling only 60-70 percent of demand. Among these, such as the Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai lines can fulfill only about 40 percent. Most of the highways are of a low level and in poor condition, with frequent traffic jams. In the major coastal ports, the ratio of ships in operation to ships awaiting operation is more than 1:1.2. Energy tends to be in short supply, and in some areas, limits on electrical supplies and the occurrence of power outages are increasing. There is a strong demand for major production materials such as steel, with declining reserves and sharp price rises. Inadequate transport capacity and shortages of energy sources and raw materials has in some areas directly affected agricultural and industrial production and foreign trade and exports. It has also affected in differing degrees the confidence of potential foreign investors. In order to improve the investment environment, and guarantee the lasting, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy, the state's long term focus is accelerating building of the infrastructure in areas such as transportation, energy, and basic industries. According to documents provided by state industrial planning departments, during the period of the Eighth Five-year Plan, the developmental plans for transportation, telecommunications, energy, and important raw materials industries and projects arranged by the central government are, in outline: Railways: Build up the important trunk lines: the Beijing to Jiujiang line, the Baozhong line, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang multiple track line, the Houyue line, the Zhejiang to Jiangxi multiple track line, and the Nanning to Baise segment of the Nanning to Kunming line. Complete the project of expanding the capacity of the Wuchang to Guangzhou segment of the Beijing to Guangzhou line and the Daqing line supporting project. Speed up the second coal transportation channel from Shensuo to Huangye port, aiming for overall completion during the Ninth Five-year Plan. Plans call for construction of 6,600 km of new lines, 4,100 km of multiple lines, and 5,600 km of electrification replacement. Ports, highways: Accelerate building the first phase of the Huangye port coal wharf project, the fourth phase of the Qinhuangdao port coal wharf project, the eastern China and southern China coal transfer bases, and a group of container wharfs in Dalian, Tianjin, Beilun and Yantian. Accelerate construction of the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Jinan-Qingdao, Chengdu-Chongqing and Beijing-Shenzhen freeways and roads especially motor vehicles. The State plans to construct 5,400 km of new freeways and first and second class roads especially for motor vehicles, and build 90,000 km of new roads. Telecommunications: Construct inter-provincial and regional optical fiber communications cables between Xian-Chengdu, Beijing-Shenyang-Haerbin, and Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou. Plans are to increase the nation's telephone switchboard capacity to 18 million. Coal: Stress construction of large scale coal mines in Shenfu, Zhungeer, Yimin, Yunji, Lianhuai, etc. Make a major effort to remake old mines in eastern China, and continue to encourage development of local mines. Plans call for raw coal output to increase to 1.25 billion tons in 1995. Electric power: Stress construction of such power plants as Shanxi Baoji, Henan Qinbei and Sanxi Yangcheng, etc., speed up progress of building hydropower station in Ertan, Yantan, Tianshenqiao, Shuikou, Manwan, Lijiaxia and Wuqiangxi, etc. Complete preparations for the primary stages of the Three Gorges Project. Meanwhile, vigorously develop nuclear power. The state plans to add 64 million KW of power generators throughout China. Electric energy production by 1995 will be increased to 920 billion KW hour. Petroleum: Continue prospecting and exploiting oil fields in eastern China, and stabilize current output. Try to increase prospecting for oil reserves in western China, and vigorously exploit natural gas and oil and gas fields offshore. Study, develop, and apply energy saving technology. It is planned that in 1995, crude oil output will reach about 150 million tons. Steel: Stress improving quality of products, and increasing products which are in shortage. Try to increase substantially the proportion of continuous casting and sheet and tube materials. Plans call for an output of steel to increase to 88 million tons in 1995. The fixed asset investment scale for the whole of society during the Eighth Five-year Plan is 3,400 billion yuan (calculated according to the fixed price for 1990, the same below). Of this, the plan for state-owned units calls for 1,870 billion yuan in infrastructure construction and renewal investment. According to the state plan and current developmental trends, investment in infrastructure, basic industries and renewal will be about 900 to 1000 billion yuan during the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. It has already achieved 335 billion yuan in 1991 and 1992, so the investment in 1993 and 1994 would be about 200 billion yuan per year. II. Huge potential for foreign investment in infrastructure Investment in construction of the infrastructure and basic industries is on a large scale, and has long term returns. It used to be state investment for the most part, but since the implementation of opening and reform, localities, departments, and enterprises are increasingly gaining the right to control their own economic activities, while the market system's role in economic growth and resource allocation is becoming increasingly obvious. In recent years, society's fixed asset investment has tended to be multi-channel, and so has investment in infrastructure and basic industries. At present, the major investment sources are: 1. State budgeted domestic capital and capital for construction of special projects. By this is meant the state budget, local finances, allocations from departments in charge and from the national specialized investment corporations or basic construction loans extended to construction units by entrusted banks, funds allocated to enterprise units for replacement, and special construction funds collected by railway, highway, and energy departments at a certain rate. In 1990, state budgeted investment dropped to 40 percent in railway and coal departments, while it was about 10 percent in transport, post and telecommunications, petroleum, and electric power departments, and in steel industry departments, it dropped below 7 percent. 2. Domestic loans. These are loans allocated from banks' own capital or deposits taken in from enterprises and institutes, loans arranged as capital for localities' special projects, key enterprise bonds and construction bonds, etc., that a bank issues when acting as the agent of the State specialized investment corporation. In 1990, bank loan investment in the posts and telecommunications, civil aviation, and steel sectors constituted only 40 to 50 percent of their infrastructure and renewal investment, while in other sectors, bank loans for the infrastructure was about 20 percent. 3. Self-collected capital. With the relaxing of prices, some infrastructure sectors such as highways, railways, posts and telecommunications, civil aviation, electricity, steel, etc., have improved their economic efficiency and strengthened self-renewal and self-development abilities. Their self-collected capital has been increasingly rising. In such sectors as railways and electric power, self-collected capital has constituted more than 30 percent of the investment in infrastructure and renewal. 4. Exploitation of foreign capital. This includes foreign loans, invested capital from foreign investment enterprises, donations from overseas, etc. At the outset of reform and opening, foreign capital imported for construction of infrastructure and basic industries consisted chiefly of loans from foreign governments and international financial organizations. Direct foreign investment was very cautious, limited only to cooperative prospecting and exploitation of offshore oil and gas fields. In the middle and late eighties, the government began to encourage foreign investments in some energy projects and in freeway, port and wharf construction. Some coastline provinces and cities made a series of agreements on a group of joint venture projects for constructing electric power mill, highways and railways. Guangdong's Pingnan Railway was the first joint venture joint stock railway enterprise. Shenzhen's airport and port were both built with foreign capital. The key national mainland-Hong Kong joint venture construction project, the Guangdong Dayawan Power Station has gone into connection and started production. By the end of 1992, there were 28 electrical power stations with foreign investment, with a total capacity of 7.87 million KW. Six coastline oil fields have gone into production, with a yearly output of more than 3 million tons. Hainan is also leasing 30 square km of land in Yanggugao to the Japanese Xiongguzu [phonetic] (Hong Kong) Company, Ltd., for 70 years, for developments which will encompass wharf, road, and power station construction through the province. Statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation show that since 1989, all figures and amount of money involved in agreements on use of foreign capital increases in differing degrees in the petroleum, coal, and transportation sectors. The rapid rise in the use of foreign capital in the infrastructure and basic industry demonstrates that foreign businesspersons have complete confidence in China's economic development and the future of value addition in the infrastructure sector. However, infrastructure and basic industry do not constitute a large share of total amount of foreign capital utilized to date. The major existing problems on China's part are: insufficient experience; we still have not followed up with some relevant laws, regulations, and supporting management measures; and foreign business persons still have misgivings about committing long term investment on the Chinese mainland. In recent years, the major developed nations in the West have suffered from a continuously slumping economy, their industrial mix is facing readjustment, and must find a market for their massive capital and investment-type goods. China's infrastructure construction is no doubt a potential market, so has a definite attraction for foreign capital. We should maintain stability in our economy, politics, and society, enlarge our measures for opening to the outside, readjust our relevant policies, attract more investment, and speed up development of the infrastructure. III. Relevant encouraging policies and measures The Chinese Government will in the future adopt the following policies and measures to speed up construction of the infrastructure: First, while controlling the scale of fixed asset investment in society, increase the rate of investment in infrastructure construction. In the last three years of the Eighth Five-year Plan, the state will strictly control general projects of the processing industries and will possibly increase investment in key construction projects in transportation, telecommunications, and energy. In the central government's investment in 1993, 70.6 percent went into construction in transportation, telecommunications, energy and the raw materials industry, an increase of 5.9 percent over the year before. Second, speed up price reforms in energy and transportation, to strengthen the ability of the infrastructure and basic industry sectors to raise their own funds. The State will gradually raise the level of shipping fees collected by railways and ports, bringing them near or up to the level of cost plus average profits. As soon as possible, merge the plan prices and market prices in the crude oil and electric power sectors. Change the state's unified price fixed in basic industry sectors to differing levels of price-setting control, giving localities a certain amount of leeway in their price setting rights. Let localities set prices for transport and shipping facilities which they operate. Third, using the market operations system, encourage localities, departments, and enterprises to invest in infrastructure construction. With a uniform national plan and uniform technical standards for highway construction, localities will be permitted to build their individual sections. In joint venture infrastructure projects, the central government, localities, and enterprises will operate on the principle of "sharing profits and risk" and "the investors will take the profits." Fourth, appropriately enhance the level of collections in special construction funds or attached fees in railways, highways, shipping, and civil aviation, etc., and add special construction funds for coal, electricity, and oil, etc., as well as implementing intensive management of construction funds collected, charging by use, with rolling development. Fifth, expand the scale of medium and long term bank loans for construction in transportation and energy. Authorize fiscal rights for some large-scale transportation enterprises and enterprise groups. As appropriate, issue more construction bonds. With the establishment of a system of social insurance, bank deposits of all types will grow steadily. The state should attempt to apply these sums of capital to profitable key construction projects. Sixth, enthusiastically absorb and exploit foreign capital. In April 1991, the National Congress passed the "Tax Laws for Profits of Foreign Capital Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises." In June 1991 the State Council issued detailed implementation regulations and other state laws and legal regulations. These stipulate that foreign commercial interests can obtain favorable treatment if they invest in the infrastructure and basic industries, as follows: Foreign commercial investment in urban energy, transportation, and port construction in older cities in coastal economic development zones, special economic zones, or economic and technological development zones. Foreign commercial investors in the airport, port, railway, highway, and electrical power stations in the Shanghai Pudong New District will be charged at a 15 percent tax rate on their enterprises' profits. Joint venture enterprises engaged in port and wharf construction, and foreign enterprises investing in such infrastructure facilities as airports, ports, wharves, railways, highways, electric stations, coal mines, and hydropower, etc., in the Hainan Special Zone, and which have been in operation for more than 15 years', can receive tax relief after making application and with the approval by local tax organs. This will be relief from the first five years' taxes starting with the first year in which the enterprise earns a profit; then, the enterprises will pay only one-half of the taxes on their profits for the sixth to tenth years. Give relief to customs duty and united industrial and commercial tax for importing machines, equipments and raw materials used for developing energy, railway, highway, port, etc. of fundamental construction by means of using foreign capital. The fourth session of inviting tenders for oil drilling off the East China coast lasted one year, and was very successful. The areas contracted for and agreed to occupy 55 percent of the total area for which tenders were invited. The initial risk investment in the prospecting stage for foreign partners is estimated at more than US$240 million. The biggest joint venture project in the Shenzhen SEZ is the Hong Kong Heji Huangpu Ltd. Corporation's construction and operation of the Yantian International container wharf. The contract was signed during a ceremony on 5 October 1992 in Beijing. This project has a term of cooperation of 50 years, with registered capital of HK$1.2 billion. The estimated total investment on the project will be over RMB5 billion yuan. Based on what is needed to speed up development of the national economy and perfect the industrial mix, during the Eighth and Ninth Five-year Plans, China will continue to expand the scale of its importation and use of foreign capital in construction of the infrastructure and basic industries. Major measures currently pending or in operation are: First, foreign business will be allowed to contract for construction of railways, highways, ports, airport lounges, electric power stations, etc. In keeping with international practice, after a project is completed, it will be managed and operated by foreign businesses for about 15 years, while the Chinese side collects taxes from it. When the tern of a contract has expired, the entire project will revert to the Chinese side. Second, in order to encourage foreign business investment in building the infrastructure, other investment areas related to projects will be opened up for foreign business investors. For example, those who invest in highway and railway construction may operate highway and railway lines, and engage in retailing, real estate, and advertising along railways or highways. Foreign business persons who invest in port construction will be permitted to operate as transport and shipping agents, commodity agents, etc. Third, 12 open regions, including the Talimu basin, will invite prospecting and exploitation by foreign oil companies. It is reported that there is as much as 8.2 billion tons in oil reserves in these 12 regions, and as much as 250 million cubic meters in natural gas reserves. So far, 68 enterprises from 17 countries, including 24 U.S. enterprises, have shown interest in investing in exploitation of the Talimu basin oil field. Fourth, the steel industry plans to implement a joint stock system in some key enterprises through the issuance of B-type stocks overseas, or improve the level of incentives to attract even more foreign capital in the form of foreign governmental loans, export loans, etc., to launch enterprise technology renewal. Some joint venture projects that fall in the category of important raw materials, and that import advanced technology will be permitted to market their products chiefly in the domestic market. Accelerated construction of the infrastructure and basic industries will definitely result in greatly increased imports of related technology, equipment, and materials. China's market will open with further reform of the foreign trade and commerce system, as we try to get closer to the international regulations for managing import and export trade and importing foreign capital. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has made public a list of 210 large and important technical projects that China will import between 1993 and 2000, with a gross value of close to US$30 billion. Of these, 102 projects are in energy, transportation, civil aviation, or posts and telecommunications. The forecast is that, in the future, overseas investors will have more cooperation and trade opportunities in these areas.
