Nino Vieira revoked the decree providing for the elections to be held on 27 March. In a communique issued by the presidency of the Council of State, the Guinean president says that his decision to postpone the elections again is linked to the note from the National Election Commission which states that it is not technically possible to hold the elections. Fernando Pereira reports from Guinea-Bissau. [Pereira] At this rate, Guinea-Bissau will enter the Guinness Book of Records as the African country with the longest transition process to democracy. In effect, the process started in 1991, and this is the third time that the pluralist elections have been postponed. This measure has not come as a surprise. Since last month, it has been known that it was practically impossible to hold elections on the set date, 27 March. The delay in the registration process, the main electoral task, is one of the reasons for the postponenent. Another reason, given recently, was the inadequate functioning of the regional election commissions and irregularities in the selection of candidates for drawing up the electoral lists. Finally, this latest postponment has much to do with the serious economic crisis in the country, which could be further aggravated by this postponement.
