Out of 275 deputies, four abstained, 179 voted for, and 92 voted against investigating Mitsotakis' responsibility, while six deputies abstained, 164 voted for, and 106 voted against investigating Bakoyianni's responsibility. The Chamber of Deputies had earlier rejected a proposal submitted by New Democracy [ND] deputies to hold a joint debate on the phone-tapping issue involving Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou during 1985-1989. The rejection of the proposal caused the postponement of the relevant prosecution to be lifted. PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], KKE [Greek Communist Party], and Political Spring supported the formation of an investigative committee. Political Spring voted against an investigation into Bakoyianni's responsibilities in the phone-tapping scandal. Addressing the Chamber of Deputies, Mitsotakis and Bakoyianni denied all charges. Mitsotakis said that the man who revealed the issue, Khristos Mavrikis, was paid to implicate him and his daughter. He stressed that although he challenged Papandreou to accept a joint investigation of the 1985-1989 phone tappings, the entire issue should be dropped. Discussing Mavrikis, Bakoyianni said that contrary to Mavrikis' allegations, she did not own the house on Arvaniou Street during the disputed period. Eleven ND deputies, nine PASOK deputies, two KKE deputies, and one Political Spring deputy did not attend yesterday's Chamber of Deputies session.
