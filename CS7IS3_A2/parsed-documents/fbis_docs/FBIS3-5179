He said the Government had also issued an order specifying steps and regulations in granting bail to foreigners who illegally enter Thailand to work in the fishing industry. The amount of bail has been reduced from 50,000 baht to 5,000 baht. A number of Burmese have been hired to work in fishing industry, mining and construction. But most of them are illegal immigrants. Mr Soemsak's remarks were made during the opening of a two-day seminar called "Problems and Ways to Solve the Labour Problem and Development in the Five Southernmost Provinces." The seminar ends today. The seminar, attended by state and private officials at a meeting room of Yala Rama Hotel in Muang District, aims to find solutions to labour problems in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, Songkhla, and Satun. The deputy labour minister said the Government and other state agencies concerned would try to upgrade the skills of Thai workers so that they could gain higher income.
