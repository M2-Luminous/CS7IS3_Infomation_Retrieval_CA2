It is composed of all parties -- only the Radicals did not join owing to some reason of theirs, but I do not wish to elaborate -- however, regardless of the parties in question, and judging by the individuals, I believe that the government is quite a good one and that the people and the parliament will very soon be able to assess the work of this government. Personally, I think that it [the government] will be a good one. [Mikelic] I think that we are now a entering a phase in the peace process that has been signed, and that means that we need to make this connection selectively, from people who are going from their positions toward production [sentence as heard]. On the other hand, we must see which companies we will tackle first, in individual municipalities where they have a perspective; at the same time we need to stop certain declines, particularly in areas where state-owned property suffered significant damage [sentence as heard]. I am extremely glad that this program was given general support today. I am also glad that the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS], and its president, Milan Babic, have managed to rise above the parliamentary coalition that used to exist in the assembly, and that he [Babic] has now truly placed the national interest of the Serbian people at the forefront. I am glad that he came alone to this post of foreign minister. The remaining ministers will surely be capable of shouldering the burden I mentioned earlier in my address.
