The withdrawal was on the instructions of the Transitional Executive Council, NPKF spokesman Col Connie van Rensburg said on Monday, and would be completed by Saturday May 14. "Once all the troops are regrouped at the De Brugge base, retraining will start and will continue until the future of the force is decided upon by the government of national unity," said Col van Rensburg. The NPKF, made up of former liberation army guerrillas, SADF [South African Defense Force] and homeland defence force troops, and members of the SA Police, has been dogged by controversy since its inception. This included reports of drunkenness, mutinous behaviour, and poor training, culminating in the force's inability to keep the peace in war-torn East Rand townships.
