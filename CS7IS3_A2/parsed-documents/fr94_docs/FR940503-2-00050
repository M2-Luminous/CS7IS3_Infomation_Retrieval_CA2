Take notice that on April 12, 1994, Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), P.O. Box 683, Houston, Texas 77001, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;352&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon a transportation service for Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, a Division of Tenneco Inc., which was authorized in Docket No. CP83&hyph;197&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Columbia Gulf proposes to abandon transportation service performed under a gas transportation agreement dated January 10, 1983, as amended, and pursuant to Columbia Gulf's Rate Schedule X&hyph;86. Columbia Gulf states that it has been transporting up to 12,000 Dekatherms of natural gas per day from South Marsh Island Block 99, Offshore Louisiana, to the interconnection of its line and the Blue Water System in South Marsh Island Block 74. It is stated that the transportation is subject to a monthly demand charge. Columbia Gulf explains that by letter dated December 8, 1993, Tennessee requested conversion of the transportation service to Part 284 service, and the parties executed an Order No. 636, FTS&hyph;2 Transportation Service Agreement effective February 1, 1994, providing for the conversion of Part 157 service to service provided under part 284. Columbia Gulf requests an effective date for the abandonment of January 31, 1994, in order that service under part 284 may commence on February 1, 1994. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before May 17, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Columbia Gulf to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
