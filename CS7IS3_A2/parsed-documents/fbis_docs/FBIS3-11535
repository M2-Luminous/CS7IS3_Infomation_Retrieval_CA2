According to Scavone, Paraguay upholds that negotiations should be conducted through economic blocs. Scavone thus responded to reports from Argentina -- one of the Mercosur members along with Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay -- stating that it is allegedly negotiating its entrance into NAFTA. Asked what will be done if it is confirmed that Argentina is negotiating its entrance into NAFTA at the bilateral level, Scavone said something will be done in this regard and Paraguay may submit a claim within Mercosur. Argentina's alleged request to enter NAFTA was one of the mandatory issues discussed by those who attended the lecture David Rockefeller gave on 21 March at the Business Administration School (EDAN). In this regard, Rockefeller said Chile is "at the top of the list" but Argentina may be a firm candidate in view of "impressive changes" implemented in the last few years. Scavone stated that the integration theory presupposes the achievement of a series of agreements on several issues. He said: "It was fairly easy to achieve the elimination of customs tariffs. But issues such as the establishment of a single customs tariff demand the simultaneous compatibility of macroeconomic policies. This is what Dr. Rockefeller said." Rockefeller said the socioeconomic development of each individual country also guarantees the success of any economic bloc.
