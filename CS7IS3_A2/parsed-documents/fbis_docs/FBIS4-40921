During the visit the Russian minister expects to meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Kozyrev will discuss with the NATO leadership the questions of signing a NATO frame document for the Partnership for Peace and a Moscow-proposed programme of strategic cooperation between Russia and NATO. The latter document would determine the main documents of Russia-NATO cooperation with regard to the role and weight of Moscow in world affairs. We believe, noted the Russian minister, that it is necessary to sign both documents simultaneously and will be ready to do it depending on how soon the entire required preparatory work will be completed in NATO headquarters. Kozyrev said that he could not give the precise date of his visit to Brussels since this question has to be agreed with all the parties concerned.
