However, Janusz Bryczkowski, at whose invitation Zhirinovskiy came to Poland, said that these people are politicians and businessmen of the new, rising generation and not of the current political setup. During the news conference, Zhirinovskiy devoted much attention to "Pan-Slavonic economic solidarity, in which Poland and Russia can play an important role." In his opinion, bank guarantees are needed for trade between the two countries. "We can give preferential treatment to Polish construction companies, including the construction of highways, among other things," he said. He announced that talks with Moscow banks would be held to discuss this matter. He did not exclude the possibility of his own company participating in this undertaking. Asked for comment on Prime Minister Pawlak's visit to Moscow, Zhirinovskiy said that politics runs along two separate tracks. "If what is worked out by Poland and Russia turns out to be good, we will accept it. We are not going to reject good solutions," he said.
