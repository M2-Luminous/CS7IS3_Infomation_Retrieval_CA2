I know, as do you, that every article or every literary work has three components: Real life, man's ability to embrace it spiritually, and a little bit of imagination. These three components constitute some material -- a book, an article or a report. I would like us to center our talk today around the issue which has been taking place in front of us and also around those issues which are of interest to you. You are welcome. [Unidentified conference mediator] Ukrainian television. You are welcome. [Ukrainian television correspondent] Mr. Supreme Commander, President of Ukraine, esteemed Leonid Makarovych. We proceed from the principle of reasonable sufficiency in building the Armed Forces of the independent Ukrainian state. Today we saw quite serious exercises. Could you assess these exercises from the point of view of today and from the point of view of building our state in future? Thank you. [Kravchuk] Of course, the building, creation, the restructuring of the armed forces of Ukraine.... [pauses] We have completed the stage of restructuring the armed forces and now we have to adapt them to realities which exist, to our internal and external problems. And the main task of the Armed Forces is to defend the state, to ensure peaceful work of the people. This is a priority. And, of course, we have satisfied ourselves that we have gone through those stages, we have gone through them peacefully, without conflicts and today we have armed forces which are capable, I emphasize this, of ensuring the tasks they are facing. This does not mean in the least that we have no problems. There are problems of logistical support, military training, the future of our armed forces, equipping them, their prospects for the future, and so on. But there is only one conclusion: The Armed Forces do exist and today the officers, generals, and soldiers demonstrated their ability to fulfill the most complicated tasks. And I am satisfied with the fact that everything was taking place synchronously, according to plan; there have been no emergencies, as they say, and we are satisfied that these exercises have taken place. They were necessary. Strictly speaking, these were the first exercises since our Ukrainian Armed Forces have been in existence. And people must undergo training so as to be able to defend their state and their people. [Mediator] (?Halychyna Film), please. [(?Halychyna Film) correspondent] Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Commander-in-Chief, this is the question of interest to us: What was the army you dreamt about and how are these plans being put into practice? [Kravchuk] First and foremost, we have been dreaming about the army which any nation and any state can dream of if it set a goal and this goal is concentrated not only in the people's wish, which is quite understandable, but in the conceptual principles of our enactments. We have a military doctrine, a concept, we have enactments on the organization and formation of the Armed Forces, and those Armed Forces which we have today comply with the principles which were approved by the Supreme Council and by the president's decree and which meet our possibilities. We must have armed forces for peaceful work. Neither in our doctrine nor in our concept are we setting or have been setting any tasks whatsoever as far as, for example, any aggressive aspirations or other such tasks before our Armed Forces. The only tasks are to defend people's peaceful work, build an independent state and ensure the fulfillment of these most important priority tasks. [Mediator] UKRINFORM's Demydenko, please. [UKRINFORM correspondent Demydenko] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, by now the people of Ukraine have grown accustomed to seeing you in your capacity as the president and to the actions you take as those of the president. Today, you acted as commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. How did it feel? What were you thinking about? [Kravchuk] (?Since) I only took part in the exercise, I believe it was primarily the commander who had the greatest degree of responsibility. It was the commander of the Subcarpathian military district, Colonel-General (Bobkov), and our defense minister, Army General Radetskyy, and all those in the military who supported, planned, drew maps, and marched every inch of that ground in order for everything to take place as planned. This was their supreme responsibility. When I came here, my aim was to see what we had done in these years to build our own Armed Forces. I can say without exaggeration that a lot has been done and not only with regard to form but also content. Today you heard and saw before your very eyes how this action took place. You heard the Ukrainian state language. You saw the Ukrainian insignia. You finally saw the substance and spiritual structure of our soldiers, officers, generals, and commanders of all ranks. This is what is most important. A new state is in the making and its own Armed Forces are following a parallel course with its difficulties and complexities. Hoping, however, that maybe the time will come when this... [pauses] or it was easy for someone, is unrealistic. [sentence as heard] [Mediator] Please. [KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent Yuriy Kvit] Leonid Makarovych, please forgive me (?in advance) if the nature of my question is not quite appropriate in the current atmosphere. I believe, however, the people of Ukraine will ask and be concerned about these questions. Do you know that this event of ours cost (?the Defense Ministry) a great deal. Preliminary estimates show it was somewhere in the region of over 40 billion karbovantsi. Do you know that the period (?of preparation), that as far as I know was protracted, when the training ground, understandably, was being made quite ready for this event, cost very much too. Barracks repair and other work was done. In short, forgive me, an awful lot was spent (?in our time of poverty). At the same time, the military district's catering service alone owes around 200 billion karbovantsi for food (?allocated to) the district, and many of the district's servicemen have not been paid for March yet. So do you think this great expenditure was worth what we hoped for and what we saw today? Is there a ratio, a balance in it? [Kravchuk] Well, all of you may know this saying and know to whom it belongs: He who does not want to feed his own army, will feed someone else's tomorrow. I would like to say this: If there are armed forces which cost a state a great deal of money indeed -- be it even not the amounts that you cited; and although I do not know these figures they can gernerally be specified with regard to the whole of Ukraine's Armed Forces -- if these armed forces do not train, they are useless altogether. Following your logic, then, we would have to disarm altogether and, generally, include a some armed forces in, shall we say, the formations that would not even cost 40 billion karbovantsi but a little bit less and generally delete the protection of the state from our agenda altogether, simply delete it. The thing is, I know that with regard to this -- and not only with regard to this -- no sooner is something more or less large-scale begun, than someone starts to talk about how much it costs and whether it would not be better in our difficult situation, let us say, to pay wages with these funds. It is logical. But today you pay wages to the people of an independent state and without the Armed Forces, tomorrow other states will come and have these people, currently working for an independent state, work for another state. No one will then calculate this expenditure. It will then be a quite different situation. I am not saying that people's life today is good. Nor am I saying they are able to maintain a large army. But should the question be raised of today's difficulties and should nothing be done and should everything be reduced to only the minimum, shall we say, for the people somehow just to survive and, shall we say, have more on the table today -- to put it conventionally, 150 grams of meat rather than 100 grams -- there may not even be this tomorrow. In other words, I would not like to reduce everything in this case to a specific exercise. There is strategy and there are tactics. If we have our Armed Forces and have our army, they either have to train and be ready to protect us or they should not be there at all. If you proceed from this, you will think quite differently. It is exactly the way I think, because the Armed Forces cost us trillions rather than billions. So why should we spend those trillions if we know that those armed forces will be unable to protect the state. And if they are to protect us, they have to know how to do this. [Mediator] Oksana Telentsiy, HOLOS UKRAYINY. [HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Telentsiy] Esteemed Mr. President, I happened to hear today that the excellent machinery that we can see [words indistinct]. (?What is) the future of our military industrial complex in Ukraine under conditions of the acute economic crisis? Thank you. [Kravchuk] The machinery that was moving in this beautiful area of our land in most cases is manufactured here in Ukraine, in most cases. They are tanks, self-propelled and other systems. Of course, they are assembled from parts that we either buy or receive from other states of the former Soviet Union. We can, however, make them ourselves. We have marvellous opportunities to build cargo aviation. True, we have difficulties, shall we say, with manufacturing high- speed aviation, fighter and other aircraft. But to say that this is the remainder of [USSR] luxury is maybe too early. We have an appropriate program for the military industrial complex to develop. The development of weaponry of our own has good prospects. We have appropriate scientific laboratories, institutes, forces, and key personnel who are at work and quite seriously at work too. But a predicament is a predicament. I absolutely agree with you that we today cannot ensure this is the way we would like it to be done; true, we cannot do it. [Mediator] REUTER, please. [REUTER correspondent] Mr. President, (?you will agree that) until recently, the parliament of Ukraine could not determine its position on the START I Treaty. (?As interpreted) in particular by Russia, Ukraine was blocking the Russo-American START II treaty. How do you see the situation now? Is Ukraine still (?obstructing it) or not? And the second question is this: Do you forecast any problems of the kind you had with parliament with regard to nuclear weapons for Boris Yeltsin with his parliament [words indistinct] the START II Treaty which [words indistinct] provides for a large reduction in nuclear weapons? Thank you. [Kravchuk] Well, START II in this case has no direct bearing on Ukraine. Having signed the trilateral agreement in Moscow and accords following it, we -- our parliament -- have determined our attitude towards Ukraine's position expressly and clearly. The latter now is a problem that goes beyond our state's boundaries. As a state, however, that had nuclear weapons, on whose territory there were nuclear weapons, who set itself the task of their elimination and which determined its position on this expressly and clearly, of course Ukraine will accordingly stimulate other states' actions and policies so that the world's nuclear weapons are destroyed altogether. This is our position which we shall uphold. As a member of the United Nations Organization and a member state of appropriate European structures; we shall do everything to achieve this end and shall not obstruct it because this is our position of principle. [Mediator] MOLOD UKRAYINY, please. [MOLOD UKRAYINY correspondent (?Volodymyr) Brazan] [Words indistinct] the Ukrainian (?army's high morale). But are you, Mr President, not (?concerned) about another question? When settling the Crimean issue, for example, and you having to use force, will our state be able to rely on the Russian-speaking Ukrainian Army? [Kravchuk] To begin with, I do not know what Russian-speaking means. We have Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Hungarian, and other people populating Ukraine. It is multinational. What language a person communicates in does not determine, shall we say, their spiritual essence and their position. That is why, this thesis of the Russian-speaking population should be withdrawn as groundless philosophically, historically, or otherwise. It was invented by someone and it seems to me it was invented by politicians in Russia in order to protect, as it were, the so-called Russian-speaking population. What this is, I do not know. There is no such notion. There is nationality rather than language. So, firstly, I do not want to make a division thus. Secondly, I believe and hope that we shall not have to use our armed forces in Crimea. At any rate, we shall never take the initiative. We hope we shall settle this issue peacefully; shall settle it by way of negotiations, including with those states -- or primarily Russia -- which have certain interests there. I do not want any thoughts to remain incomplete. One thing is clear to me: that Russian mentality, the Russian elite, both political -- and not only political but the literary and spiritual as well -- will never put up with the fact that Crimea does not belong to Russia; never. And the policy will be shaped correspondingly. However, to put up with this, that is to say, to bear this in one's heart and to have the forms of action are quite different things. I believe that there will be enough common sense, in any case, that high-ranking politicians will have enough common sense, and it is they who determine policy today, but not those political forces and trends which exist today here and there and everywhere. This is the first thing. Secondly. I understand, for example, the policy immediately related to Crimea and inside Crimea. Well, Crimea's drifting can be either speedy or evolutionary, but the drifting... [pauses] in view of the fact that the Russian population is the majority and that there is interest in Russia, this... [pauses] No matter what happens to Crimea, whether it becomes an oblast or a republic -- they believe if it were an oblast it would be easier to cope with problems and if it were a republic it would be more difficult. All these are illusions. The drifting results from the very composition and the fear -- the fear, I underline this -- that the Ukrainian state, having embarked on so-called nationalist course, will, so to say, lead to the elimination of Russian spirituality, Russian spirit, traditions and culture in Crimea. But how to do this? For example, to set a course now so that this would be done from inside Crimea. They say that some actions will be carried out there so that Crimea will be further alienating itself from Ukraine and approaching its statehood, as the first step, so as to conceal the genuine objectives, and then, when there is a possibility to conclude treaties, the treaty on accession to Russia will be concluded. This is the policy of Crimea itself. What is Ukraine's policy? Ukraine is conducting the following policy: To vest the broadest, the greatest possible economic and other socioeconomic plenary powers in Crimea, the rights to tackle all the socioeconomic problems facing Crimea using the possibilities of this region, its resources and specific features. The broadest possible rights. And this is already a fact of life that we have agreed to this. This refers both to the budget and other things. But we are saying sincerely and frankly that we shall never conduct any negotiations with anyone as regards the political status and territorial integrity of our Ukraine, for example, and as regards Crimea. [Kravchuk continues] What is the current situation in the world? I would like you to understand this, that the situation in the world now is in Ukraine's favor. That both the European states and the United States of America officially underlined that they respect and that they will support everywhere Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and inviolability of its borders. Believe me, this is extremely significant. Way back when the former parliament of Russia took a decision on the status of Sevastopol you probably felt that the Security Council responded instantly. That is to say, it is impossible to tackle issues in Crimea today without taking into account Ukraine's weight, its role and the prestige it gained, both political and otherwise, and its potentials. One cannot tackle these issues, I repeat this, without taking this into account. This exactly is what we proceed from. In other words, we shall strive for mutual interaction with all forces. We would like to take into account the interests, I emphasize this, in this region and the interests of Russia. Our attitude toward policy is realistic and we do not want, let us say, to think that this is the matter of concern for one state only. At present the interests of many are interlaced there. We would like to take this into account and we shall propose how to do this. However, to raise questions about any political changes, about territorial or any other changes, this will never be allowed to happen -- never. I would like everyone to be aware of this. Territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence are the bounds for policy, the bounds beyond which no one will make any steps. The one who will make them has no right to respect himself and he cannot be considered to be a politician. Everyone must be aware of this. And we shall never allow anyone to go beyond these bounds. We ourselves do not pass them and we shall not allow anyone to do this. We shall be defending these bounds. [Mediator] Mykhaylo Soroka, URYADOVYY KURYER. [URYADOVYY KURYER correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, [words indistinct] prior to your visit this morning to the Lvov region, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry had departed from Kiev. What are the main results of his visit to Ukraine that you could emphasize, and will the Ukrainian-American dialogue continue? [Kravchuk] Well, to begin with, Secretary Perry came on the instruction of United States of America President Clinton, to fulfill the accords signed by us in Washington. I can say that the negotiations held were interesting, constructive, and fruitful. Not only were all the Washington ideas were realized in Kiev, but also something in addition to them. We agreed and signed documents on increasing servicemen's housing construction funds and social security, which will become a reality in the very near future and will be done. More money was given to conversion and other purposes relating to the elimination of our nuclear weapons. We placed the main emphasis, however, on how the officers and servicemen who serve in the army, will be provided for socially at present. Secondly, the delegation's composition was rather wide-ranging. There were, you see, rocket technology specialists there and there were negotiations in connection with possible civilian use of our rocket technology. There were conversion specialists and professionals who will immediately deal with the verification of nuclear weapons elimination. This was a representative delegation dealing with everything ranging from the armed forces to space. On each of these issues, we made an important step forward. [Mediator] Another question please. [UNIAN correspondent Volodymyr Ivakhnenko] It has become known from unofficial information that the Russian side has refused to form a commission which would begin an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet jointly with the Ukrainian side. What is your vision of a settlement to the Black Sea Fleet issue on the eve of another round of talks with Russia? [Kravchuk] I can say that to date there is Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's instruction to form such a commission for it to start working. There are problems. I have no precise information about who it was who refused. The only thing that I do know is that there is no other decision by the head of the Russian Government. So if there are any problems, I hope they will be resolved. If this was not done on 15 March it can be done on 10 April. One cannot, however, say that this issue was struck out from the agenda altogether. [Mediator] Your question please. [UkrKinoKhronika studio correspondent, name indistinct] I have a question for Mr. Radetskyy. Do you find today's exercises successful and do you think it worthwhile for the Ukrainian artillerymen to have shelled a church at the firing range given that the issue of religion is so complex now in Ukraine? [Radetskyy] Firstly, yes, the exercises that were held today, indeed, were expedient. This should be done. The president as the commander-in-chief has already stated this to you today. Secondly, no artillery, by the way, shelled the church because, all precautions taken, artillery fires shells from the flanks rather than over the heads of the forces on the offensive. Thirdly, we known very well the remarkable history of this firing range. I know Mala Vishenka and Velyka Vishenka (?which used to be there). Today, incidentally, we jointly with the Lviv region administration dealt with this problem. So I think everything is normal and natural and what had been planned was fulfilled under the plan. I do not understand your question: What does this church have to do with it? No one, incidentally, fired at it, not even soldiers from their automatic rifles. And, by the way, no one has been shelling it since 1980, no. No one has been shelling it since 1980; the people's eyes have opened. [Kravchuk] The only thing I would like to add is this: Since 1917, not only this church but all the churches on our soil, and not only the churches but also the people who believed, believe, and will believe in God, have been so shelled verbally and their soul so ruined that this church is like a silent witness to what has been done. The people, you see, have already understood it themselves, as the minister said. One cannot do this to the people, the fruit of their labor and their belief. It is improper. That it has been understood is good. Of course it has so happened that it has taken place and there is this firing range. But what can be done now? We cannot, after all, shut it down, because colossal means and resources have been invested here and it is needed. It is needed in order to train and practice the skillfulness of our armed forces. [Correspondent] How well are the Ukrainian troops prepared to take part in the Partnership for Peace program and joint military exercises? [Kravchuk] Partnership for Peace does not foresee the participation of Ukrainian troops, because it is a partnership for peace. [sentence as heard] There is another clause there, a clause saying that during NATO military exercises, our units and troops could, with our consent, participate, in order to practice certain models for themselves, not to take part in any possible military action. That is impossible. We are taking part in the action in Yugoslavia, with our battalion, which is involved there in order to ensure normal life, and only that. This is agreed with the UN Security Council. Therefore, some unit could, with our consent and the consent of the relevant NATO structure, take part in joint military exercises, but not more. This does not imply our interaction with NATO troops, because we are not a member of NATO. [Moderator] Mykola Yurchyshyn, SILSKI VISTI, please. [SILSKI VISTI correspondent Yurchyshyn] Esteemed Mr. President, is there an alternative military service in Ukraine? According to the law, there should be one. [Kravchuk] What alternative service? [Radetskyy] This is laid down in the law, and the law should be adhered to. Incidentally, there are very few objectors, those who refuse to carry arms, in Ukraine today. These include sick people or those who belong to religious movements. We are solving these problems and we are working on them. Moreover, the law speaks not only of alternative service, but also about contract service which we also plan to practice in future, as right now there is no money to maintain a professional army, although, it would in fact pay off and would be cheaper for Ukraine to maintain than these boys we are drafting for a year and a half, who are wrecking everything and for whom this time is too short to embrace the material they are to study. [SHLYAKH PEREMOHY correspondent] I have two questions, if I may. The first one is this: The president of Ukraine is at the same time the commander-in-chief. But we now have another president, the Crimean one. Are you going to share any powers of the commander-in-chief with him? [Kravchuk and Radetskyy are heard laughing] My second question concerns the Defense Council of Crimea which has been set up there. Is it a state structure, if yes, what functions has it been charged to perform? [Kravchuk] This follows from your first question about Crimea, and I will answer it more broadly. There are a few aspects that probably need clarification. There is Ukraine's legislation, its Constitution and laws, and there is the law on delimiting powers between Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. These laws exist and according to these laws, the Crimean president cannot -- being absolutely governed by the legislation -- shall we say, command, influence or regulate any forces. This is the prerogative of the Ukrainian president only. Nor can he, let us say, under our Constitution have any military structures. Moreover, our law, our legislation does not allow military formations that are not provided for in our legislation. This not only applies to Crimea but to everyone and everywhere. Thus, what is being done, even if it is only beginning to be done, is unconstitutional and unlawful and we shall be bringing everything in Crimea in line with the legislation. [Radetskyy] Can I answer? [Kravchuk] Yes, you're welcome to. [Radetskyy] As for the question on the Crimean Defense Council, the only council we have is Ukraine's Defense Council. I know of no such council as the Crimean Defense Council. This is an invention. By the way, the Odessa military district commander and the 32nd Army Corps commander are present here today, who strictly perform their duties within the framework of those entrusted to them by the Defense Council of Ukraine. There is and there will be no other council. [Kravchuk] So, we shall execute the Constitution and laws of Ukraine, and any statements that there is no need for the Ukrainian Army in Crimea and such like, are groundless legislatively and have no foundation except for ambitions and wishes. That is why they are not not the basis for practical moves. I have instructed Ukraine's appropriate services so as for them to work and bring everything in line with the legislation. By the way, you see, no matter how agitated they were and no matter how insistent they were on a referendum or a poll, everything boiled down to a poll to be conducted by the president. Crimea's Central Electoral Commission has refused to conduct this poll. All it is doing is to provide the premises and hand out the ballot papers. It will neither calculate nor count or make conclusions on this poll. The poll in Crimea, strictly in legal terms, thus amounts to an opinion poll by the presidential team. You know, there is no such thing anywhere, either in the laws or the Constitution. Anyone can conduct such a poll, including the president. In this case, however, it is not legitimate as it even is conducted without commissions or any legalization by, shall we say, a legitimate body. This is being done by certain officials authorized by the president. This he can do and I am calm about this, because any analysis [pauses] -- I do not know to what degree it will be legalized, how its authenticity can be verified and so on. So what conclusions will be drawn from this? None. There simply will be expenditure. That is all. [Mediator] Questions are welcome. [Unidentified correspondent] The Defense Ministry's TV. I have a question on armed forces reduction and how it will affect state security. [Kravchuk] We have to have sufficiency in our defense capability and to do so our armed forces have to be sufficient, as it were. There are materials providing for their numerical strength, which is 450,000 for the armed forces at this stage. We shall approach this and then see what the situation is and what the quality of our armed forces is, because, shall we say, if they are to be professional armed forces, probably -- we shall also settle this issue in due time -- a different type of expenditure, a different type of weaponry and a different number of men will be involved. Meanwhile, we shall act in accordance with our military doctrine approved by the Supreme Council. [Radetskyy] Leonid Makarovych, can I add something? [Kravchuk] Yes, you are welcome to. [Radetskyy] The Defense Council, by the way, has held a sitting and you tasked me with clarifying it. The thing is that this numerical strength of 450,000 is as of 31 December 1994, while you assigned the task of examining this issue and reducing it to 420,000. There is such an instruction from the president and we are dealing with this. [Kravchuk] This is not, shall we say, a magic number we have to hang on to. Firstly, it is the quality of weaponry, the quality of armed forces training, the situation outside the country and the international and domestic situation, that will dictate the numerical strength and quality of our armed forces, rather than simply, shall we say, recording it in writing and hanging on to this number. [Radetskyy] (?Including) materials and machinery provision. [Kravchuk] That is right. [Lvov television correspondent] Mr. President, due to certain circumstances we have two military districts, the powerful Precarpathia and Odessa districts. Could you say, please, if there is an opinion that the eastern part of the country remains as if unprotected, as if there is no mighty force guarding the borders there. [Kravchuk] No, this is not the case. There is the Odessa military district there. We have appropriate structures. We also have the National Guard which performs its functions and which, by the way, actively participated today. The National Guard commander is present. So, in other words, we have the appropriate armed forces and appropriate military structures etcetera, shall we say, of all ranks to ensure the tasks set by the Ukrainian state are performed. The only thing I would just like us to proceed from, is this: We are not training ourselves to make war. We are training ourselves to protect ourselves, which is our concept of principle. We are not and shall not be first to raise our hand against anyone, God forbid. Ukraine is a peaceful state and, incidentally, it has always been peaceful. It has not been at war with anyone. We do not have any territorial claims against anyone. In our policy and our statements, we have never expressed even a hint that we have some claims to someone, be it our neighbors near or far, no. We say [pauses] -- this is what we state. But we, at the same time, say we do not want anyone to have any such claims against us. Should there be any, however -- and there are some let us not pretend there are not -- we shall show we shall protect our interests. If anyone tries -- [pauses] not by means of established international principles which, by the way, have been worked out in detail both in the Helsinki process and at the United Nations Organization, worked out in detail, and the world [pauses] -- this is the most sensitive issue: Why is the world so sensitive when someone violates this? Because here lies that most dreadful line between peace and war. Therefore, we say that we shall not make even a single step to cross this line. But the one who will do this not by means of those established norms existing in the world but who will try to do this by means of force, it is clear that it will be countered by force. There is no other option. [Radetskyy] Leonid Makarovych, the esteemed gentleman who put this question had in mind not only this but also the fact that the Odessa district is so large while the Precarpathian district is so small. And this issue was already touched upon [word indistinct]. [Kravchuk] Well, we are currently working out our structure. [Radetskyy] Territorially. [Kravchuk] We are working it out. For example, there were staff exercises and they have been held for two weeks. Is that right? [Radetskyy] They are still in progress. [Kravchuk] Then I will continue to analyze. There, at the exercises, we were talking about how to build our territorial defense so that it would be adequate to the situation. And this will be changed. And, again, this is not something established once and forever, but this is a process. [Radetskyy] I would like to explain as a military expert that the question is not how many troops there are in a military district, but what these troops are, what their mobility is like, what their combat readiness is like, so that we could, in any location where our security is being threatened, concentrate these forces in order to solve the problem by means of a political dialogue, not by force. We should create formation in that location so that those threatening us would give up trying to fight against us but would solve the conflict in a political way. [Passage omitted] [Correspondent from NARODNA ARMIYA] Leonid Makarovych, these are the first exercises held after the Army General of Ukraine Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy was appointed Ukraine's Defense Minister. Today [word indistinct] not only the combat activity of the troops but also Vitaliy Hryhorovych were assessed. [Kravchuk] You know, when Vitaliy Hryhorovych took the post, he got down to practical deeds. He is an experienced person who made a career, in different places, as they say, and at different posts, from a platoon commander to the minister. He knows all the ticks and hooks which they draw on maps and which they dig in the earth. He knows where one should stand and what one should do, and he himself can replace a company, platoon, regiment, battalion, division, or district commander. He is a genuine minister. A person who has not gone through all this will experience difficulties. This is why I appreciate his experience. This is the first thing. Secondly, he is a person who wants that the armed forces be functioning as a clockwork mechanism and who knows what is to be done toward that end. He is a man of responsibility. I know that here, especially on the land of Galicia, there is much talk about the former minister, Mr. Morozov. He initiated and applied certain efforts so that we could have our armed forces. And no one can deny this fact. But it turned out so that [pauses] -- one can only do what he is able to do. And one will never do more than that. He did what he could do. Being aware of the fact that this post is rather serious and has a lot of trends and philosophical and political interpretations around it, we were doing everything possible to preserve the status quo, although it was not easy to do this. And no one should be blamed. However, the situation, both in the center and in the regions, and in the troops -- I know this -- was such that this issue had to be solved. And then the minister knew this from the conversation he had with me. Despite the fact that I, nevertheless, submitted his candidacy to parliament, he came and asked that his candidacy be withdrawn.
