They pointed out: The facts have amply testified that the Chinese side made tremendous efforts at the talks. The essence of the Sino-British dispute is not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong, but one of whether to act in good faith and whether to converge with the Basic Law in the three aspects so as to realize a smooth transition in Hong Kong. In the face of the iron-clad facts, Britain can hardly shirk its responsibility for the rupture of the talks. Fan Xu Litai and Li Zetian, members of the Preliminary Committee, said: China's publication of the facts concerning the talks is a good thing which can help the public in Hong Kong understand the truth. The facts show that during the talks, China made considerable concessions over the three preconditions set by Britain, that is, "lowering the voting age, abolishing appointed membership, and implementing the system of single seat, single vote." China also agreed to the British proposal concerning elections of the two municipal councils and the district board. China only requested that discussion of the single seat, single vote system in the Legislative Council elections be left to a later stage. However, Britain used this as a pretext to suspend the talks. This move by Britain shows that it has no sincerity whatsoever in the talks. Fan Xu Litai said: It is China's consistent goal to maintain Hong Kong's smooth transition, prosperity and stability. China had hoped the talks would be successful; the responsibility for the breakup of the talks lies with Britain. Li Liansheng, a deputy to the National People's Congress, said: Since Britain has unilaterally published the tailored contents of the talks, it is only natural that China has been compelled to make a corresponding response by making the facts public. In so doing, Hong Kong residents can distinguish right from wrong and will not be misled by the British-orchestrated public opinion. He added: The British unilateral publication of the White Paper is an attempt to take the initiative to misguide Hong Kong residents and make them believe that responsibility for the rupture of the talks lies with China. The facts prove that the essence of the Sino-British dispute is not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong, but one of whether to abide by the agreements reach between the two countries. The Chinese and British Governments long ago reached a series of agreements and understandings concerning the arrangements for Hong Kong's political system. The unwarranted dispute has been started by Britain's inconsistency and failure to honor its commitment. Hong Kong affairs advisor Chen Wanxian welcomed China's publication of the details of the talks, and deemed the document as helpful for Hong Kong residents to draw a fair judgment. She said: By using the promotion of democracy to cover up its failure to honor the Sino-British agreements and understandings, Britain's ultimate objective is to perpetuate its vested interests in Hong Kong beyond 1997. Hong Kong affairs advisor Tang Yizhu pointed out: The facts show that Britain, devoid of sincerity in the talks, unreasonably brought up at the negotiation table the demand to discuss issues falling within the scope of China's sovereignty and manipulated the Hong Kong's Legislative Council to discuss the "constitutional reform package." Obviously Britain wanted to use the talks to cover up its efforts to peddle the so-called "constitutional reform package." He added: As we understand, in order to reach agreement with Britain on electoral arrangements for the district board and the two municipal councils, China repeatedly made concessions during the talks and proposed a compromise which took into consideration the stand of both sides and which would skirt the differences between the two sides. However, Britain raised obstacles which led to the rupture of talks. The Hong Kong Federation for Democratic Construction, Association of Freedom and Democracy, Liberal Party, Focus, Association for the Advancement of Democracy and the People's Life, and many other political parties and social organizations in Hong Kong also published commentaries, giving a "big welcome" to the Chinese publication of the facts concerning the talks. A few of social organizations believe that the contents released by China are "comprehensive," while those in the British version are "selected and prioritized." China's move can help the residents better understand the truth that Britain's faithlessness led to the failure to reach a Sino-British agreement on electoral arrangements. Yang Yaozhong, a representative of the Hong Kong Educators' Association, said in a commentary: The contents of the details of the talks released by China can ensure a correct understanding of the facts. In the face of the facts, Britain cannot shirk its responsibility for the rupture of the talks. In more than a century of colonial rule, Britain has never promoted democracy in Hong Kong. Now it is holding the banner of democracy. The essence of this is to maintain Britain's influence on Hong Kong after 1997.
