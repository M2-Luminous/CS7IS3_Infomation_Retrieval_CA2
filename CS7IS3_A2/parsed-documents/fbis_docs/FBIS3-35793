It is only with this kind of Georgia that Russia can preserve the friendly relations that have been formed over the centuries," Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said, speaking at a meeting with North Caucasian leaders at the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. This meeting was held on the eve of an official visit to Georgia by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. "The importance of this trip," Kozyrev stressed, "goes beyond the framework of Russian-Georgian relations. Here we are talking about an important step toward the implementation of a strategic policy in the Caucasus. This policy is set on the basis of a carefully calculated balance between state and regional interests." According to Kozyrev, "allegations of some kind of a military alliance between Russia and Georgia against Abkhazia are totally unfounded." Russia, he said, does not divide the Caucasian nations into "ours" and "theirs". One of the main tasks of the visit is to advance a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and to reaffirm Russia's role as a mediator in this process. The Russian minister believes that if the sides do not reach a comprehensive political settlement of the Abkhaz conflict and do not formulate and sign the relevant documents under the auspices of the United Nations, it will be simply dangerous optimism to hope for peace in that region. In such a case, extreme nationalists, "the party of war", will increasingly shape politics in the Caucasus. Kozyrev believes that, as a first step in this direction, it is necessary to agree on conducting an operation to support peace in Abkhazia, with the necessary involvement of peacekeeping forces and international observers. The situation in the region is of essential interest to Russia. That is why it is, yet again, primarily Russian peacekeepers who will have to conduct this peacekeeping effort in Abkhazia. Both Georgians and Russians are asking for it. Russia will once more carry the largest burden of the peacekeeping challenge--of safeguarding human lives, of the sovereignty of the neighboring state, and of the rights of national minorities. Incidentally, the minister continued, "not only is Russia not hiding from the international community, but it is asking for its support". He resolutely denied "patronizing or vicious gloating by outsiders, or speculations by "the Zhirinovskiy factor", both in Russia and in the West. "What one needs is not lecturing on norms of the United Nations or the CSCE, but the practical effort to establish these norms in the Transcaucasia, as well as across the post-Soviet area on the whole," Kozyrev said. During the course of the visit, the issue of the North Ossetian settlement will be raised with the Georgian leadership. The truce in North Ossetia is being maintained, thanks to the presence of the Russian peacekeeping contingent and representatives of the CSCE. Bloodshed may resume there at any time.
