The ex-Minister Is Ready To Rejoin the Government"] [Text] Former finance minister Boris Fedorov in an interview with ITAR-TASS stated that thanks to a fall in the rate of inflation down to 9.8 percent in February and 8 percent in March, the government now has a unique chance to complete successfully the many-month efforts toward financial stabilization. "The cabinet of ministers has the possibility to use the emerging results of the policy conducted by the previous government," the State Duma deputy noted. "It is worrying, however, that in the last three and a half months the Viktor Chernomyrdin government has not undertaken a single step that could be described as reformist." If the current government continues such a stance, in the next few weeks a retreat from the economic gains achieved will become inevitable, Boris Fedorov believes. According to him, the first sign of this will be the extension of large financial subsidies to state enterprises, in particular the upcoming appropriation in April of approximately 3 trillion rubles to enterprises in the agricultural sector. Such a move, the former Russian Federation finance minister pointed out, will thwart the existing possibility to carry though in Russia "the most painless financial stabilization in world history." Confirming his prediction that by the end of the year the rate of the dollar could rise to 10,000 rubles, Boris Fedorov expressed the opinion that Viktor Chernomyrdin's government will be able to "last" only until this fall unless it moves from passive policy to an active course for reform. "If by that time the cabinet of ministers does not undertake real actions, the government will at best be reformed," the former Russian finance minister said. He expressed readiness to rejoin the government "if the requisite powers are granted" to him.
