He told the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY that his government expected Africa to convene an emergency meeting asking the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to halt his military assistance to the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF]. The front is fighting the government for the control of the capital, Kigali. Despite repeated denials from Kampala, the Kigali government maintains the Ugandan Government has been supporting the front since the beginning of the guerrilla war in October 1990. Ngirabatware is in Dakar to deliver a message from the new Rwanda head of state Theodore Sindikubwabo to the Senegalese President Abdou Diouf. The envoy has delivered similar messages to the leaders of Gabon and Togo. We wish to conclude a ceasefire with the RPF. This is a prerequisite to any discussion, he said. He said that the crisis could only be solved through negotiations in Arusha Tanzania, being brokered by Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi.
