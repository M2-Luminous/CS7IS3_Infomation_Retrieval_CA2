FR940304-2-00016 FR940304-2-00012 Comments Received on the 1993 Interim Final List of Fisheries Thirteen comments were received in response to the request for comments on the interim final List of Fisheries for 1993. All of the comments received were in support of the changes published in the interim final List of Fisheries, and are summarized below. Alaska Prince William Sound (Eshamy, Coghill, and Unakwik districts) Drift Gill Net Fishery and the Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent to Prince William Sound) Drift Gill Net Fishery Twelve comments were received supporting the split of the former Alaska Prince William Sound drift gill net fishery into two separate fisheries, based on the difference in take rates in the two areas. All comments received also supported the reclassification of the Alaska Prince William Sound (Coghill, Eshamy, and Unakwik districts) drift gill net fishery from Category I to Category II. Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico Tuna, Shark, and Swordfish Pair Trawl Fishery One comment was received supporting the reclassification of the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico tuna, shark, and swordfish pair trawl fishery from Category II to Category I. The individual making the comment also suggested that all pair trawl fisheries be reclassified as Category I fisheries. NMFS is aware of only one other pair trawl fishery which operated for a short time in the Gulf of Maine, targeting groundfish. This fishery has been inactive following issuance of emergency regulations published on June 8, 1993 (58 FR 32062). Amendment 5 of the New England Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, approved on January 3, 1994, contains measures to continue the ban on the use of pair trawl gear in this fishery indefinitely. If new information is received regarding the use of pair trawl gear in other areas, further action will be taken on this recommendation. Proposed Changes 1. Recategorize the Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent to Prince William Sound) salmon drift gill net fishery from Category I (Table 1) to Category II (Table 2). Many of the comments received on the 1993 interim final List of Fisheries indicated that the take rates given for the Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent to Prince William Sound) drift gill net fishery were overestimated. Take rates were based on the total number of interactions, which included momentary interactions with the nets, e.g., animals brushing up against the net or swimming over it, as well as serious injuries, and mortalities. Many individuals submitting comments noted that if only those interactions resulting in serious injuries or mortalities were used to calculate take rates, the take rate would be much less than that reported in the interim final List. Therefore, NMFS has reviewed the observer data collected in this fishery and calculated a revised take rate of 0.56 marine mammal takes per 20 days of fishing, based on an estimated 252 serious injuries, and kills in 8,883 fishing vessel days. Based on the calculated take rate, NMFS proposes reclassification of the Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent to Prince William Sound) drift gill net fishery from Category I to Category II. 2. Recategorize the WA, OR Lower Columbia River salmon drift gill net fishery from Category I (Table 1) to Category III (Table 3). Marine mammal/fishery interaction and incidental take data have been collected in this fishery since 1991 under a marine mammal observer program that was completed at the end of calendar year 1993. Incidental take data have been collected by observers from the two major fishing seasons (winter and fall) with approximately 6 percent coverage of fishing effort in winter 1991, 4 percent in fall 1991, 10 percent in winter 1992, 7 percent in fall 1992, and 7 percent in winter 1993. Percent observer coverage for the fall 1993 fishery is currently being estimated, and will be completed after all landing data have been reviewed. Only one marine mammal mortality, a harbor seal, was observed in 3 years of observations in the fall fisheries (1991, 1992, and 1993), while a total of 28 marine mammal serious injuries or mortalities (24 harbor seals and four California sea lions) were observed over the course of 3 years of observations in the winter fisheries (1991 through 1993). Based on the observer data from 1991&hyph;winter 1993 (fall 1993 data analysis is underway), less than 0.5 marine mammals are taken per vessel per 20 days of fishing in this fishery. Based on this, NMFS proposes that the WA, OR Lower Columbia River salmon drift gill net fishery be recategorized from Category I to Category III.
