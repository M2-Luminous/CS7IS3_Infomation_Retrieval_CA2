The resolution was adopted after a six-hour meeting of southern African heads of state and government. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos was represented by Prime Minister Marcolino Jose Carlos Moco at the OAU meeting. [passage omitted] Prime Minister Moco was accompanied by Deputy Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Jorge Chikoti. The summit discussed the war in Angola and the current stage of the Lusaka peace talks. The fact that the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] appears to agree to one thing today, only to disagree the next day, made the OAU adopt yet another resolution. [Begin Chikoti recording] The meeting found that the situation in Angola is extremely serious. In the words of the OAU secretary general, this summit could not have wound up without a communique conveying some serious concerns. First of all, UNITA must participate in the democratic process by unambiguously accepting the offer made by the government. Furthermore, it was noted that the Angolan Government has made extremely important concessions and that the international community must now consider Resolutions 864 and 903, because what is happening now is dangerous and a firmer approach to the problem must be adopted. His Excellency Prime Minister Marcolino Moco asked for His Excellency OAU Chairman Husni Mubarak's personal support and direct commitment to the Angolan peace process, urging the United Nations and the United States to view the Angolan issue in a very serious light. Thus, the resolution on Angola carries another important implication: We can now use it as a working tool because of the OAU ad hoc Committee's concern about the prevailing situation in Angola at a time when peace talks are being held and the Angolan Government has made extremely important concessions to UNITA. [end recording] Meanwhile, Prime Minister Moco held a private meeting with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano shortly after being welcomed at the airport in Harare on 18 March by Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister Nathan Shamuyarira. Though the press has learned nothing about the meeting with the Mozambican head of state, it is thought that the Angolan and Mozambican peace processes were discussed. Prime Minister Moco also met Egyptian President Husni Mubarak yesterday morning. The Angolan official briefed him on the Lusaka peace talks and on Angola's political, military, economic, and social situation. Prime Minister Moco asked the Egyptian head of state to have the OAU take concrete steps to ensure that UNITA abandons the path of war and signs a peace accord. The OAU chairman promised he would work to find greater support for the Angolan peace process from the international community. [passage omitted]
