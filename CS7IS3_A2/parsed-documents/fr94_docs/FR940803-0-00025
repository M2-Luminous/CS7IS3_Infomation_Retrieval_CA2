FR940803-0-00025 FR940803-0-00009 Under ยง121.1603(a)(4), a protest is considered premature until identification of the prospective awardee. Traditionally, this identification occurs at bid opening or, in the case of a negotiated procurement, at the point the contracting officer notifies other offerors of the intended award and names the prospective awardee. SBA believes that the concept of notification applicable to protests filed by other offerors is not appropriate with respect to contracting officers, since it is the contracting officer who does the notification. Thus ยง121.1603(a)(4) will merely require that a contracting officer wait until he or she has identified the apparent successful offeror before filing a protest concerning that firm's size status. Such a restriction will ensure that SBA does not impose the burdens of an unnecessary size investigation on other offerors or expend its limited resources rendering size determinations that are unlikely to have any practical significance for the procurement in question. This clarification of SBA's procedural regulations governing premature protests applies to all pending protests as well as all size determinations for which a final decision has not yet been rendered by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12612 and 12778; the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.; and the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. CH 35 For purposes of Executive Order 12866, SBA certifies that this rule will not have an economic effect in excess of $100 million, result in a major increase in costs for individuals or governments, or have a significant adverse effect on competition and, therefore, will not constitute a major or significant rule. SBA has made this determination because the rule is purely procedural in nature and will impose no additional filing or other requirements and, as such, does not represent a significant regulatory event. For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule will not have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism assessment. For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that the rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2 of that Order. For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, SBA certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, for the same reason that it will not be a major or significant rule. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, SBA certifies that the rule will not impose a new recordkeeping or reporting requirement. List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 121 Administrative practice and procedure; Government procurement; Small business.
