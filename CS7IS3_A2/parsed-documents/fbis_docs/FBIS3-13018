It primarily presupposes the establishment of safe areas in southern Sudan, the intervention of foreign forces, and the imposition of an air, economic, oil, and military embargo on Khartoum in preparation for an entry by the opposition forces, which are currently deployed in one of the neighboring countries, to overpower the regime. But the opposition "al-Ummah" Party has doubts about this plan's success. In a telephone interview with AL-SAFIR, opposition sources in London said that forces belonging to one of the "northern" opposition parties are now deployed all along Sudan's borders with one of its neighboring countries, which recently became embroiled in a dispute with Khartoum after accusing the al-Bashir government of harboring and supporting opposition groups from that country. The sources, which declined to reveal their identity, added that a meeting of the Sudanese opposition parties in the British House of Lords late last week sponsored by Baroness Caroline Cox had called on the international community to establish "safe areas" in southern Sudan and to impose an air, economic, military, and oil embargo on Khartoum that would weaken al-Bashir's government enough to allow the opposition to enter the capital and remove the regime. The sources explained that the safe areas to be established would not only include southern areas (that is the provinces of Bahr al-Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Equatoria) but would be extended to include what is known as the disputed "ravaged areas," on which there is no agreement yet as to whether they are "southern" or "northern". Some of these include parts of the provinces of Darfur, Kordofan (Jabal al-Nuba), and al-Anqasta. This means reducing the borders of the northern area to a minimum. The sources went on to say that a simultaneous declaration of an embargo on Khartoum would tighten the noose around the al-Bashir government, together with the closure of the borders with Libya and Chad and even Egypt, the closure of Port Sudan's harbor, and the isolation of the present government. This would allow the opposition forces inside the country to act, lead to an army revolt, and pave the way for the entry of the opposition forces from outside. The sources admitted that the stage that will follow this remains vague because the opposition parties have not yet agreed on the type of regime or the fate of the south, in addition to the absence of any party or figure capable of rallying the masses or possessing a specific program for taking over authority and managing the country in a transitional period. But deputy leader of al-Ummah Party Nasir-al-Din al-Mahdi has doubts about the likelihood of getting a resolution from the UN Security Council setting up safe areas and imposing an embargo on Khartoum. He noted that he senses that the British Government is hesistant about this matter. Al-Mahdi said that the London meeting was held at the House of Lords at the invitation of the House to the opposition to come and explain its stands on the current political situation in Khartoum, the right to self-determination in the south, the conditions of refugees and displaced persons, and other Sudanese issues. Speaking to AL-SAFIR from London, al-Mahdi said that "the original aim of the meeting was to urge a halt to the war in the south, provide the necessary relief and support for the refugees and displaced persons, notify Khartoum of the gravity of its repressive practices, and deter it by appealing to the international community." Al-Mahdi believes that the meeting's call for "setting up safe corridors in the war-stricken area, imposing an arms ban on the Sudanese Army and an oil embargo and economic sanctions on Sudan, defining a military no-fly zone, appointing a resident assistant commissioner for human rights in Khartoum, and suspending Sudan's membership in international and regional organizations" was more an appeal than a call. He admitted that the issue of the right to self-determination in the south has created controversy and that the opposition has failed to reach agreement on it. "No one can say he is authorized to raise this issue, not even the southern parties, who do not represent all southerners, particularly since most of them do not live in the south," he said. Al-Mahdi expects "an escalation of opposition activity inside Sudan by the Sudanese people as a prologue to deposing the government soon after its failure becomes clear. He believes it is likely that "the regime's international isolation will increase through the imposition of more economic sanctions." He said that the campaign the Sudanese Army is currently conducting against the rebels--a campaign that Khartoum denies-- "will fail because, at best, government troops will control the main roads but not the cities." He believes that this failure will create a state of discontent in the Army's ranks and might lead to a mutiny. He is convinced that "the internal situation will soon explode." Al-Mahdi admitted that the opposition abroad is weak and "ineffective," particularly because of the differences among the various sectors. "We are trying to draw the attention of the opposition abroad to the need to focus on major issues, like deposing the regime and drawing up a program for the post-al-Bashir era," he said. He added: "But this opposition might not be able to do much. The Sudanese are not too wrong when they call it the 'hotel opposition.'" He added: "This opposition will continue to be a hotel one if its internal differences persist. The Sudanese people do not expect much of it. They even call on us to stay abroad." The London meeting included Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party; 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, the secretary general of the al-Ummah party, which is led by Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi; 'Izz-al-Din 'Ali 'Amir, a leading cadre in the Communist Party representatives of the two rebel wings; Amin Makki Madani, the chairman of the Sudanese Human Rights Organization; plus 35 Sudanese figures. The conferees differed on the future of the south. Representatives of the John Garang-led Sudanese People's Liberation Army [SPLA] said: "Here we are divided into northerners and southerners on the issue of self-determination." Sources who participated in the meeting say that although most of the northern parties may not object in principle to granting self-determination for the southerners, they cannot risk losing the northerners' support for them by admitting that. The only party that boycotted the London meeting was the opposition National Organization for the Independent Sudanese Forces. This organization released a statement in London saying that "the great interest shown by some Western governments, organizations, and media in the war and famine in southern Sudan raises many fears and misgivings in a large sector of the Sudanese people." The statement summarizes these fears, saying that "although tragic, the situation in southern Sudan does not differ from more tragic situations in numerous regions in Africa and other parts of the world that have not received similar attention, not to mention that these situations have met with procrastination and negligence by the West." The statement adds: "This concern coincides with the proposed Western political plans regarding the problem of the south and with a call for international intervention to set up so-called safe havens in some parts of Sudan. This smacks of a plan to partition Sudan and separate the south." The state went on: "There is a clear link between the change in the balance of power between the warring sides and the timing of the Western governments and organizations raising the issue of famine and human rights. This reflects the existence of political motives behind this campaign and the West's bias toward a certain party." Western countries, led by the United States and Britain, indeed began a political and propaganda campaign in recent months focusing on the situation in southern Sudan "which has not changed since 1983." The campaign has also focused on the need to set up safe havens in the south on the pretext of insuring the delivery of relief aid to the population. Recent reports from southern Sudan indicate that government forces have advanced in the main areas of the south. The statement disputes the right of the parties taking part in the London meeting to "speak in the name of the Sudanese people" and also denies that these parties' viewpoint is representative . Replying to a question about the Sudanese opposition's request for an embargo on their country, which the Sudanese people would suffer from, the opposition sources which took part in the London meeting said "The Sudanese nation already suffers from the current situation; an embargo would not increase their suffering." The sources rejected any resemblance between the current Iraqi situation and the future situation of Sudan if an embargo is imposed on it. The sources said that the al-Bashir government "has begun to crumble and an embargo will only expedite its departure." They expected the embargo not to last more than five months, after which the opposition forces would be able to enter Khartoum. The sources disclosed that the original plan aimed to set up safe havens in the south and proclaim the formation of a provisional government in Juba with the objective of toppling the al-Bashir government and advancing north after an international embargo had been imposed on Khartoum. The sources explained that the recent disagreement between Khartoum and a neighboring country allowed for the revision of the plan and for deploying opposition forces in these countries [plural noun as received] and along the borders with Sudan. Commenting on Egypt's stance on these possibilities, the sources said that Cairo will not object to any resolution that might be passed by the international community against Sudan, noting the Egyptian Government's recent stand that it will not intervene in any decision. The sources ruled out the possibility of Cairo objecting to the deployment of international and "American" forces in southern Sudan. Last week, AL-SAFIR published a report that confirmed that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry is opposed to Washington's efforts to set up safe havens in the south, noting that it is this Egyptian opposition that is blocking such a move. The sources, however, regarded the Egyptian Foreign Ministry "as being not concerned in Sudanese affairs." The sources stressed that "Sudan has always been regarded in Cairo as the responsibility of the Egyptian Intelligence Agency, not the Foreign Ministry." As far as self-determination in the south is concerned, the sources said that the rebels' call for a referendum on separation is an ill-intentioned call because it is not in the interests of either the northern or southern parties. The sources said that Garang's wing does not support breaking away completely from the north (because of its close ties with the north and its leftist tendencies and because its ties with Washington are not solid). Meanwhile, the dissident wing, led by Riak Mashar, supports that demand "only for the sake of one-upsmanship." The sources added that the tribal system in the south does not allow it to break away "because this would trigger bloody battles among the tribes, which would fight for control." Added to this is the absence of an administrative structure or a system that could help the south build a "state" or separate entity. The sources noted that breaking away would force the southern authorities to seek the help of "foreign experts" to build their state. These "experts" would probably be from the north, particularly since the states surrounding the south lack suitable cadres, and in addition are mostly French-speaking. Arabic is the only common language of the southerners, who speak different dialects. Moreover, the sources touched on the issue of oil in the south. The discovery of large amounts of oil in the south has strengthened some sectors' demand to break away. The southerners will need workers and experts to work in that field. Although it is possible to seek the help of foreign experts, the workers will all be from the south. This means an internal migration that could fan tribal disputes. Some tribes will not let rivals stay and work in their zone. The sources referred also to the issue of the south's "borders" if it breaks away--an issue that is yet to be settled. Some demand that these borders be extended to the south of Khartoum and accordingly encompass ravaged areas, something the northerners will not allow. The sources wondered about the fate of the one million refugees who have been living in the north for years. These have changed their traditions and lifestyle. "Will they return to the south if it breaks away and will they find a place in areas totally different now from those they grew up in?" the sources asked. The sources noted two additional reasons--both foreign--that preclude breaking away. The first has to do with "the OAU charter," which views the post-colonial borders in Africa as final and unchangeable under any circumstances. The second has to do with Sudan's neighboring states, most of whom house many tribes. A breakaway would set a precedent encouraging these tribes to fight among themselves and demand the right to self-determination.
