ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI recalls that "the leaders of parliamentary groups who voted for a political amnesty explained the need for it by striving to maintain civil peace". However, "it appears evident that the release of the 'political prisoners' not just stimulate the activities of the hardline opposition -- it will entail the emergence of quite a number of organisations whose activities would be quite capable of destabilisiing the situation in the country". In addition, the situation is also being compounded by the fact that the Lefortovo investigation ward inmates and forces supporting them have no representation in parliament, for well-known reasons. "This is precisely why their struggle for the division of political space may become particularly fierce". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an analytical article under the headline "The Opposition Has Got Competitors From Lefortovo. The President Begins To Regroup Forces". Recalling the events of the October last year in Moscow, the newspaper points out that "the developments connected with the release of the 'Oktobrists' have vividly shown the extent of contradictions that tear the presidential team asunder". "Of course, the State Duma decision about an amnesty hardly gave pleasure to the president. However, there is every indication that those presidential team members who believed that the 'Oktobrists' are much more dangerous in the symbolical image of martyrs than in the image of real political figures gained the upper hand". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy: "As a politician, he undoubtedly enjoys a considerable prestige. But one should take into account that he became the leader of the entire opposition and a real alternative to Boris Yeltsin by virtue of his high position, in the extreme situation of a coup d'etat". "At present, however, opposition politicians (Zhirinovsky, Zyuganov and Baburin) should view him, rather, as a potential competitor: for, according to people close to Rutskoy, he intends not only to return to politics but also participate in the future presidential elections". TRUD on a probable development of events in Russia following the amnesty. The newspaper believes that "if the political struggle unfolds in uncivilised forms, those factions which voted for an amnesty on the plea for a quest for civil peace would find themselves in a rather difficult position. "This primarily applies to the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, whose votes enabled the duma to pass the decision on the release of the 'Lefortovo inmates'. "It is not ruled out that in the event of a flare-up of extremism, the parliament will have to take some additional measures if it comes to realise the danger posed to the country by such a development of events". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the same subject: "It is already evident to everyone that there can be no question of any 'civilised forms' of political struggle. "Moscow, which became somewhat calmer recently, will again be divided into zones of influence while the president loses time irretrievably and together with it the last levers of power". PRAVDA carries an interview with State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin. In response to a question from the newspaper's correspondent about the amnesty, Rybkin pointed out that the meaning of the amnesty "is to give a chance to those who took a false step to turn a new leaf at this difficult and critical time. The purpose is to consolidate society so as to pull the country out of chaos through common efforts". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs an interview with former speaker of the Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov who was released from Lefortovo under the amnesty. Khasbulatov touched upon some provisions of the president's message to the Federal Assembly, pointing out that the message consists mainly of what he, Khasbulatov, once said at congresses of people's deputies. "This means that the presidential team who prepared the message accepted the Supreme Soviet evaluations. Surprising is something else. Those people are unable to accomplish this task by virtue of their being oriented to the destruction of Russia, to the conduct of war against their own people". PRAVDA carries an interview with Belarusian parliament chief Meczeslaw Hryb who was elected to the post at the end of January. Sharing his vision of how to take the republic's economy out of the crisis, he said it is essential, first of all, to restore economic ties with "ex-Soviet republics, particularly with Russia". "Only an economic union and a common monetary system can save the situation as I pointed out on more than one occasion," Hryb said.
