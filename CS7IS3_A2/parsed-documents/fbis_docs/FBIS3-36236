According to Svirin, Estonia demands that the majority of the servicemen who retired after 20 August 1991 should leave when the army leaves, even if they have no accommodation in Russia. The remaining military pensioners must apply to Estonian authorities for residence permits. At the same time they are required to give a signed declaration saying that they have no arms at home and do not intend to obtain any. Retired servicemen must also promise not to join any military formations nor endanger the state of Estonia through their actions. Svirin stated that such requirements are humiliating. According to Svirin, the Russian side expected to reach an agreement on the citizenship issue, but the Estonian delegation refused discussion on the matter.
