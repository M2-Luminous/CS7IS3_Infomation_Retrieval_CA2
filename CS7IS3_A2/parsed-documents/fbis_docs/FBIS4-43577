This conviction that the shift in the vote was more far-reaching than expected and hence the punishment "was not superficial" yesterday led the PSOE Executive Committee Standing Committee to decide to begin a process of internal reflection that will result in a "very rigorous and very realistic" analysis of the election results, without evading the true scale of its defeat last Sunday. The Socialists believe that this is the only way to find the real causes that have led their voters -- "those who brought us to power," they say -- to deprive them of their support, and the only way to get right the corrections that they must henceforth tackle. This more rigorous analysis of the defeat will be made next Monday at the Socialist Federal Executive Committee's plenary session. Gonzalez Recommends Calm At the meeting held at the Moncloa Palace, shortly before Felipe Gonzalez left for Colombia, where he will be taking part in the Ibero-American summit, the prime minister recommended "calm" to the Socialist leadership in order to study the reasons for the debacle and not to make hasty decisions that could be wrong. Even so, one of those attending the meeting explained to this newspaper that "calm does not mean passivity." At that meeting, which was attended by all the Standing Committee members plus Andalusian premier Manuel Chaves, a superficial approach was made to analyzing the causes of the defeat, which was attributed to the fact that the public still does not notice the economic recovery, the corruption cases, and the internal discord. But as well as accepting the electorate's "severe warning," it was made clear at the meeting, as Secretary for Organization Cipria Ciscar later explained, that the party "is united around the government's activity and Felipe Gonzalez' leadership." In that initial urgent analysis, nobody raised the need for changing the policy of pacts with CiU [Convergence and Union], although some PSOE leaders believe that that alliance with the Catalan nationalists could have influenced the results in Andalusia. In fact, the electoral setback in that autonomous community, which has been a traditional Socialist fief, is the reason that leads the PSOE to believe that the punishment by its voters was not short term but represented a much more serious voting shift "because," they say, "they have punished us where it could hurt us most," especially since in Andalusia the electorate could have opted for punishing the Socialists in the European elections but supporting them in the regional government. Some of the possible solutions to this situation were also raised at the meeting, always trying to guarantee political stability. These included the possibility of Felipe Gonzalez' undergoing a confidence vote in parliament, an option that the Socialists do not rule out, although their CiU partners explicitly reject that possibility. In the Socialists' opinion, a confidence motion would be a gesture to society that they have understood the message, and would avoid giving the impression of passivity or of their believing that "nothing has happened." Whether or not to present one is a decision that the prime minister will have to take over the next few days, on his return from Colombia. However, nobody raised the possibility of immediately calling an early election, an option that is on the agenda but that terrifies the PSOE, because it believes that in these circumstances it would mean "giving away victory to the People's Party." Perhaps for this reason, Ciscar reiterated yesterday the Socialists' pledge to continue to promote political stability, as well as to apply "the necessary corrections and regain the public's confidence." To that effect, he also emphasized the party's and government's pledge to end corruption and "clean up political life, not just through legal measures but through ethical attitudes." In the background to this debate, the Socialists are considering whether society now views them as an exhausted and outdated option, and what measures would make it possible to win back the support of an electorate that has been loyal to them for years and that has now mostly opted for abstention, with the aim of winning the next election. Talk With All Political Forces The Socialists believe that one of the most immediate requirements of their electoral defeat is to begin a serious and calm dialogue with all the political forces, especially those such as CiU, which give them their parliamentary support, in order to analyze together the domestic situation created by last Sundays's election results, but they believe that those talks should also extend to the People's Party, not only in order to conduct that appraisal of the new political situation but also in order to discover what will be its stance in the near future. For the present, the Socialists are firmly maintaining the image of internal unity in the face of the electoral setback, but in private the different emphases that each of the sectors places on the consequences of the defeat are taking shape. Thus the Guerraists believe that their voters are demanding, as they did 6 June 1993, a "leftward shift," and certainly a cabinet reshuffle to strengthen the country's political leadership and end the impression of the government's lack of a political steady hand. The renewalists attribute the defeat both to the economic crisis and unemployment and to the recent corruption cases, which have damaged the Socialists' credibility and sown suspicions about their honesty and their readiness to combat all forms of unlawful conduct.
