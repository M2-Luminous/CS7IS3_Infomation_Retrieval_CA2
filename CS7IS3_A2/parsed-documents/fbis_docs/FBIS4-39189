According to him, the hard-line opposition has not abandoned its intention to resolve the Tajik problem by force, including military measures. As the general said, at the moment the opposition is concentrating its forces not only on the border with Afghanistan, but also within Tajikistan. Russia's 201st motorized infantry division stationed in Tajikistan is capable, in cooperation with Russian frontier guards and Tajik Government forces, of thwarting any military actions the opposition may launch from within Tajikistan and from neighboring Afghanistan, Kondratev declared.
