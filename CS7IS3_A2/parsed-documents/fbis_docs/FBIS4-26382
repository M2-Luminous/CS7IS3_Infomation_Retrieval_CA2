He stressed that the entire army should value and attach the utmost importance to the fresh upsurge in troop training that has already emerged, further strengthen and reform military training, and upgrade the troops' combat capability under high-technology conditions to strive for the fulfillment of Chairman Jiang Zemin's overall demand that "the army must be qualified politically and competent militarily, have a fine style of work, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate logistical support." After hearing a report on the state of troop training reform, Liu Huaqing on 13 June said in western Henan: Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the need to give military training a place in strategy, while Comrade Jiang Zemin demands that army units pay close, proper attention to military training as a regular central task. In recent years I have always thought about the question: In what way can our troops complete the shift from dealing with warfare under ordinary conditions to winning a localized war under high-technology conditions? Thanks to the deepening of training reform, some successful ways have been found through our explorations, and a fresh upsurge in troop training has basically taken shape throughout the armed forces. That evening, the Army and the Air Force held a nighttime joint exercise at a hilly area. Liu Huaqing rushed to the exercise ground and told the military unit leaders on hand: In making nighttime warfare drill and troop training under high-technology conditions the theme of nighttime training reform, you have selected a good spot for a breakthrough. Mobilizing the entire military in nighttime training reform is a historical development. Now that the correct way has been found, it is necessary to popularize, develop, and upgrade it, and pay attention to its implementation in a solid and down-to-earth manner. Braving the high temperature of 36 degrees centigrade, Liu Huaqing went to a certain tank regiment to view an exhibition of night vision devices. When he saw the good effects of the automated system for daytime and nighttime command of artillery troops [pao bing qun zhou ye zhi hui zi dong hua xi tong 3517 0365 5028 2521 1123 2172 2264 5261 0520 0553 4762 4827], Liu Huaqing cheerfully said: To pursue modernization with the present equipment, our army should take the path of technological innovation, tap the potential of existing equipment, and upgrade combat efficiency to twice the current level. The key lies in emancipating the mind, firming up our will, and giving play to the subjective initiative and creativity. So long as we make our way into this area and make more explorations, we will be able to find the way through which the inferior can prevail over the superior [yi lie sheng you 0110 0503 0524 0327]. Liu Huaqing visited grass-roots cadres and soldiers everywhere he went. After a certain air division carried out a nighttime joint exercise with the Army, he specifically called the pilots to his side and said in sincere words and with earnest wishes: You have put on a really excellent performance. Fighting might take place not only during daytime but also at night, or even alternately during daytime and nighttime. We must prepare for both; we should carry out rigorous training during daytime as well as nighttime. During his investigation and study of the troops, Liu Huaqing repeatedly stressed in front of high-ranking military cadres: The current state of troop training is very good; leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in stepping up the study of high technology know-how, studying high-technology warfare, carrying forward the fine tradition of our army, and carrying out reform and innovation. Should we keep paying unremitting attention in this way, we surely will be able to lift our army's combat capability under high-technology conditions to a new level, and to justify the great trust placed in us by the party and the people.
