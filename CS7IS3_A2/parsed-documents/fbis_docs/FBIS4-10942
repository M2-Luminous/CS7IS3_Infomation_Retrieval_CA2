He said that whomever commits price abuses will have to compete with cheaper and perhaps better-quality products. Ricupero favors putting the real into circulation as soon as possible but did not specify a date. He also supports the conversion of foreign debt titles to finance education projects. Such a conversion already is being applied to social and environmental projects. Minister Ricupero also said that he trusts in the economic program's success, even though some economic sectors still are not operating in URV's [Real Value Unit]. This week he will announce the form of conversion for postal fees. Minister Ricupero today met Deputy Tarcisio Delgado, leader of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] in the Chamber of Deputies, and told him that Congress should establish in the Constitution only the general principles of the tax and social security reform. The rules for these reforms, the minister said, should be defined through complementary laws.
