[passage omitted] In the N-TV "Newspunkt" program, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic commented on the NATO air strikes on Serb positions. [Haris Silajdzic, in English, with superimposed German translation] "The principle is right but unfortunately it is not enough. This is not enough of a deterrent. Unfortunately there was too much hesitation, and then when finally intervention came, it was only half-hearted. Although we really welcome the work of NATO and the United Nations, it is still not enough. I think a not very strong message was sent there, not strong enough." [Announcer] To the question of what more had to be done, Silajdzic told N-TV: [Silajdzic] "As far as I know, two or three tanks were destroyed in these attacks. Serb soldiers, however, destroyed far more than 10 Bosnian tanks and the people in them. The lesson is not yet hard enough. A clear lesson would be to destroy all the Serbs' tanks, that is the only way. A clear message would be to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnians. As you know we have been denied this so far. The international community owes us this, however. Then we can deal with our own defense. Let us defend ourselves and we will do it ourselves."
