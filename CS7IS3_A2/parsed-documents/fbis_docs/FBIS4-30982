Maria Mikusova has just returned from the Hotel Borik where the signing took place. [Mikusova] This is the 27th agreement signed by Slovakia and Russia since the formation of an independent Slovakia and the first of its kind between Russia and one of the Visegrad Four countries. The existing arrangement of mutual relations in the sphere of travel created extensive possibilities for differences of interpretation and various bureaucratic measures. The signing of this agreement provides for the introduction of very precise and clear rules. In the words of Ambassador Yastrzhembskiy, it is a special agreement because it concerns people who are interested in visiting our country. As for what the significance of this agreement was for Slovakia, I asked Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan: [Begin recording] [Kukan] The agreement on visa-free travel which we signed with Ambassador Yastrzhembskiy has the principal significance of regulating travel and visits by Russian citizens here and our citizens to the Russian Federation. In terms of objective conditions it is not a classic agreement on visa-free travel such as we have with certain other European countries, but I think it will play a positive role in the current situation in our mutual relations and that it will have a positive effect on the future. It also documents our interest in expanding relations with the Russian Federation in such a way that would be beneficial to both sides. [Mikusova] Minister, will this agreement guarantee that such elements as we would not wish to see here will not get onto our territory? [Kukan] Yes. I answer yes unequivocally and without hesitation. That is why we signed it. [end recording] Let me only add that the agreement will come into effect following joint ratification.
