In fact, Horn is testing more than this when he tells a Prague newspaper that if the MSZP is given the opportunity to implement its foreign policy program, then it will strive to have basic agreements signed with these contents as soon as possible. At the moment, there is no point to guessing whether the MSZP will get this opportunity. However, according to our information, it is almost certain that the MSZP's strategy is obvious for the enlightened section of the Hungarian party spectrum. Therefore it is likely that if a coalition with this kind of enlightened majority comes to power next year, their foreign policy will be dominated by a neighborhood strategy similar to that of the MSZP's. Therefore, the results of the Prague investigation could even assume national importance. It appears to be particularly ingenious that Horn detailed the concept, which he published in Hungary about three weeks ago (and which received virtually no response here), in a Prague newspaper. Although the Czech Republic is not one of our neighbors, as a result of 70 years of shared history it is quite attuned to Hungarian sensitivity to Slovak foreign policy, while this "message from Budapest" may appear more credible if it comes to Bratislava through a Prague detour rather than in "direct transmission." It will be interesting to find out how [Slovak Prime Minister] Meciar (or Romanian President Iliescu, or perhaps Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic) reacts to this offer of Horn's, which speaks about mutual offers rather than bargaining. He did not say "if you give me the border issue, then I will give you the national minority rights" -- it was something completely different. This something different is the lesson of European history -- also being intended for domestic use. It shows that the problems of national minorities cannot be solved through reattaching territories. It also shows that only guaranteeing the borders, rather than changing them, can bring peace, however badly and unjustly they were established in the first place and, for this reason, the borders must to be made permeable and open. It shows that the members of a national minority must be free to meet their relatives over the border whenever they want and, on their return, books and newspapers in their language must not be confiscated by customs officers. It shows that these minorities must be allowed schools and choirs in their home country, and, living in one unit, they should be able to elect their leaders, have the same freedom as other citizens to start businesses, and, something that is not a reality but only a wish even in Western Europe: Owing to their predetermined disadvantage, they should enjoy a few more rights on certain issues than the others (positive discrimination). Bosnia and the disease tormenting Yugoslavia are examples of the opposite. Does anyone yearn for these? Before anyone tries to use the trump card of the "sold minorities" in the election campaign, he should consider this. [sentence as published] If he can.
