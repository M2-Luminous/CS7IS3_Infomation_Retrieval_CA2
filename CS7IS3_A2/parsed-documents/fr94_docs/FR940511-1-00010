FR940511-1-00010 FR940511-1-00001 (b) Preparation of mortgages . The closing agent will insure that all mortgages are properly prepared, completed, executed, and filed for record. Where applicable, the mortgages should recite that it is a purchase money mortgage. The following requirements will be observed in preparing FmHA mortgages: (1) Real estate mortgage forms. FmHA mortgage forms will be used in all cases and other FmHA forms will be used whenever possible. Form FmHA 1927&hyph;1, ``Real Estate Mortgage or Deed of Trust For XXX ,'' (state) will be used for all insured and direct loans except where Form FmHA 1927&hyph;7 (State), is used for all rural housing loans. These forms will be prepared and distributed in accordance with state supplements. When a loan is made to a homestead entryman or to a contract purchaser of a farm unit from the Bureau of Reclamation, a rider to Form FmHA 1927&hyph;1 will be used per state supplement. (2) Number of copies. (i) The original recorded mortgage is to be retained in the borrower's case file unless the original mortgage is retained by the recorder, and a conformed copy will be provided to the borrower. (ii) When the original is to be retained by the recorder, an original and two conformed copies will be prepared. One conformed copy will be retained in the borrower's case file and one conformed copy will be provided to the borrower. (iii) Extra copies of mortgages may be needed in individual cases in some participation loans, loans on reclamation projects, when security is taken on trust or restricted property involving loans to Native American, and other similar situations. (iv) The closing agent will distribute copies to appropriate parties at loan closing or as soon as possible thereafter. (3) Persons required to execute mortgage. The mortgage will be executed by the borrower and all other persons having an interest in the real property being mortgaged whose execution is necessary for FmHA to have the required lien priority, (for example, a spouse's right of dower or curtesy) so that, in the event of default, the mortgage will be enforceable against all such interests. Persons signing the promissory note and the mortgage will use exactly the same names which appear on the title. (i) When the applicant is a corporation or cooperative, the mortgage will be executed by the authorized officers on behalf of the corporation or cooperative. Authorization must be granted to the officers by either: (A) The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, or (B) A duly adopted resolution of the board of directors authorizing such execution and indicating which officers are authorized to execute the loan documents on behalf of the corporation/cooperative, unless applicable FmHA instruction or state law prohibits. The resolution must bear the certification of the corporate/cooperative secretary that it was duly adopted and not revoked and have the corporate seal affixed, if applicable, to be acceptable. When shareholder approval is necessary the resolution must recite that shareholder approval has been obtained. (ii) When the applicant is a partnership, the mortgage must be executed by the partners required by the partnership agreement to execute loan documents on its behalf. (iii) When the applicant is a trust, the requirements of the trust agreement and state law shall control as to who is authorized to execute the loan documents. (4) Date of Execution . The mortgage will be dated and executed on the same date as the promissory note. If necessary, the mortgage may be done on a different date provided it is not executed before the date of the note or after the date of closing. (5) Title exceptions . The mortgage will specifically describe all exceptions it will be subject to, if customary under local practice or required by state law or state supplement. The exceptions will normally be shown as part of or immediately following the legal description of the land and must be the same as shown on the final title opinion or mortgagee policy of title insurance. In cases where specific description of each exception to title is not customary or required, these exceptions may be described by use of a general statement similar to the following (unless inconsistent with applicable State law): ``Subject, however, to all outstanding covenants, conditions, restrictions, reservations, liens, encumbrances, easements, rights of way, leases, mineral, oil, gas and geothermal rights (with or without the right of surface entry), timber rights, water rights, judgements, pending court proceedings, probate proceedings and agreements which limit the title to the property.'' (6) Releasing or retaining existing mortgages in refinancing cases . When there is an outstanding FmHA real estate mortgage against the property and the loan secured by the mortgage is being refinanced with the current loan, the mortgage for the outstanding loan will be superseded and will be released at the time of loan closing, unless it is necessary under state law to keep the existing mortgage in effect to retain a valid lien of the same priority for the obligation being refinanced. (7) Describing notes in mortgages . In most cases, only the note(s) for the new loan(s) needs to be described when a subsequent loan is made and a subsequent mortgage is taken. The note(s) for any unpaid loan(s) secured by real estate will not be described in the mortgage unless the approval official determines: (i) It is necessary to do so to protect the government's interest, (ii) The description of the unpaid prior secured note(s) in the mortgage being taken would not result in a higher title insurance premium for the new mortgage, or (iii) State law requires that all original notes be presented when filing a security instrument. A State supplement should reflect this exception when applicable.
