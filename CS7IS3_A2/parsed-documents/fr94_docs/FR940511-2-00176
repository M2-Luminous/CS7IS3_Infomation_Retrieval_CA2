FR940511-2-00176 FR940511-2-00110 In order to facilitate daily pricing and margin evaluations, PTC intends to acquire Trepp's CMO pricing model. Currently, PTC receives a price tape from Trepp daily no later than 5 p.m. and meets regularly with representatives from Trepp regarding its pricing service. Nevertheless, as the volume of CMOs deposited at PTC increases, the on-site availability of the Trepp model should provide PTC with additional safeguards. 24 24 Letter from Michael D. Frieband, dated March 4, 1994, supra note 5. PTC's proposed methodology requires its model to predict accurately the market price of CMOs. Thus far, PTC's experience has been limited to comparing the predicted versus actual transation price of VA REMICs. 25 The data indicate that PTC's model has been reasonably accurate in predicting actual prices. 26 However, VA REMICs represent the most stable of CMOs given that VA mortgages are assumable, and therefore less subject to prepayment risk. Moreover, the structures of the VA REMICs so far issued and on deposit at PTC have not been particularly complicated. 25 VA REMICs are the only CMOs currently depository eligible at PTC. 26 See letter from Michael D. Frieband, dated August 17, 1993, supra note 5. Another concern raised by the proposed methodology relates to the prepayment projections on which it relies. The prepayment projections volunteered by twelve firms are averaged, but whether such quotes are executable is not considered. This may affect the accuracy of the prepayment speeds used to arrive at a market price for CMOs. Without accurate prepayment data, the predicted price might lag behind the market's true price by up to 30&hyph;45 days, when each agency issuing mortgage pass-through securities releases the actual prepayment factors 27 and settlement occurs. The interest rate volatilities of the underlying Treasuries from which the CMOs are priced can change 50&hyph;75 basis points over the course of 30&hyph;45 days. In part to address this concern, PTC has determined to use fifty basis points for purposes of running the stress test to establish margin. 28 27 A factor represents the fractional share of the original principal that remains in a given pool of mortgages comprising a mortgage pass-through security ( e.g., a factor of .7 indicates that 70% of a pool's principal remains). 28 See letter from Leopold S. Rassnick, dated March 21, 1994, supra note 5. The Commission believes that in granting PTC temporary approval of its CMO pricing methodology until April 30, 1995, PTC will be afforded an opportunity to gain experience with its methodology. In addition, the temporary approval period will allow PTC to take steps to address any concerns which exist with respect to its methodology. 29 29 PTC has represented that it will provide the following information to the Commission prior to the expiration of the temporary approval period: (1) PTC will explain what criteria it uses in identifying certain CMO tranches as more volatile and/or risky than other tranches. PTC will recalculate margin for any tranche whenever the Treasury yield curve has changed by 100 basis points from the time of original issue or last recalculation; however, until it establishes clear standards, PTC will reevaluate margins for all tranches at least twice a year, in addition to reevaluating selected tranches quarterly; (2) PTC will consider using a model other than its present modelling vendor to conduct the stress test (or serve as the present vendor's back up), as opposed to relying on a single vendor both for the stress test and as a source of daily pricing; (3) PTC will address the treatment of non-par issuances, which tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than other CMOs; (4) PTC will explain the method by which its present modelling source aligns a CMO with a referenced Treasury maturity; and (5) PTC has stated its intention to modify its systems software to make automated price comparisons possible, and PTC will expedite the automation of its comparison of predicted versus actual CMO transation price data.
