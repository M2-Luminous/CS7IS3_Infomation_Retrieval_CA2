ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This document modifies the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) distribution formula to allow States with incompatible intrastate regulations limited participation in only the basic grant program beyond October 1, 1994. It does not change the distribution formula pertaining to those States that have achieved compatibility with respect to both interstate and intrastate transportation. The revised formula is necessary to provide continued funding for States that have not achieved full compatibility in the enforcement of safety regulations applicable to intrastate transportation. Such States will be qualified through formula allocation, rather than suffering absolute loss of eligibility after September 30, 1994. DATES: This interim final rule is effective March 7, 1994. Comments on this interim final rule must be received on or before April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written, signed comments to FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;94&hyph;4, room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. All comments received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Taylor, Office of Motor Carrier Safety Field Operations (202) 366&hyph;6308, or Ms. Grace Reidy, Office of the Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;0834, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t. Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) was first authorized in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (sec. 404, Pub. L. 97&hyph;424, 96 Stat. 2097, 2156) and most recently reauthorized by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (sec. 4002, Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 2140) which was signed into law on December 19, 1991. The original authorization contained certain conditions States had to meet to be eligible for funding. One such condition required each State to adopt and enforce commercial motor vehicle safety regulations which are compatible with the Federal requirements. Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 350 was amended by a final rule published in the Federal Register on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 40946), to reflect the mandates of the ISTEA. The amended rule, among other things, defined compatibility, with respect to interstate applicability, to mean identical with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) and, with respect to intrastate applicability, to mean within the Tolerance Guidelines. The rule also required interstate compatibility to be achieved not later than October 1, 1993. The FHWA's Tolerance Guidelines, which set the compatibility requirements for intrastate regulations, were included in the new regulation as appendix C to part 350 and future funding under MCSAP was conditioned on achieving intrastate compatibility by October 1, 1994.
