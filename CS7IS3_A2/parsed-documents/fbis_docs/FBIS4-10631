He ignored the rules many times because he considered it necessary. He gave priority to the human facet of his work. Being a foreigner, he involved himself in internal affairs when he believed it would benefit the people. He condemned what was condemnable, he did not hide his annoyance over the government's arbitrary measures and, committing the serious crime of interference, he prevented a coup d'etat with a fierce communique, which possibly merited the disapproval of experts in international relations. It cannot be doubted, Mr. Glassman, that you have done a lot more for this country than many politicians who stress that they are fighting for the needs of the people, and yet take advantage of them when they can. It is a pity that he is leaving. Even at the risk of sticking my nose into the internal affairs of your country, I decry your government's decision to deprive us of a much valued and honorable person who was not afraid to lose the confidence of the Paraguayan authorities if that helped consolidate the national process. It would have been very significant for us for him to have continued as head of the U.S. Embassy in these times. We Paraguayans know that things are not going well, that there are too many people interested in returning this country to the past, and that it is those people who have the decisionmaking power within the government. Up to the present, we have only had you to confront the power of those persons, their lack of decency, and their arrogance. The only hope we have now is that your successor will not respect diplomatic rules, and yes, that he will respect democracy, the banner that you raised so bravely. There are very powerful sources in Paraguay that have decided that the country must return to the dark age of dictatorship. We decent Paraguayans have decided not to allow this backward step, because in this process we have taken risks, and have many times lost too many things and dear ones, which demands from us the final victory. But we also need the international community to support us. Paraguay was an island that the world ignored during the Stroessner dictatorship. Your country supported the dictator when this coincided with its interests. We do not want that to occur again. Only with the help of the world's democratic nations can we prevent a return to the dark ages, a move desired by those who hold power today. For this reason we need experts in diplomacy. We do not want people who stick to the rules, to protocol. We want persons who will stick out their necks when it is necessary to consolidate a process that has lasted too long already and has shed so much Paraguayan blood. We need someone like you. There is no doubt about it: You will not receive an award as the best diplomat, but please accept the thanks of a people who are trying to get out of the dark, and who have mortgaged all their efforts in order to achieve this. Thank you, Mr. Glassman, and so long.
