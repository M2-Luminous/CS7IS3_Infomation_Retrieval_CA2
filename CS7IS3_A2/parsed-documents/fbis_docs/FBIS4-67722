What morals! -- What else can be said after hearing that a female employee of an intimacy club infected her two year old son with syphilis last year. In 1993, overall, according to data from the State Clinical Center for Skin Diseases (formerly the Skin and Venereal Disease Dispensary), in the course of everyday life, "thanks" to their parents, two children have developed gonorrhea and two syphilis. According to the figures for last year, the morbidity rate increased three-fold for syphilis, 1.2 fold for gonorrhea, while the morbidity rate for fungal diseases increased 1.2 fold, and urogenital chlamydial infection was a common diagnosis. Furthermore, these are not absolute indices, only the registered cases, and many people seek the services of private medical firms for treatment of their venereal diseases. A three-fold increase in syphilis is a very high index, and the prognosis by specialists at the center is that syphilis morbidity will not decline. In 1993, 45 per 100,000 inhabitants suffered from this disease in 1993 (in 1992, the respective number was 13), with the majority being women, and for gonorrhea -- the respective number was 204 (153 in 1992), with the majority being men. In 1992, those suffering from venereal diseases were persons with a higher education, while last year, 69% of all patients had a mid-level education, 53% -- from 20 to 29 years of age. Unfortunately, the statistics for last year show that even 13 to 14 year old girls have had to seek help from venereal disease specialists. Children are primarily infected by fungal diseases -- which are passed on to them by infected animals. There is quite a number of "wild" cats roaming the streets of Riga, and, therefore, parents should look out for their children. In comparison with 1992, the number of skin disease cases was lower for this past year. Deputy chief physician Dace Galvina explains this as related to the institution of patient fees, and the relocation of dermatologists to the State Clinical Center for Skin Diseases, the result of which is that patients from the outlying rayons of the city do not visit these specialists. Likewise, lice infestation, or pediculosis, is becoming more widespread. Not only head lice, but also clothing lice have been observed. They are primarily being spread by vagrants, beggars and the very poor. In Riga, there are two locations where a person can be deloused -- the bathhouse at 249 Brivibas Street and the Riga Disinfection Station -- but because there is lack of means, not everyone can afford to pay for this service. Dr. Galvina reminds us that during the first six months of this year, while the Center for Sexually Transmitted Diseases is being set up on Pernavas Street, patients may visit venereal disease specialists at the State Clinical Center for Skin Diseases.
