Gein was created in mid-1989 at the initiative of Major Benedicto Jimenez Blaco, a brilliant Dincote officer whose obsession was to capture Abimael Guzman. His dedication, almost romantic, to the struggle against terrorism was known among his colleagues. Jimenez convinced chiefs and those under him that the only way to capture the Shining Path founder, the author of the so-called "Gonzalo thoughts," was through the systematic use of intelligence information. With the support of former Dincote Director General Fernando Reyes Roca, Benedicto Jimenez began the training of about 15 selected policemen. But it was still an improvised and not very coherent group. Later, the new Dincote director, General John Caro, gave the organization a real push until he made it into an efficient intelligence organization. Gein increased its specialized personnel to 53, and without any doubt the best thing it did then was to locate the refuge of Abimael Guzman on 31 January 1991. It was a house located on Bellavista de Chacarilla Street. Police found the famous video showing Guzman dancing to "Zorba the Greek" there, a large amount of internal documents on the Shining Path and its main members, and cassettes with the voice of Abimael Guzman. This work was decisive for Guzman's capture in September 1992. Gein reached its peak with Ketin Vidal, who took over as Dincote chief in December 1991. The number of its special agents went to 83. Dincote personnel talked with humor about "Benedicto thoughts" in contrast to the Shining Path's "Gonzalo thoughts." At the same time, Dincote operational units, the Deltas and Divicotes, received major logistical support with high-technology electronic equipment. Examples: small wireless telephones that are very easy to install anywhere, highly sensitive electronic "ears" capable of hearing and recording conversations from 60 to 80 meters away or through walls to hear a conversation, and photographic cameras and film equipment to capture images in the dark. Abimael Guzman's capture gave major popularity to Dincote and especially to its chief, Ketin Vidal. According to some analysts, this situation made some prominent government members jealous, who decided to transfer Vidal to an administrative position in the National Police. Later the SIN swallowed the best-qualified group in Gein. Benedicto Jimenez and about 20 of his men joined the SIN on orders from the authorities. Jimenez is now an instructor in this national intelligence organization. In this regard, a top police officer whose identity we obviously must keep confidential said: "What happens is that the SIN is now the organization that wants to score the points. The SIN, which for years was not able to form a qualified countersubversion team, now wants to improve its image, and to do that it brought the best Dincote scorers into its ranks. The idea is that from now on the success will be by SIN and not Dincote. According to the National Defense System, Dincote is regarded as merely an operations unit. It is not in charge of any intelligence work, but was forced to do so in view of the fact that they needed precise intelligence information on the Shining Path. The SIN, which was supposed to provide this information, was unable to do so. Gein made up for this deficiency. The government now has ordered strengthening and giving more importance to the SIN, headed by Division General Julio Salazar Monroe, although many believe that the "de facto" SIN chief is retired Captain Vladimiro Montesinos Torres. The SIN is the main organization that collects the work produced by its subunits: The Army Intelligence Service (SIE), the Navy Intelligence Directorate (Dina), and the Air Force Intelligence Directorate (Difap). According to the established scheme, the SIN chief has the status of a minister of state. He presides over a small cabinet that submits a daily report containing strategic information at a nationwide level on the military, non-military, and sectorial areas to the president of the Republic's office. This report includes updated socio-economic, political, and psycho-social information. The intelligences services subject to the Interior Ministry (among them is the Dincote intelligence group) fall under the Interior Ministry Intelligence General Directorate [Direccion General de Inteligencia del Ministerio del Interior] (Digimint). Will the strengthening of SIN harm the country? We asked former Dincote chief Gen. John Caro, who now has become an analyst of the terrorism phenomenon, this question. "It might affect Dincote but not the country. Let us wait and see. I hope that with well-trained personnel and the modernization of its technology, SIN will do a good job. We know that the Shining Path remains in Ene Valley, Huallaga, and other areas of the country. In the struggle against terrorism, precise intelligence information will always be welcome wherever it comes from. Now we probably will have a real national intelligence service that will be better than that provided by Dincote in metropolitan Lima." After consulting various sources, it can be said that Dincote will not be broken up or dissolved as some extremist versions have stated. Dincote has experienced a moderate reduction of personnel but at a level that does not affect its operational capacity. Moreover, its logistical equipment has not been transferred to other units as some have stated. The recent arrest in Chiclayo of an important MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] cell, including an Italian terrorist who belongs to the terrorist group, was the result of intelligence work by Bredet [Special Brigade of Detectives Specialized in Terrorism]-Dincote, headed by Colonel Juan Gonzales Sandoval. However, aside from this operation, the number of significant arrests has dropped. Dincote's actions seem to have shrunk. Gen. John Caro tries to explain: "The catch tends to drop when many fish in the same pond have been fished. We already have arrested between 80 and 85 percent of the leadership. There are some 15 to 20 percent that remain to be arrested. This does not mean that Dincote has lowered its guard. But it is a fact that it will more difficult to arrest them now because they are alert. The cost of each arrest, logically, will increase because a lot more fuel, a lot more personnel are necessary..."
