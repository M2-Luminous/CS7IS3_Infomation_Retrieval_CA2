Brussels and Paris are saying that it is out of the question to do anything other than protect foreign nationals.

He is currently in France: [Begin Compaore recording] We felt a lot of pain when we heard the news because we believe that the Rwandan people do not deserve this. However, we can see that Africa, unfortunately, is going to go through many other tests before it achieves its democratization, because we have historic limits which prevent us from going forward at the rate hoped for by the people and even by the international community, but we trust that the Africans will manage to establish their nations and, of course, to preserve their freedoms. This, of course, will have to be with the support of the international community. [end recording]
