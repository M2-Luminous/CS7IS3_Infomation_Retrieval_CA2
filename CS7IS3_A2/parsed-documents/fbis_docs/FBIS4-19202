"We will never again return beneath the yoke of Saddam's brutal dictatorship," the secretary general of the "Patriotic Union of Kurdistan" said at a Kurdish-German event. Talabani stressed that the Kurdish federal state in northern Iraq, which was proclaimed in 1992, can and will survive. "We are well organized and we are willing to pay the price for it," he stated. The next goal is the liberation of those oil-rich parts of Kurdistan that are still occupied by the Iraqi military at the moment. He complained that the Kurds in this region are not only persecuted by Baghdad but also suffer under the sanctions imposed by the United Nations. He affirmed Kurdish solidarity with the other Iraqi opposition groups in the struggle against the regime in Baghdad. Accusations of separatism are completely unfounded, he said. The Kurds want the establishment of a democratic Iraq with a federal system as the best guarantee to preserve their cultural identity. Talabani, who also met with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn, criticized Western politicians, who see Saddam's regime as the guarantor of Iraq's unity. In reality, the dictatorship is the greatest enemy of unity, because it divides the nation, Talabani stressed.
