In addressing the conference, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out: Propaganda and ideological work has a close bearing on the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all levels must attach great importance to this task. They must strengthen their leadership and shoulder responsibility in this regard. He stressed: Propaganda and ideological work requires arming people's minds with scientific theories, guiding them with correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring them with outstanding works so that generations of socialist-minded people who have lofty ideals, who are ethical and educated, and who have a high sense of discipline can be constantly trained and cultivated, and so that during the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we will have a powerful ideological guarantee and the support of the media. Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren Jianxin, and other comrades attended the conference, which was chaired by Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat, and head of the Propaganda Department, of the CPC Central Committee. The main agenda of the conference is to study ways and means to intensify and improve ideological and propaganda work under the new situation, doing so under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and that of the party's basic line, by following the guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and by following the principle of being firm in carrying out material construction and promoting socialist ethics at the same time. In his speech, General Secretary Jiang Zemin focused on issues in three respects: first, the importance of intensifying propaganda and ideological work during the new period; second, the basic guidelines and major tasks of propaganda and ideological work; and third, the party must intensify and improve its leadership over propaganda and ideological work. Jiang Zemin said he hoped that the conference will enable party leaders at all levels and comrades working on the propaganda and ideological front to have a clearer idea of the task of overall importance, achieve a consensus of views, and work earnestly with higher morale so as to create a new situation for propaganda and ideological work, and do an even better job of rallying and inspiring the vast number of party members and people to push forward the cause of reform, opening up, and modernization. Jiang Zemin pointed out: The basic policy of the work of the whole party is, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and that of the party's basic line, to fully implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and its third plenary session; speed up the building of the socialist market economic system; maintain the sustained, fast, and healthy development of the national economy; safeguard social stability; and promote social progress in all sectors. The most important mission of the party is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability. All party comrades must understand this mission of overall importance, obey and serve this mission, and take the initiative in accomplishing the work in all fields as required by this mission. Jiang Zemin said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the basic guiding principle for all party projects. Comrades working on the propaganda and ideological front must firmly adhere to this basic guideline and use it as the guide for all their work. Jiang Zemin said: Today and in the time to come, we must pay special attention to the work in four respects. First, the most important task of the propaganda and ideological front is to arm the minds of all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Second, we must persist in implementing the party's basic line and in providing public opinion with the proper guidance. Third, we must make ideological education a success to bring up people who have lofty ideas, who are ethical and educated, and who have a high sense of discipline, so as to expedite socialist spiritual construction. Fourth, we must adhere to the course of serving the people and socialism, uphold the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend, foster the main theme, and bring about a boom in socialist literature and art. Jiang Zemin stressed: While promoting socialist spiritual construction through propaganda and cultural work, we must do several things. First, we must give top priority to its social results [ba she hui xiao yi fang zai shou wei] and integrate economic and social results on this basis. Second, we should approach our nation's traditional culture and culture from abroad with a scientific attitude. Third, we must persist in spiritual construction and place emphasis on construction and better management. Jiang Zemin also fully endorsed the results achieved by the comrades working on the propaganda and ideological front. He said: The vast number of comrades on the propaganda and ideological front are loyal to the cause of the party and the people, and they have accomplished a good deal of work in publicizing the party's basic theory and basic line; in promoting reform, opening up, and modernization; and in promoting socialist ethics, and they have made significant contributions in those areas. Jiang Zemin stressed: The Central Party Committee trusts the contingent of propaganda and ideological workers, and the party and the people have high hopes for them. Under Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, I hope that you will make every effort to achieve even greater success, press forward, and work hard to bring propaganda and ideological work to a new level.
