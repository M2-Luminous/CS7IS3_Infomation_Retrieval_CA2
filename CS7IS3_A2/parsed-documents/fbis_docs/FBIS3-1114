Speaking at an ANC rally in King William's Town, he said the most recent Goldstone report had identified senior police officers as having been involved in the campaign of violence and death that had taken place in South Africa for many years. "I am certain that the ANC is going to pursue this matter no matter how high it reaches," he said. "It doesn't matter how high people are, it does not matter how big their titles, it doesn't matter where they are within the politics of South Africa. "The terrorists must be punished." This was a responsibility the organisation owed both to the democratic process and to its people throughout the country. It was a precondition to free and fair elections. Mr Mbeki also said the commission's report gave the lie to the belief that what had been happening in South Africa was black-on-black violence. "What is Goldstone saying? It's not black-on-black violence. It's people who are opposed to change, people who like apartheid, people who want to maintain apartheid (who were responsible). "It was the violence of the apartheid system against our people. It was a violence carried out over many decades to ensure that our oppression continued."
