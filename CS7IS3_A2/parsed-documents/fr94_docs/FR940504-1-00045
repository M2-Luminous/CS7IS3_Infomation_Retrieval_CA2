However, NMFS is not requesting public comment on the redesignated paragraphs. Classification NMFS prepared an analysis of the economic impact on small entities as part of the EA/RIR. All vessels using trawl gear to harvest BSAI or GOA groundfish and processors receiving trawl-caught groundfish could be affected by the management measures proposed under this action. Most catcher vessels harvesting groundfish off Alaska meet the definition of a small entity under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In 1993, 265 catcher vessels were issued permits to harvest groundfish with trawl gear in Federal waters. All these vessels could be affected due to adjustments in fishing patterns resulting from (1) changing the season of the BSAI flatfish fisheries, and (2) revising the management of the GOA halibut PSC limit established for trawl fisheries. These effects are not expected to result in a reduction in annual gross revenues by more than 5 percent, annual compliance costs that would increase total costs of production by more than 5 percent, or compliance costs for small entities that are at least 10 percent higher than compliance costs as a percent of sales for large entities. Therefore, the proposed action would not result in a ``significant economic impact'' on small entities under the RFA. A copy of the EA/RIR is available (see ADDRESSES ). This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675 Fisheries, Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Dated: April 28, 1994. John T. Everett, Acting Deputy Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR parts 672 and 675 are proposed to be amended as follows:
