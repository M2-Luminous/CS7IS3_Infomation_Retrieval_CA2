Spanish Scent Big Money"] [Text] Madrid-Barcelona -- The Bosnia crisis could not spoil the atmosphere of the Russian-Spanish dialogue in Madrid. B. Yeltsin and Premier F. Gonzalez called it very successful and interesting. Boris Yeltsin advised that so far Russia and Spain have been trading very badly -- Spain accounts for just 2 percent of Russia's foreign trade turnover. In a frank and categorical way he attempted to win over around 200 top Spanish businessmen with whom he held a business lunch at the Ritz Hotel. The president announced that the government is currently drawing up new foreign economic legislation which will envisage, in particular, the granting of most-favored status to foreign investors and the creation of conditions for delivering goods to the Russian market similar to those which exist for Russian producers. Admittedly, despite the well-known pressure on him in Russia, he did not reject the use of import tariffs as an instrument for regulating foreign trade. The businessmen listened with interest to the president's promise to provide guarantees for investors against any political surprises. Certain specific proposals were also voiced -- to modernize several oil refineries and even to get involved in opening up oil fields in Udmurtia and Krasnoyarsk Kray. The Spanish scented big money in these proposals. They have all been beaten to the punch by Pedro Balvye [name as transliterated], president of the Campofrio meat processing concern. Having taken a chance on investing in Russia several years ago, this concern is now not only operating successfully in Moscow but is even building another major plant. Visiting a Campofrio enterprise near Madrid, Boris Yeltsin was clearly surprised in one shop to see large hams going round on a mechanical carousel. Many Russian tourists even think that these popular smoked hams, to be found in every Spanish bar and restaurant looking as natural as if they had been painted by Rubens, are plaster casts. The journalists were waiting for the tasting, and were speculating on which wine the president would choose to accompany the ham. But they were disappointed -- he did not touch anything. At a press conference an Italian journalist asked Boris Yeltsin about his health. The president replied: "I would like everyone my age to have the same health as I have. I play tennis, swim in the Black Sea in March when the water temperature is four degrees, and work 16-18 hours a day with hardly any days off. I would like to make the following offer to those who try to upset me by talking about my health: I am prepared to undergo an all-day checkup [dispanserizatsiya] with journalists present. Let the doctors do their examinations and produce their analyses, and then everyone will know my state of health."
