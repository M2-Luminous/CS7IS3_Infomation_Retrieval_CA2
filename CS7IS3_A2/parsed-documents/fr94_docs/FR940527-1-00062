FR940527-1-00062 FR940527-1-00014 As demonstrated by the above tables, our analyses showed that none of the MSA-based options consistently outperformed the current estimated FY 1995 post-reclassified wage index in terms of wage conformity within labor market areas and wage conformity across labor market areas. With respect to wage conformity within labor market areas, the results in Table A demonstrate that the 20-mile radius hospital-specific option, with 549 losing hospitals, best reduces the number of hospitals with wage index values more than .08 below their own wage level. The FY 1995 post-reclassified wage index was second best, with 590 hospitals with wage index values more than .08 below their own wage level. The 20-mile radius approach also produced the fewest number of hospitals (1014) with wage index values more than .08 above their own wage levels. However, as demonstrated in Table B, the estimated FY 1995 post-reclassified wage index outperformed the other labor market options, with only 559 hospitals whose own average hourly wages were 108 percent or more of their respective labor market area's average hourly wage. Therefore, the 20-mile radius and the estimated FY 1995 post-reclassified wage indexes demonstrated somewhat better outcomes for wage conformity within labor market areas than any of the other options we studied. With respect to wage conformity across labor market areas (``boundary problems''), as indicated in Table C, the estimated FY 1995 post-reclassified wage index generated the fewest hospitals having boundary problems (662), with the central-outlying MSA option having the second lowest number of such hospitals (712). All of the nearest neighbor options, including the 20-mile radius option (with 1,041 hospitals), had the effect of significantly increasing the number of boundary problems that would occur, although the problems were of a smaller magnitude. Overall, none of the MSA-based options or the nearest neighbor options consistently outperformed the current estimated FY 1995 post-reclassification wage index. While the 20-mile radius option performed well in terms of wage conformity within labor market areas, it performed significantly worse than the current system with respect to wage conformity across labor market areas. Additionally, with respect to the distributional effects of all the options, none demonstrated any measurable improvement in payment equity across hospital groups. Therefore, we are not presenting any tables concerning the distributional effect in this discussion. We have decided not to propose changes to labor market areas for FY 1995 because we believe that neither revisions to the current MSA-based system or the nearest neighbors labor market options that we studied constitute a clearly demonstrable improvement over the current system. b. Options for Future Wage Index Refinements Using Combined MSA/Hospital-Specific Approach. While none of the alternative labor market areas that we studied, whether based on current MSA definitions or the ``nearest neighbor'' approach, provided a distinct improvement over the current reclassification wage index, we believe a classification system that uses a combination of both approaches has considerable potential for improving the wage index. Discussed below are some options for further study that we believe may offer a viable alternative to the current system by taking into consideration all of the varying factors that affect a hospital's labor market. Each of these options is based on a weighted average of each hospital's own average hourly wages and the average hourly wages of a group of other hospitals. The following concepts and assumptions underlie the wage index options that we are now analyzing: â€¢Empirically defining labor market areas in a highly accurate, definitive manner is extremely difficult, if not impossible. MSAs and statewide rural areas may be reasonably accurate in many cases, but in other cases, these areas may be larger than a hospital's ``true'' labor market area. None of the methodologies we studied for subdividing MSAs and/or statewide rural areas or for designing nearest neighbor labor market areas proved to have been demonstrably more accurate than the current system.
