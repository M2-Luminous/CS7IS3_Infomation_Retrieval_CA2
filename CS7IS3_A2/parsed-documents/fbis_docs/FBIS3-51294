Journalists who visited an EZLN camp for the first time have reported that the EZLN leader known as "Major Mario" has announced that the EZLN Indian Clandestine Committee will answer very soon the government concerning its dialogue proposals. "Major Mario" has denied the EZLN is attempting to establish socialism, but he insisted that the Indians and peasants will struggle for the fulfillment of the 10 points of their program: democracy, jobs, fraud-free elections, independence, land for peasants, jobs [as received], housing, health, justice and education. The Zapatista leader said the war will not end until these demands are met, and the EZLN will not disarm, because, he said, "we would rather die fighting with dignity than from cholera and measles and repressed by landowners;" we want freedom, the right to express ourselves, democracy, and true peace. "Major Mario" assured that the EZLN has respected the truce, but the Army has continued to attack, and the EZLN rebels have orders to defend themselves and have only responded to the attacks. Concerning rapprochement with Manuel Camacho, commissioner for peace and reconciliation, "Major Mario" has said this decision must be made by "Commander Marcos;" he added that the rebels are Mexicans and natives of Chiapas who acknowledge Mexico's flag and national anthem. In response to a question on war casualties, the Zapatista rebel denounced that the Army murdered civilians, dressed them as Zapatistas and blamed the EZLN for their murder. "Major Mario" said the Army is no longer dealing with unarmed peasants. "Major Mario" said the uprising was decided by the Clandestine Committee after seeking out every legal path, finding no results. The government has destroyed Article 27 of the Constitution, and the North American Free Trade Agreement will only foster poverty.
