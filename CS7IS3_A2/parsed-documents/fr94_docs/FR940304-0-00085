FR940304-0-00085 FR940304-0-00019 Axis deer ( Axis axis ), native to Sri Lanka and India, were first introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1868 as a game animal on Molokai, later to Oahu and Lanai, and finally to east Maui in 1960. Hunting of axis deer is allowed only on Molokai and Lanai during 2 months of the year (Hawaii DLNR 1985, Tomich 1986). The animal constitutes a threat to Mariscus fauriei on Molokai and a potential threat to Ischaemum byrone and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense on Molokai and Maui (HHP 1991x5, HPCC 1990b, Medeiros et al . 1986; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). Cattle ( Bos taurus ), the wild progenitor of which was native to Europe, northern Africa, and southwestern Asia, were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1793. Large feral herds developed as a result of restrictions on killing cattle decreed by King Kamehameha I. While small cattle ranches were developed on Kauai, Oahu, and west Maui, very large ranches of tens of thousands of acres were created on east Maui and Hawaii. Much of the land used in these private enterprises was leased from the State or was privately owned and considered Forest Reserve and/or Conservation District land. On Kauai, both sides of Waimea Canyon were supporting large cattle ranching operations by the 1870s (Ryan and Chang 1985). Feral cattle roamed Oahu, but most were removed by the early 1960s; today only a few can be found in the northwestern part of the island (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1990). Feral cattle were formerly found on Molokai and Maui and damaged the forests there. Feral cattle can presently be found on the island of Hawaii, and ranching is still a major commercial activity there. Hunting of feral cattle is no longer allowed in Hawaii (Hawaii DLNR 1985). Cattle eat native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, create disturbed areas into which alien plants invade, and spread seeds of alien plants in their feces and on their bodies. The forest in areas grazed by cattle becomes degraded to grassland pasture, and plant cover is reduced for many years following removal of cattle from an area. Several alien grasses and legumes purposely introduced for cattle forage have become noxious weeds (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Tomich 1986). The habitats of many of the plants in this rule were degraded in the past by feral cattle, and this has had effects which still persist. Some taxa in this rule are still being directly affected by cattle. These include: Clermontia lindseyana , Cyanea hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii , Cyanea stictophylla , and Nothocestrum breviflorum (HHP 1991a1, 1991p4, 1991p5, HPCC 1990b, 1991a, 1991h; F. Duvall and A. Medeiros, pers. comms., 1992). Goats ( Capra hircus ), a species originally native to the Middle East and India, were successfully introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1792, and currently there are populations on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. On Kauai, feral goats have been present in drier, more rugged areas since 1820; they still occur in Waimea Canyon. Goats have been on Oahu since about 1820, and they currently occur in the northern Waianae Mountains. On Molokai, goats degrade dry forests at low elevations. On Maui, goats have been widespread for 100 to 150 years and are common throughout the south slope of Haleakala (Medeiros et al . 1986). On Hawaii, goats damage low-elevation dry forest, montane parkland, subalpine woodlands, and alpine grasslands. Goats are managed in Hawaii as a game animal, but many herds populate inaccessible areas where hunting has little effect on their numbers. Goat hunting is allowed year-round or during certain months, depending on the area (Hawaii DLNR n.d., 1985). Goats browse on introduced grasses and native plants, especially in drier and more open ecosystems. They also trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants. They are able to forage in extremely rugged terrain and have a high reproductive capacity (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988, Tomich 1986). Clermontia lindseyana , Mariscus fauriei , Ochrosia kilaueaensis , Portulaca sclerocarpa , Silene hawaiiensis , Tetramolopium arenarium , and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense are currently threatened by goats (Bruegmann 1990, CPC 1990, HHP 1991s5, 1991x5, HPCC 1990b; R. Hobdy, A. Medeiros, and R. Shaw, pers. comms., 1992), and Ischaemum byrone is potentially threatened by the animal (HHP 1991m11; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). Sheep ( Ovis aries ) have become firmly established on the island of Hawaii (Tomich 1986) since their introduction almost 200 years ago (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Like feral goats, sheep roam the upper elevation dry forests of Mauna Kea (above 3,300 ft (1,000 m)), including PTA, causing damage similar to that of goats (Stone 1985). Sheep have decimated vast areas of native forest and shrubland on Mauna Kea and continue to do so as a managed game species. Sheep threaten the habitat of at least two previously listed endangered species as well as the following plant species included in this rule: Portulaca sclerocarpa , Silene hawaiiensis , Tetramolopium arenarium , and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, HHP 1991s4, HPCC 1990a, 1990b, Shaw et al . 1990, Stone 1985; K. Nagata and R. Shaw, pers. comms., 1992).
