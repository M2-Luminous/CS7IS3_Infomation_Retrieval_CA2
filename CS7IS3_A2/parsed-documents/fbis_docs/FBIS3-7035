Noting that the South Korean workers now are subsisting on unprecedented-in-scale starvation wages due to the Kim Yong-sam group's anti-popular labor policy and wage-curbing steps, the white paper cites concrete facts proving this. According to the white paper, the wages conditions of South Korean workers can be seen graphically in the size of their nominal wages per hour which are a meagre one-eighth or one-ninth of those in Western countries and far below those of the workers in Asian capitalist countries. The wages gap between workers in South Korea is very wide, depending on their schooling and sex. A South Korean university professor said the difference between uneducated workers and university graduates in terms of income was in a ratio of 1 to 37 in case of men and 1 to 54 in case of women. Wages of South Korean female workers account for only 42.6 percent of male workers. The proportion of women among the young workers aged between 13 and 29 in South Korea is 58 percent. Mainly engaging themselves in the fibre, shoemaking, toymaking and electronic industries, women are forced to slave labor of 12 to 16 hours a day on low monthly wages of 300,000 or 400,000 won. Worse still, South Korean workers have to do extra-hour work for three or five days a week, yet not a few workers are paid less than the "minimum wages" fixed by the puppets in the "Labor Law". Their wages are far below the minimum living cost and, to make matters worse, they have to pay most of the meagre wages in taxes, instead of using them to keep the pot boiling. At present, more than 200 kinds of taxes are levied upon the workers in South Korea. Even according to data released by the puppet authorities, the rate of tax burdens in South Korea rose to 20.2 percent in 1994 from 16.5 percent of 1986, and the amount of tax burdens per head of the population increased to 1,316,000 won in 1994 from 1,125,000 won of 1993. In case of a family of five they have to pay 6.58 million won per annum in taxes. The workers' wages in South Korea are too insignificant compared with the annually rising commodity prices. A South Korean newspaper reported that the rate of the jump of consumer prices in the 1983-93 period was not 68.7 percent published by the authorities but five times higher than that. House purchasing prices in South Korea are five to six times those in the United States and Japan which are believed highest in the world. If a wage-earner with a monthly pay of 400,000 won is to buy a flat of 20 phyong (one phyong equals six feet square), he has to save his wages for more than 50 years, neither eating nor spending. South Korean primary school children must pay more than 820,000 won, middle school pupils 970,000 won and high school students 1,230,000 won annually. Besides, there are miscellaneous fees of various names they have to pay monthly, which run into hundreds of thousands of won. Most of the workers who want their children to go to high school or university have to make them do their own cooking. In this case, monthly charges for a boarding room alone amount to 310,000 to 370,000 won. The South Korean workers today are suffering from chronic occupational diseases and all kinds of illness as they are forced into high-intensity labor for long hours under coarse work conditions. In South Korea a medical examination costs 5,000 won, and a medical checkup for antigen, electrocardiogram and the stomach consumes respectively 8,000, 8,500 and 13,000 won. Charges for an operation on the stomach are 300,000 won, an operation on appendicitis 100,000 won, and a cornea transplanting operation 180,000 won. When hopitalized, a patient must pay more than 10,000 won a day, excepting the cost of medicines. When all this is taken into consideration, the South Korean workers' wages account for less than one fourth of the actual cost of living. This notwithstanding, the comprador businesses under the patronage of the ruling quarters frequently go without paying the small amount of wages of the workers for several months. According to doctored figures published by the competent authorities of South Korea, the unpaid wages of workers in South Korea in recent years added up to 298.1 billion won. The practice of "keeping wages in arrears" is getting all the more serious since the traitor Kim Yong-sam came to power. According to data, 241 businesses in South Korea were keeping in arrears wages to the tune of 58.1 billion won early this year. This is five times the figure in the corresponding period of 1992. (South Korean newspaper TONGA ILBO, Feb. 4, 1994). The South Korean newspaper HANGYORE SHINMUN predicted that the "wages in arrears" would grow further due to the new regime's "tough wage-curbing policy". The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to enforce wage-curbing measures like the "no work, no pay" system and the "total wages" system, distorting the reality by arguing that the economic crisis of South Korea resulted from the workers' struggle for a higher pay. It is trying to justify its low wages policy with the rhetoric of "economic rejuvination." When labor-management disputes over the wages problem broke out, the traitor Kim Yong-sam revealed his true class color, contrary to his calls for "hardship sharing" and "common destiny", by siding with the management and brandishing the sword at the workers. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique vowed to make this year the "first year" free of "labor-management disputes", openly betraying its scheme to crack down brutally on the workers' struggle for the right to live. This is an outspoken declaration of war of the "civilian" fascist dictator against the labor movement. The traitor Kim Yong-sam has squandered money earned with the sweat and blood of workers in arms buildup. According to the content of the 1994 "budgetary expenditures" finalized and published by the South Korean "economic planning agency", military spendings go far beyond 10,000 billion won, or up 9.6 percent from last year in scale. By contrast, the fund earmarked for the "welfare of the working people" accounts for less than one 300th of the military expenditures. All this shows that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a fascist dictator, kingpin of plunder and war fanatic stepping up war preparations by bleeding the laboring masses white with the strong arm. If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique continues to suppress this year the workers' struggle for their elementary right to live, including their demand for a higher pay, at the point of the bayonet, laying the blame for the economic bankruptcy of South Korea at the door of the workers, it would result in precipitating its own destruction.
