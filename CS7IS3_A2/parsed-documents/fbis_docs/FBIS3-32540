We do not need to bring in labor forces, not even to carry out exercises. [Humberto de la Calle, Liberal Party] I think this sort of operation was mishandled from the very beginning. It should have been clearly explained and not with half-truths. [Miguel Maza Marques, Conservative Party] Besides blowing it by allowing their presence, the country has been lied to. This is, in my opinion, a doubly unfortunate position by the president. [Gabriel Melo, Conservative Party] That was a shameful agreement. Foreign troops were granted permission to bear arms, use all ports and airports, and conduct emergency night flights, according to the agreement. All this to build a small school? [Carlos Lemos, Liberal Party] The country has not been told the truth. Proof of this is that when the defense minister returned to work after a heart ailment, he told the country that it was about time to clarify what had happened in Juanchaco and other parts of the nation. [Enrique Parejo, Conservative Party] I do not think they fooled the president. Who knows what is behind all this. Therefore, it is important the president explain.
