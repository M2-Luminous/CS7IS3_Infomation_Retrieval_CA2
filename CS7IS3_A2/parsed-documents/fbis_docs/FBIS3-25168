The newspaper said that the remarks by the president put an end to rumors appearing in parts of the French press that Cameroon would leave the franc zone in the wake of the devaluation of the CFA franc in mid-January. The leader of the radical opposition, John Fru Ndi, suggested that Cameroon should exit the zone and create its own currency.
