FR940822-1-00016 FR940822-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 20 RIN 1018&hyph;AC66 Migratory Bird Hunting; Conditional Approval of Bismuth-Tin Shot as Nontoxic for the 1994&hyph;95 Seasons AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This is to inform the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is proposing in this notice to conditionally approve bismuth-tin shot as nontoxic for waterfowl and coot hunting during the 1994&hyph;95 waterfowl hunting season. Available information and data from studies indicate that bismuth-tin shot is nontoxic to migratory waterfowl if ingested. Further studies will be required to confirm these preliminary conclusions. DATES: Comments on this proposal must be received by September 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments regarding this Notice should be addressed to: Director (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 634 ARLSQ, 1849 C St., NW, Washington, D.C. 20240. Comments received on this Notice will be available for public inspection during normal business hours in Room 634 Arlington Square Building, 4401 No. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Paul R. Schmidt, Chief, or Dr. Keith A. Morehouse, Staff Specialist, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 634 ARLSQ, 1849 C St., NW, Washington, D.C. 20240 (703/358&hyph;1714). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Service is proposing on an interim basis to conditionally approve the use of bismuth-tin shot (in a mixture of [nominally] 97&hyph;3 percents, respectively) as nontoxic for the taking of waterfowl and coots during the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season. This proposed action responds to a petition for rulemaking by the Bismuth Cartridge Company, dated June 14, 1994, and received by the Service on June 24, 1994. Specifically, the petition requests that the Service modify the provisions of 50 CFR, section 20.21(j), to make legal the use of bismuth-tin shot on an interim, conditional basis for the 1994&hyph;95 and the 1995&hyph;96 seasons. The Bismuth Cartridge Company petition acknowledges responsibility for completion of the nontoxic shot approval procedures studies outlined in 50 CFR, 20.134, before final approval is considered. The petition for rulemaking cites as reasons in support of the proposal the following: a) bismuth is nontoxic; b) the proposed rule is conditional; and c) the evidence presented in the record, i.e., the application from the Bismuth Cartridge Company. The petition for rulemaking follows two applications for final approval, one dated October 21, 1993, and the other dated December 30, 1993, that were provided to the Service. In reply, the Service responded that the applications were deficient because the bismuth-based shot material expected to be loaded into shotshells had not been found through preliminary testing to be nontoxic. Preliminary toxicity testing by the applicants had been with (essentially) pure bismuth only. Thus, there was not (either available or provided with the application) adequate scientific data covering toxicity of the material to be loaded into shotshells. However, the Service pledged in both replies to work with the applicants to process the applications in as timely a fashion as possible. Since the mid-1970s, the Service has sought to identify shot that when spent does not pose a significant hazard to migratory birds and other wildlife. Ingestion of spent lead shot has long been identified as a source of significant mortality in migratory birds. The Service first addressed the issue of lead poisoning in waterfowl in a 1976 environmental impact statement (EIS), and later readdressed the issue in a 1986 supplemental EIS. The latter provided the scientific justification for the ban on the use of lead shot for hunting waterfowl and coots that was begun in 1986 and completed in 1991. Currently, only steel shot has been approved by the Service Director as nontoxic. However, the Service believes that there may be other suitable candidate shot materials available which could be approved for use as nontoxic shot. The Service is anxious to consider these other potential candidates for approval as nontoxic, and does not feel constrained to limit nontoxic shot options.
