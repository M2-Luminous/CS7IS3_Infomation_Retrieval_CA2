The financial reserves of the station, however, are not sufficient to cover the repair fees, he added, so a lottery has been organized to help the administration with its undertakings. Sampeur notes that at one time, the UN Development Program [PNUD] had drawn up a list [not further identified] to help the station, but this was destroyed in the crush of the 30 September 1991 events. He nevertheless pointed out that this help will need to be extended. [passage omitted]
