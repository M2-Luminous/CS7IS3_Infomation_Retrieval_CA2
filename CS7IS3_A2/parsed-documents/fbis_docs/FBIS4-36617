Even the opposition did not find fault in it. If the prime minister's meeting with the Jordanian monarch gave birth to an agreement to conduct further negotiations in Elat and al-'Aqabah instead of Washington; and if there will now be deliberations on demarcation of borders and jointly combating terrorism, as well as the distribution of water resources, this will mark important progress. Even if in practice most of those components already exist, formalizing them in a joint, official, and signed document is significant. Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres, who were weaned on the Hashemite theory in Israeli foreign policy, remain loyal to it despite the historic breakthrough they made in the dialogue with the PLO. They feel they have achieved a great deal up to now, but they appear to be depending on King Husayn to reach another bilateral agreement with them, which would lead to full peace. If that is the case, they will be disappointed. In November 1993, Peres returned from extensive discussions with King Husayn in Amman. They agreed on a far-reaching document. The king did not want to leave the ceremony to his brother, the crown prince. He insisted on including his signature on the agreement. After that, Peres pursued him like a groom chasing after a reluctant bride, and repeatedly heard from the monarch that the wedding ceremony would be held "in the spring" and then "in the summer," and now the best we can hope for from these warm ties is the fall and autumn leaves. Why do Rabin and Peres believe that Husayn cannot trick them a third time? Because there is a limit? Because one cannot go on cheating forever? There are people who really do not dare deceive and cheat, but there are leaders for whom the third time is easier than the first. Husayn, who is ailing and left yesterday for medical tests in the United States, is one of them. The renewed clinging to Husayn is due to the political weariness of the prime minister and foreign minister. Historian Arnold Toynbee once explained that a leadership cannot carry out two revolutions. It is possible that the gambit with the PLO along the Oslo-Washington-Cairo axis was a revolution by Rabin and Peres, or by one of them, and that they do not have any more steam to continue on to other destinations. This fatigue also explains their tortuous and bewildering stands about the uncovering of the Jerusalem document following a thorough parliamentary investigation by Dan Meridor and Ben Begin. Under these conditions, Rabin and Peres do not have the strength to race ahead to full autonomy as the stage before a permanent solution. It is easier for them to hope that the Palestinians will not manage to organize elections or uphold for long the (so far successful) Gaza-Jericho agreement. In fact, there is a new target date: By the 1996 Knesset elections, Rabin and Peres want to make do with the early empowerment stage on the West bank. That is much less ambitious than the year of strategic decisionmaking they had earmarked for 1994. The alternative to quickened negotiations with the Palestinians is not pulling back to the granting of sewage, education, transportation, and tourism rights to the residents of Janin and Nabulus. Yasir 'Arafat received an undertaking to hold serious negotiations and Israel has an interest in fulfilling that promise. It would be wrong to treat subclauses, in themselves sound, as an adequate alternative. Rabin and Peres are not advancing the negotiations with Hafiz al-Asad. True, that is difficult. Al-Asad came under constructive criticism in recent weeks. He is stubborn and archaic, and immersed in a long gone world. His guests found him worried that he will end up like Nicolae Ceaucescu, who started by opening a narrow skylight to a new gust of wind and was hurled away by a hurricane. For the first time, western leaders refer to al-Asad as an "idiot." Al-Asad wants the entire Golan Heights, and is even including al-Hammah, which did not belong to Syria prior to 1967. He is demanding the demilitarization of the eastern Upper Galilee, which will return Tel Hay to the days of Yosef Trumpeldor in March 1920. His stubbornness over the time factor for the withdrawal and the security arrangements are annoying. Patience has so far characterized the Israeli position in the negotiations and it seems that it is being replaced by desperation and preparations for a anemic scenario: to reach the 1996 general elections with early empowerment in the pocket and an advanced Israeli-Jordanian agreement. That will not happen, and that cannot be all there is. If the government focuses only on those two important but secondary elements, Labor will move into the opposition benches. If the idea is to disrupt the political settlement, then Israel has better governments for the job.
