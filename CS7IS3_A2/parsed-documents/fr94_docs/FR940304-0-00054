FR940304-0-00054 FR940304-0-00017 4. The Commission is not modifying the pricing bands applicable to the transport or special access service categories at this time. The service category bands constrain the LECs' ability to offset rate reductions in some categories with rate increases in other categories. 5. The Commission is setting forth the details of establishing the indexes and banding limits for the new trunking basket and the realigned service categories within that basket. First, the 2% upper and 5% lower bands for tandem-switched transport and the 0% upper band for the interconnection charge apply to changes from the initial rates for these services as of the transport rate restructure, regardless of whether the LECs raised or lowered their local transport rates prior to the rate restructure. (``Initial rates'' refers to the rates that became effective as a result of the September 1, 1993 initial restructured transport tariff filing, or rates that subsequently go into effect as the result of the mid-course correction.) Thus, the LECs should set their initial bands and SBIs for the tandem-switched transport and interconnection charge service categories using the baseline of the initial restructured rate levels. 6. Because 47 CFR part 61 does not explicitly address the manner in which service categories are to be merged, the Commission adopts transition rules governing how the initial banding limits and indexes should be set for the new trunking basket and the realigned service categories within that basket. The initial degree of pricing flexibility for the trunking basket will be set by taking into account both the pricing flexibility currently available in the special access basket and the pricing flexibility available in the traffic sensitive basket (which currently includes transport). Thus, while the pre-existing actual price index (API) for the special access basket will be used as the initial API for the trunking basket, the PCI for the trunking basket should be set as follows. LECs should calculate the ratio between the pre-existing PCI for the special access basket and the API for that basket, and the ratio between the pre-existing PCI for the traffic sensitive basket and the API for that basket. A weighted average of these ratios should be derived using the base period revenue weights of the special access and transport services included in the trunking basket, respectively. This weighted average should be multiplied by the pre-existing API for the special access basket to derive the PCI for the trunking basket. (Base period demand for flat-rated transport elements (i.e., demand for the 1992 base year) should correspond with the historical demand used in computing the initial interconnection charge. The rates used in this formula should be the rates effective on the date that the transport rate restructure became effective, or rates that subsequently go into effect as the result of the mid-course correction.) 7. Similarly, adjustments to the upper and lower pricing bands applicable to the existing voice grade and high capacity/DDS service categories and the DS1 and DS3 subcategories are necessary to reflect the incorporation of comparable flat-rated transport rate elements. While the SBIs for these categories are to remain the same, the upper and lower bands should reflect a weighted average of the pre-existing upper and lower bands for the special access services and the 5% upper and lower bands for the flat-rated transport services. This weighted average should be calculated using the base period revenue weights of the special access and transport services included in each service category and subcategory. A comparable procedure will be used to incorporate transport services into a density pricing zone category that has already been established for special access services (or vice versa). 8. The changes adopted in the order necessitate adjustments to the price cap indexes. Accordingly, the Commission directs all LECs subject to the price cap rules to recalculate their price cap indexes pursuant to the decisions in the order. The LECs should file such recalculated indexes with the Commission in a special filing not accompanied by rate changes. The Commission delegates authority to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to specify the format and timing of this filing. In addition, such recalculated indexes should be used as the basis of any price cap filing that changes rates of services in the trunking or traffic sensitive baskets. 9. Finally, the Commission clarifies some miscellaneous implementation matters. First, the Commission clarifies that its decision in the Second Reconsideration Order, 58 FR 45266 (Aug. 27, 1993) (requiring use of historical demand for all components of the formula for computing the inter-connection charge) applies only to price cap LECs. Rate-of-return LECs continue to be subject to 47 CFR 61.38 and 61.39, and should continue to use projected demand to set transport rates. Consistent with the First Reconsideration Order, 58 FR 41184 (Aug. 3, 1993), however, these projections should only forecast demand growth, and should not attempt to forecast IXCs' reconfigurations in response to the transport rate restructure. Second, due to the difficulty of applying non-premium charges to flat-rate transport elements, the Commission modifies its rules to clarify that non-premium charges must be established only for the interconnection charge, and not for the facility-based transport elements. Third, the Commission modifies the rules to clarify that the LECs must waive certain non-recurring charges for a six-month period following the effective date of their restructured transport tariffs. Finally, the Commission is making limited technical changes to 47 CFR part 69.
