Durban police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said eyewitnesses saw a red bakkie carrying armed men into the township, about 15km north of Empangeni, at about 4am. "They opened fire at two different bus stops, killing six people and injuring seven. The victims were shot at random." The attackers were armed with AK-47 rifles, 9mm pistols and shotguns, said Maj Naidoo. The attack comes amid heightened political tension in the volatile northern Natal region and ahead of a visit to the University of Zululand by African National Congress President Nelson Mandela, who will address supporters there on Saturday.
