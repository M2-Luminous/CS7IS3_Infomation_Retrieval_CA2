Kozlovskiy, under the rubric "Individuals": "Slippery Shokhin: Political Agility as a Means of Fighting a Decent Reputation"] [Text] The only representative of power to have met with former U.S. President Nixon, between the latter's meetings with Mr. Rutskoy and Mr. Zhirinovskiy, as it happened, was RF [Russian Federation] Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin. One can guess that this meeting was scarcely at Mr. Shokhin's personal initiative; however, the fact that it was he who was selected for this mission reflected the position he has landed in the government, due largely to his own initiative. Aleksandr Shokhin remains one of the most tenacious ministers in the Russian government. He was invited by Ivan Silayev to occupy the post of labor minister, held on in the transition administration of Acting Premier Oleg Lobov, and entered organically as one of the key vice premiers into the "reform cabinet," where, as we know, he headed up the economic bloc. Despite his early manifested inclination toward extreme political tenacity, Mr. Shokhin was long considered one of the most literate and powerful reformers on the "Gaydar team," on which he occupied a special, relatively independent position. By the way, when Aleksandr Shokhin, as the first of the "renegade reformers," began to pronounce unintelligible texts "on the need to strengthen the social orientation of the reforms" on the eve of the elections, it reminded us mostly of cheap demagoguery: it reminded us that during the first period of reforms the social bloc's former chief could boast of a single merit--he held on tenaciously to that same "social protection" and blamed the government for its lack. Without dwelling on the reasons that brought Mr. Shokhin into the "Shakhray party," it should be noted that he entered quite organically into the role of economic ideologue. His theoretical constructs were limited to hints at a poorly digested "centrism" in the spirit of the Civic Union, and his practical attacks against government policy pursued the goal of toying with Russia's Choice. Mr. Shokhin's membership in the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and even, to some extent, his supremacy in that party might seem surprising at first. However, he quickly achieved "unity and accord" with his colleagues on the basis of a single ideological paradigm that linked the party to absolute political spinelessness. From this standpoint, each of the PRES leaders has his own special merits: Mr. Shakhray, who virtually ensured passage of the criminal resolution granting amnesty to the organizers of the state coup due to extenuating circumstances; Mr. Zatulin, a petty trade-finance middleman implicated in petty machinations who has now attained petty power and who long reviled in the press the very people and politics with which he now willingly formed a bloc. As for the "intelligent and competent" Mr. Shokhin, he along with his comrades in his party, willingly agreed to the suggestion to join a government formed on the very basis of their party's defeat in the elections. By the way, we should mention the fact that it was Mr. Shokhin who brought in Mr. Melikyan to take over the newly freed up chair of the head of the RF Ministry of Labor. Mr. Melikyan is now willingly and extensively developing both in public and in his practical activities his patron's most demagogic ideological findings. Once he took over Russia's Ministry of Economics, Aleksandr Shokhin attempted to proclaim it the key economic department, empowered to carry out the purposeful state regulation of the economy. Thus he attempted virtually to commandeer the legacy of Mr. Lobov, an act that ought to have been considered utterly shameful for the "economist-reformer." I will make the proviso that Mr. Shokhin's undoubted service was his extremely harsh position at the negotiations with Western partners and international financial organizations on the issues of their economic "assistance" and Russia's foreign debt. However, Mr. Shokhin has been virtually dismissed from these duties, and he is not going to be allowed, or so it seems, to render any such benefit in his new field of endeavor. The administration seems to have made the most radical reform decision of recent years by taking away from the Economics Ministry the monumental quarters of the old USSR Gosplan [State Planning Committee]. Soviet-Russian bureaucratic practice shows that, after something like this, "great institutions," as a rule, are not restored. So that once again they have, as they say, wiped their feet on Mr. Shokhin. The new economics minister's highly developed agility is becoming a threat to his own professional reputation: unlike Mr. Soskovets or Mr. Chernomyrdin, he cannot fail to be aware of the content of his new economic illuminations. By the way, in his conversation with President Nixon, Aleksandr Shokhin accused Premier Chernomyrdin of excessive monetarism in connection with February's indecently low rates of inflation. In a recent interview, former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov proposed that Mr. Shokhin's next post be minister of health care. However, if Aleksandr Shokhin is going to treat himself as carefully in the future as he has so far, then he might boldly count on occupying the chair of deputy minister of health care.
