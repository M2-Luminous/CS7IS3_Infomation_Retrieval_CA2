This fundamental principle is now enshrined in a treaty of friendship and cooperation between Russia and Mongolia signed by the presidents of the two countries in January 1993, Nikolay Pavlov, chairman of a Russian delegation in the mixed Russian-Mongolian border commission, said in an interview with RIA. Although historically there have always been good relations on the Russian-Mongolian border, checks are currently being made along it, Pavlov said. This verification, which began in 1987, is aimed at giving a more clear identification on the terrain of the border line, repairing old and installing new border posts, and carrying out a great deal of cartographical and other work. To verify the border a mixed Russian-Mongolian commission was set up, consisting of a Russian and a Mongolian delegation. The Russian delegation included representatives of the Foreign Ministry, of the Defence Ministry, Border Troops, and also of the governments of the Altay, Tuva and Buryat republics and administration of the Chita region. In spite of material and technical difficulties, noted Pavlov, it is planned this year to complete all work connected with the installation, repairs and painting of border posts and fully to hand over the frontier to the frontier troops of the sides. The Mongolian side is also interested in the conclusion of the verification. The clear demarcation of the border and its inviolability are seen by it as a major factor for strengthening friendship and cooperation betaeen the peoples of Russia and Mongolia, Pavlov said in conclusion.
