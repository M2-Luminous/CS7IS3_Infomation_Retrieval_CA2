As stated by a source concerned with a major automaker, the automobile industry appreciates the Japanese Government's attitude, saying: "Establishing numerical targets, which was our concern, has been avoided." However, according to the same source, while observing that "the U.S. stance of not understanding Japan's position has not changed," the industry is concerned the U.S. Government and Congress may stiffen their attitude. What the automobile industry is afraid of is the government will ask it to work out a voluntary purchase plan for U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts in order to break the deadlock in negotiations, just as the government did when (then) President Bush visited Japan in 1992. Although the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] actually sounded out the auto industry concerning the purchase plan, every automaker expressed opposition, saying: "(Since business activities have now been aggravated,) the situation is different from in 1992." Eventually, MITI's goal was not achieved. The electrical appliance industry also highly approves of the government stance on the telecommunications issue, a focal point within the government procurement sector under the framework talks. According to Tadashi Sekizawa, president of Fujitsu Ltd., the industry stated: "The government has consistently maintained that establishing numerical targets would lead to managed trade, and as a result, the failure to reach an agreement was unavoidable." Life insurance and nonlife insurance circles issued statements approving of the breakdown in the framework talks. According to Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine & Fire Insurance Association of Japan, Incorporated, they said "the failure to reach an agreement was inevitable." In negotiations in the insurance sector, the United States demanded that the share of business of foreign-affiliated companies on the Japanese market be increased to a two-digit percent to reach the same level as other members of the G-7 (Group of Seven). Meanwhile, according to a top executive of a major nonlife insurance company, Japan opposed the U.S. demand, maintaining "the attitude of shutting their eyes to the lack of their own efforts has proved to be managed trade." Therefore, as stated by a top executive of a major life insurance company, the industry is relieved, saying that "failure is better than an agreement which includes numerical targets."
