During a recent visit to Alto Parana Department, President Wasmosy had stated that Congress seeks to hinder the democratic process and to affect the dignity and honor of the Armed Forces. The National Encounter senator added: "Frankly I do not understand this criticism because Congress has expeditiously debated 90 percent of the draft bills in a coordinated manner and approved all the requests for credits submitted to us; I honestly do not understand this attitude." Nikiphoroff also criticized the executive branch's successive vetoes considering that in six months it vetoed seven draft bills that had been approved by Congress. Nikiphoroff said: "The president vetoes everything; however, we are not doing the same." [passage omitted]
