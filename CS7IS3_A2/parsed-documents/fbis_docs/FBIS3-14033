During this year, while the freedom fighters won some glorious battles, they also faced heavy losses. They have to bear the misfortune of the martyrdom of their commanders. During the beginning of last year, India sent additional military forces to Kashmir. The leader of the Border Security Forces, Chander Prakash, made an interesting comment about the presence of these forces in Kashmir in an interview. He said that in the jungles and mountains, where even the sun's rays are not seen, our soldiers are busy in rebellion. At the beginning of this year, Hizb-ul Mujaheddin's commander, General Shaib, was killed by the Indian forces in Srinagar. In addition, Nasir-ul Islam, leader of Jumiat-ul Mujaheddin; Maqbul Ilahi, leader of Hizb-ul Mujaheddin; and Shamash-ul Haq, the acting supreme commander, were also killed. All in all, the most important members of nearly all the freedom fighting organizations were either killed or arrested. These include: Khalid Gibran, Sajjad Ahmed Mir, Jaffar Jamali, Maulana Ilias, Jamal Afghani, Akbar Bhai and Abdulmajid Sheikh. Al-Jihad's commander-in-chief, Sheikh Abdulaziz, Muslim Mujaheddin's Master Ahsan Dar, and Dukhtran Millat's leader Aasia Inderabi were also arrested at one or the other time. In addition to the arrests and killings, the Indian armed forces started burning various areas in Kashmir to put additional pressure on the freedom fighters. Sopore is one region where everyone has rebelled against India for the last 45 years. A large number of freedom fighters are members of different organizations in this region. According to the Indian communications media, this area had become a "little Pakistan" that housed a strong camp of the freedom fighters during this movement. The hold of the freedom fighters on Sopore has been so strong that the Indian armed forces could never enter here. When they tried to attack Sopore at the beginning of the year, the freedom fighters not only made the military forces suffer heavy losses, but also took away their weapons and ammunition. Later, the mujaheddin had an exhibition of these weapons and ammunition which was viewed by thousands of people. Taking over Sopore became a major problem for the Indian forces. The top leadership of the army decided that instead of fighting the mujaheddin in Sopore, they would turn Sopore to ashes. Finally, on 6 January, they set this area on fire and cooled their fire of revenge this way. Yet, the people of Sopore began to help the mujaheddin even more, raising Pakistan's green flag over every house. The mujaheddin openly celebrated Pakistan's freedom on 14 August. The Hizb-ul Mujaheddin transferred the Pakistani flag to their headquarters in Srinagar. What is worse, even the prominent Indian magazine INDIA TODAY had to admit that Sopore is the capital of the pro-Pakistan group. The Indian forces, after long determined planning, decided that they would stop only after destroying Sopore. On the night of 26 December, the Border Security Force and other paramilitary forces joined the Indian army and attacked Sopore. About 150,000 soldiers surrounded Sopore and also received enforcement from the Air Force. Still, the mujaheddin counterattacked with strong force. As a result, the Indian forces had to retreat, and the defeated enemy, demonstrating its traditional "bravery," burned cities, towns, and mosques and crushed them under their tanks. Sayyed Salahuddin ordered the mujaheddin to vacate Sopore temporarily. The next day, dozens of mujaheds who had participated in the battle returned to the base camp in Azad Kashmir [Pakistan]. This movement was also hurt by the arrest of popular female leader Aasia Inderabi. She had organized Kashmiri women and supported the mujaheddin. The role the women are playing in this movement is unprecedented in the history of the freedom struggle. Since 1989, several mujahed organizations have been active in Kashmir. These organizations have played an important role in this jihad and in organizing attacks on Indian forces. Among these organizations, the largest is Hizb-ul Mujaheddin. It follows a military structure and is the only organization that has influence statewide. Most of the activities in Kashmir are carried out by the members of this organization. In 1990, this group blew up the original structure of the Wooler Barge, causing billions of rupees in damage to it. Similarly, in the last part of 1990, it led a successful attack on India's former core commander and governor's advisor General Zaki, in which he was wounded. Similarly, on 24 January 1992, Hizb blasted a bomb at the police headquarters in Srinagar. It took the jihad from the narrow confines of the valley to Jammu and Laddakh. In 1992, Shamsher Khan, a Hizb commander, controlled Doda for several hours. The Hizb-ul Mujaheddin has invited mujaheddin from all over the world to Kashmir, welcoming them warmly on their arrival. They are declared "guest mujaheds." In addition to Azad Kashmir, mujaheddin from hundreds of other countries are guest mujaheds in Kashmir. The supreme commander of Hizb is Sayyed Salahuddin, who lived in Azad Kashmir for a few months in 1991. Indian military experts believe that if Hizb is removed from the military platform of Kashmir, things would be easier for India. The Hizb calls prominent Kashmiri leader Sayyed Ali Gailani its patron leader. At present, 70 percent of jihad activities are done by Hizb members. The Hizb has the honor of being the largest and best organized of the groups. Liberation Front--It is true that the Front started militant activity in the valley. The Front got a lot of publicity when it abducted Rubiya Sayyed. This group was established by Ishfaq Mujeed Wani, Abdul Mujeed Sheikh, and Mohammed Yasin Malik. Except for Yasin Malik, the other two leaders have been killed. At present, the leader of the Front is Javed Ahmed Mir, while Amanullah Khan in Azad Kashmir is the chairman. The Front is composed of anti-Pakistan elements. Many of its leaders have declared Pakistan and India equal enemies of Kashmir. The Front took the political path instead of militancy. Therefore, it was not involved in any militant activity during the last year. The al-Jihad is a sub-group of the People's League. The Muslim Janbaz Force and the Jihad Force are playing an important role in the Kashmir jihad. Prominent philosopher and politician Mohammed Farooq Rehmani and Sayyed Shabeer Ahmed Shah are the leaders of the People's League. These two leaders learned about fighting for Kashmir's independence from their cradles. Unfortunately, however, both of them went their separate ways because of mutual differences. The influence of this organization extends all over the valley; however, the Farooq Rehmani's group Janbaz Force is especially strong in Bandi Pura and Bara Mula. In addition to these organizations, Ikhwan-ul Musalmoon, Alumar Mujaheddin, Jumiat-ul Mujaheddin, Tehrik-ul Mujaheddin, Harkat-ul Mujaheddin, Muslim Mujaheddin, and Hizb Allah are also active in the jihad efforts. All of these organizations support Islam and Pakistan. These organizations agree on the following point for joining Pakistan: India is our common enemy; therefore, all efforts should be made to be free of Indian clutches. A decision about Kashmir's future should be made according to UN resolutions, by holding a plebiscite. All have to agree to joining Pakistan and forming an Islamic government. The real participants in the militant activity in Kashmir are those anonymous mujaheddin, whose names, deeds, and positions no one knows save Allah. *
