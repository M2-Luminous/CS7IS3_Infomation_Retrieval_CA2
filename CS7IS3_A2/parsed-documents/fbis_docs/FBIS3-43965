All those who delay in joining it or who fail to join will be left behind. In accordance with President Mobutu's decree, endorsing the wish expressed by the political class during the Palais du Peuple consultations, an extraordinary session of the High Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament, was officially opened at 1600 at the Palais du Peuple today. The first session was devoted to the registration of the members and the management of the new Parliament. It must be pointed out that the political class' decision to have Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo chair the High Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament -- beginning from the next session -- was unanimously approved. Proceedings are to resume at 1500 at the Palais du Peuple on 20 January. All members of the High Council, Transitional Parliament are requested to attend the meeting. Toum Bamba Toulou has just arrived from the Palais du Peuple and gives us further details: [Begin Toulou recording] The atmosphere at the Palais du Peuple was good. Mr. Moulenda Loutoula, parliamentary secretary general, chaired the inaugural session of the High Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament. There were almost 400 members from the defunct National Assembly, the defunct High Council of the Transition, which was set up following the Sovereign National Conference. Negotiators from the two political groups -- the Political Forces of the Conclave, as well as the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allied Groups -- who worked arduously to obtain the protocol agreement which will govern the transitional period, were also present. There are three items on the agenda of this extraordinary session, which should not exceed 15 days. As of tomorrow, the session will be chaired by Monsignor Monsengwo, chairman of High Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament in accordance with the spirit of the accord. First, there will be the internal organization of the Parliament, that is, the examination and ratification of the mandate of the members, then the drawing up and adoption of internal regulations, the election of the final executive bureau, and the setting up of working commissions. The honorable councillors will also set up and adopt the constitutional act for the transitional period. The last item will be the election of the person who will head the final transitional government. All the items on the agenda are important, but the one concerning the election of the prime minister is very delicate. This is why we are repeating our call that there must be good will, clearheadedness, and moral and intellectual sincerity from all sides so that a judicious and conscientious choice for the prime minister will be made.
