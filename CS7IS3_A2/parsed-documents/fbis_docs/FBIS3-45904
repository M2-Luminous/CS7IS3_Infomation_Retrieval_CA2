Ji Guoyan, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Futures Supervision and Administration Commission, said such illegal trading is plaguing China's fledgling futures market. "Owing to an imperfect management system and inexperienced traders, the market provides some openings for speculators," Jin said. Aiming to stop the illegal practice, about 20 officials from the province's futures regulatory organizations and the Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau recently launched a surprise night attack on six companies in Guangzhou. Most such companies rent offices in the most expensive buildings in downtown Guangzhou, like the International Building, the International Finance Building, and the World Trade Centre. All six companies were caught doing futures trading, which goes beyond their authorized business scope as stipulated by the local industrial and commercial bureau. Inspectors found evidence that the companies were helping clients buy and sell foreign exchange through computers connected to foreign swap markets. The companies' registered business certificates clearly specify that they confine themselves to providing information or advice on real estate, engineering and finance. This means they are not entitled to deal in foreign exchange trading. The six companies were ordered to stop operating and to return client's cash deposits within 30 days. Since the Bank of China authorized Guangzhou to open foreign exchange futures trading last year, the province has been very careful in issuing licenses to companies. Among the 156 future companies in the province, only 12 are authorized to deal in such business. With a registered capital of HK$50,000 ($6,400), approved and registered companies can help clients conduct margin trading with cash deposits of HK$4 million ($512,000). Some companies have no connections with international futures trading exchanges. Others hire unqualified dealers and cheat their customers. According to a local magazine, residents of the affluent Pearl River Delta region have been cheated of more than HK$1 billion ($130 million). To prevent such abuses, futures companies must now operate from two sides: overseas companies provide the investment and brokers, and the Chinese side administers. The State Foreign Exchange Administration last June ordered all futures companies listed with the State Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau to be checked and re-registered.
