Brunei's Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed Bolkiah said he would consider the proposal to enter a joint venture to produce fertiliser from Brunei, Squadron Leader Prasong said. Brunei has limited investments overseas because it is a small country, Sqn. Ldr. Prasong quoted the prince as saying. But there was no word on Thailand's proposal to buy more rice. "We asked Brunei to buy more Thai rice because Thailand continues to suffer a deficit in bilateral trade," Sqn. Ldr. Prasong said. Prince Bolkiah heads home today at the end of a three-day visit. He paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Chuan Likphai at Government House yesterday. Discussions over the past three days also covered opportunities for Thai workers in Brunei. According to Sqn Ldr Prasong, Brunei is satisfied with the performance of Thai workers and prospects for them may broaden as the oil-rich state puts more effort into development.
