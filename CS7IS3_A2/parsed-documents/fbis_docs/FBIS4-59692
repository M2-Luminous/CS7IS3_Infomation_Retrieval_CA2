During a reception held by the Iraqi Mission in the honor of the figures, the deputy prime minister reviewed Iraq's position, which sees the need for the Security Council to recognize the facts that are supported by UN circles in charge of implementing UN resolutions. Tariq 'Aziz said Iraq has implemented a great deal of these resolutions, and it is now the turn of the Security Council to recognize these facts and consequently lift the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq. The deputy prime minister said one member only; namely, the United States, is using its influence to prevent the implementation of Security Council resolutions. It thus represents the minority at the Security Council. Tariq 'Aziz answered questions by several members of the delegation of international personalities on Iraq's relationship with the Security Council. [passage omitted]
