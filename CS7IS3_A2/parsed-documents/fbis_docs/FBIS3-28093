The Maritime and Port Administration reported on Thursday it had decided to permit shipping firms to build these vessels with foreign financial funds obtained in the name of their locally incorporated companies. The decision is to help the maritime industry secure vessels more easily and alleviate their taxational burdens, an official at the administration said. He explained that Korean shipping firms will be allowed to obtain shipbuilding loans abroad without regard to whether the vessels to be built would be registered in Korea or elsewhere. This means that ships thus obtained could be registered in third countries, instead of Korea, where ship-related tax rates are lower. In the initial stage, shipping lines will be permitted to obtain only large specialized vessels like crude oil, coal and iron ore carriers and container vessels because an overall permission would obviously lead to a rush to overseas vessel procurement, the official said. Presently shipping lines obtain vessels with either shipbuilding loans from domestic banks or foreign capital introduced under the condition of registering new-built vessels in the country. But, domestic loans carry high interest rates while introduction of foreign capital has to go through rigid government control.
