Everything is quite simple. The Russian Selling House is perhaps the only private finance company for now which makes it possible for you, my dear reader, to get rid of the fear of having things stolen on a train or plane, at a railway terminal, and so on. For example, you live in Vladivostok, and you are about to travel to Moscow. How much money does one need for the trip? Certainly a full wallet.... However, you will not have this problem at all if you become a depositor of the Russian Selling House. That is to say, you will pay in the money to its Vladivostok office, and as soon as tomorrow, or a month or a year from now--whenever you need--you can withdraw all or some of your money, but certainly with interest, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, or dozens of other cities in Russia and even Ukraine.... Aleksandr Astanin, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Russian Selling House, began our conversation by saying: "For now, only Ukraine outside of Russia. However, we are planning to open branches, first throughout nearby foreign countries and then in many distant foreign countries. [Volkov] Do you mean to say that you will work with the currencies of the former Union republics? [Astanin] Precisely. Potential depositors, for example, in Kazakhstan will be given an opportunity to deposit their tenge-denominated savings at our local branch and withdraw rubles in Russia--naturally, at the exchange rate we set. [Volkov] Aleksandr Valentinovich, it appears to me that you yourself are not aware of the full significance of this project. I for one am from the so-called near abroad and, as the saying goes, have learned the hard way about the problems of the segment of the local population which some silly politician named "Russian-speaking." Some 30 million Russians who remained after the disintegration of the Union in its former republics were, in essence, robbed once again after the introduction of national currencies. When they leave these states, the money is exchanged for them with a lot of friction, or the exchange is rejected outright, with references made to a lack of Russian rubles. The exchange frequently occurs at locally set, unrealistic, extortionate rates. If you succeed in carrying out your project, millions of Russians will be forever grateful to you. [Astanin] It is no accident that our house is called Russian.... However, one would think that this project would be advantageous in every sense for the authorities of nearby foreign countries, too. First of all, we will relieve them of some of the problems of conversion; the population will be happy; what else do the authorities need? [Volkov] How do you manage to attract depositors? [Astanin] By absolute trust and the ever present desire to comply with the will of our clients. For example, a client brings his money to us today, but tomorrow changes his mind and wants it back. We will give him the money back right away, but with interest for the day. Who else, apart from us, will add the daily dividend for him? Incidentally, we have never promised people fabulous profits. However, our depositors have always known that each 1,000 of their rubles "gains" 3 rubles [R] per day, and effective 1 March of this year we "threw in" another R2 on our own. From now on, each R1,000 invested yields R5 per day to our clients. I will stress--it is R5 per day, with a 100-percent guarantee of receipt of the invested funds in full and with interest immediately upon demand in virtually any city in Russia. [Volkov] In Volgograd, the "cradle" of the Russian Selling House, the company has not, so to say, always been in the clover.... [Astanin] Correct. At first they looked askance at us; some members of officialdom viewed us disapprovingly: What if the leaders of the company "make tracks" for foreign lands with the cherished attache case? However, the Russian Selling House has never intended to swindle anyone. On the contrary, in April of last year we indexed the deposits of the population by 30 percent at once. The house invested and is still investing its spare funds in real estate and many other things that will not be carried abroad in any manner. I will now divulge just one commercial secret: We own real estate throughout Russia on a far greater scale than some companies that specialize in this. It appears that something is afoot in Volgograd, too. [Volkov] Indeed, at a recent press conference the governor of the oblast stated that he is not against selling to your company an unfinished hotel building downtown--the sickening construction project without an end. [Astanin] We will be happy to buy this "masterpiece" of Soviet industry and turn it into a "dandy." Of course, it is nonetheless quite offensive, in human terms, that they took so long to accommodate us, and what did this result in? A few days ago two well-known soccer teams played at the local stadium, the Rotor and the Uralmash.... Who would you have us root for? For our Rotor from Volgograd, or for the visitor Uralmash, which our company bought not so long ago? [Volkov] Nonetheless, as you put it, something is afoot in Volgograd. But what about other regions? [Astanin] We find good shelter almost everywhere. They know about us, and local leaders very frequently facilitate our "acclimation" in every way possible. Difficulties with the central departments continue. To this day we have been unable to get a license in Moscow. The Central Bank passes off all our letters to the Ministry of Finance, and the latter passes them off to the Central Bank. We intend to finally break the vicious circle. We will take the matter to the courts. Besides, we will open several banks at once in the large cities of Russia. [Volkov] Are these the immediate prospects? [Astanin] The most immediate. At the same time, we resolved to invest funds in establishing powerful facilities in the construction industry (we are projecting a construction "boom" by the end of the 1990's), the development of communications, transportation, and many other economically advantageous projects. [Volkov] Therefore, you plan your operations, do you not? [Astanin] Definitely. This is a guarantee of success and the necessary condition for founders, who are young and energetic. S. Gruzin and A. Solomadin were there at the outset of the Russian Selling House, and at present they are the originators of most if not all fruitful ideas that sustain the company. I am not afraid to say that it is precisely due to planning our work, both in the long run and on a daily basis, that we have more than 1 million depositors and a wonderful infrastructure all over Russia, that we are establishing contacts with various countries, and that we have provided jobs for 10,000 people. To be sure, we are not the trailblazers in this area: Japanese and American businessmen have always planned their operations....
