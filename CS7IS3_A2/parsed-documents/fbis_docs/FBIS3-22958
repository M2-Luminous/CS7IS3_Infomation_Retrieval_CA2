The official says this information was behind an alert the United States issued to its citizens concerning the possibility of attacks against them. The Egyptian prime minister told the U.S. ambassador that Egypt's competent authorities have no information or evidence in this regard. The prime minister asked the ambassador to provide the Egyptian Government with any information that Washington has on this so that the two countries might cooperate in facing any possible threat to tourists. Washington and Cairo are holding consultations on this issue.
