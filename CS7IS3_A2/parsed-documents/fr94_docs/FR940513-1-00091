FR940513-1-00091 FR940513-1-00019 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 215 [Docket No. 940414&hyph;4114; I.D. 032494B] Marine Mammals; Subsistence Taking of Northern Fur Seals AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule and subsistence harvest estimates for the Pribilof Islands. SUMMARY: NMFS is required to publish an estimate of the number of seals expected to be harvested in the current year to meet the subsistence needs of the Aleut residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK, pursuant to the regulations governing the subsistence taking of northern fur seals. The purpose of these regulations is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents and to restrict taking by sex, age, and season for herd management purposes. This notice estimates the number of seals to be taken in 1994. This notice also proposes to amend existing fur seal regulations, making the harvest take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year. This proposed amendment is based on the fact that a relatively consistent number of fur seals has been harvested each year since 1989, and that NMFS does not expect subsistence needs to increase such that takes for subsistence purposes will exceed the established upper limit of the subsistence harvest estimate range first established for the 1992 harvest. DATES: Written comments must be received by June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Dr. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, (F/PR), 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Zimmerman, (907) 586&hyph;7235, or Margot Bohan, (301) 713&hyph;2322. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The subsistence harvest of northern fur seals, Callorhinus ursinus , on the Pribilof Islands, AK, is governed by regulations found in 50 CFR part 215, subpart D_Taking for Subsistence Purposes. The purpose of these regulations, published under the authority of the Fur Seal Act (FSA), 16 U.S.C. 1151 et seq ., and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq ., is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents and to restrict taking by sex, age, and season for herd management purposes. To minimize negative effects on the Pribilof Islands fur seal population, the harvest has been limited to a 47-day season (June 23&hyph;August 8) and is restricted to only subadult male fur seals. Pursuant to the regulations governing the taking of fur seals for subsistence purposes, NMFS must publish a summary of the previous year's fur seal harvest (1993 harvest results were published on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 59297)), and a projection of the number of seals expected to be taken in the current year to meet the subsistence needs of the Aleut residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK. The projected estimates are given as a range, the lower end of which may be exceeded if NMFS is given notice, and the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), determines that the annual subsistence needs of the Pribilof Aleuts have not been satisfied (50 CFR 215.32(e)(3)). Conversely, the harvest can be terminated before the lower end of the range is reached if it is determined that the annual subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents have been met or the harvest has been conducted in a wasteful manner. Subsistence Estimates and Trends The number of northern fur seals harvested on St. Paul Island since 1986 has ranged from 1,077 (1990) to 1,710 (1987) (Table 1). The annual subsistence takes on St. George Island since 1986 have ranged from 92 (1987) to 319 (1993) seals (Table 1). Within the past 3 years, however, the number of fur seals harvested annually has been relatively consistent. Since 1991, the average number of seals harvested each year on St. Paul and St. George Islands has been 1,548 (range: 1,482&hyph;1,645) and 265 (range: 194&hyph;319), respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the actual number of animals harvested has never reached the upper end of the estimated range. In 1992, for example, only 194 of the 365 fur seals originally estimated for subsistence need during that year were taken on St. George Island. In 1993, only 319 of the 407 seals requested were taken to meet the subsistence needs of St. George residents.
