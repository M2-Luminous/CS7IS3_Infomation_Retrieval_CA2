It is clearly an electoral advantage that the United Smallholders' Party [EKGP] accepted a coalition role in the past four years -- as pointed out by Janos Szabo, agricultural minister and EKGP chairman. We asked Janos Szabo about coalition desires, the split among the smallholders, and agricultural matters. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] As a village party, what does the EKGP suggest to solve the current crisis in the agricultural sector? [Szabo] Everyone is trying to effect a brainwash! If the crisis is a radical and revolutionary change, then this is what is really taking place: the biggest transition in land ownership in our 1,100 year history! Despite all our problems and the international recession, a decreasing domestic market, the loss of our eastern markets, drought, and a chronic shortage of capital, 1994 will be the year of growth in agricultural reserves. The economy has priority in the EKGP program. This program is based on four years of hard work and outstanding achievements. The Group of 36 in the parliament played a major role in all this, because this faction fulfilled the majority of the party's program. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If you were to become part of the new government, what would be your first measure to benefit villagers? [Szabo] We would guarantee greater state support for the agricultural sector; we would export quality products to the West; we would urge a reasonable tax reduction; and we would let the owners get a bit richer. It is an open wound in the agricultural sector that, of 1.1 million part-owners of business, only 300 are completely involved in the business; this situation requires an urgent solution. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does the fact that the Group of 36 and later the EKGP participated in the coalition represent an advantage or a disadvantage? [Szabo] During transitional periods, the time required for the maturation of a politician is rather short. But one wears out quickly, both morally and politically, and the coalition wears out quickly also. The change involves traumatic elements. It is possible that, according to some voters, playing a role in the coalition represents a disadvantage.... But one should not be shortsighted! In spite of all the transitional difficulties, the last four years have made real history! We instituted private property and the framework of a constitutional state; despite all the difficulties, there is stability in Hungary and, therefore, it makes no difference what the professional pessimists say. Those who are affected by compensation, land ownership, and the assignment of lands -- some 4-5 million voters -- should realize that the government has compensated them. We started six months ago, and we succeeded in presenting 14 territorial lists and 56 candidates. It is clearly an advantage for the Group of 36 and the EKGP to be part of the coalition. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] With which parties would you happily form a coalition and under what conditions? Would you demand a certain ministry? [Szabo] We would gladly form a coalition with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] if we make it into the parliament, but we do not exclude any other party, with the exception of the Workers Party and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. A good agreement is the basis of correct coalition relations contacts! This agreement should include proportional party decisionmaking in accordance with said party's power as represented in parliament. Larger parties should not have greater decisionmaking rights in the parliament; smaller parties should not have smaller rights. We do not have a list of ministerial demands, but our party clearly prefers the Agricultural Ministry. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The smallholders are divided: there are four parties on the political palette. You repeatedly declared that Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], is the obstacle hindering union. [Szabo] The only difference between the programs of the various smallholders parties -- the FKGP, the Historical Smallholders' Party, the Compromise Smallholders' Party, and the EKGP -- is the way they go about doing things, but there is no difference regarding the essence of their programs. In the villages, simple people and smallholders-oriented voters are not divided, and there is a basic demand for a single large party to represent the small landowners in politics. Nor is there any particular importance attached to which party was in the coalition and which party was not. We should be united, and the EKGP is doing everything in its power to achieve this unity. Jozsef Torgyan is an obstacle! He should step aside and leave the road, so that unity can emerge.
