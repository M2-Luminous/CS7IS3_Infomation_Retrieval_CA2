FR940217-1-00081 FR940217-1-00014 Section 668.82␣Standard of conduct. The Secretary proposes to amend paragraph (a) of this section to add that a third-party servicer is also a fiduciary of the Department of Education. The Secretary also would amend paragraph (a) to provide that an institution or its third-party servicers would be required at all times to act with the competency and integrity sufficient to qualify the institution or servicer as a fiduciary. This change would clarify and emphasize the requirement that the fiduciary standard always applies and is not to be construed narrowly. The Secretary wishes to point out that this standard is not simply an additional requirement but, rather, it is a condition of initial and continued participation in or servicing of the Title IV, HEA programs. An institution or servicer cannot selectively avoid fiduciary responsibility. This section would also be amended to specify that the Secretary would have the authority to initiate proceedings against a third-party servicer under this subpart if the servicer violates its fiduciary duty. The Secretary proposes to specify that the Secretary would have the authority to initiate a proceeding against an institution under this subpart if the institution's third-party servicer, acting under contract with the institution, violates the servicer's fiduciary duty. The Secretary wishes to emphasize that an institution is always responsible for the actions of its third-party servicers. The Secretary also proposes to make a technical amendment to clarify the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. The Secretary's long-standing interpretation of these regulations is that a violation of an institution's fiduciary duty is grounds for termination, limitation, suspension, and fine proceedings_ individually or in combination. As a result of the enactment of a statute authorizing the imposition of emergency actions, the Secretary also proposes to add emergency action to this list of potential consequences resulting from an institution's violation of the institution's fiduciary duty. An emergency action also would be applicable against a third-party servicer that violates its fiduciary duty. The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution or third-party servicer violates its fiduciary duty if the servicer, an officer or employee of the servicer, or any person with substantial control over the servicer is guilty of or has been judicially determined to have committed a crime involving Federal funds. These provisions also would apply to a person, agency, or organization, or an officer or employee of an agency or organization with which the servicer contracts. A violation of fiduciary duty for these reasons would also constitute grounds for the termination of the participation of an institution under whose contract the servicer committed the violation. The Secretary proposes to expand the breadth of paragraph (d) of this section to parallel similar provisions proposed to be included in §668.12, previously discussed, except that, in this case, these provisions would prohibit a third-party servicer (as opposed to the provisions of §668.12 which prohibit institutions) from employing or contracting with persons or organizations that have questionable past performance with respect to government funds. Paragraph (d) would be similarly amended to include misuse of State and local government funds and administrative determinations of fraud or other material violations of law. Finally, the Secretary proposes to amend paragraph (d) of this section. An institution or servicer, to remain qualified as a fiduciary, would have to meet the following requirement. If the institution or servicer becomes aware of a criminal conviction, or an administrative or judicial determination of fraud or other violation of law, by a person involved in the servicer's administration of an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program or a person with substantial control over the servicer, with respect to Federal, State, or local government funds, the institution or servicer would be required to protect the Title IV, HEA programs, including removing that person from Title IV, HEA program involvement or from exercising substantial control over the institution or servicer, as applicable. In addition, if an institution or a third-party servicer becomes aware that a violation of, or failure to carry out, applicable statutes and regulations by the servicer's principals or affiliates (as those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85), the institution or servicer is required to act to protect the Title IV, HEA programs, the beneficiaries of those programs, and the Federal Government from the risks occasioned by those events. These risks may include, but are not limited to, financial risks and risk to the reputation of the Title IV, HEA programs. An example of an action that an institution or servicer must take to protect the Title IV, HEA programs, their beneficiaries, and the Federal Government is the removal of all Title IV, HEA program administration duties from the assigned responsibilities of an individual. A violation of these proposed provisions would constitute grounds for the termination of the participation of an institution under whose contract the servicer committed the violation and the eligibility of the servicer to administer any aspect of an institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. These amendments parallel similar changes made to the institutional participation agreement requirements under §668.12. The Secretary also proposes to amend this section to explain how a basis for debarment and suspension relates to the standard of fiduciary responsibility. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to redesignate current paragraph (e) of this section as paragraph (f) and to add a new paragraph (e). The new paragraph would specify that if an institution or servicer becomes aware that cause for suspension or debarment of any of the institution's or servicer's principals or affiliates (as those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85) may exist, the institution or servicer is required to act to protect the Title IV, HEA programs in the same manner discussed in the previous paragraph, pending the outcome of a debarment or suspension action against that individual, or of proceedings that could give rise to suspension or debarment action against that individual.
