The appeal to the army, military police, public security, and state security organs across the country is believed to be the prime cause of the authorities' detentions and arrests of dissidents before the annual session of the National People's Congress, to be opened today. Mr Jiang's remarks, followed by the crackdown on leading dissidents, indicate that China may adopt a tough stance in the talks on human rights issues with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who starts his to Beijing visit tomorrow. "Any unstable element should be wiped out when it is in the embryonic stage and any issue should be dealt with properly and thoroughly before it sprouts and grows roots," Chinese sources yesterday quoted Mr Jiang as saying to law and order enforcers. During recent visits to the provinces, Mr Jiang, who is also the chairman of the Central Military Commission, summoned regional army, armed police, public security, and state security officers to make his points. Mr Jiang's speeches have been compiled into a document which is now being circulated to the army and all other law enforcement departments nationwide. Chinese sources quoted Mr Jiang as telling senior public security and armed police officers in Xian, the capital of the northwestern Shanxi Province, on 2 February, that: "We must be determined to crack down on any troublemakers, wipe out any unstable elements, and solve any social problems that may spur instability in society at the earliest stage. And the earlier we solve these problems, the less we will suffer." Mr Jiang, General Secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, also called on the army and law enforcers to stay alert in the current situation at home and abroad. "We, especially those responsible for safeguarding our nation, should have a strong sense of 'suffering and misery' in this historical moment as our nation is undergoing unprecedented fundamental changes," Mr Jiang said. He urged the army and law enforcers to try their best to ensure a stable social environment and law and order by suppressing dissidents and criminals. "Law enforcement departments should do their best to safeguard the achievements in development and reform and ensure that this endeavor by the Chinese Communist Party and the people should not suffer overnight because of the negligence of our comrades," Mr Jiang said. The party chief explained that the sense of "suffering and misery" required every comrade in the enforcement departments to stay alert at all times. He said enemies at home and abroad had never abandoned their plots to undermine China's national unity and sabotage China's reform and development cause -- adding that the human rights row was one such case. However, Mr Jiang said the domestic and world political and economic situation was very good and favoured China's ruling party and the people.
