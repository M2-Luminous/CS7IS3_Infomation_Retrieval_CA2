That step by step we are leading Sweden out of the crisis. And that a "yes" to Europe is a "yes" to the future. This was how Moderate Coalition Party secretary Gunnar Hokmark sketched the Moderates' election message. The message will to a large extent be that Sweden is now on the right road and what is important is to continue along the path we have started to take. "We are used to facing Social Democratic scare propaganda in election campaigns. But this year their attacks will flounder on the simple fact that when they were ruling the curves were all pointing downward and now the curves are pointing upward." The Moderate election campaign will clearly show the differences between Moderate and Social Democratic policy. This applies in particular to tax policy where the Moderates are pushing their line of tax reductions. While the Social Democrats, according to the Moderates' calculations, want to raise taxes by 80 billion kronor. "On tax policy there is a clear political dividing line. Here the Social Democrats have already lost credibility once before. The policy they are now advocating is the same policy with which they led Sweden into the crisis." It is from the Social Democrats that the Moderates expect to attract the largest number of new voters. "It is there that we have the major opinion poll and voter gains to make," Gunnar Hokmark said. "When we have made gains in the past, it is chiefly from the Social Democrats that we have taken votes." Gunnar Hokmark does not expect the four government parties to publish a joint election manifesto. "We will run the election campaign as individual parties. But the government coalition in itself is a very important manifestation." He is convinced that European issues will play a major role in the election campaign. "The question of whether or not Sweden should become a member will hover over the whole election campaign and will be brought to a head. And it will also be a question of who will lead Sweden in Europe. ``We Moderates will push the European issue firmly. We know that we will win voters with this. And we know that when we push the European issue others will push it more than they would have done.'' Gunnar Hokmark believes that the economy and Europe will be the election campaign's two main issues. The Social Democrats' party secretary, Mona Sahlin, recently proposed that farmers and businessmen should pay additional taxes if Sweden becomes a member of the EU, because these groups will gain so much from membership. Gunnar Hokmark calls this a "stupid excuse for raising taxes." Center Party leader Olof Johansson in his turn has said that increased environmental levies could contribute to the financing of Sweden's contribution to the EU budget. Hokmark says "no" to this too. "We will be able to afford to pay our membership contribution because membership will lead to increased economic growth. We should not then limit this growth by increasing taxes." Gunnar Hokmark thinks that local taxation should be reduced during the life of the next Riksdag (1994-1998). This will be achieved primarily with the help of "good local politicians." But he would also like to see a freeze on increases in local taxation and he thinks that referendums on tax increases should be held. The Moderates' first deputy chairman, Lars Tobisson, recently outlined what future social welfare should look like. The system will guarantee basic protection and protection against inflation. Citizens will have to protect themselves to a much greater extent against loss of income through their own savings and personal insurances. This caused Social Affairs Minister Bengt Westerberg (Liberal Party) to hit the roof. In this area there is a sharp dividing line between the Moderates and the Liberal Party and here the Liberals want to keep today's system. But Gunnar Hokmark would like to tone down the differences. He thinks that it is wrong to call the Moderate proposals cuts. They are necessary changes, he said, to create robust insurance systems which do not undermine social welfare policies. "The one-day period needed to qualify for sickness benefit for example was not a cut but an improvement, damn it. It led to less absenteeism and increased productivity." He was unwilling to outline any timetable, but said that "it is important to keep up a pretty rapid pace in the process of change." Another issue which divides the nonsocialist parties is nuclear power. The Center Party and the Christian Democratic Community Party want legislation establishing 2010 as the final year for nuclear power stations. The Moderates on the other hand think that nuclear power should be retained as long as the safety requirements are met. "Sweden is now entering a period of economic boom which will hopefully continue for the whole of the nineties. This makes an increased demand on electricity. And for environmental reasons in particular electricity is better than oil. "It is true that the parties have different views on this issue. But what has been characteristic of this Riksdag is that the government parties have been able to incorporate divergent views. I am convinced that they will be able to do so in the life of the next Riksdag too."
