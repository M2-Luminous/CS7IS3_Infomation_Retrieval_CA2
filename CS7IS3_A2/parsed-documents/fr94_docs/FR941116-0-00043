FR941116-0-00043 FR941116-0-00008 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;29] Amendment to Time of Designation for Restricted Area R&hyph;4207; Upper Lake Huron, MI AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the time of designation for Restricted Area R&hyph;4207, Upper Lake Huron, MI. This action changes the hours of operation from ``sunrise to sunset'' to ``intermittent, sunrise to sunset by Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).'' This action will enhance real-time joint utilization of special use airspace. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, February 2, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ken McElroy, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;7686. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations reduces the time of designation for Restricted Area R&hyph;4207, Upper Lake Huron, MI, from ``sunrise to sunset'' to ``intermittent, sunrise to sunset by NOTAM.'' This action is the result of a request from the U.S. Air Force to reduce the time of designation of Restricted Area R&hyph;4207, Upper Lake Huron, MI. There are no changes to the activities conducted within R&hyph;4207. This action will enhance real-time joint utilization of special use airspace and more accurately reflect actual use of the area. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Section 73.42 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review This action reduces the time of designation of the restricted area. There are no changes to the boundaries, altitudes or activities conducted within the restricted area. Accordingly, this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts.''
