The decision had been made as far back as 18 January. Fedorov's disagreement in principle with the new economic policy of the government which is being formed at present was the reason for his resignation. Fedorov also finds it is impossible for him to stay at his post together with chairman of the Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. Since the president has kept Gerashchenko, Fedorov has chosen to resign. The ex-minister said there would be no headlong drop in the ruble exchange rate in the immediate future since the foundation of the financial policy had been laid for three months in advance. He predicted a worsening of the financial situation in April. Fedorov said he did not know of any other policy in the conditions of market economy except monetarist, and any attempts to improve the industry by issuing money will only lead to higher inflation. He sharply criticized the agreement between the Russian Central Bank and Belarus on the single monetary zone. He expressed the opinion that Russia would bear the burden of the decision. Among his merits, Fedorov mentioned the ruble's relatively stable rate and an increase in the real income of the population by 10 percent in 1993. [Begin Fedorov recording] A populist policy which, I think, will be chosen, threatens with the ruble rate reaching 12,000 by the end of the year, average inflation rates -- approximately 30 percent and falling real living standards. At the same time production will still fall by about five per cent. So none of the indices will improve. But, as I already said in my New Year forecast, it is possible that the production of tanks might increase. [end recording] Fedorov refused to name his candidate for the post of finance minister fearing that, if he named him, the latter would have not been appointed.
