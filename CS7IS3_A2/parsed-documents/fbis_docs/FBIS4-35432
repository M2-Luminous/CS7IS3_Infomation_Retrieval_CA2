How does the Brotherhood respond to this accusation? [Al-Hudaybi] President Mubarak himself, in a recent visit to Europe, told the French newspaper LE MONDE that the Muslim Brotherhood is a moderate group that shuns terror and expresses its views through peaceful means. Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, less than a month ago, also said that the Brotherhood shuns violence and terror and believes in peaceful means. Therefore, I do not know why there has been such a change of heart. [Raghib] How do you explain this reversal of attitude toward your group. Which interpretation do you think is correct? [Al-Hudaybi] For the past 25 years, our record has been clean. Every investigation into acts of violence committed during this period came to the inevitable conclusion that the Muslim Brotherhood is not involved in violence or linked with terror in any way. Furthermore, we have taken part in the People's Assembly elections in 1984 and 1987. We had a respectable number of deputies in the Assembly. We participated in parliamentary life in a serious way. No one ever accused us of breaking the law or deviating from the constitution. We also have members in the current municipal councils who have never violated the law. Some of our members have been elected to boards of prestigious professional associations and performed services that have been greatly commended. Their conduct and unionist work fell within the constitutional, legal, and legitimate boundaries and evoked nothing but praise. No one accused them of committing any act of violence. Their actions speak louder than words. [Raghib] Recent incidents in the Bar Association sparked off accusations that the Brotherhood is using the Association for illegal purposes. Pro-government writers have repeatedly made this claim. How do you respond to such an accusation? [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is opposed to violence. I am not well-informed about Bar Association events because I have been sick lately. But allow me to say, for starters, that the authority that is entitled to make such accusations is the Public Prosecution Office, which has not said anything so far. The accusations that were made came from the Interior Ministry, an authority which, in our opinion, is not entitled to issue charges. The whole controversy and the attendant speculations and accusations could have been avoided had the coroner's report on the causes of death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani been published. The issue is not whether Madani belonged or did not belong to terrorist organizations, but whether he was tortured or not. [Raghib] The Brotherhood issued a statement last Thursday denying that it calls for sedition. What did the statement aim to achieve, and why was it issued at this very moment? [Al-Hudaybi] We issued this statement to refute the accusations leveled upon us. We aimed to answer all those who took the opportunity to defame and assail the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has taken part in a lot of political and social events in Egypt and other countries. We did our bit during the October 1992 earthquake. Many of our members offered professional care to the victims. This was a peaceful effort, a work of charity. On the external level, we have helped out in Bosnia-Herzegovina and other areas. [Raghib] You know and we know that the Muslim Brotherhood's activities have so far been banned. Are there any other channels that the Brotherhood is using to carry out its political and social activities? [Al-Hudaybi] No. There are no illegal channels for either political or social activities. All of our activities are carried out in public. All the Brotherhood members are known to the state's official departments. There is no reason why we should work in secret. All of our statements and activities are done in public within the framework of the constitution and law. [Raghib] The Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of violence since its establishment in 1928. Some reports indicate that the cornerstone of the Brotherhood's old military organization is that it supports current terrorist actions with the aim of changing the regime. Is this true? [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is neither involved nor has anything to do with the current events. We have no members who act outside the Brotherhood's framework. As for the Brotherhood's history since its establishment, its policies before the revolution were directed against the Jews and colonialists. The Brotherhood had its excuses for that. But now times have changed and the situation is different. The reports that the remnants of the military organization are working to overthrow the regime are baseless. They are all rumors propagated by our enemies who know that they are false. Therefore, I decline to elaborate on the issue. [Raghib] What about the Salsabil Computer Company's case which was blamed on a secret organization of the Brotherhood. Is not that true? [Al-Hudaybi] It was not really an accusation incriminating the Brotherhood. Had it been true, none of the defendants would have been released from the prison. Therefore, we do not consider it as an incriminating factor or an accusation. The Brotherhood has no links whatsoever with this company. [Raghib] What about the Muslim Brotherhood's ties with its counterparts in Arab and foreign countries? [Al-Hudaybi] Our relations with the Muslim Brotherhood abroad are far from being secret. We attend seminars and conferences held by the Brotherhood in any Arab or foreign country. We attend these meetings by invitation. We discuss the status of the Brotherhood in each country and we assess everything that concerns the Islamic countries. But in Egypt we are not allowed to hold such seminars or conferences or to invite any representative of the Brotherhood from abroad. [Raghib] Who currently finances the Brotherhood? [Al-Hudaybi] Any able member of the Brotherhood can donate according to his limit, but the public donations are published in the press. These donations are deposited in the banks' accounts and are inspected by the Central Auditing Agency. This is the situation. The Brotherhood has no specific financial sources from either inside or outside. [Raghib] You certainly want to take part in the national dialogue and the regime is refusing to allow this. What is the solution? [Al-Hudaybi] I have nothing to say on this subject. The issue of national dialogue has become effaced and is not listed on our agenda. We are not thinking of taking part in this dialogue when it is held.
