FR941117-2-00127 FR941117-2-00087 IV Accordingly, in accordance with Sections 81, 161b, 161c, 161i, and 161o of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and 10 CFR Parts 20 and 30, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT, ETL shall: A. Immediately cease and desist from any further use of byproduct material now in its possession. B. Maintain safe control over the byproduct material, as required by 10 CFR Part 20, by keeping the material in locked storage and not allowing any person access to the material, except for purposes of assuring the material's continued safe storage, until the material is transferred to a person authorized to receive and possess the material in accordance with the provisions of this Order and the Commission's regulations. C. Transfer the nickel-63 byproduct material within 30 days to a person authorized to receive and possess the material. If ETL does not have sufficient funds to complete the transfer, ETL must provide, within 10 days of this Order, evidence supporting such a claim by submitting to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555: (1) An estimate of the cost of the transfer and the basis for the estimate, including the license numbers and identifies of the persons who have provided estimates of the cost of the transfer; (2) written statements from at least two banks stating that ETL does not qualify for a loan to pay for the transfer; (3) copies of the Federal income tax returns of ETL for the years ending 1993, 1992, 1991, and 1990; and (4) a signed statement agreeing to allow the NRC to receive credit information on ETL from a credit agency. In addition, if ETL has not been able to find a person who will accept the byproduct material, ETL must provide to the Director, Office of Enforcement, at the address stated above, within 10 days of the date of this Order, the names of the persons who have been contacted regarding acceptance of the byproduct material and the dates that the contacts were made. A SUBMITTAL OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS DOES NOT EXCUSE NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THIS ORDER. D. At least two working days prior to the date of the transfer of the byproduct material, notify Dr. Ronald Bellamy, Chief, Nuclear Materials Safety Branch, NRC, Region I, by telephone (610&hyph;337&hyph;5200) so that the NRC may, if it elects, observe the transfer of the material to the authorized recipient. E. Within seven days following completion of the transfer, provide to the Regional Administrator, Region I, in writing, under oath or affirmation: (1) Confirmation, on NRC Form 314, that the nickel-63 byproduct material has been transferred, (2) the last date that the byproduct material was used, (3) a copy of the survey performed in accordance with 10 CFR 30.36(c)(1)(v), and (4) a copy of the certification from the authorized recipient that the source has been received. Copies of the response to this Order shall be sent to the Regional Administrator, Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555. After reviewing your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with NRC requirements. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 10th day of November 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hugh L. Thompson, Jr., Deputy Executive Director for Nuclear Materials Safety, Safeguards, and Operations Support.
