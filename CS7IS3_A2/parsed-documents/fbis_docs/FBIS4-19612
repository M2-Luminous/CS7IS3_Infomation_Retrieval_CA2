The EU's Ministerial Council of Foreign Affairs said in a statement: "The Union intends to send a strong political signal to the incoming government and to the South African population." The Council agreed in principle to include South Africa in its general system of preferences (GSP) comprising low tariffs on manufactured imports from developing countries. The decision was the centrepiece of proposals for the rapid deepening of economic and political relations with South Africa pending the negotiation of a comprehensive new system of political, trade and economic links. A formal decision on the GSP issue is expected following the EU's 10-year review of its GSP system in May, and consultations with other developing countries linked to the EU in the Lome trade-and-aid agreement. The EU also agreed in principle to extend its "rules of origin" to South Africa, which means that South African components of goods partly manufactured in other countries of the region would also benefit from low tariffs. And the Council agreed to pursue schemes for promoting and protecting foreign investments in South Africa, and to boost cooperation in such areas as education, industry, telecommunications, science and technology. "We want South Africa to become a motor of economic growth in southern Africa," an EU spokesman said, adding that the GSP break would boost South African exports of manufactured and high-tech goods. The EU is South Africa's biggest trading partner, but most of its imports of South African products currently comprise raw materials. Trade between the two sides totalled ECU10.8 billion (12 billion dollars) over the first nine months of 1993, resulting in a trade surplus of ECU2.59 billion (2.95 billion dollars) for the EU. The EU has already dismantled all economic sanctions against South Africa, and Tuesday's decision is the first element of a new era of EU-South African links to replace the frosty relations of the apartheid years. The EU Council also proposed to open negotiations for a strong interim agreement with the new South African government soon after the elections, linking comprehensive cooperation with respect for democracy and human rights. And it agreed to use its influence at the United Nations to have lifted the last remaining sanctions against South Africa -- an embargo on arms sales and military cooperation.
