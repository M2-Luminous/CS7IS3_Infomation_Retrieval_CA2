DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said the report ascertains for the first time that there is no political will for a solution to the Cyprus issue based on the procedures that have been followed for a number of years. He said: The Turkish Cypriot side is blamed for the failure of all talks on Cyprus. Turkey is blamed indirectly. Referring to the alternative proposals, Matsis said that based on the ascertainment that the Turkish side has no political will, only two of the proposals are significant: The adoption of measures by the Security Council for the other side and the radical revision of the approach for a Cyprus solution. He added that President Glavkos Kliridhis' proper policy led to the revelation of the Turkish intransigence and to the attribution of responsibility.
