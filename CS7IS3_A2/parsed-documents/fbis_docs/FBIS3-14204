The visit is the first of its kind to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. In a statement to QUDS PRESS, the source said that the visit, which falls within framework of the political moves by the opposition Palestinian forces to mobilize support for their positions that are opposed to continuing the talks with Israel, is aimed at discussing political developments in the region and the Libyan stance toward the current peace process. Libya opposes the self-rule accord reached by Israel and the PLO at the end of last year. All leaders of the opposition Palestinian factions, with the exception of Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, are participating with the Palestinian delegation, which is expected to meet with Libyan President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. The source said that Jibril, who resides in Damascus, did not accompany the delegation for security reasons. He added that the visit was made upon an invitation from the Libyan leadership. The Palestinian forces opposed to the Declaration of Principles are seeking to mobilize a hardline Arab stance against this accord. For this purpose, they have established an alliance which they have called "the Alliance of the 10 Palestinian Forces," whose headquarters is in Damascus.
