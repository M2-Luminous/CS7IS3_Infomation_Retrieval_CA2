It is estimated that about 20,000 people are now infected with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], the virus that causes AIDS. About 6 percent, or about 1,200 people, of those infected are expected to develop AIDS (a disease that weakens the body's immune system). Those who show symptoms of AIDS require treatment, like it or not. Data so far gathered by the Department of Health show that at the end of last year there were 177 HIV victims, a figure that rapidly increased to 187. "Clinically, only about 40 of that number are actually suffering from AIDS," said Dr. Broto Wasisto, M.D., M.P.H. [Master of Public Health], director general of medical services of the Department of Health. In view of this phenomenon, class A and B hospitals throughout Indonesia must be prepared to treat them. "The Department of Health has distributed to all hospitals books with instructions on how to care for AIDS victims," he declared. Not all hospitals are able to do this yet. In a panel discussion at RSCM [Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital] last year on improving capabilities for managing AIDS cases at hospitals throughout Jakarta, it was learned that hospitals are generally ready. "The problem, however, is that their perception of treating AIDS is not yet the same," said Dr. Samsuridjal Djauzi, an internist who also handles AIDS at the RSCM. A discussion panel participant from PELNI [Indonesian National Maritime Company] Hospital admitted, "We feel awkward explaining AIDS to a patient or the patient's family." Thus, procedures for the counseling of patients are clearly important, and not only from the medical aspect. "They are often stressed and afraid and still consider AIDS a stigma or something unusual," Samsuridjal said. Dr. Lukas Mangindaan, a psychiatrist who provides AIDS counseling at RSCM, said that counseling is necessary in order to find out how much the patient and the patient's family know about HIV. "Discussion of sexual matters must be done in a way that does not embarrass or offend the patient. Questions about sex need to have a special place in AIDS consultation, because most transmission of HIV occurs through sexual relations," Lukas said. At RSCM, patients infected with HIV, and especially AIDS, are treated immediately without the patient being put to the trouble of administrative procedures and questions of advance payment. In fact, RSCM also gives basic medicines without charge. These include antibiotics and lifesaving medicines of an emergency nature, such as infusions. The upgrading of hospital facilities to treat AIDS patients is actually not a difficult matter. Of course, additional cost, such as for procuring gloves, will be incurred to prevent spread of the disease. The use of gloves, however, is not just for AIDS, because there should be safety measures to prevent the spread of disease between doctors/staff and patients and among patients. For that reason, doctors, nurses, and cleaning staff must use gloves. It is clear that doctors, nurses, laboratories, administrative staff, and cleaning personnel must be prepared for treating AIDS patients. Samsuridjal described RSCM's experience. When an AIDS case was diagnosed, links had already been established with the clinical laboratory and clinical pathologist so that when a specimen was taken from the patient, it was immediately dealt with safely. In addition, within the AIDS treatment team a doctor must be appointed to be responsible. When that is not done, sometimes not even one doctor examines a patient. "The important thing is the willingness of doctors and hospitals to treat AIDS patients," said Samsuridjal. There have been hospitals that for lack of experience have been unwilling to treat patients and have sent them to RSCM. "That should not happen," said Dr. Kartono Muhammad, general chairman of the IDI [Indonesia Physicians Association]. Besides RSCM, other hospitals in Jakarta are able to treat AIDS victims. They include MMC [expansion not given] Hospital, PERTAMINA [National Oil and Natural Gas Company] Hospital, Kramat Hospital, Mitra Keluarga Hospital, and St. Carolus Hospital. According to Broto Wasisto, for the treatment of AIDS the focus is generally on class A and B hospitals, which have specialist doctors and complete facilities. Many nurses from class A and B hospitals have been sent overseas to learn how to care for AIDS patients. "Two years ago Indonesia sent nurses to Australia, the United States, and Thailand," Broto said. According to Samsuridjal, AIDS has attacked not only residents of big cities but people from small cities, too. He recommended, therefore, that class C hospitals -- which normally are in the provinces -- also be prepared. Broto said there are two steps that class C hospitals must take if they receive AIDS patients: Send them to class A or B hospitals, or bring in specialists from class A or B hospitals. This is called a referral system, whether from above or from below, depending on the situation.
