One rebel negotiator assured PRENSA LATINA that supervision of violations of citizens' liberties is the sole issue making true progress since the current round of talks began on Thursday. The source requested anonymity out of respect for the participants' commitment with the United Nations not to disclose any information to the media during the talks. Nevertheless, he let it slip that "tomorrow there will surely be a joint statement on this issue." Immediate international verification, however, is only one of three issues included in the human rights issue. This in turn is one of the two points on the negotiating agenda together with the setting of a general timetable for the process. So, in five days of alternate encounters by the participants (pendular system) with UN moderator French Jean Arnault, neither the creation of an investigation commission on the violations nor the possibility of an alleged agreement in this regard has been taken up. The two sides have not met face to face, only communicating separately with the mediator. Nevertheless, each delegation separately admitted "progress" and even Hector Rosada, chief of the government delegation, talked about "75 percent progress." Arnault accepted there are differences and decided to postpone until tomorrow the encounter that should have concluded today, as the extension of his consultation with the warring factions warranted the need to engage in one more day of conversations. The UN official did not consider important the fact that the government and the guerrillas had not met together after five days of talks. "This does not mean incomprehension; it is only a technical detail," he indicated. Arnault also indicated that the main stumbling block in outlining international verification is centered on the manner in which it is to be implemented. That is, is the verification done "in the middle of the war or after the cease-fire," he explained. On this, there are recent precedents in Central America where the United Nations initiated investigations of the violation of human rights in El Salvador after the signing of the armistice in January 1992 between the government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. Therefore, according to analysts, in no way do the end of war actions have to necessarily be a condition to start clearing up murders, extrajudicial executions, kidnappings, and other matters in Guatemala. A document distributed here by the Guatemalan human rights organizations indicates that from June 1993 to February 1994 there were 43 massacres, 282 murders, 45 persons declared missing after being arrested, 1,469 arbitrary detentions, and 210 death threats registered in Guatemala. In addition, 19 children were reported missing and 17 infants were found dead, according to the Guatemalan human rights commission. Last week, the UN Human Rights Commission that meets in Geneva, Switzerland, decided to continue its advisory on Guatemala regarding citizens rights and urged the warring factions to sign an immediate international verification agreement on this issue. In this regard, Arnault commented, "it is clear that the UN orientation fostered the parties' desire to sign an agreement."
