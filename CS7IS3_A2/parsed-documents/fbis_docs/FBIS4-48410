The law is to be amended to strengthen its force, according to the Minister for Justice Chief Maweni Simelane. The lawyers said this legislation is contrary to every civilised notion of justice. This is contained in a series of documents prepared by the organisation and which have been made available to THE TIMES. The lawyers said the law is likely to cause more harm than the good that is presumably intended. They said the proposed amendment to the non-bailable offence legislation seeks to deprive the courts of the last vestiges of discretion left to them. "The likelihood of injustice is increased," they said. They said it is essential that the Courts be left with a discretion to enable each case to be dealt with on its merits. [passage omitted]
