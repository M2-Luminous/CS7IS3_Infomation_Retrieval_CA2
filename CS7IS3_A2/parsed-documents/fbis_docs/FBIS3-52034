This has occurred on the eve of a public workers strike, which according to the strike promoters, will be joined by over 200,000 workers. The uncertainty heightened in the wake of the decision by the Transportation Coordinating Board to paralyze activities this coming Tuesday. This measure could leave the country without a normal fuel supply during the strike. The explosion that we mentioned earlier injured three persons who were identified as: Lydia Bolanos, 32; Carlos Bolanos, 35; and Ramon Hernandez, 32. Mrs. Bolanos is employed by the computer section of the National Police and happened to be passing by the area. The shrapnel scattered up to a radius of 5 km, reaching the Kennedy and Galilea neighborhoods of Zone 18.
