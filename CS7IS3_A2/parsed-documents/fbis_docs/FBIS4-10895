[Castello] Good morning to all the workers of the "Doing Radio" program in Havana, particularly Cavada. [Cavada] Good morning. [Alonso] Today, Marcos is in high spirits because in a few hours he will be here in Havana. He has been invited to the conference "The Nation and the Emigre Community" scheduled to begin Friday at the Convention Center. What do you have to tell us? [Castello] I will tell you about the forthcoming conference in Havana. Here, the media coverage continues to spiral faster and faster. Every television newscast and radio program is highlighting the conference "The Nation and the Emigre Community." As a matter of fact, there is an increasing number of features carrying the opinions of certain people adamantly opposed to the conference, people who get to delirious excesses, and describe the conference participants as a small group of unconditional, resentful, greedy, and privileged people who are trying, all of a sudden, to boost their standing to top class. In order words, they are trying by every means to mar the legitimacy and importance to the process beginning this weekend in Havana. Another interesting bit of news on the media today -- also an evident symptom of the situation: The front page of THE NUEVO HERALD trumpets that this dialogue is creating discord in Havana and attributes to an unidentified source reports that there are even conflicts between the Cuban Foreign Ministry and the Ideological Department of the Communist Party of Cuba regarding the purpose of the conference, what ought to be goals, and how it ought to be carried out. The climate reached an apex last night. There was a report -- to call it something, perhaps more than it deserves -- that there was an alleged problem with Cuban President Fidel Castro. It is being said that a hospital has been taken over. In other words, there is all manner of this sort of development common to any important event. This situation is typical. There are many people here invited to the conference, and since Monday they have been departing for Havana in accordance with their means. The bulk of the delegation will travel tomorrow, at least those who reside in the United States, including me. Therefore, I will have a chance to greet you. [Alonso] What can I say; we are accustomed to these issues being manipulated by the media abroad every time there is a meeting of this kind or any new event. We are very used to this. However, we are also aware that there are different opinions in this regard within the United States, and particularly Florida. It is very typical that this comes from the powerful people who have the means to manipulate the media and close to politicians. However, there are many others who want a rapprochement, family reunification, and all those issues to be discussed at the conference, and are very happy this event is taking place. [Castello] I could add that the people committed to this type of attack -- because there is a difference between expressing an opinion freely, everyone has the right to oppose or support the Havana conference, that is undebatable. However, the manner and attitude of this type of attack is precisely one of the things that moved the members of the Rio Group -- Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina -- to express to U.S. Vice President Al Gore, the fear of holding in Miami, later this year, the hemispheric summit called for by President Bill Clinton. Precisely, in fear of the Cuban exiles and the way in which they express themselves, they are worried that that meeting which is to focus on continental economic and environmental problems, economic cooperation, etc., will be taken off track by the Cuban issue, once again, due to the actions of these Miami far right sectors.
