The Russian vessel, apparently a patrol boat, forced the 83rd Kintoku Maru and the 18th Tenyu Maru to stop on Wednesday morning as they were sailing in waters 20 kilometers south of Etorofu, one of the four disputed islands held by Russia. The two trawlers were taken to Shikotan, also one of the four Russian-held and Japanese-claimed islands, and underwent inspection by Russian authorities, they said. The Tenyu Maru with a crew of 16, based in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, was released later that day and returned to Kushiro on Thursday morning but the whereabouts of the Kintoku Maru also with 16 crew members from Kushiro is still not known, the officials said. The Kintoku Maru and its crew are believed to be detained there, the officials said. The two vessels had been engaged in fishing operations south of the Kuril chain of islands under a fishing agreement between Japan and Russia. Disputes over sovereignty of the four islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai groups of islets -- have marred relations between the two countries.
