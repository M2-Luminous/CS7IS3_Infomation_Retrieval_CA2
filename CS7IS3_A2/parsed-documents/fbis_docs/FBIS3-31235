The Srpska republic will tomorrow issue an official statement on the NATO ultimatum. This is what Karadzic told the British (WTN) Agency: [Correspondent] Do you envisage handing over any more heavy weapons to the United Nations or are you going to leave them where they are, albeit under UN control? [Karadzic] We are going to make some combinations. We are probably going to give something over and to regroup something in order to make it possible for the United Nations to have efficient control. We also want reciprocity from the Muslim side. [Correspondent] Do you think we are now closer to an agreement? [Karadzic] Well, I think we may be closer since the United States has interfered. The United States cannot afford to interfere and not to come and help peace to be reached. The United States and Russia will probably have the last word, but probably in line with a plan by the European Union. In any case, we are ready for peace, we are ready to give over some territories that we control, and even some traditionally Serbian territories, but we are not going to go much below 64 percent of the private property that we possess. For peace and in the name of peace we are going to give something, but not everything. [Correspondent] Do you think that air strikes are now more or less likely? [Karadzic] Air strikes have always been realistic. We have always taken them seriously, not because of other people's behavior, but because of NATO's internal needs. NATO is experiencing a deep crisis just as the Western alliance is. They are showing their muscle and in our case they are also trying to scare Russia. They are doing things that are going simply to interrupt and destroy the NATO alliance. The NATO alliance is not needed in this war. NATO resembles a giant who has no feeling for reality. It will try to destroy somebody, but will destroy itself this time. If there are any air strikes, many NATO nations are going to distance themselves from this moral catastrophe. Then they are going to become completely divided.
