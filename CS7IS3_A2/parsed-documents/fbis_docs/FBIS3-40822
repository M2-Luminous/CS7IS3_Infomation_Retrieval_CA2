Since UN General Assembly Resolution 194 was passed on 11 December 1948, the United States alone every year has sponsored a vote on the resolution, renewing its support for it. Paragraph 11 of this well-known international resolution (which Israel says binds no one, as it was passed by the General Assembly, not the Security Council) establishes the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and live in peace with their neighbors and the obligation to pay compensation for property to those who choose not to return and for every missing or injured person. Only this year did the United States take a different position. It refused to sponsor the motion to renew the international community's support for Resolution 194 and joined Israel in abstaining from voting. The Arabs were dealt a double blow. They were gripped by fear that American policy in President Bill Clinton's administration would become more strongly inclined to disengage itself from the international authority for the Middle East peace process embodied in Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Critics of the Declaration of Principles agreement signed by the PLO and the Israeli government, as well as forces that were hostile to it from the beginning, can find in the new American position reason to conclude that the Oslo-Washington agreement was what allowed the United States to retreat from its traditional position on Resolution 194 as prelude to devising an unjust solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees. Critics and opponents can also say that it is politically naive to demand that the United States be more royalist than the king or more Palestinian than the Palestinians, now that the PLO has signed an agreement that puts the refugee problem on the "permanent solution" agenda without mentioning Resolution 194, deemed to be the international authority for resolving this problem. We will not evade a response to this point of view, which seems to have acquired some plausibility in the wake of and because of the recent American position, but we shall first try to assess the real dimensions of the American step. About a year and a half ago, the United States announced that it had in the past supported and still supported UN General Assembly Resolution 194. This position was announced by the State Department's spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler prior to the meeting in Ottawa of the committee on refugees that has emerged from the multilateral negotiations on regional cooperation in the Middle East. Her statement reinforced the feeling that Arab, and especially Palestinian, participation in the multilateral negotiations would help enable the American administration to develop its positions on the peace process and make them more positive by Arab-Palestinian standards. Certainly, the mention of Resolution 194 in official American statements raises in the minds of those who yearn for "a just peace" a headlong desire to believe that the Palestinian problem from A to Z will be resolved finally in a political settlement that drives into oblivion the "humanitarian clause" contained in Security Council Resolution 242. This clause revealed to us how much those who hold the reins of international policy wrapped in international legitimacy lack the humanitarian sense; for setting "humanitarian right" in place of what is "political right" represents a complete negation of true humanitarian criteria. Of all Palestinian rights, the right of return is the one that most inspires the dreams of afflicted Palestinians. It will turn out to be an outrageous crime if the United States feigns inability to help us respond to this political and humanitarian need. This we say, having been taught by the experience of international politics that a major power's announced political commitment on an issue can for practical considerations turn into a political deception that its authors usually categorize as part of what they like to call "the political game." Tutweiler's statement, which was in response to a journalist's question, was followed by an American official's admission that the administration preferred not to answer "questions of this kind." The officially announced reason was that the American administration preferred to avoid raising difficult problems, such as the right of return for Palestinians, at the beginning of the talks, because raising them could lead to "the collapse of the house of cards" in which the peace negotiations are taking place. Signaling that the United States would adhere to an interpretation of Resolution 194 that evaded the essence of the resolution, the American assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, Ambassador Edward Djerejian said: "The matter (Tutweiler's statement) has been magnified and given more importance than it really has. You know the United States' position on Jerusalem. That is a good example of how the matter can be twisted." It is indeed a good example. Resolution 194 also speaks about putting Jerusalem under United Nations custody, whereas the American position (which until the other day supported this resolution) leaves the destiny of Jerusalem to the negotiations and supports the city's continued unity. How does the United States now justify its new position of abstaining from voting? Explaining the reasons for his country's abstention, George Sherman, the American representative, said: "We want at this important moment to avoid problems that might cause division; for the positions of the parties in the region differ in important respects on the refugee issue, and these differences must be settled at the negotiating table." After renewing America's strong commitment to "a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace," he expressed his government's hope that this peace would include a satisfactory settlement of the refugee problem. As for the "philosophical principles" of this American view, they are: "not showing partiality in advance, not prejudging the results of the negotiations, and rejecting any language that could be deemed a premature judgment." The American representative registered his country's objection to such expressions as "occupied Palestinian land, including Jerusalem," and "Palestinian and other Arab lands that Israel has occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem." According to the American representative's explanation, these phrases or expressions could be considered "prejudiced and prematurely judging the results of the negotiations." For the same reasons, the United States abstained from voting on a draft resolution on the Golan "condemning Israel, the occupying power, for refusing to obey resolutions on the occupied Syrian Golan, particularly Security Council Resolution 497, in which the Council deemed that Israel's decision to impose its laws, judicial rule, and administration on the Golan was null and void and of no effect under international law and demanded that Israel rescind the decision immediately." We do not know how this American position squares with Clinton's announcement that his meeting with Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad "will show the authority of the foundations of the process for a comprehensive, lasting peace." Washington has transferred the refugee question from the bilateral to the multilateral negotiations. At the same time, Washington has prevented making Resolution 194 a basis for negotiations in the committee on refugees. Washington has announced several times that it opposes raising the question of the Palestinians' right to return at the multilateral negotiations on refugees. Although the United States has moved the subject of the refugees to the multilateral negotiations, it has affirmed on many occasions that this subject must be discussed when the parties begin negotiating in the bilateral negotiations about the final disposition. Washington views the committee on refugees that has emerged from the multilateral negotiations as the place where the "technical aspects" of the refugee problem and its mode of resolution can be discussed. But only the bilateral negotiations based on Resolution 242 are responsible for finding "a just solution to the refugee problem" in accordance with this resolution. In the context of the bilateral negotiations, from the purely legal point of view the United Nations can at the appropriate time interpret "a just solution" to the refugee problem as being full implementation of Resolution 194. In seeking to interpret the phrase "just solution," the international organization cannot ignore Resolution 194, for the legitimate international authority is an indivisible whole. Without downplaying the significance of the latest American position, we expect the United States to continue its support for Resolution 194--this because it is the party most eager for the peace negotiations to encompass all the difficult issues and problems for whose solution the United Nations has defined foundations through its various resolutions. The most important thing for Washington is that the political negotiations reach results in light of which one can claim that all UN resolutions have turned into agreements between the parties, even if these agreements turn out to have the form of a distorted and arbitrary interpretation of the resolutions of the international authority. Even Israel wants a certain implementation of Resolution 194. It hopes that the negotiations on a "final solution" will arrive at results that guarantee the Palestinian refugees their right to compensation for their right to return to their homes. Perhaps the most important thing that must be avoided is indulging in the illusion that the UN General Assembly is capable of implementing Resolution 194. For 45 years, the Assembly has stated that the condition of the refugees is disturbing and has expressed regret that no means have yet been reached to realize progress in implementing paragraph 11 of Resolution 194. Yet, what if paragraph 11 were implemented under the current circumstances of the peace process? Israel, with support from the United States and other powers, would strongly reject allowing the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, so that compensation would become the likely alternative. And compensation by itself would not be the solution, since Israel would seek to make it part of a process of resettling the refugees in Arab and foreign countries and granting them the nationalities of these countries. Palestinians can in no way accept such a solution. The focus of their striving and struggle will remain guaranteeing the refugees' right to return to their homes and guaranteeing the right of returnees or those who receive compensation to obtain Palestinian nationality, so that the Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will belong to Palestinians wherever they may be. While holding fast to Resolution 194, we realize that some requirements of a just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem cannot be found in this resolution. A just solution to the refugee problem cannot come about through implementation of Resolution 194, just as it cannot come about without its implementation. The impact of the political and strategic pressures by which the state of Palestine has been limited geographically to the West Bank and Gaza Strip must be neutralized as regards the demography of this state, so that the economy can be its defining factor in regard to population.
