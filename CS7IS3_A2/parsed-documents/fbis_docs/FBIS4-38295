FBIS4-38295 "drnes126_j_94007" FBIS-NES-94-126 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Saudi Arabia Daily Refutes Involvement, `Intervention' in Yemen Daily Refutes Involvement, `Intervention' in Yemen JN2906184994 Al-Dammam AL-YAWM in Arabic 28 Jun 94 p 9 JN2906184994 Al-Dammam AL-YAWM Arabic BFN [Editorial: "The Kingdom and Yemen's Interests"] [Text] The claims that the kingdom is taking a biased stand toward the Yemen war are both baseless and unjustifiable. For the Kingdom's Yemen policy, as attested to by the Yemeni people, has always sought to promote the lot of the Yemeni people, and to boost their abilities through the huge financial assistance granted to Yemen. This assistance was used to finance development projects that were instrumental in making the qualitative leap forward seen in the areas of education, health, road construction, and other vital sectors in Yemen. The Kingdom made undeniable contributions to this commendable cultural leap forward. It is not peculiar for the Kingdom, given its huge economic prowess, to assist its brothers in Yemen. For, it has always been known for aiding Arabs and Muslims whenever it could. This is the reflection of a policy espoused since the unification of the Kingdom. This policy is still in force. The kingdom has not sought to take advantage of all the wealth and resources bestowed upon it by God to the exclusion of others. It has always extended a helping hand to fellow Arabs and Muslims in pursuit of this sound policy and its spirit, which is derived from the injunctions of the tolerant Islamic religion and its sublime heavenly ideals. Given all this, it is strange to see the northerners claim that the kingdom's position on Yemeni developments harms the interests of the Yemeni people, and that the kingdom is involved in the ongoing conflict between Sanaa and Aden when they are well aware that the Kingdom stressed the need to heed reason and halt the war between the two warring sides to protect Yemen's interests and end the bloodletting there even before the passage of the UN cease-fire resolution. The northerners are also aware that the Kingdom was one of the first countries to have blessed Yemeni unity when it was established by agreement between the two parts of Yemen four years ago. The Kingdom did so because it has always been interested in promoting the interests of Yemen and the prosperity of its people. What is going on in fraternal Yemen nowadays can in no way promote the interests of the people in the two parts of Yemen. This is because war produces disastrous consequences. The continuation of the war in Yemen will produce devastation there. This will destroy the economic infrastructures built there, thanks to the contributions made by the Kingdom to promote the Yemenis' interests and bring about their prosperity. War could only produce further ruination, destruction, and devastation for both parts of Yemen. That is why the Kingdom hastened to support the UN cease-fire resolution. The kingdom wants an end to the heinous massacres to which the cities of southern Yemen are being exposed, because they have opposed a unity meant to be built on the dead bodies of the Yemeni people. The Kingdom cannot take the blame for the mistakes Sanaa has made--mistakes that have exacerbated and complicated the political crisis in Yemen and caused it to flare up in a military confrontation with the south. The Kingdom's political constants cannot allow for intervention in Yemen's domestic affairs. Nonetheless, the Kingdom is interested in helping the Yemeni people overcome their current ordeal. Hence, its support for the UN cease-fire resolution. Additionally, the Kingdom is willing to help any Arab or Islamic efforts that could help to settle the ongoing conflict in a manner that would halt the bloodletting in Yemen and place Yemeni interests above all considerations. Given all this, the Kingdom rejects the baseless allegations that it is involved in the ongoing conflict between north Yemen and south Yemen. At the same time, the Kingdom would like to reiterate that it is determined to work to safeguard the interests of the fraternal Yemeni people. It goes without saying that the Yemeni people's interests are not promoted when Sanaa violates the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution. Likewise, their interests are not served when Sanaa sticks to a unity that is opposed by the southerners. This is because unity cannot be built by the force of arms. Similarly, the interests of the Yemeni people are not served when this war continues to kill scores of innocent children, women, and elderly in Aden, and to destroy vital economic installations just to realize transient selfish interests.
