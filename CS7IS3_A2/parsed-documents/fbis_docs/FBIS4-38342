Radetskyy summed up results of an official visit by a delegation of Ukrainian military to NATO's headquarters in Brussels. According to Radetskyy, the participants in the Brussels meeting appreciated the Ukrainian stand on efforts to build a new system of security in Europe and approved principles on which Ukraine was to build its armed forces. Everyone he met, Radetskyy said, supported, in no uncertain terms, the Ukrainian leaders who sought to preserve the territorial integrity of their country and insure the inviolability of the Ukrainian frontiers. Radetskyy assigned priority to moves "to bridge the artificially-created gap between Ukraine and Europe and return Ukraine into the family of advanced European nations". As a constituent part of Europe, Ukraine based its moves in the field of military politics on the principles of multilateral cooperation, Radetskyy said.
