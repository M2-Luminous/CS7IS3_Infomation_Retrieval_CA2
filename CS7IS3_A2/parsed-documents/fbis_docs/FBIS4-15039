Last year, officers of the administration kept under their control the unofficial presence in the region, under various covers, of more than 20 trained foreign intelligence agents. The counterintelligence department thwarted attempts to create two intelligence cells in the region, including one representing the interests of one of the Near Eastern countries. Hostile actions on the part of a number of European countries, the United States, and China were also uncovered, recorded, and discarded. The interest on the part of foreign firms and informers on their payroll in the Dnieper region, where Ukraine's powerful scientific and industrial and defense potential is concentrated, is not accidental. Many unique technologies, designs, and samples of technology and materials that have not yet been used anywhere else in the world are being created there.
