What is involved is the measure taken by the Ministry of Traffic and Communications and the (?Roads) Public Enterprise of the so-called Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna that -- in conformity with the conclusion made by the government of the so-called Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna on 5 April -- limits the passage of vehicles of a certain weight along the said road, introduces a road toll, and limits the travelling time and speed. These restrictions make it completely impossible for the UNHCR and its partners to continue supplying central Bosnia and Sarajevo with food and other kinds of aid. According to the Information Ministry of Bosnia-Herzegovina, (Karen Kong abu-Zaid), head of the UNHCR mission of Bosnia, informed Dr. Hasan Muratovic, chairman of the State Committee of Bosnia-Herzegovina for Relations with United Nations, about this problem and asked him for all available measures to be taken with a view to lifting the said restrictions and enabling normal supplies.
