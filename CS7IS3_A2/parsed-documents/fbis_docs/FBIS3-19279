"However," he said, "the United Nations has failed to lift the embargo." Speaking to the Anatolian News Agency al-Tikriti said the economic embargo including the closure of the Turkish-Iraqi pipeline should be lifted. "Western countries again use a double standard as they are doing in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said. Al-Tikriti said the closure of the pipeline negatively affected Turkey and Iraq adding, "Turkey calls for the lifting of the economic embargo, why does the West fail to take this into consideration." "Iraq cannot have pre-conditions for the opening of the pipeline as we are not the ones who closed it," he said. "However we always support the continuation of bilateral talks with Turkey." Referring to the four-way meeting between Turkey, the United States, Britain, and France which centered around the future of the multinational force, al-Tikriti said such meetings meant the intrusion into Iraq's internal affairs. "Iraq is an independent country and Turkey is our neighbor and friend, but we cannot accept the United States, Britain, and France making decisions for the region," he said. Al-Tikriti also claimed that the Kurdish problem in northern Iraq was created by the West. The ambassador said the Iraqi administration did not impose a blockade on northern Iraq. "But the UN-imposed economic embargo affects the whole country," he said.
