The daily, which is believed to be pro-government, stated that "aside from the good or bad intentions" the U.S. Government may have, it has "clearly politically damaged" Peru by supporting the report, which harshly criticizes Peruvian justice. The report, prepared by a group of legal experts presided over by Robert Goldman from the United States, states that the judicial reform the Peruvian Government has launched "severely undermined and, in some cases, eliminated judicial independence in Peru." The report also "suggested" that the Peruvian Government should annul the law that allows judges who try alleged terrorists to remain anonymous and substantially amend antiterrorist laws. EXPRESO stated this evaluation of the situation "is unrealistic" because Peru is implementing an "in-depth reform of the judiciary that ranges from the appointment of honorable and knowledgeable justices by the Discipline Board for Magistrates, which has general approval, to the establishment of a managerial and modern approach to the institution and enactment of modern codes of procedure."
