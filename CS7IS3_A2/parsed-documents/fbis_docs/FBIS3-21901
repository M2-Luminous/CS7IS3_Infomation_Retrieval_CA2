Alvaro Ayala reports. [Ayala] U.S. Attorney General Reno told de Greiff: I am increasingly concerned by the fact that in your correspondence you do not include information on the process of conversations with the chieftains of the Cali Cartel and because you have not mentioned that the Prosecutor General's Office plans to prosecute and put those chieftains on trial. These omissions are what create the environment of distrust you mention in your letters. Today the prosecutor general reacted and reminded his U.S. counterpart, Janet Reno, that in Colombia the judicial system functions independently, without bending to foreign pressure. [Begin recording] de Greiff: Colombia's Judicial Branch cannot be subjected to the evaluations Ms. Reno may want to pass on the evidence they supply. Cooperation is fine, but impositions are not. [end recording] The prosecutor general said that on 20 June he will be 65 and that his remaining in his post depends on the Supreme Court of Justice. He said that personally he would like to complete the four-year period for which he was elected. The Supreme Court of Justice, the High Council of the Judiciary, and a U.S. court adviser, have stated their support for de Greiff. William Davis is an important U.S. court adviser. He is in Colombia participating in a seminar on court backlogs organized by the High Council of the Judiciary. He spoke at the seminar with journalists and spoke out in defense of Prosecutor General de Greiff, saying that the institution de Greiff heads is too new to have to endure the strong criticism of the U.S. attorney general. [Begin recording] Davis: I said: Look, these things take five years and they are complex. We live in a world where people expect results in a matter of months, weeks, or days instead of years. [end recording] The Judicial Branch stated its support for the independence of the Prosecutor General's Office and not only criticized Ms. Reno's intrusion but also the Colombian Security Council's decision to reject the transfer of five Medellin Cartel members from Bogota to Itagui. [Begin recording] Justice Pablo Caceres: Other countries cannot expect the anatomy of the Prosecutor General's Office to depend on their opinions. Justice Ricardo Calvete: If the Prosecutor General's Office finds that these people's due process and their right to a defense must be guaranteed, then ways must be found to strictly comply with this.
