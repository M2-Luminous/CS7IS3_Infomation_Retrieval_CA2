FR940323-0-00010 FR940323-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;144&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8846; AD 94&hyph;05&hyph;08] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A series airplanes, that requires modification of the electrical power supply system. This amendment is prompted by a report that a single phase fault current can cause sequential failure of all onboard main electrical generators. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent such failures and subsequent loss of electrical power sources onboard the airplane. DATES: Effective April 22, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from British Aerospace, PLC, Librarian for Service Bulletins, P.O. Box 17414, Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on October 13, 1993 (58 FR 52929). That action proposed to require modification of the electrical power supply system. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposal. Another commenter notes that a statement in the preamble to the notice, which indicated that the cause of the subject single phase fault currents ``had not been determined,'' was inaccurate. This commenter advises that, following the original incident, an investigation by the airplane manufacturer revealed that the cause was due to the loosening of an adjustment locking nut in a remote control circuit breaker (RCCB) that caused one phase of the 3-phase power supply to remain energized. Replacement of the RCCB's was recommended by British Aerospace Service Bulletin SB.24&hyph;69&hyph;70484A, Revision 1, which was the subject of AD 91&hyph;04&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;6899 (56 FR 5751, February 13, 1991). Therefore, the cause of the original failure has been determined and rectified. However, there may be other fault causes that have not been identified; it is for this reason that the proposed modification of the generator control unit (GCU) is necessary so that the GCU can better handle failures of this type without causing the loss of all primary electric power sources. The FAA acknowledges this information.
