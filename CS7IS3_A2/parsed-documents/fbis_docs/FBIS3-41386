In a sleek building formerly occupied by the Dutch secret service in The Hague, the first chief of Europol, Herr Jurgen Storbeck, said he hoped to move rapidly beyond mere surveillance of drug traffickers. Task forces or even multinational police squads should be set up, he said--a scheme long demanded by Chancellor Kohl of Germany, but which causes shudders in London and some other European capitals. "I think governments will agree to this federal ideal. What was unthinkable 10 years ago has now become thinkable," said Herr Storbeck, former German head of Interpol in Wiesbaden. For now, British Tory nightmares of multilingual officers roaming the continent are some way from reality. Yesterday, as a launch ceremony was held, intelligence officers sat at computer monitors, checking the cross-border activities of drugs smugglers. More direct action against crime will have to wait until October, while EC countries wrangle over the legal convention establishing the force under the Maastricht Treaty. Herr Storbeck said the agency could gather detailed information on the movements and criminal records of citizens around Europe in less than three hours. Since mid-January, 19 "liaison officers" representing the 12 EC member states, including two Britons, have handled about 20 cases, supplying relevant data gathered from their national police services. This is only the first step towards the planned creation of Europe-wide databanks on crime and terrorism. However, there could be stumbling blocks ahead over privacy rules and a lack of trust between national intelligence services. "The national services have an obligation to provide us with information, but we don't have any powers to force them if they are reluctant," said Herr Storbeck.
