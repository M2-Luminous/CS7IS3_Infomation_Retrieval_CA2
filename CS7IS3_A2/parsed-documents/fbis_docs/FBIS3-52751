President Saparmurad Niyazov, who visited our country at the head of a high-ranking delegation, left Tehran at noon today after signing these agreements. He was seen off officially by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Our correspondent reports: With the signing of 11 cooperation agreements by the presidents of Iran and Turkmenistan, economic, political, trade, and cultural cooperation between the two countries have increased. On the basis of the agreements signed today by the two countries' presidents at the end of Mr. Niyazov's official visit to our country, Iran and Turkmenistan will cooperate on transport, communications, gas and oil, electricity, railways, trade, banking relations, education, and training. Turkmen President Niyazov today expressed satisfaction at the outcome of his five-day official visit to our country. He said: [Begin Niyazov recording, speaking in Turkmen, fading into Persian translation] This trip has had a profound and very positive effect on us, and on behalf of the people and government of Turkmenistan, we sincerely thank Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani for laying the foundation for strong relations between the two countries. [end recording] Mr. Niyazov said that close and growing cooperation between the two countries are exemplary, and that some important agreements have been signed which will be beneficial to the people of the two countries and will also have their deserved impact on regional and international political cooperation. The Turkmen president thanked the people and officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran for their warm hospitality. Speaking about the outcome of his talks with the Turkmen president, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, our country's president, said: [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The visit by His Excellency Mr. Niyazov and his delegation was an interesting one. As far as official visits are concerned, it could even be considered as rather unique, because almost all the members of Turkmenistan's cabinet, together with governors general, vice presidents, deputy ministers, Friday prayer leaders, and other key Turkmen figures accompanied the Turkmen president. This was quite a revealing thing, in that it showed how serious both sides were to work together in all fields. He himself explained that he left only the speaker of parliament and the chief of the police behind, and brought everyone else to Iran to make expansion of cooperation possible. This also proves what a stable and secure place Turkmenistan is if its entire officialdom can stay out of the country for five days. This is yet another interesting point, and this tranquillity and stability provides the people of Turkmenistan with the opportunity to develop their newly-independent country. They should appreciate their stability, especially in view of what is now happening in other countries with a background similar to Turkmenistan. The length of the visit was also noteworthy. They were here for five days, during which they visited many places and held talks on a multitude of subjects. Fortunately, today we witness the commissioning of 480 telephone lines between our two countries. Through these lines, Turkmenistan will be connected to the whole world via Iran. This is just one aspect of the revival of the ancient Silk Road, albeit in a modern context. We signed many agreements when we visited there, and our work there was carried over to this trip and was completed in the talks between the officials. Agreements have been signed in all fields. Good as the progress in cooperation has been in these past two to three years, I think that after this trip the pace of cooperation will be even faster. I think the other countries in the region can also benefit from our cooperation. No country should think that our cooperation with Turkmenistan is at odds with their interests; on the contrary, I believe this will pave the way for others to join in. [end recording]
