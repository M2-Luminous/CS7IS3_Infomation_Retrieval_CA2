He pointed out, however, that "no law is promulgated to please that country." In remarks to the Continental radio station, Di Tella said the Argentine Government "sent the draft bill to Congress two years ago because Argentine interests called for this procedure." He added: "A law is not promulgated to please the United States." "This is not done in exchange for something. We cannot attract high technology or investors without having a law to protect patents. It is in Argentina's interest to sanction this law," he emphasized. He also said: "A group of enterprises is waiting for the patents law to be approved to decide whether or not to invest in Argentina." He added: "This law goes beyond the pharmaceuticals issue." Di Tella said Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's election to the OAS secretariat general "resulted from a phone call made by President Carlos Menem." Di Tella asserted that Argentine support "determined" the Colombian president's decision to run as a candidate. "We could not campaign in his favor unless he presented his candidacy. This is what he did and the results were very good," Di Tella said referring to Gaviria's elections as the new OAS secretary general. The foreign minister explained that the "OAS has progressed very much in the last 10 years." He pointed out that the organization "helped several countries leave behind undemocratic situations." He added: "UN cooperation has been very effective." Di Tella concluded by saying: "We need an OAS working side by side with the United Nations. With Gaviria's presence, the OAS will be in a more important position to participate in discussions about the economy of the region."
