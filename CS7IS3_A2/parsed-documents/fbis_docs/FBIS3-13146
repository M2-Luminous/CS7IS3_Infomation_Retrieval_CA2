These countries have resources which, if they were pooled, would enable them to check the interference of the great powers. For the moment, the Iranian proposal can be considered merely a desire which is formally expressed on such occasions, because Iran is well aware that the components of such an alliance are antagonistic and hostile to each other. China and India had a military confrontation during the 1960's, and subsequently their relations remained strained for a long time. It was rather like a cold war between them. Of course, they now have concluded an agreement to promote friendship. The problems that were once created by Tibet's Dalai Lama have also subsided and the border dispute has been resolved to a certain extent. As a result, India has decided to withdraw two divisions of troops from along the frontiers with China and to deploy them in Punjab and Kashmir. At the international level, however, the two countries are still contending with each other to establish regional influence and superiority. India, in particular, is badly gripped by this fever. Similarly, Pakistan and India have a long history of disputes, spanning about 1,200 years. India has repeatedly targeted Pakistan for its military aggression to avenge the 1,000-year Muslim rule over India. In 1971, the Indian military intervention in East Pakistan resulted in Pakistan's dismemberment. Now, the Indian troops are engaged in the massacre of Muslims in occupied Kashmir. Moreover, India is also threatening Pakistan with a limited war. For obvious reasons, how can the two hostile countries join hands on some regional interests? The Government of Iran is fully aware of these stark realities, and that is why Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani has urged India to strive to resolve the Kashmir issue peacefully. Iran is fully conversant with the gravity of the Kashmir problem. It is said that Ayatollah Khomeyni, the founder and leader of the modern Islamic revolution, was of Kashmiri origin. It has been Iran's official stand that extending support to the independence struggle of subjugated nations is not an abetment of terrorism; it is like extending a helping hand to realize the right to self-determination. Iran has always rejected the U.S. and Western objections in this regard, and never accepted the U.S. and European interpretations of the human rights. In the words of the TEHRAN TIMES editor, the United States has used the human rights issue as a political weapon against the entire world including China, Pakistan and Iran. In view of these facts, the Iranian proposal to form a regional bloc cannot be termed concrete or serious, nor should Pakistan be concerned about it. In fact, if there can be a new alliance or bloc, then it should include Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, the Islamic countries of Central Asia, and Turkey. That will be a natural alliance. These countries not only have the commonality of religion among them, they have ancient historical and cultural ties as well. An alliance comprising Iran, India and China would be lacking natural ingredients. Rather, they lack anything in common. The Muslim countries, having common religious, historical, cultural and economic values and interests, should join in a single platform and form a regional bloc. If China can be included in the present (?alliance), then there is no reason why U.S. hegemony in the world could not be resisted. The history of cooperation and friendship between Pakistan and China is enviable. The PRC has now offered to cooperate liberally with Pakistan to meet its weaponry needs. Pakistani tanks and missiles are also being manufactured in China. China did not even care for the U.S. pressure in this regard. No one will object to China's inclusion in the alliance of Muslim countries as China has not been seen to carry out aggression against any neighboring country, nor has it claimed the territory of any of its neighbors. It is hoped that the Iranian Government will adopt a realistic approach regarding the formation of a regional bloc.
