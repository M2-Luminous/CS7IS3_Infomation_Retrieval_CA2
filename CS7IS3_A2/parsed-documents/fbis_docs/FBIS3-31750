As Prime Minister Meciar confirmed to us later on the plane, the talks with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Y. F. Yarov concerned, above all, the issue of reducing Slovakia's trade deficit with Russia, which amounts to approximately 30 billion [Slovak korunas]. "In the course of 1993 we had prepared 26 legal documents in the interest of a new quality of cooperation between Russia and Slovakia. The time has finally come to apply them in practice," Vladimir Meciar stressed. The talks at Moscow airport also concerned privatization plans and, in particular, further cooperation in nuclear engineering. "The Russians are ready to accept payment in kind for nuclear fuel and they will also accept spent fuel from us," Vladimir Meciar specified in reply to a question from PRAVDA. "The issue of Russian participation in the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power station remains disputed. While the first and the second unit are 90 percent complete, the question of the other two units remains open. The Russians' interest in further participation in the Slovak nuclear program was emphasized in exceptionally strong terms. They offered us an interest-free loan of $100 million." In view of the known fact that French and German partners are to participate in the completion of the first two units of the Mochovce nuclear power station, which is to be covered by a credit of 1.3 billion German marks, we asked how the nuclear safety of the other two units should be dealt with, under this Russian proposal. "The technology of the power station would be Russian but the safety equipment would be from Siemens. This would be interesting for the Russian side because they would then be able to use this model in building and rebuilding their own nuclear power stations." [passage omitted]
