Encouraged by the Mexican Government's decision to speed up its political reforms, and by the possible success of the FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso 2] program, a high-ranking White House adviser for Latin American affairs shared the splendid scenario that he had in mind with two Brazilians. "We could have -- in a matter of months -- democracy in Mexico and the stabilization of the Brazilian economy under way," he said. He could have added that the two major stumbling blocks for Washington's integration policy in the hemisphere would thus be overcome. Brazil is perhaps likely to curb inflation sooner than a Mexico under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari becomes a democratic state. The government's opponents in Brazil, at least, do not have hide their identities behind masks when they negotiate with authorities, as is the case with the Indians from Chiapas who rose in revolt. In any case, one of the Brazilians who took part in this conversation -- a senior Brazilian representative before the OAS -- took up Clinton's aide on that point, in order to reiterate the importance of U.S. support for the Brazilian economic program. "Whoever opposes an agreement between Brazil and the IMF will be responsible for a great harm inflicted not only upon Brazil, but upon the international financial system as well," he said. This utterance hints at two things. First, one can hardly expect that the gap between the economic team's estimates and those of the IMF, as far as the budget is concerned, will be bridged with a calculator. Once again, the IMF management and the governments from the seven most powerful industrial countries, which are in control of the majority of votes at the IMF executive board, will have to make a political gamble and approve a stand-by arrangement with Brazil. IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus got his fingers burned the last two times he adopted a receptive stance on the Brazilian program. He has already told Cardoso that unless he is convinced of the soundness and political feasibility of the FHC2 plan he will not put the IMF's credibility in jeopardy. The second hint included in the Brazilian official's remark to Clinton's aide is a warning: If the IMF and the U.S. Government refuse to support Brazil's current economic policy, they will make the country embark upon a path that is opposite to that of stabilization, and will for all practical purposes line up the voters in support of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential candidacy. The decisive step in the negotiations with the IMF started on 4 March. Based on the results of the technical evaluation by the IMF mission to Brazil and on an analysis of Brazilian political situation, Camdessus will have to decide whether he endorses the Brazilian economic program. He must reach a decision by next weekend so that Brazil can then work out an agreement with creditor banks by 15 April. Washington's skepticism toward the Brazilian economic program was broken last week by economist Albert Fishlow, a Brazilian scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. A pessimist in his analysis of Brazilian business cycles, Fishlow accurately forecast the failure of several Brazilian attempts to curb inflation since the Cruzado Plan in 1986. On 4 March, however, he surprised an audience comprised of the upper echelons of the U.S. Government, high-ranking members of international organizations, and Latin American experts from leading Washington "think tanks" when stating that "the new stabilization program will probably be a complete success." Addressing a seminar on the economic integration of the Americas sponsored by the Inter-American Dialogue, Fishlow gave three reasons for his optimistic forecast. The first was that unlike previous programs, the current one is based on a strong fiscal policy. The high level of foreign exchange reserves that the country has gives the government plenty of leeway. Finally, the economist noted that the program is politically coherent, as it may catapult Cardoso into the presidency. Clinton's aide -- who was present at this seminar -- did not seem to be very much convinced. "Fishlow's friendship with Cardoso may have impaired the former's prowess at analysis," he said. And yet he arrived at the OAS cocktail some hours later dreaming about the idea that Brazil would stabilize its economy and that Mexico would become a democratic country "in a matter of months."
