LO 2 LH 2 +LO 2 /RP&hyph;1 Sum of (60% for LO 2 LH 2 )+(10% for LOs2sRP&hyph;1) Sum of (60% for LO 2 LH 2 )+(20% for LO 2/ RP&hyph;1). LO 2 RP&hyph;1 or LO 2 NH 3 or B 5 H 9 +a fuel 10% 20% up to 500,000 pounds plus 10% over 500,000 pounds. IRFNA/Aniline (Note 1) 10% 10%. IRFNA/UDMH (Note 1) 10% 10%. IRFNA/UDMH+JP&hyph;4 (Note 1) 10% 10%. N 2 O 4 /UDMH+N 2 H 4 (Note 1) 5% 10%. N 2 O 4 /UDMH+N 2 H 4 (Note 1)+solid propellants 5% plus the explosive equivalent of the solid propellants 10% plus the explosive equivalent of the solid propellant. Tetranitromethane (alone or in combination) 100% 100%. Nitromethane (alone or in combination) 100% 100%. Notes: 1.These are hypergolic combinations. 2.The percentage factors given in the table are to be used to determine equivalencies of propellant mixtures at static test stands and range launch pads when such propellants are located aboveground and are unconfined except for their tankage. Other configurations shall be considered on an individual basis to determine equivalencies. 3.The explosives equivalent weight calculated by the use of this table shall be added to any non-nuclear explosive weight aboard before distances can be determined from Appendices B and C to Subpart F of this part. 4.These equivalencies apply also for the following substitutions: ␣a.Alcohols or other hydrocarbons for RP&hyph;1. ␣b.BrF 5 , CIF 3 , F 2 , H 2 , H 2 O 2 , OF 2 , or O 2 F 2 for LO 2 . ␣c.MMH for N 2 H 4 or UDMH. ␣d.C 2 H 4 O for any propellant. ␣e.NH 3 for any fuel resulting in a hypergolic combination. 5.Use LO 2 /RP&hyph;1 distance for pentaborane plus a fuel and LO 2 /LH 2 distances for pentaborane plus an oxidizer. 6.For quantities of propellant up to but not over the equivalent of 100 pounds of explosives, the distance shall be determined on an individual basis by the PCO. All personnel and facilities, whether involved in the operation or not, shall be protected by operating procedures, equipment design, shielding, barricading, or other suitable means. 7.Distance less than intraline area not specified. Where a number of prepackaged liquid propellant units are stored together, separation distance to other storage facilities shall be determined on an individual basis by the PCO, taking into consideration normal hazard classification procedures.
