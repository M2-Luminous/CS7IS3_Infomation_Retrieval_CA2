On Monday morning the defeated Bagrov had a telephone conversation with the Ukrainian leaders. Bagrov announced that he would quit politics and that he had no plans to lead any opposition to the elected president. Neither does he imagine any confrontation with the Crimean parliament. However, he described Meshkov's election program as unfeasible and recommended that the newly-elected president amend it. The possibility of holding a referendum on Crimea's status, which the new president has scheduled for March 27, must be evaluated by the Crimean parliament, said Bagrov. He also pointed out that Crimea and Russia could no longer be reunited. Meanwhile, according to Interfax-Ukraine's sources, Meshkov is already forming his cabinet. The law on the president of the Republic of Crimea gives him the status of head of the executive authority. On Tuesday or Wednesday Meshkov is likely to go to Kiev for talks with the Ukrainian leaders. Vice Chairman of Ukraine's Popular RUKH Aleksandr Lavrinovich described the results of the presidential elections in Crimea as "the defeat of the Ukrainian officials' authority." He told Interfax-Ukraine that a referendum on Crimea's secession from Ukraine might be held, presumably next spring. He believes that the results of the elections in Crimea might mark the beginning of confrontation between Crimea and Ukraine." [no opening quotation marks as received] Ukraine's First Deputy Minister for Nationalities and Migration Aleksandr Piskun believes that the results of the elections were due to the Ukrainian authorities' inconsistent policies. "All this poses a threat to Ukraine's sovereignty," he said.
