References to the term ``affected interests'' have been removed throughout the rule and replaced with the term ``interested public.'' The proposed rule would also remove the authorized officer's current discretion to determine whether an individual is an ``affected interest.'' These changes were not included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The reason for the change is to provide a consistent standard for participation by the public. Any party who writes to the authorized officer to express concern for the management of livestock grazing on specific grazing allotments will be recognized as a member of the ``interested public'' under the proposed rule. This allows the BLM to develop a record to assure notification of proposed and final decisions and to involve the ``interested public'' in the consultation process. Requirements for consultation with the interested public have been added in sections of the proposed rule that deal with the initial allocation of forage, development of activity plans and range improvement programs, the issuance or renewal of grazing permits or leases, and the establishment or adjustment of the terms and conditions of grazing permits and leases.
