Speaking in Singapore, Mr. Bolger said Asian countries were now able to say with some firmness that their approach to human rights was as valid as that of anybody else. He said countries in Asia were better able to deal with such issues now that everyone wanted to trade with them. Early this week, Mr. Bolger came under criticism in New Zealand for endorsing Indonesian rule in East Timor despite Western concerns over human rights there.
