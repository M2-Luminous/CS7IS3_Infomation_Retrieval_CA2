Famania begins by giving the following resume: "Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares has a Ph.D. in Economics and Business Administration from a U.S. university. He was born in Panama City on 28 June 1946 and spent most of his youth in Chiriqui Province. He was Citibank's corporate credit manager for Panama and Central America in 1971. He entered public life as a member of the Legislative Commission in 1975. Perez Balladares was minister of finance and treasury and of planning and economic policy during President Basilio Lakas' administration; President Aristides Royo kept him as minister of planning and economic policy; and President Ricardo de la Espriella appointed him general manager of IRHE [Institute of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification]. He also stands out as member of the negotiating team for the 1977 canal treaties. His political life began when the PRD was founded in 1979. He rose in this organization, which was the political arm of the military regime, and went from grass-roots group president -- the lowest echelon in the party's organizational chart -- to PRD general secretary in 1982. His estrangement and reserve with the party's line goes back to when Manuel Antonio Noriega was made commander of the then National Guard in 1983. His coolness increased after the 1984 elections. This attitude, however, contrasts with his decision to accept the appointment to be the campaign manager for Colina [National Liberation Coalition] presidential candidate Carlos Duque Jaen in 1989. After the 20 December 1989 U.S. military action, he assumed a more critical and active position in the PRD. He actively participated in the party's internal reorganization and won the PRD internal election to again occupy the post of general secretary in 1992. He was elected presidential candidate for the May 1994 elections at the PRD convention held on 31 July 1993, and thus became the first elected citizen to run for this position. Since then, the polls indicate that his popularity ratings have increasingly expanded and currently place him as the front runner." After this profile, Famania asks Perez Balladares why he distanced himself from the PRD in 1983 to return later as Duque's campaign manager. He replies that the party had requested that he be Duque's campaign manager in an electoral process that was very difficult and was practically lost. He adds: "I could have refused but this would have been disloyal to my party. I assumed my responsibility at the time and absolutely do not regret anything I did." Famania asks the candidate what his position was when the military tried to cheat in the 1989 elections. Perez Balladares replies that his management of the Duque campaign ended on election day and that Duque and himself had recommended that the government "and those who gave orders at the time" accept Guillermo Endara's victory and that "Mr. Noriega try to find an honorable solution to his situation." Famania mentions that the PRD lost the 1989 elections overwhelmingly and has now appeared, with him as a candidate, for the 1994 elections and is leading all the polls. The candidate explains that the PRD is a totally new party, which has been reorganized democratically and thus become much stronger. Famania notes that analysts have stated that the PRD has received positive poll ratings because it started campaigning before the rest of the parties. Perez Balladares laughs and says: "I believe that is wishful thinking by our opponents." Famania recounted that the Arnulfist Party candidate has called "all the political parties to unite in a large civil alliance against the PRD" and asks Perez Balladares if he thinks such an alliance is possible. The PRD candidate says he does not know if it is possible but notes that this alliance is based on vested economic interests and "not based on programs to solve the country's problems." The candidate adds that the PRD will contend with the candidates its opponents present and that they will continue with their campaign "to explain our programs, proposals, solutions, and the opportunities we hope to offer. The Panamanians will be the ones to decide on election day." Famania asks him if the PRD will form alliances to control the Legislative Branch and Perez Balladares answers that the word alliance has been used in an attempt to unite forces to parcel out the country and that "what we really need is for all sectors in the country to reach a national agreement" to lead the country through the especially delicate period of the turn of the century. Famania asks: "Don't you think the PRD's ties with the last period of the military regime could negatively impact your popularity rating?" He replies: "I believe it is evident that a return to the past, in addition to being stupid, is absurd. The immense majority of Panamanians understand this is totally impossible, even if someone, who would not be us, wanted to return to the past. We do not propose a return to any past system, but there are people who seem to be anchored to such an idea. They can only see the country as it existed in 1989. Let me tell you something: The people and country demand that we solve the problems of today, 1994, not the ones of 1989." Famania asks Perez Balladares if he would be willing to bring Noriega back to Panama to have him complete his prison sentence here; the candidate dismisses emphatically this possibility, adding: "We have many problems to solve in the future. We have a big national challenge and cannot distract ourselves with subterfuges, such as bringing people back to the country, persecuting people, carrying out retaliations, or digging up past issues. We have much to do ahead of us. We do not have time for this." The program host mentions that Balladares has promised to build an expressway to Colon and other works if he wins the elections and asks how he plans to finance them. The candidate answers: "They are not promises. I have presented proposals to the country. My proposals are based on the need to find quick alternatives to promptly solve our serious unemployment problem, which will be my government's number one priority." He adds: "How will they be financed? The works will be financed in the same way they have been financed by all the developing countries; the private sector and the government join efforts to carry them out. All our proposed works can be carried out effectively. I have already received concrete offers from three firms to build the Panama-Colon expressway." Famania says it has been noted that the firm that builds the expressway will not recover its investment within the 20-year term established by the law. He asks if the PRD plans to change the laws, to which Balladares replies: "We will have to give the firm that builds the road the necessary time for it to recover its investment and make a reasonable profit." The program host asks if his government would invest in such works, and Balladares answers: "There has to be a participation. I believe the government--in the extent that we generate internal savings--will have to participate together with the private firms." Famania then asks how will the government "generate internal savings," and Perez Balladares says: "Savings are obtained with an austere government program." Famania broaches the issue of privatization, saying the PRD maintains that public services should not be privatized. He asks: "Isn't this a bit like swimming upstream, because all the countries are privatizing their public services to make them more efficient?" Balladares says: "We say there are basic services that have to be government monopolies. One of them is the Idaan [National Water and Sanitation Institute]. I believe water is a priority item in any country and that it must be managed by the government. Another item is the distribution of electricity. There is no incentive for any private firm to implement a rural electrification program, because it is not profitable. For the government such a program is fundamental to integrate the marginal population, mostly in the interior of the Republic, to the country's development." He adds: "To talk about an out-an-out privatization process or to oppose such actions based on an ideological premise is a mistake. As a government, we have to do the things that will provide more social benefits, be it with private, public, or mixed firms." Famania questions the benefits of having the government manage basic services, which are not offering quality service. The candidate says: "I believe some of those services can be privatized, because the government does not have the needed cash flow to increase or improve the services rendered by those institutions. Somehow, those services--especially the ones I mentioned--must continue to further national development and, thus, must be controlled by government." He adds: "Let me tell you something else: Those services are not efficient, because we made the last investments to produce water, for example. We built the Chilibre water-processing plant a long time ago. Nothing else has been done in this field. What was the last major thoroughfare built to alleviate the serious traffic problem in Panama City? It was the Tumba Muerto Avenue, which we built in 1971 or 1972, more than 20 years ago. Nothing more has been done since then." Famania says the current economic order is different to the one that existed in the 1970's, and he asks if a PRD government will be able to build such works now. The PRD candidate emphatically answers affirmatively. "We can do so because we are creative and will involve the private sector, unions, and all public and private organizations interested in solving the country's problems," he added. Famania asks Perez about the PRD candidates filling the ballot as presidential and vice presidential candidates -- instead of "splitting the cake" -- in spite of the alliance with the Labor Party, PALA, and the Liberal Party. Perez responds that the cake belongs to the Panamanian people and adds: "The fact that we have achieved an alliance or a concerted effort to be able to carry out a work program by broadening the participation to other political parties while maintaining our original proposal, clearly means that we are definitely not willing to distribute political spaces but, instead, to carry out a program for national solutions with those persons in our political group, our friends who now share with us this concerted effort, and other sectors -- independent or from other parties -- who have the capacity for the job. The best men for the public offices." Famania goes on to ask about the plans for fighting unemployment and Perez answers that the way to fight unemployment is to attack the root of the problem which, in his opinion, is the lack of proper education. Perez claims education is not currently directed at the available job market. He says they propose an integration of private enterprise with the different universities and training centers so that, and together with the Government, they can guide education toward the jobs that will be available at the beginning of the 21st century and in accordance with the demands from investors. Then Famania says that the continuous teachers strikes will be an to that goal and Perez contends that the last teachers strike was one of the many wars caused by former Comptroller General Ruben Dario Carles, of which he won none. Perez criticizes the way the Current Government lost the golden opportunity it had for buying the foreign debt and claims his government would deal with the commercial foreign debt. Later the two discuss the security in Panama and Perez says that for the citizens' safety there must be a professional police force and that a civilian must be kept at the head of the police force. He adds: "What happens is that, according to the very persons who have been dealing with the topic over the last four years, there has been a policy of not backing, economically -- and mainly from Mr. Carles' Comptroller's Office -- the professionalization programs for that police force." Famania then claims that young men do not want to be policemen due to the low salaries and Perez responds that professionalizing the police also means increasing their salaries. Regarding the borders, Perez says the border with Colombia must be watched by a professional force to control the illegal aliens and drug trafficking. On the subject of the defense needs of the Panama Canal in accordance with the Canal Treaties, Perez says that an army is not necessary for the defense of the Panama Canal, that such a claim "was a subterfuge used to justify the [Panama] Defense Forces [PDF] that were created. That absurd mistake cannot be committed again. We do not need that; for the protection of the Panama Canal areas we need the same type of protection used for industrial installations anywhere in the world." Famania then asks whether he would use former officers of the PDF as advisers, and Perez says that he has said many times before that that stage is over and there is no going back. He adds: "Those officers -- former officers of the Armed Forces -- have every right to participate as civilians in Panama's civilian life, but they will never be reintegrated [into the armed forces]." Famania asks about the proposal to lower the retirement age and Perez says they will study the topic and that he does not believe that it is fair that different workers have the same retirement age, particularly those whose bodies suffer greater physical wear. About political persecution Perez says he is already working on what he believes is the clue to good administration of justice: a good attorney general. Asked about the possibility of massive layoffs, Perez says he knows the vast majority of the public workers will vote for him and that there will be no layoffs. Finally, with regard to a political amnesty, Perez says that topic has passed to a third plane, that those who were unfairly in jail for political crimes have already been released, and that those who have been sentenced will have to serve their sentences. Asked about his alleged renovation in spite of maintaining his ties to the same persons involved in the past regime, Perez responds that that is a false insinuation and his government would use the most capable Panamanians regardless of their political affiliation.
