It envisages investing more than 3 trillion yen in projects to procure public-use land, to assist small and medium businesses, and to expand loans by the Housing Finance Corporation [HFC]. The total will come to almost 7 trillion yen if about 3.5 trillion yen's worth of public works projects are added to it. In addition, there will be measures to boost the financial and security markets, one of which is to provide financial assistance for clearing bad debts. If some 7 trillion yen's worth of measures to reduce income taxes and residents' taxes are added, the total comes to about 14.7 trillion yen, which means the stimulus package will be the biggest ever, surpassing that of April last year. The new economic measures contain a key project aimed at improving liquidity of land, and the project will require investment of 500 billion yen to 1 trillion yen to promote acquisition of land for public use. Specifically, this means additional appropriation of funds for the Housing and Urban Development Corporation to acquire land for future housing construction. It will also provide funds for local housing corporations to pay for interest accrued from land purchases. The government is also considering reducing the tax on profits from land transfer. To support small and medium businesses, ceilings on low-interest loans by such government-run financial institutions as the Small Business Finance Corporation and People's Finance Corporation will be extended to enable more of them to benefit from the loans. In the area of measures to promote employment, a new system will be created to help job-creating small and medium industries expand their plant and equipment. A total of 1,300 billion yen will be made available in this area. Where loans by the Housing Finance Corporation are concerned, an additional 100,000 housing units received benefits under the emergency economic measures effected in September last year, and the number of housing units eligible for HFC loans expanded to a total of 700,000 in 1993. In order to further promote investments in housing construction and to make it the prime mover in pulling the economy ahead, additional loans for 70,000 housing units -- worth more than 1 trillion yen -- will be made available under the new package of economic measures.
