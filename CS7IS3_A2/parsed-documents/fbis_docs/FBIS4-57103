Jaime Crombet, vice president of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], participated in the assembly which was characterized by its organization, its brevity, and its search for solutions to area problems as soon as they arise. Also attending the assembly were administrative officials of the units corresponding to this People's Council, who responded to the queries of the population as necessary. Jaime Crombet explained that during the current progress report process, efforts are being made to avoid monotony, formalisms, lengthy reports, and limited participation of the constituency -- things that would block the appropriate development of these assemblies. [Begin recording] [Crombet] We think that the progress report process is not merely a delegate meeting with his constituency. This is a dynamic, constant, and daily process, as we have seen here. This assembly is a summary, a sample of which we can take advantage not only to recount what has been done but also to project future tasks and promote collective participation in solving the problems of the community. This process also permits channeling any unresolved problem the community or district may have, if it is beyond the realm of the district, to the People's Council for resolution. In that case, of course, the delegates must take it to the Peoples' Council and then to the municipality; some are national level problems. The people know there are many material problems for which there are no feasible solutions at this time, such as power outages, transportation, food supplies, or medicine supplies. There are many problems that are the result of the economic situation of the nation, the special period. The people, as we have seen here today, know that many problems do have solutions, and that some are subjective problems. We need to have those problems brought up and, depending on the possibilities and types of problems, to promote solutions and the participation of the constituency. We have also encouraged taking advantage of these meetings to highlight, emphasize, and encourage the main events that have taken place in that community. References can be made to international, national, provincial, and municipal problems. We believe, however, that it is essential that the people know who are the best students; if there has been a graduation; whether there is a vanguard student; who are the most outstanding combatants; whether there are workers in the distriact who are national vanguards; who are the best sugarcane cutters; which members of the Federation of Cuban Women are going to be delegates to the municipal assembly, provincial assembly, or congress. These accomplishments of the people should be highlighted. Tonight, we have seen here that the assembly concluded with a cultural activity, not with artists of national caliber but with amateur artists from this People's Council and activities that the people enjoy. We also saw the active participation of children; they were spontaneous and appealing. This assembly moved quickly. There is no need for assemblies to be boring. Not all assemblies have to be alike. Each community has its own characteristics; cities have their characteristics; country towns have other characteristics. We want great diversity, dynamism, and participation. We do not want rigid formulas; above all, we want to motivate the people. We have to stimulate the people so that there will be the utmost participation because, in these difficult times of the special period, we need the people's backing, their support for the Revolution and the measures that must be adopted. This is a process of ratification and willingness to make the sacrifices needed to preserve the main values for which we are fighting: our sovereignty, national independence, the accomplishments of socialism, and the preservation of the fatherland. It is important, for these to become assemblies of revolutionary confirmation. The most important aspect of the assemblies, as was confirmed here, is the ratification of the willingness of the immense majority of our people to support the accords of the ANPP and the measures that, little by little, the Council of State will implement. Measures against ill-gotten wealth, against hoarders, have already been announced. These measures have the massive backing of the people. Measures will be implemented, however, that will not be so popular; some of the people will not be pleased with those measures. Therefore, what we need is for the revolutionary forces at these assemblies, those who are more aware of the facts, to explain, inform, and clarify things when a portion of our people are not fully convinced of the reasons behind each of the decisions to be adopted in compliance with the resolution of the special session of the ANPP. [Godoy] In this process, the attendance of managers and administrators has also been stressed. [Crombet] That is essential, and we have seen that here. When the main figures of the municipal administration, of the entities that work at the Peoples' Council level, are not present, many questions go unanswered and then the issues have to be relayed to the People's Council or municipal authorities by the delegate; thereupon the assemblies lose dynamism, efficiency, and effectiveness. This has happened in many places. The manager of the grocery store is not present at the assembly; problems relating to the grocery store are discussed and the administrator is not present. It is essential to the quality of the assemblies that the principal figures -- the school principal; the director or administrator of the daycare center; the administrator of the grocery store, or neighborhood market, or vegetable market; the butcher; the local doctor; the main administrative officials -- be present. The municipal administrative officials should organize a schedule and attend the assemblies so they can actively participate. Then, whenever proposals are made, the issues can be debated and analyzed and the possible solutions evaluated in the assembly. This is the better way. If the problem can be solved or clarified at the assembly, that is even better. Sometimes, this type of assembly is much more efficient than those where the involved parties are not present because then the proposals must be left for later and the people are told the outcome afterwards. Sometimes the information does not arrive on time or at the appropiate time. We have seen how many of the problems brought up here were immediately discussed and solutions and alternatives found. The process becomes much more dynamic and efficient when those responsible for the things the people need to solve are present. This has to be scheduled and controlled; it is not spontaneous.
