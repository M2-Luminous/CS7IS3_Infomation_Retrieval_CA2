This technology is said to be a dual-purpose one allowing both civilian and military applications. The program is divided into two parts, each embracing a two-year period, and provides for acquisition of Paton technologies through the agency of the US University for Unified Research Partner Relations. The Ukrainian Institute's technology is preliminary evaluated at 10 million dollars. Its application financial effect on seven branches of the US national economy, as American experts believe, may be in excess of 7 billion dollars within a decade with total implementation costs estimated at 10 million dollars. The impressive project's implementation is supposed to require establishment of several joint ventures for promotion of Paton's technology in the US engineering, shipbuilding, aerospace and automaking industries, as well as in the nuclear power and medical industries and sport accessories manufacture. In April 1993, the Paton Institute signed an agreement with Pratt & Whitney (United Technology Corp.'s division) to set up a joint venture [jv] for space manufacture of metals and ceramics, which is hardly feasible under the earth conditions. The jv's aggregate authorized fund is stated at one billion US dollars with each party's 50 per cent share in it. The Ukrainian party's contribution is expressed in its specialized equipment, production areas and intellectual property. Pratt & Whitney, whose main speciality is aircraft, particularly, Boeing, engine design and construction, supplied a part of the equipment and did the bulk of financing. Within the project's framework a research center will be set up in Kiev to develop new space material manufacture technologies based on the processes underlying electronic-beam vapor-coating spraying. Originally the US side contemplated its participation in the center's work during a five-year period. After it scrutinized the center's R&D the US party signed an agreement in February 1994 extending the period to another five year term. In January 1994, the jv's R&D center, which employs about 30 fellow researchers in Kiev, was complemented with a pilot production facility staffed by over 50-strong personnel, which is a former workshop of a special electric metallurgical factory, Mikhail Koklyuchenko, jv C.E.O., disclosed in an interview to UKRINFORM. This pilot facility has embarked on specimen manufacture of some materials intended for spraying metallic and ceramic durable coatings. According to Mr. Koklyuchenko, their serial production will start in 1994 to continue in several years to come. As he maintains, they will find broad and versatile applications in both Ukraine and the USA, in view of which the jv expects numerous contracts to be signed shortly for their supplies. The Yevgeniy Paton Arc Welding Institute under the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences was founded back in 1924, and has been among the world's leaders in this field ever since. The electron-beam technology has been developed and improved for over two decades by now. In addition to its numerous and broad fundamental studies the Institute has performed minor applied researches in arc welding engineer, as well as equipment and material manufacture for its multitudinous domestic and foreign customers. The Paton Institute's ramified substructure includes the Institute per se, which focuses on major research and fundamental theoretical studies, a pilot plant for arc welding equipment manufacture and specimen trials, a pilot plant for welding materials and technology testing, a pilot plant for special electric metallurgical engineering applications, a design and technological bureau with a pilot facility, and six engineering centers. Initially, the jv's authorized fund amounted to about 60,000 dollars with each party's share of 50 per cent. Patonweld experts suggested four marketing directions to sell Ukrainian technologies internationally. In late 1993, AT&T made and delivered specifically ordered 18 tons of powder for tear-resistant coatings to the partners. To implement the jv's projects the Ukrainian party resorted to the services of the Torez factory of fusion coatings in the Donetsk region. (There were only two such factories in the former Soviet Union. The other one was located in Russia's Tula near Moscow). Presently, Patonweld is said to have manufactured 40 tons of special powders. However, as Petr Kuznetsov, the jv's spokesperson, tipped off to UKRINFORM, recently changed export procedures and introduction of the so-called specifically designated exporters hamper powder shipment to the jv's customers abroad. Averaged world market prices for such powders based on high-carbon compounds are about 1,200 USD per ton. As Mr. Kuznetsov tends to believe, the jv's future activity will hinge on precisely exports of domestically designed and manufactured materials and products.
