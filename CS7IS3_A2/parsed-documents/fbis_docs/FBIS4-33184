This money was donated by AID. "These are rumors," the government indicated in a communique released to the media by "de facto" Economy Minister Rigaud Duplan. Duplan said the decision to freeze the funds had been made by AID officials. Duplan maintained that only this organization has the right to authorize the opening and closing of state checking accounts. [sentence as received] "The government's measure to freeze all accounts is not directly related to any program to finance humanitarian aid," Duplan explained. He added that on 27 May, AID asked the person in charge of the "PL-480" program, which is responsible for regulating food assistance, to freeze all operations and withdraw money from the account in the Central Bank. Despite this request, the Central Bank refused to hand the money over to the government of constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval and to AID when it wrote a check to recover the funds and transfer them to another bank. A Central Bank source said the people in charge of the institution acted in accordance with a decision of the Economy Ministry to "freeze" the use of funds to the Malval government, adding that they were not forced to do so by the Army. The money in the account comes from the sale of food donated by AID to the Malval government to finance humanitarian aid for the poorest sectors of the population. The constitutional government has not yet reacted to this decision by the "de facto" government, which wants to use this money to finance "its social programs."
