The fire engulfed an extension to the second assembly and testing block (MIK-2). The fire gutted five rooms where, in addition to everyday appliances, special equipment was housed. Fortunately, the cosmodrome has replacement equipment. An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the press center of the Military Space Forces that the fire could have been caused by a faulty electrical appliance or carelessness with fire. In general, staff negligence was to blame. The fire is not the only sorry event at the cosmodrome recently. A little earlier, an officers' garrison building burned down here. This kind of incident seems to becoming usual at Baykonur. However, extinguishing fires has to be done under extreme conditions: there is an acute water shortage at the complex. Added to that, the approach routes, both road and rail, become blocked by snow which often prevents even lorries carrying food from getting through to the cosmodrome. However, the situation has another side as well. Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, it was stated at the press centre of the Military Space Forces that it is now simply unprofitable to deliver new vehicles and equipment to Baykonur because, under the present circumstances, everything that comes on to the territory of Kazakhstan automatically becomes the property of that state. The signing of the relevant treaty on the status and future of the cosmodrome is being dragged out because of disagreements between Kazakhstan and Russia over leasing period and the size of rental payments.
