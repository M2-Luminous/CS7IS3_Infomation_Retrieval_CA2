But under the U.S. system in which administrative, legislative, and judicial functions are separate, President Li's visit to the United States is possible only when, in addition to the maneuvering on the part of Congress, the administrative branch should have good will. Given the current policy of the United States, which deems mutual visits by high-level officials not in line with its interests, President Li's visit to the United States is impossible. However, the official said: If there are more voices of support, this will put pressure on the U.S. Government. The accumulation of such efforts will certainly bloom and produce fruits. A case in point is the U.S. arms sales to us. We have worked hard on this issue over the past 13 years. Another example is our entry to GATT. In the future, we will mobilize more people to support us. It is our hope that the U.S. side will come to understand that we do not mean to sabotage the relations between the United States and Communist China. It is hoped that the United States will separately deal with its ties with Communist China and its ties with us.
