In accordance with the requirements of the development of productive forces, it naturally will adjust the patterns and relationships of interests among various quarters. Therefore, it inevitably will bring about many contradictions. Today, in particular, when our reform has been in full swing and has entered the stage of effecting a major breakthrough, new reform measures have touched, or will touch upon the depths of relations of social interests quite extensively. This inevitably will cause more and more complicated contradictions. Compared with the past, the present contradictions among the people are more conspicuous, widespread, and complicated. We should say that this is a normal phenomenon that demonstrates a new economic system full of vigor and vitality. It is advancing more rapidly to replace the old economic system, which trammeled the development of productive forces. Therefore, in the fact of many complicated contradictions, we must neither feel puzzled nor shrink back. We must realize that the old system not only trammeled the development of productive forces and adversely affected the improvement of the people's living standards, but also distorted interest relationships in many aspects. This fostered discontent among the broad masses of people. Under the old system, contradictions among the people not only existed extensively, but also faced the possibility of being intensified at all times. Therefore, at a glance, with the deepening of reform, there are more and more acute contradictions among the people. Actually, our production relations and superstructure have become more suitable to the development of productive forces. Distorted interest relationships among various quarters and collectives are being straightened out. Unity between the state and the people, between the central and local authorities, between various departments, between various units, and among the masses is being strengthened. Facts have shown that reform is beneficial to the stability of our country, social progress, and unity of the people. Therefore, no matter how enormous the contradictions we encounter, we must be firm and unshakable in deepening reform, and must rely on deepening reform to solve problems arising in reform. This is our basic idea for handling contradictions among the people. Why should we rely on deepening reform to handle contradictions among the people? This is because complicated contradictions among the people which have been brought about by deepening reform are contradictions based on identical interests of the masses, and contradictions arising in social progress. However, if we fail to handle them in a timely fashion, there might be negative results. Those nonantagonistic contradictions might even become antagonistic contradictions. Leading organs and cadres at all levels must attach importance to this matter, and must work conscientiously and seriously to handle it well. First, we must never waver in persisting in deepening reform. In the meantime, we also must control well the weight and pace of reform, so that they conform with the capability of the state, society, enterprises and the masses. This will enable us to limit to a controllable scope the impacts and frictions occurring in the course of replacing the old system with the new. Second, reform is a large and systematic social project. Various reform measures are mutually linked with and constrain each other. If we fail to attach importance to coordination, cooperation and mutual care, we tend to deepen reform in isolation, or feel it difficult to advance or to retreat. This will trigger thorny social problems. For instance, in reforming our labor and employment system without the establishment and improvement of our social insurance system, it will be difficult for us to take a big step. If we act rashly, we are liable to lose more than we gain. Let us take another example. If enterprises fail to make marked progress in transforming their operational mechanisms, it naturally will be difficult to turn several large state-owned banks into genuine commercial banks. If we move too fast, we might possibly "strangle" a number of enterprises that originally stood a very good chance of success in invigorating themselves. The examples cited above tell us the truth: While promoting reform, we must adopt an overall point of view to control well its progress and weight, so that we can act in tacit agreement to advance reform in a coordinated manner. In so doing, we can ease up many contradictions, and avoid their intensification. This will make the work of handling them easy. Third, it is necessary for us to do thoroughgoing and painstaking ideological work. The reform we are carrying out proceeds from the greatest interests of the broad masses of people. If we view adjustment of interest relationships and the redistribution of certain power in an isolated way, we might think that some people gain more than they lose, or vice versa. As a whole, however, our success in reform will greatly emancipate and develop our country's social productive forces, and will vigorously arouse the enthusiasm of our entire people. This will enable our motherland to become strong and powerful more quickly, and enable our people to improve their livelihood. Our people are always reasonable. As long as we can state the reasons clearly, they not only can fully understand certain inconveniences and difficulties brought to some of them by contradictions arising in the present-day reform, but also can actively help the government solve these contradictions, and be of one heart and one mind to push forward our great cause of socialist reform.
