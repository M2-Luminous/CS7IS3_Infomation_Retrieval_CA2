Japan agreed to consider the Russian request for the emergency storage facility at a bilateral experts' meeting held at the Foreign Ministry, the officials said. The two sides reconfirmed that it is essential to prevent further dumping of low-level liquid radioactive waste into the ocean by Russia, they said. Russia told Japan it is storing about 1,900 tons of liquid radioactive waste in four vessels and other facilities around Vladivostok but that the storage capacity is nearly full. The environment in the Russian Far East is in "critical" danger because, for example, one of the old vessels storing the liquid radioactive waste has a hole in it that might pose a threat in bad weather, the Russian delegation was quoted as saying. Russia explained that emergency measures are necessary to cope with the situation and asked for Japanese cooperation in finding a chemical tanker with a storage capacity of between 5,000 tons and 25,000 tons, the officials said. An estimated 5,000 tons of liquid radioactive waste are generated annually in Russia as a result of the dismantling of nuclear-powered submarines. A 100 million dollar fund pledged by Japan to Moscow to help Russia scrap its obsolete nuclear weapons will be utilized to purchase the tanker or some other facility for emergency storage, they said. The tanker would be a used one, since it would take more than a year to build a new one. The two sides agreed to hold another experts' meeting in Moscow in early January to further discuss the matter, they said. Russia dumped 900 tons of liquid nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan on October 17. It suspended a planned second dumping following international protests, particularly from Japan and South Korea. Tuesday's meeting was attended by Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Michail Kokeev and five other officials from the Atomic Energy Ministry, the Navy and the Pacific Fleet. The Japanese group was headed by Yukiya Amano, director of the Foreign Ministry's Science and Nuclear Energy Division. Officials from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and Science and Technology Agency also attended. At the meeting, Japan and Russia also reconfirmed plans to conduct joint research on the Sea of Japan in mid-January, the officials said. South Korea will also take part in the joint research, which will sample both water and sediment around the point where Russia dumped the waste in October. Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) may also be aboard the research ship, they said. The Japanese and Russian delegations also basically agreed to conduct a second joint research expedition next summer if possible, they said. The two sides will hold a joint working group meeting in Tokyo in March to discuss the results of January's joint survey, details of the proposed second investigation and other problems involving the storage of radioactive waste, they said. On Wednesday, the Russian delegation will visit radioactive waste storage and processing facilities in the village of Tokai in Ibaraki Prefecture, the officials said.
