FR940323-0-00030 FR940323-0-00019 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100;4043; I.D. 031794A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the pollock total allowable catch (TAC) for the inshore component in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), March 18, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Fishery Biologist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the TAC of pollock for vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component in the AI was established by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994), as 16,838 metric tons (mt). The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), that the pollock TAC for the inshore component in the AI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 16,338 mt with consideration that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the AI. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by operators of vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component in the AI, effective from 12 noon A.l.t., March 18, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20.
