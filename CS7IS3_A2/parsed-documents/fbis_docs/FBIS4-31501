It is not inconceivable that this, too, contributed to the plunge in the prices of compensation vouchers. The opposition parties in parliament--the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]--explained repeatedly that they would by all means complete the compensation process; moreover, they would do so as soon as possible. In reply to our question, Attila Karoly Soos [SZDSZ] said that recipients of compensation cannot be robbed of their property yet again. Legal security also demands that the next government accept, even if not too happily, the "bequest" of the previous government. Thus, the Free Democrat representative considers it obvious that a government coalition which includes the SZDSZ will offer an appropriate supply of stocks for compensation vouchers. Should it become part of the government, FIDESZ would also like to continue the compensation process and complete its implementation as soon as possible. However, the Young Democrats do not envision passing a new compensation law either. Incidentally, in their opinion, after an assessment of obligations against the state's property, a certain amount of property should be offered against the compensation vouchers, which would include stocks not only of the good companies. Then the price of compensation vouchers would be decided by market forces. The MSZP also considers Hungary to be a constitutional state, i.e., the Socialists also undertake to implement laws which were passed earlier. Thus, the MSZP did not vow to repeal the laws on compensation either. Thus, the current government coalition would perhaps do better not to scare recipients of compensation with the prospect that if the current government falls, recipients of compensation will not have much going for them, either. Rather they should perhaps take care to offer more valuable state property for compensation vouchers. They could also see to it that one does not have to stand in line for days for one or two stocks, or they could even enable the recipients of compensation to choose from the stocks of 10-12 companies at the same time. This way, the current government coalition might gain more votes in the election. Because as things stand now, no one is happy, except for speculators; those who received no compensation are unhappy because they did not receive any, and those who did are unhappy because they did. The price of compensation vouchers is decreasing because of the scarce supply of stocks and the scare tactics. That is to say, the coalition parties cannot take advantage of any of their virtues in the middle of the election campaign. To be sure, it is indisputable that due to the current government, more than 1 million people are recipients of compensation. It is also indisputable that up to now, the government made an effort to maintain the price of compensation vouchers, which the next government is not likely to do wholeheartedly even if it completes the compensation process. In other words, instead of scaremongering, they ought to act, and then the recipients of compensation would really trust in the current coalition, and would prove their trust on 8 May.
