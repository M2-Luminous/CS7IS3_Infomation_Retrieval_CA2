[Begin Bouziane recording] The statements Prime Minister Sifi made after his meetings with French and Belgian officials have indicated that his visits to Paris and Brussels have accomplished their goals It has become clear, however, that the trip was aimed at achieving two things: First, to muster political support for the reform efforts of the Algerian authorities; and second, to secure financial support needed for winning the battle of economic reforms in Algeria. In this respect, one should say that Sifi will not return to Algeria empty-handed: France has promised Algeria 6 billion francs; the European Commission has indicated that it would be releasing $240 million to Algeria this year. In his news conference, Sifi reiterated his satisfaction with the outcome of his visit to France and affirmed that the authorities in Algeria were not at odds with the European governments, which have been urging them to open a dialogue with the Islamic moderates. [passage omitted] According to Sifi, the resolve of the authorities was still intact: They are still seeking dialogue with anyone who respects the Constitution and denounces violence. [passage omitted] He added that the French, Belgian, and European officials he met during the last few days had affirmed to him their real support in all spheres in order to allow Algeria to overcome its crisis and play its role in the promotion of cooperation between the Arab Maghreb and Europe and the stability of the region. Replying to a question on a possible rift between Paris and Washington, he asserted that he felt, following the Algerian foreign minister's visit to Washington, that there was a great agreement in their respective viewpoints in view of the fact that Algeria did not reject to broaden dialogue to other parties that have denounced violence. For his part, Juppe has also pointed out on the same issue that he felt, after President Bill Clinton's recent visit to Paris, that there was great agreement in their respective viewpoints. He added: President Clinton told us he was supportive of the process to regain stability in Algeria as well as of economic reforms. [passage omitted] [end recording]
