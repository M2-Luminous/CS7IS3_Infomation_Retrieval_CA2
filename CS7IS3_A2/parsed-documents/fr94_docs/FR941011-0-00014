FR941011-0-00014 FR941011-0-00004 The public was provided with a 30-day period, ending on February 4, 1994, to comment on the interim regulation. The Service received three comments. Discussion of Comments Statutory Interpretation One commenter disagreed with the Service's interpretation of section 161(c) of IMMACT. Focusing on the requirement that a petitioner seeking to preserve a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date must file a ``new petition'', the commenter argued that Congress intended the priority date rule in section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT to apply only to employment-based petitions filed before October 1, 1991 and not to applications for labor certification filed before that date. The commenter further contended that an employment-based petition filed after the Department of Labor certifies a labor certification would not be a ``new'' petition since an employment-based petition is considered to be ``new'' only if the petitioner has not previously filed an employment-based petition on behalf of the alien. In other words, the commenter basically argues that the use of the words ``new petition'' in section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT presupposes the filing of an old petition. The Service disagrees with the commenter's argument. In order to properly address the comment, it is necessary to examine carefully section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT. The underlined portions of section 161(c)(1)(A), which specifically refer to labor certification applications, are the MTINA amendments, which were added after IMMACT became effective. The language of section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT reads as follows: (1) In the case of a petition filed under section 204(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act before October 1, 1991, for preference status under section 203(a)(3) or section 203(a)(6) of such Act (as in effect before such date) or an application for labor certification before such date under section 212(a)(14)_ (A) in order to maintain the priority date with respect to such a petition or application, the petitioner must file (by not later than October 1, 1991, but not certified until after October 1, 1993, or 60 days after the date of certification in the case of labor certifications filed in support of the petition under section 212(a)(14) of such Act before October 1, 1991, but not certified until after October 1, 1993 ) a new petition for classification of the employment under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 203(b) of such Act (as amended by this title), and Before Congress amended section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT by enacting section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, section 161(c)(1)(A) provided that in order to maintain a priority date of an employment-based petition filed before October 1, 1991, a new petition must be filed by October 1, 1993. As used in section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT, the term ``new petition'' clearly refers to an employment-based petition other than the one the petitioner had previously filed with the Service and not ``new'' in the sense of a first-time petition. Congress' use of the word ``new'' in section 302(e)(2) of MTINA does not alter the fact that the MTINA was amended specifically in order to apply the same priority date standard applicable to employment-based petitions to labor certifications applications filed before October 1, 1991. It is a basic rule of statutory construction that effect must be given to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute, so that no part will be inoperative, superfluous, or would emasculate the entire amendment. See ยง46.06 Singer, Sutherland Statutory Interpretation, 5th Ed. (1992); U.S. v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538&hyph;39 (1955). Adopting the commenter's interpretation of section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT would render the MTINA amendments to that section superfluous simply because Congress retained the word ``new petition.'' The Service cannot ignore the MTINA amendment. For this reason, the Service will not accept the commenter's reading of section 161(c) of IMMACT. The commenter also criticized the Service for engaging in retroactive rulemaking, citing Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U.S. 204 (1988). The Supreme Court held in Bowen that courts should be reluctant to find authority for retroactive rulemaking absent an express statutory grant. See id. at 209. As stated in the preceding paragraph, however, this rule is based on an express statutory amendment creating the October 1, 1993 deadline. The Bowen case is not applicable to this situation, since the Service is simply implementing a clear statutory directive.
