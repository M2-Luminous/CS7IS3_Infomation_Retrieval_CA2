FR940406-0-00011 FR940406-0-00001 Demonstration Projects/Cash-Outs in Other Benefit Programs_7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) and 273.10(d)(1) In accordance with section 340 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) to specify that in-kind or vendor payments which would normally be excluded as income but are converted in whole, or in part, to a direct cash payment under the approval of a federally authorized demonstration project shall continue to be excluded from income. These federally authorized demonstration projects include demonstration projects created by waiver of the provisions of Federal law. However, conversion to direct cash payment does not change the non-deductibility of the expenses paid with these funds. Accordingly, in order to ensure that an excluded vendor payment which has been converted to a direct cash payment is not excluded twice (once as income and once as expenses) the interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to specify that an expense covered by an excluded vendor payment which has been converted to a direct cash payment under the approval of a federally authorized demonstration project remains non-deductible as a household expense. The Department received no comments regarding these provisions of the interim rule. Therefore, this action adopts the interim provisions as final with no changes. Reporting Responsibilities_7 CFR 273.12 and 273.21 Under section 323 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule, State agencies are required to provide a household, at the time of certification and recertification, with a statement describing the household's reporting responsibilities. Moreover, State agencies must provide all households with a toll-free telephone number or a number where collect calls will be accepted in order for the household to reach an appropriate representative of the State agency. The interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.12(b)(1) to specifically require that the ``change report'' form include a statement describing the household's reporting responsibilities. In addition, 7 CFR 273.12(b)(1) was amended to specify that the ``change report'' form must contain the number of the food stamp office and a toll-free number or a number where collect calls will be accepted. (Reporting requirements remained unchanged for households subject to MRRB provisions of 7 CFR 273.21.) The interim rule also amended the provisions relative to the Notice of Eligibility, the Notice of Denial, the Notice of Adverse Action, and the requirements for bilingual notices. The regulations at 7 CFR 272.4(b)(3)(ii)(B), 7 CFR 273.10(g)(1)(i)(A), 7 CFR 273.10(g)(1)(ii) and 7 CFR 273.13(a)(2), respectively, were amended to specify that these notices must also include either a toll-free number or a number where collect calls will be accepted for households living outside the local calling area. The Department received one comment on these provisions of the interim rule. The commenter pointed out that the legislative intent of the toll-free or collect telephone number was to increase households' access to the State agency in order to obtain information or report changes. The commenter felt this statement of purpose should be incorporated into the rule itself to help guide State agencies' implementation efforts. The Department believes including a statement of purpose in 7 CFR 273.12(b) is unnecessary. Congress was clear that its intent in passing the Hunger Prevention Act was to make it easier for eligible households to apply and obtain benefits (Senate Report No. 100&hyph;397, p.25). On its face, the implementation of this provision demonstrates its purpose without additional explanation. The interim provisions are adopted as final without change. Special Provisions for Farm Households_7 CFR 273.8, 273.11, and 273.21 Pursuant to two provisions of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule amended Program regulations to extend eligibility to farm households which are in need of program assistance. Section 341 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 specified that self-employed farm households which are subject to MRRB have the option to annualize their self-employment income and expenses over a 12-month period. This provision was implemented in the interim rule by amending 7 CFR 273.21(f)(2)(i) and 273.11.
