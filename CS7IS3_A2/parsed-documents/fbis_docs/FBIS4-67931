Warheads Being Removed in Ukraine and Kazakhstan''] [Text] At long last the problem that perturbed the whole world after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence in its place of four states with over 350 strategic missiles with nuclear warheads on their territory is close to a solution. Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorussia [Belarus] have begun to consistently fulfill their juridical commitments regarding nuclear disarmament. ``All 46 RS-24 heavy missiles stationed in Ukraine have been deactivated,'' Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, has declared. ``Ukraine, and also Kazakhstan and Belorussia, the other CIS countries where our nuclear missile weapons are stationed for the moment, are honestly and consistently fulfilling their international commitments regarding nuclear disarmament.'' He made this statement at a meeting with foreign countries' military attaches in Moscow. ``The deactivation of missiles,'' the general explained to your IZVESTIYA correspondent, ``means that their nuclear warheads have been removed and have been replaced by a special technical equivalent in order to ensure the normal, accident-free functioning of missile systems, while the missiles themselves no longer have targeting information [lisheny poletnykh zadaniy]. They no longer threaten anyone.'' The commander in chief also disclosed that 20 missile complexes of the RS-18 liquid-fueled missile whose guaranteed operational lifetime had expired have been removed from alert status, the rocket fuel and oxidant have been pumped out of them, and the missiles have been readied for recycling [utilizatsiya]. Already 120 nuclear warheads have been withdrawn to Russia, and the rest will be dispatched to Russian plants in accordance with the Russian-Ukrainian timetable in conformity with the trilateral agreement concluded between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in January of this year. Operational control of the missile complexes in Ukraine is exercised from Moscow, administrative control from Kiev. Agreement has also been reached with Kazakhstan on granting Russian status to the strategic missile units stationed on that sovereign state's territory. As IZVESTIYA has already noted, there are 104 RS-20 (SS-18 in the NATO classification) missiles with the biggest launch weight of 211 tonnes, with a throwweight of 8.8 tonnes, and with 10 nuclear warheads on each missile in the country. Now over a period of 14 months these warheads will be removed from the missiles and withdrawn to Russian plants. The recovery of missiles from silos and their dispatch for recycling will take much more time and effort, but are to be completed within three years. But Kazakhstan will become totally nuclear-free as early as 1995. (Forty Tu-95MS strategic bombers and 240 cruise missiles were withdrawn from its territory a few months ago.) Admittedly, questions of paying for the process of eliminating the nuclear-missile complex on the state's territory have still not been resolved, but, judging by the present state of intergovernmental relations between Moscow and Alma-Ata [Almaty], the funding of the work to destroy the missile silos will not cause great problems and disagreements. There are no disagreements between Moscow and Minsk on the question of withdrawing strategic missiles from Belorussia's territory. The ``Topol'' missiles are leaving Lida and Mozyr on schedule, as IZVESTIYA reported in issue No 50 for 17 March. Russia has now eliminated 302 launchers for its strategic missiles and 403 missiles, and a further 600 will have been destroyed by the year 2003. It is honestly fulfilling its commitments under the START I treaty and is laying the foundation for fulfilling the START II treaty. According to the commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, strategic nuclear weapon delivery vehicles are decreasing by one-third in our country and strategic missile warheads [golovnyye chasti] by a factor of more than six. By January 1996 the Strategic Missile Forces personnel will have been cut by 25,000 men and the central apparatus of the Main Staff and directorates will have been cut by 20 percent. Russia currently has 1,050 launchers, and by the end of the century there will be 800. Further reductions in strategic arms and their development now depend also on the other states in the ``nuclear club.'' Military experts and specialists in international relations familiar with the problem of the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine and Kazakhstan know that the process of reaching agreement here was by no means simple and straightforward. It took great efforts by the states' leaders, parliaments, and generals and, naturally, by the U.S. Administration, Britain, and France and a certain amount of political and economic pressure before the parties to the multilateral dialogue were able to reach agreement. But the main thing has been achieved. The Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, of which Russia and the United States are guarantors as countries keeping the treaty in their state archives, will not be violated. The world community has ensured that the nuclear club has not grown. And this means there is the hope that no other states possessing these terrible weapons of mass destruction will appear on the planet. There is another conclusion that must be drawn from this fact: The world community, provided that there is consensus within it, is capable of solving many other problems of tricky relations between states and within them by peaceful means. All this takes is goodwill and awareness of its responsibility to the peoples.
