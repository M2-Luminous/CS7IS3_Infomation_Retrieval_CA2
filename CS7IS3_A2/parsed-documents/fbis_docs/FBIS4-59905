The radio team at the headquarters of the former National People's Assembly will give more details. Over to Messaoud Aouchallouch: [Messaoud] Yes, Rachid. Ladies and gentleman, peace be upon you. Rachid, the official inauguration ceremony began at about 1105, presided over by Liamine Zeroual, the state president. The president gave an address at the beginning of which he focused on the importance of the Transitional National Council as an institution which embodies one of the most important resolutions of the National Consensus Conference and one of the essential foundations for the fruitful completion of this decisive stage. It is also considered an important means of implementing the program to extricate the country from the crisis and achieve democracy within the framework of respect for the deep-rooted values of the Algerian people. Liamine Zeroual made a point of recalling the state's obligations to achieve all the goals of the platform of national consensus, especially those related to organizing free and democratic elections which give the choice of the nation full sovereignty. He noted that this council emphasizes the main characteristic of the government's endeavor to tackle the problems of the country; this endeavor is reflected in the political and social consultation. The state president seized this opportunity to explain a few positions around which a lot of controversy was aroused in respect of the efforts aiming at reviving the political and social dialogue within a legitimate framework and specified objectives, as he described it. Liamine Zeroual said: Our invitation to dialogue -- he said this as an explanation -- our invitation to dialogue emanates from our deep conviction that it is the path that will allow us to gather all national forces which are far from any extremism and imported ideas from whatever source. However, I would like to make clear to you, the state president went to say, that the effort which I began last March within the framework of reviving the political dialogue was not understood correctly by some parties. Therefore, it is imperative for everyone to define his position very clearly according to the defined framework and objectives, and away from any calculations or maneuvers. Concerning the state, I would emphasize here, the state president added, that it will shoulder, without any hesitation and with full determination, all its commitments in leading the transitional period. In this respect, the restoration of stability to the country and the protection of the security of the individuals and properties come at the fore of our priorities. The state will continue to achieve these objectives without ceasing until the total elimination of violence and terrorism from our society. After the head of state's address the national anthem was played, and Mr. Bouchaib, the most senior of the members, announced that the session was adjourned and that it will resume later in a closed session. Regarding the presidency of the council, I should point out that according to the latest reports this will go to a person who represents the institution of the state, Mr. Abdelkader Bensalah, the former spokesman for the National Dialogue Commission, who was a member of the dissolved National Assembly and chaired one of its committees. He was also a director of ECH-CHAAB newspaper and is now a senior official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If the choice of Bensalah as the only candidate is finally confirmed, the elections will be unopposed and will take place 10 days after this inauguration, bearing in mind that Article 34 of the National Consensus Document stipulates that the president of the Transitional National Council should be elected by the members of the Council for the duration of the transitional period.
