The breakup of the pentagonal, the start of dialogue between the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and the PD [Democratic Party], the "dual" government formula, and the resumption of discussions with the opposition are issues that appear every day on the front page our newspapers. We asked Romanian President Ion Iliescu to give his views concerning these most recent events. [Dragotescu] In your opinion, what chance is there that the PDSR and the PD will reconcile their differences? [Iliescu] I believe that what is under discussion here is not so much the programmatic aspect of the respective issue but certain obstinate behavior that has appeared in human relations. Therefore, I believe that dialogue is difficult also because of these resentments that have arisen and, certainly, because of the fact that these resentments are emphasized by certain principles. It is always easy to break up a relationship but it is much more difficult to repair it. Probably, this also holds true on a large scale: Namely, a military conflict can break out easily but it is very difficult to achieve reconciliation. A split in the family can also be easily provoked when people do not show enough concern. However, the sides make up with great difficulty. That is the case with political formations too. [Dragotescu] Are there any misunderstandings between you and Mr. Petre Roman [Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) leader]? [Iliescu] I have never had any misunderstanding with him. He started to move along a certain path and I believe that, in so doing, he also displayed certain aspects of his character that are not in his favor. [Dragotescu] In journalistic circles, there is much talk about the fact that C.V. Tudor [senator, president of the Greater Romania Party] allows himself to attack you in certain ways because he has a hold on you. [Iliescu] Nobody has any hold on me whatsoever. I have led a straight and honest life and I am not ashamed of anything that I have done in my life. Therefore, one should not think along these lines. I have to be more careful when I express myself because, in view of my official position, I cannot allow myself to start disputes and feuds with anybody. Considering the way in which Mr. Corneliu Vadim Tudor behaves, I believe that it would be completely below my dignity even to offer him a reply. [Dragotescu] Do you believe in a PDSR-PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party] government that might operate for a longer time than the current government? [Iliescu] It depends on several things. It is not only a question of direct understanding between two parties that, in any case, cannot form a majority. If, together, they could form a parliamentary majority, then, certainly, one could talk about it. However, given the fact that they cannot, the issue becomes more delicate. [Dragotescu] Would you personally prefer a government that includes the PDSR and the opposition? [Iliescu] I prefer nothing. I would like a government that, to a certain extent, is stable and enjoys the support of Parliament. I have said this often and I see that this is not how things are perceived at all: Political understanding between political formations that are included in Parliament is one thing and the possible structure of a government is another. The government might also include only specialists or representatives of a single political formation, but this has to be achieved on the basis of a political platform that has larger parliamentary support. No matter what kind of governments will follow, Romania's problems remain the same. Any Romanian government should be a government of reform. This, no doubt, requires broad political and social support. [Dragotescu] Don't you think that there is a certain contradiction in what you are saying? On the one hand, you often accuse the opposition of taking provocative actions that lead to destabilization while, on the other hand, you accept the PDSR associating with the opposition. [Iliescu] No! One can always criticize somebody. This does not mean a halt to dialogue. In a dialogue, there are also controversies and differences of opinions, including criticism of uncivilized behavior. However, I want to repeat that this does not mean that political dialogue should stop. The aim of such a dialogue is not to settle differences of opinions and to start an exchange of niceties. There might even be a heated dialogue on controversial issues between persons holding opposing views. However, this is the only way in which Romania's interests can be promoted. [Dragotescu] Do you believe that early elections might be a solution? [Iliescu] Possibly, if no other solution is found. However, I believe that this would not be favorable for the country. An election campaign would only disturb public life. This year, we should concentrate on doing something positive in the economy in order to overcome the current crisis.
