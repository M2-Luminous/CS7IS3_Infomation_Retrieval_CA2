The spokesman also stressed that we must seek a just, quick, and viable solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem based on respect for international law and the decisions of international organizations. Replying to another question, Venizelos said Greece was not informed of the raid beforehand and added that not every NATO country is informed before similar acts. There is no provision for any similar process involving deliberations, he said, adding that the order was given by Akasi, meaning it was actually an order by the UN secretary general.
