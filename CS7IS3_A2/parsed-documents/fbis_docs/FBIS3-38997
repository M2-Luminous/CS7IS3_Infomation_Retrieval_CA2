Undoubtedly, even though its effect will be minimal. The core of the amnesty issue concerns the question of whether, in Belgium's name, injustice occurred when collaboration was punished. And if yes, how should that injustice be made up for? Luc Huyse's pathbreaking work three years ago showed that in the first months repression was far stronger than afterwards, far more severe on political compared with economic collaboration, and partisan in its attempt to remove Flemish nationalism as a political factor. Anyone with doubts after this report should then read the memoirs of Eyskens senior: He thought that it was normal for any self-respecting state to punish collaboration severely, but at the same time described the many occasions he had to intervene to prevent excesses and help those condemned, even 20 years after the war. In Flanders in the decades after the war, immediate amnesty was presented as a means to compensate for these injustices; this would entail the pardon of all those condemned. But in recent decades this demand became excessively associated with extreme right-wing groups in Flanders. At the same time every French-speaking politician was all too eager to translate amnesty as unacceptable moral forgiveness of collaboration. Therefore first Hugo Schiltz, then Luc Huyse sought compromise formulas: The famous "measures which can contribute to the reconciliation of the citizens" mentioned in the governmental agreement of the Martens VIII government (1988) and the King's speeches of 21 July 1990 and 1 February 1994. Fifty years after the war, the number of people and amount of suffering involved are no longer unduly large. A report by the Flemish Council in 1985 talked about several thousand pensions and 1,800 other cases. Such cases range from descendants who are still required to pay back debts from 1944 to the Belgian state through to civil servants who were refused medals. Between 1980 and the end of 1990 the Belgian state gradually allowed 96 people who were still making payments because of a postwar condemnation to have their punishments reduced. Between 1975 and 1990, 71 people appealed on the grounds of the law of 30 June 1961, which allowed the restoration of civil rights. Ten applications were actually rejected because those involved had been condemned to more than 10 years in prison during the repression. It is a new feature that the PS's bureau, which in the past received any change in this question with an unswerving no, is now ready to "investigate" the social consequences of the condemnations after the war. It shows in that in the south of this country as well, people are beginning to realize that it is necessary to remove the main difficulties presented by this question, which always gave tens of thousands of people in Flanders a good argument to hate Belgium. It must be hoped that this new position will still give something to the last few hundred victims of the injustice which took place in 1944 and 1945. But it is probably a little too late to restore the political damage to this unsteady country.
