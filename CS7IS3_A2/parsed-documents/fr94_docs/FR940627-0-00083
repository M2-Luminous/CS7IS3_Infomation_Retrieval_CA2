SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background_Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3111&hyph;3126) requires that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaries) implement a joint program to grant a preference for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife resources on public lands, unless the State of Alaska enacts and implements laws of general applicability which are consistent with ANILCA, and which provide for the subsistence definition, preference, and participation specified in sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA. The State implemented a program that the Department of the Interior previously found to be consistent with ANILCA. However, in December 1989, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in McDowell v. State of Alaska that the rural preference in the State subsistence statute violated the Alaska Constitution. The court's ruling in McDowell required the State to delete the rural preference from the subsistence statute, and therefore, negated State compliance with ANILCA. The Court stayed the effect of the decision until July 1, 1990. As a result of the McDowell decision, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (Departments) assumed, on July 1, 1990, responsibility for implementation of Title VIII of ANILCA on public lands. On June 29, 1990, the Temporary Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the Federal Register (55 FR 27114&hyph;27170). Consistent with Subparts A, B, and C of these regulations, a Federal Subsistence Board (Board) was established to administer the Federal Subsistence Management Program. The Board's composition includes a Chair appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. National Park Service; the Alaska State Director, U.S. Bureau of Land Management; the Alaska Area Director, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs; and the Alaska Regional Forester, USDA Forest Service. Through the Board, these agencies have participated in development of regulations for Subparts A, B, and C, and the annual Subpart D regulations. On June 1, 1993, the 1993&hyph;1994 Seasons and Bag Limits for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the Federal Register (58 FR 31252&hyph;31295). Those regulations which include the sections on the taking of fish and shellfish expire June 30, 1994. On July 15, 1993, the Native American Rights Fund, on behalf of a number of individuals and organizations, submitted a petition to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture requesting that they include navigable waters within the definition of ``public lands'' as used in implementing Title VIII. This was a request for administrative relief. The Secretaries continue their evaluation of this petition.
