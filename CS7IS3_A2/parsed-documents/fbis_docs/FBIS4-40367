Zh. in Check"] [Text] Moscow's law and order organs gave the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] a remarkable gift for Russian Independence Day. The Investigations Directorate of the Moscow Main Internal Affairs Administration has turned down a request to start criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy from State Duma deputies and a STOLITSA magazine journalist who were injured by V.V. Zh. [Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy] on 8 April (owing to the absence of corpus delicti). Thus, the LDPR leader gets carte blanche to use the physiognomies of his political opponents to relieve the itch in his fists. According to KURANTY, however, the State Duma deputies do not intend to give up attempts to get Zhirinovskiy punished, even if not by court, for the fight in the Duma in April.
