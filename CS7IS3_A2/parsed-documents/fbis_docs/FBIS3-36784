The news conference is relayed live from the Seimas radio studio. [Brazauskas] The Ukrainian delegation. [sentence as heard] We are happy to witness a great event in our political lives. We have defined, I can even say we have improved our relations with a great state such as Ukraine. Today's visit will make a very good and positive impression on our lives. We have discussed possible paths for our further cooperation with Mr. President and his delegation. We also spoke about the improvement of these relations, we touched upon foreign policy matters as well. I congratulated Mr. Kravchuk on Ukraine's decision [changes thought] and I believe that namely today the Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs is signing the Partnership for Peace agreement. [Words indistinct] today join the ranks of partners, especially such a mighty partner as Ukraine. Discussing the issues of our domestic policies we, of course, spoke mostly about the progress of economic reform and about the results of this progress, both positive and negative. We shared our experience [in this sphere]. [Kravchuk] Ladies and gentlemen, in sharing the conclusions and assessments that President Brazauskas of Lithuania has just spoken about, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, and the Government of Lithuania for the hospitality and the friendly attitude you have shown to us. I am convinced that the signing of today's documents are a very important step, that another step will be taken in Kiev, that the President of Lithuania Mr. Brazauskas, will visit Ukraine and that I will officially invite him to visit our state. Thank you [Correspondent] A question from the Baltic News Service. I would like to ask the president, do you think that the idea to set up the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea alliance has any future? If so, what meaning could be attached to that idea? [Kravchuk] I think that the Eastern and Central European initiative that Ukraine proposed and which coincides in many aspects with similar initiatives proposed by Poland, France, and other states, makes possible the creation of such an alliance with the Baltic states, Ukraine, and other states. It is important for me to stress that when we speak about such an alliance, we are not talking about any blocs, any military or political blocs, but about security zones, about economic and political cooperation, and foreign political interaction. We have all the grounds for this. [Brazauskas] I would like to say a few words. The initiative that has been shown by Ukraine and the Ukrainian president and which has been supported is not, of course, aimed at forming a military bloc, nor is it intended to do so. Therefore, the French initiative, or more precisely, the initiative shown by the French Prime Minister coincides with the above mentioned initiative. These are very concrete steps toward general European cooperation. I think that the Partnership for Peace is one of the main means available in Europe today for carrying out this cooperation. [Correspondent] A question from Ukrainian television. I have a question to the presidents, the presidents of Ukraine and Lithuania. Please explain -- the economic foundation is the priority for future relations between our states, after all, these economic documents were signed today after the political document was signed. What are the basic directions in this development? Thank you. [Kravchuk] First of all, I would like to stress that economic relations between Ukraine and Lithuania are not just the beginning of such relations. We have a good foundation and traditions, and on the basis of these we should build and broaden our economic relations by laying a new road and principles. At present they do not correspond to our possibilities. There are objective reasons for this: The settlement crisis and the introduction of our own currencies. All this has had an effect on relations but the prospects and the possibilities are too broad, and we have already spoken with Mr. President about the possibilities for trade and cooperation in the field of transport through the Baltic ports; we could have access to this region through the Black Sea and Lithuania could have access to other regions. Therefore, we have good prospects and good possibilities. I spoke about this and once again would like to stress that today we have signed an important political document, which is also partly an economic document. I hope that new documents will be signed in Kiev. Our cooperation and relations in the economic sphere will be broadened and will deepen in all aspects. [Brazauskas] I would like to say a few words on the same topic. The currently existing developed transport communication lines that link the Baltic Sea with the Black Sea, can be and should be utilized. What is important here is that an agreement, and I would think that there would be no doubt about that, should be reached on these issues with Ukraine and Belarus. Our shipbuilding and ship repair enterprises use steel that is exclusively manufactured and imported from Ukraine. Therefore, we are greatly interested in cooperation, first of all, in this sphere. I think that while both our states are now moving toward a market economy, and this process is not an easy one, our cooperation should be organized in such a way that it will become a very broad and beneficial relationship. [Correspondent] A question from KOMMERSANT DAILY ROSSIYA. A question to President Kravchuk. Esteemed Leonid Makarovich, Ukraine is the first country in the CIS to join the Partnership for Peace agreement today. Can you tell us please what impact the new situation would have on the rather complex relations with Russia, first of all because of the Black Sea Fleet and with the world community concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Does Ukraine intend to become a full member of NATO? [Kravchuk] I think that first, the signing of this initiative by Ukraine will not have any bearing on relations with Russia, because perhaps Russia will also sign this initiative on Partnership for Peace too. After all, this initiative is open to all countries. When we all become members, [changes thought] not members, but when we all sign this initiative then there will be real cooperation between all states. Second, I am convinced that resolving the nuclear arms problem and implementing the trilateral agreement by all sides, which was signed in Moscow, we will, at the same time, strengthen the positive attitude and friendly relations between Russia and Ukraine. I am convinced that we will also resolve the issue of the Black Sea Fleet, because I know that unless the pressing problems of nuclear arms and the Black Sea Fleet are resolved, it will be difficult to build normal friendly relations with Russia. Our political relations with Russia are especially important. I am convinced that this particular meaning will have realistic content if there is goodwill on the part of Russia and Ukraine. I consider that the Partnership for Peace initiative does not contradict the interest of all states but will favor understanding, cooperation, and the working out of certain programs and policies of our foreign policy and also of other states, and this is really being done for the benefit of peace and not confrontation. It is the right of every state to determine its own foreign policy. [Kravchuk] By way of conclusion, I would like to say that the problems that currently exist between Russia and Ukraine should not be deliberately exacerbated because we are aspiring to resolve them through mutual understanding and mutual support. We are attempting to build these relations for the future so that nobody sows the seeds of discord among our peoples, because our future lies in friendly, and I stress, in friendly and businesslike relations with Russia, our neighbor, with which we have the most interests and where most of our foreign policy is directed. Finally, I would like you to listen to the policy that the Ukrainian state is pursuing and not to listen to the statements made by the opposition, because they do not principally coincide with this most important problem. [Correspondent] A question from UKRINFORM agency. This is a question to the head of the Republic of Lithuania. Currently, in your country there are approximately 50,000 Ukrainians. Could you say that they live in your country like at home. You probably discussed this problem today with the Ukrainian president. [Brazauskas] I think that the Ukrainian national minority, which comprises about 50,000 people, are Lithuanian citizens enjoying full rights and there are no problems whatsoever in this matter. We are glad that people of all nationalities, including Ukrainians, have taken up Lithuanian citizenship. The overwhelming majority of them have taken up Lithuanian citizenship. Today, these people are taking an active part in the country's political and social life. I hope that when Mr. President meets representatives of the Ukrainian community he will hear the same thing that I have just said. [Announcer] This was a live relay of the news conference held by the Lithuanian and Ukrainian presidents at the president's office in Vilnius.
