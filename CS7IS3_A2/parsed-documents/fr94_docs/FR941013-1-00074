FR941013-1-00074 FR941013-1-00010 Adopting a 10 ppmw action level for the process vent MACT floor corresponding to the 10 ppmw total organic concentration value used for subpart AA rules was considered by the EPA but determined not to be appropriate. The 10 ppmw value used for the subpart AA rule is not the sole regulatory criterion (i.e., action level) by which the need to apply air emission controls to affected vents is determined. The need to apply controls under the subpart AA rules is determined by the total organic emission rates for each affected vent and for the entire facility from all affected vents. The data available to the EPA at this time for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are insufficient to correlate a VOHAP concentration action level value equivalent to the total organic emission rate limits used for the subpart AA rules. Consequently, the EPA relied on a qualitative assessment to select a VOHAP concentration action level which would exclude those treatment processes having little or no potential for organic HAP emissions. A VOHAP concentration action level of 100 ppmw was selected for the MACT floor for existing process vents consistent with the rationale used to select the action level for tanks, containers, and land disposal units. e. Existing Equipment Leaks. The MACT floor for equipment leaks is determined to be control of emissions from leaks in ancillary equipment containing or contacting wastes or recoverable materials with total organic HAP concentrations equal to or greater than 10 percent by implementing leak detection and repair (LDAR) work practices and equipment modifications. Most off-site waste and recovery operations facilities are also hazardous waste TSDF. Thus, ancillary equipment operated at these facilities to treat hazardous waste are subject to the existing RCRA organic air emission standards for TSDF equipment leaks (40 CFR 264 subpart BB and 40 CFR 265 subpart BB). These standards require implementation of a LDAR program and modifications to certain types of ancillary equipment operated at the facility that handle hazardous waste having a total organic concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent. The LDAR and equipment requirements are consistent with existing NSPS process equipment leak standards promulgated by the EPA under CAA section 111 (i.e., 40 CFR 60 subparts VV, GG, and KK) and for certain NESHAP process equipment leak standards promulgated under CAA section 112 (i.e., 40 CFR 61 subpart V). 2. MACT Floor for New Sources The MACT floor for new sources is identical to the MACT floors determined by the EPA for existing sources with the exception of the MACT floor for new tanks and new containers. For the emission point types other than tanks or containers, the MACT floor determined for existing sources also represents the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source. a. New Tanks. The MACT floor for new tanks is determined to be use of a cover vented to a control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by 95 percent (or equivalent floating roof technology) for those new tanks in which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste in the tank is equal to or greater than 0.1 kPa (approximately 0.07 psi). This is the level of emission control that is required for new tanks under the Hazardous Organic NESHAP (40 CFR 63 subpart G). The EPA concluded that these types of emission controls represent the emission control level achieved in practice by the best controlled sources similar to the types of new tanks anticipated by the EPA to be built at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities and used for management of wastes or recoverable materials containing organic HAP. b. New Containers. The MACT floor for new containers is determined to be the use of covers and submerged loading for containers in which waste or recoverable material is placed having a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. The EPA's review of its container data base for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category indicates that some existing TSDF owners and operators (but significantly less than 12 percent) reported using submerged fill to load material containing organic HAP into containers.
