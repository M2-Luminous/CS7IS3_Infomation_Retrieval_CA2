Eng. Golboddin Hekmatyar, has intensified the last week launched diplomatic offensive against president Prof Borhanoddin Rabbani and his close associate commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. A four-member delegation of the Supreme Coordination Council arrived in Islamabad last week to meet the foreign minister and other concerned officials. The Council consists of Hezb-e Eslami, Junbish-e Milli, Hezb-e Wahdat and Afghan National Liberation Front. The delegation members were Abdol Hadi Arghandiwal, Hashmatollah Mujadadi, Dr Talib and Abdol Samad. During their meeting with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali, the delegation maintained that fighting in Kabul would continue until President Rabbani resigned from his office to pave the way for establishment of a broadbased interim government in the Afghan capital of Kabul. They said Golboddin Hekmatyar was also willing to resign from the office of prime minister. The Council is also demanding holding of general elections in the country within six months to elect the future government of Afghanistan. The setting up of a national army is also one of the Council's demands which links its four-point plan to restoration of peace in Afghanistan. The Council is also ready to surrender all of their arms to the Ministry of Defence of the new government. A reliable source told THE FRONTIER POST on Saturday that the delegation would also be visiting Iran and Saudi Arabia soon to win diplomatic support of these two countries to their peace plan.
