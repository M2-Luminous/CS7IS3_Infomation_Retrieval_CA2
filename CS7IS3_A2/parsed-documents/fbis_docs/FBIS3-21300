Koor described the venture as part of its strategic diversification designed to broaden the company's basket of products. Much has been said of the recovery plan, by which Koor's creditor banks have forced it to sell its controlling interest in Tambor at a price far below its current worth. Koor's renewed entry into the Israeli dye industry is intended to break Tambor's monopoly over 80 percent of the local market. There is more than meets the eye in this script. Koor may have sold its direct interest in Tambor but it continues to hold half the shares of Mashav, which owns 24 percent of Tambor's shares. At the end of this chain, Koor has 12 percent of Tambor's shares. The opening of a rival dye company does not mesh with its interests as a part owner. It seems reasonable to conclude that Koor was unwillingly drawn into the venture by Makhteshim even though Makhteshim's CEO is Yehuda Milo, Koor's deputy CEO. "Koor controls lines that are fundamentally independent," a member of Koor's board of directors explained this week. "Not everything is set from above. A subsystem can identify a business opportunity in a field that runs against Koor's interests, the management team brings the proposal to the company's board of directors and the board then decides. The chairman of the board does not make the decision himself." The dye company is just one example of a symptom inherent in Koor's strategy of diversification--its fluid assets are not within the company itself. Koor's latest financial report shows a considerable improvement in its fluidity, amounting to working capital of 724 million shekels at the end of September, 1993. The financial reports for the first seven months of this year, however, are combined reports. Koor admits that most of its fluid assets were drained in satisfying its debts to Israeli and foreign banks. The company's current fluid holdings are in its subsidiaries, primarily Nesher and Tadiran. The Prizma project is proof that under current conditions, Koor does not have absolute control over its lines of investment or their nature. On the other hand, Koor will have no difficulty finding funds to finance its diversification program on its own. Because it is not leveraged at present, it enjoys a wide field for acquiring funds. Indeed, it expects to raise close to 120 million shekels in convertible bonds, which it will use carrying out its five-year strategic plan. Koor must expand in order to preserve its returns on capital. The high profits of 1992-1993 led to a sharp increase in its shareholder equity. Accordingly, it must expand its sources of income and, above all, diversify them. The company's recovery plan was essentially a consolidation plan by which Koor sold dozens of concerns. The reduction brought it back to profitability but also made it highly dependent on three sources of income: Tadiran and Telrad, Nesher, and Makhteshim and Agan. Tadiran alone accounted for one-third of Koor's profits in 1993. Along with Telrad, its dependence on the communications branch is very high. This dependence is particularly problematic in light of Tadiran's own deep roots in Bezeq, which is suffering from steadily lower prices; it also is having difficulties making the transition from the local market to exports and from a slice of the military market to the civilian one. Its opportunities in cellular phones also have plunged since GTE withdrew from competition. If it does not find a new partner, it too will have to drop out. Koor's success in 1994 will depend on its success in steering Tadiran through an obstacle course. That, apparently, is the reason that Koor's CEO, Benny Ga'on, recently appointed himself chairman of Tadiran. The goal that Koor has established for itself in the strategic plan is to reach annual sales of $3 billion by 1997, $1 billion from exports. The strategic plan is based on an economic survey the company made that identified two critical fields with potential--the tourist industry in peacetime and the capital market. As for tourism, Koor has announced its intention to go into four areas: hotels, car rental, travel agencies, and holiday parks. As for the stock market, Koor's managers are talking about opening or buying a brokerage house. In fact, market analysts say, Koor has already begun making vast acquisitions. "There is practically no company trading on the market that has not passed over Koor's desk," is the way a senior figure at a competitor puts it. "As a general matter, it looks like the company is buying almost everything available, and at high prices." Despite a superficial resemblance to the Koor of prerecovery plan days, this is not a return to the mold that brought it down back then. In the 1980's, Koor bought anything at hand, including highly leveraged, money-losing businesses without knowing what was going on inside them. Its motives were partly political, and the interlocking debts among the companies dragged the whole system into bankruptcy. Today, the companies do not owe debts to one another. Each profit center is autonomous, so a loss in one company will not topple the entire house of cards. But the prices at which Koor has been making its acquisitions, critics contend, are liable to become problems in the future. 'Ami Goldene, managing director of Me'ir 'Ezra, which is competing with Koor for acquisition of Milutal, a frozen vegetables business, has assailed Koor for the high price it offered for the business. Goldene may have an ax to grind, but the capital market provides other examples. Along with Klal, Koor bought Yuli 'Ofer's holdings in Carmel Granites at market prices. Of the acquisition of 15 percent of Arki'a, one market analyst says, a company like Koor has no reason to invest in a business without taking control of it. "You have to remember that the moment that Eilat has 6,000 hotel rooms, another carrier will be able to enter that route. Arki'a will lose its monopoly and be forced to cut fares," says the analyst. The purchase of the Kinorot Tiberias hotel has also drawn criticism. "If Koor wants to enjoy the peace dividend, it has to build hotels rather than buy them. When you buy a hotel today, the price already reflects the expected dividend," says the analyst. Koor is used to giving reasons in its defense. Koor's CEO, Benny Ga'on, refused to be interviewed for this article, but other company officials stressed that the best evidence of Koor's caution is the long list of companies that it contacted--and turned down. A random and unrepresentative sampling of the list includes Tempo, Sahar, Moritz-Tukhlar, Dan Rent-A-Car and Histour. "There is a lot of noise surrounding Koor, a sense that it has a hand in everything. Koor is thought of as a company that brings financial and organizational skills. We get business offers every day," says a Koor official, "but we turn away most of them. If you look at where we have actually put our money, you see that the company has been very selective." According to this official, once Koor achieves the goals it has set itself, it will stop the entire process. "You can expect that we will quit running after opportunities at a certain point." With the exception--surprisingly--of Milutal, the officer completely rejects complaints about specific investments. "The deal still is not done and nothing is definite," says the official. "The frozen vegetable market is highly saturated and we have a lot of questions. It will depend on the numbers the other side shows us." As for the other investments, adds the official, all considerations were taken into account at the time of acquisition. "How can you say that we bought Arki'a at market prices when the deal was done the night the shares were issued? On paper, we've made 25 million shekels since the sale, a half million sheqels a day," says the Koor official. Someone else, outside the company, also rejects the criticism. "Two years ago, Koor was deep in the recovery plan and not in a position to buy anything. What IDB [Israel Discount Bank] got quietly during those two years, Koor is now doing all at once and very noisily," says the CEO of one of the economy's leading corporations. "They said prices on the market were high two years ago, too, and it later turned out that anyone who did not buy then lost out, and big. It is true that Koor is now buying at market prices and multipliers of 25 and 30, when many companies are being sold above their value. The problem is not companies that are sold on the stock market but those not on the market. But you have to remember that even Koor itself is acquiring ever higher multipliers, so it is difficult to say definitely whether it is buying at exceptionally dear prices," says the CEO. If one can judge by Koor's publicly traded stock, the market still has not decided. Its shares sell now for the same price they did six months ago, far below the overall share index. Some attribute that to the volume of trades that the government set in motion on the market. Others see it as a vote of no confidence in the strategic plan. Three directors have resigned from Koor's board over the past half year. Some have tried to link the wave of departures with a feeling of uneasiness arising from developments in the company. The three members involved categorically deny that and claim that they resigned because of conflicts of interest. Accountant Ariela Zukhobitzky preferred the stock market's board of directors. Minister Shalom Shiran says that Koor's entry into the world of stock portfolios made him fearful of conflicts of interests because he serves as adviser to a number of companies in the field. "If I would had any complaints, I would have made them known," contends Shiran. Shmu'el Rotem, of Nayar Hadera, says that he decided to resign after he was asked to serve as director on behalf of the public; there was some overlap between the operations of Argaz and those of Markavim, which is a subsidiary of Koor. Rotem cut to the heart of the matter in a single sentence: "Koor's directors and management have to guard against euphoria and keep a sense of proportion in their decisions and activities." People close to the company today speak out more pointedly when the word "euphoria" goes around. "Some acquisitions were worth getting, some not. Some things might have been bought more cheaply," said one person close to the company. "It is natural that a sense of euphoria has developed in Koor," says one member of the board of directors. "It is no wonder that that is happening in a company that was mired so deeply in the mud and got out thanks to good management. Undoubtedly there are people on the leadership teams who have said the same thing." Benny Ga'on, say those close to Koor, wields almost total control over the company. Partly, that is a matter of his charismatic personality and the status he can claim as the man responsible for the company's revival. But the deeper reason is that Koor has no owners in the true sense of the word, and in the absence of owners, one member of the board explained, management becomes whatever it can. Koor bore the yoke of the bank arrangement until a year ago. When it was freed of the arrangement, Hevrat Ha'ovdim, which now holds 37 percent of Koor's shares, was supposed to step back in and take on the role of owner. Since the collapse of the Histadrut's own companies, however, this body has been emptied of much of its substance. If Hevrat Ha'ovdim is now regaining its strength, that is due to its possession of Koor, and not the reverse. Prof. Eytan Sheshinsky, chairman of Koor's board of directors and a dominant figure in his own right, was formally appointed by Hevrat Ha'ovdim. But as an active partner in the recovery process, Sheshinsky was identified more with management than with the shareholders. In any event, Hevrat Ha'ovdim's control over Koor is temporary. In the meantime, Bank Hapo'alim is the sole body that has exercised the options it received as part of the Koor arrangement in return for wiping out it debts. The bank has held 23.9 percent of the company's shares since August, 1993. When the other banks, foremost among them Bank Le'umi, exercise their options, Hevrat Ha'ovdim's share of Koor will drop to 22 percent and Bank Hapo'alim will become the controlling shareholder in the company. Bank Hapo'alim already keeps real holdings to the extent permitted by law, so the Bank of Israel has instructed it to sell its interest in Koor; it is also, in any case, forbidden to be the company's largest shareholder. According to the banks' restructuring plan, however, Bank Hapo'alim will be required to sell most of its holdings in Klal, Deleq, Ampal and Dior P.B. Sources close to the bank estimate that it would prefer to sell one of its other large holdings provided that it can take control of Koor. In any case, changes recently were made in Bank Hapo'alim to increase its involvement in Koor. Formally, the creditor banks had two representatives on Koor's directorate--Roni Feinstein and Moshe Veitman. Bank Hapo'alim, whose holdings entitle it to appoint four of Koor's board members, is now working to place two of its people on the management council. Those are Dafna Peli, secretary of Bank Hapo'alim, and Badan Yahas, who is in charge of the bank's finance and customer services divisions. Both were involved in overseeing Koor during the recovery plan, so they know the company well. "It is not that the board of directors has failed to do its duty, God forbid. There were a number of arguments and incidents in which the directors refused to confirm plans that management had brought. That is the same thing we have seen in Bank Le'umi and Bank Hapo'alim. In the same way, it is hard to point to anyone who gives orders to Moshe Zanbar or 'Amiram Siyon," says one member of the board. As he sees it, Bank Hapo'alim's control of the board of directors will change the picture. "The moment that Hapo'alim becomes owner and appoints its own people, it will exercise tremendous influence in the way it sees fit. It isn't a question of caution or of someone with a better understanding of how the economy works. 'Amiram Siyon is not preferable to Benny Ga'on--they hatched from the same egg. It is a question of balance in making decisions."
