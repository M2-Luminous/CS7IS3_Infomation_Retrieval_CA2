Qiao Shi, its chairman, presided over the opening ceremony of the eight-day session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee. The Draft Law on the People's Bank of China (PBC) specifies the authority and responsibilities of the PBC as the country's central bank, to pave the way for China's current financial reform, Zhou Zhengqing, a PBC deputy governor, said at the meeting. The draft auditing law is intended to maintain the soundness of the government budget and protect the value of state property, said the auditor-general, Guo Zhenqian. The Draft Arbitration Law provides an arbitration system, in line with international practice, to solve economic disputes better and to promote the country's economic and trade cooperation with other countries, said Gu Angran, director of the Legislative Affairs Committee of the NPC Standing Committee. A deputy director of the NPC Law Committee, Li Yining, also submitted the revised version of the Draft Securities Law to the legislators for further deliberation today. There were 220 items in the current draft, 50 items more than in the previous one, Li said. The "major changes" were based on the previous review by the lawmakers and opinion from relevant government agencies, localities, legal and financial experts, he said. Three reports on the review results of the Draft Labor Law, the Draft Law on Urban Real Estate and the Draft Regulation on Punishing Copyright Violators were given to the meeting by Cai Cheng, Xiang Chunyi and Wang Shuwen respectively, each a deputy director of the NPC Law Committee. The current Draft Labor Law puts more emphasis on protecting the legal rights of workers, according to Cai. The current Draft Regulation on Punishing Copyright Violators raises the maximum penalty for them from five years in prison to seven years, Wang said. Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu submitted a border treaty with Laos to the legislature for approval.
