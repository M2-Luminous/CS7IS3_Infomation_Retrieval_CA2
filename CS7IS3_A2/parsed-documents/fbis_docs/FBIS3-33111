The peace talks in Chiapas State will begin Monday at 1100. The place is still unknown, obviously for security reasons. Smiling and in good spirits, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that we are quickly advancing toward peace. Camacho Solis said that during the peace talks in Chiapas the proposals presented by the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] and the Indian groups will be honored because the dialogue has political foundations. [sentence as heard] [Begin Camacho Solis recording] We have agreed on the date for the peace talks. Next Sunday, the movement of delegates will begin. Bishop Samuel Ruiz and I will be traveling Sunday morning to the various areas where there is an EZLN presence, and will be accompanying the delegates to the city in Chiapas State where talks for peace and reconciliation will begin the following day at 1100. We all want to begin real negotiations. The peace talks can be one of two things: one, simply an opportunity to report problems or present political programs; the other, an opportunity to express views regarding the situation in Chiapas and the country, and also to advance in negotiations that could eventually lead to the end of hostilities, and hence to peace and reconciliation. We must all choose between those two options: Do we want this simply to be a forum to report problems, or do we want to make this an opportunity to build peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and in the country. I am totally committed to the second option. I have come here and will go to the forum to listen and to learn. We have all learned a lot. We will also go to the talks with the clear purpose of facilitating the end of hostilities. In other words, the issue here is that we could not attain peace if someone tried to force the EZLN into accepting a solution that is not dignified. That is not the way to build peace. The only possibility is respecting the proposals, listen to them, discuss them, propose other things. The position I will present will be the one I perceive as best for the interests of the Mexican State, not of part of the administration. It must reflect the various interests and opinions, as well as the concerns, reports, and proposals that the EZLN will present toward a possible political agreement that can be built as time permits. There are two options: either we simply meet to mention our problems, or we meet to sign a peace agreement. I have perceived that the EZLN, which at the beginning was probably not ready for a change under the political conditions that prevailed after 10 January, today has shown us through decisions like the ones it adopted yesterday that it is interested in coming to the negotiating table not only to present its political positions, but also to open the possibility of a real dialogue that can lead to dignified peace.
