FR940505-0-00036 FR940505-0-00009 Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) should be removed, 3,500 CSN should be replaced by 4,500 CSN, and 3,000 CSN should be replaced by 3,500 CSN to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals, but the proposed CSN changes are not consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer. The results of this analysis suggest that 3,500 CSN can be changed to 4,000 CSN; however, 3,000 CSN can not be changed. This final rule has been revised accordingly. Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(4)(iii) should be replaced by 1,000 CIS after the effective date of this AD, and 3,000 CSN should be replaced by 3,500 CSN to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals, but the proposed CSN change is not consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer. The results of this analysis suggest that 3,000 CSN can not be changed. This final rule has been revised accordingly. One commenter states that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) should be removed, and 4,500 CSN should be replaced by 6,000 CSN to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals, but the proposed CSN change is not consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer. The results of this analysis suggest that 4,500 CSN can be changed to 5,400 CSN. The final rule has been revised accordingly. One commenter states that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(5)(iii) should be replaced by 2,000 CIS after the effective date of this AD to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals, but the proposed CIS is not consistent with the results of this failure analysis performed by the manufacturer. The results of this analysis suggest that 1,400 CIS is appropriate. This final rule has been revised accordingly. Although no comments were received regarding compliance paragraphs (b)(1) to (b)(5), the FAA has changed these paragraphs to be consistent with the corresponding paragraphs in paragraph (a) of this final rule. The economic analysis section of the proposed rule assumed that all inspected disks would require replacement. The manufacturer has informed the FAA that this assumption is overly conservative based on analysis and inspection results to date, and that only approximately 2% of the inspected disks will require replacement. The 2% figure translates to approximately 10 disks installed on aircraft of U.S. registry. The economic analysis section of this final rule has been revised accordingly. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 650 GE CF6&hyph;6/&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 500 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 108 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $77,314 per engine. Based on these figures, and assuming that 10 of the inspected disks will require replacement, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,743,140. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
