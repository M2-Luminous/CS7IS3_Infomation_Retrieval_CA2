Prior to this war exercise, fighter bombers, pursuit-assault planes, and electronic jamming planes took off from U.S. military bases in the Pacific and flew to bases of the U.S. Air Force occupying South Korea. This war exercise was conducted in the skies over Oeyon Island and Yongwol. Squadrons based in overseas U.S. bases, various fighter bombers, assault planes, observation planes, and reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Air Force occupying South Korea, and those of the puppet Air Force were massively mobilized in this exercise. Timed to coincide with this war exercise, KC-135 refueling planes took off from overseas U.S. bases, prowled about in the skies over Kwangju and Chungju, and refueled fighters which were running amok in the war exercise for a war of Northward invasion. That day, approximately 20 500-MD armed helicopters flew to areas in Pochon, Yonchon, and Chorwon of Kangwon Province of South Korea, which are close to the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ], frantically launched midair firepower strikes, and supported ground attacks. On the same day, the South Korean puppets deployed tanks and large- caliber artillery groups of the puppet Armed Forces to Paengnyong-ri and Chuhyon-ri of Paju County, Kyonggi Province and, later, moved approximately 300 armed bandits to Chungsu-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea. In addition, 105-mm artillery units of the puppet Armed Forces took up combat positions in Songok-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province; Sangsa-ri and Kangsan-ri, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea; and Chomwon-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province and fired approximately 100 rounds of cannon to areas close to the DMZ along the Military Demarcation Line. The exercise commotions for a war of Northward invasion by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are a deliberate provocation maneuver to aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula.
