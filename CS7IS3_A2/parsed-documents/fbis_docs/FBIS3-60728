The Chernobyl catastrophe was preceded by a similar accident in Chelyabinsk Oblast Kyshtym where the Soviet atomic bomb was being constructed. Radioactive waste was dumped in a lake near the town, and that caused an explosion. Has anybody ever analyzed why this happened? I spent many years working at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of Electrodynamics and I am an expert in the field of thermodiffusion. The fourth block ``sarcophagus'' consists of nuclear fuel residue covered with a thick layer of concrete. All in all, about 1,000 tonnes of uranium and plutonium are stored at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant [AES], including fuel for operating reactors and radioactive waste. Without going into detail, I want to say that on 30 December 1992, I came to the conclusion that a terrible thermonuclear explosion is inevitable at the fourth block. The explosion will totally destroy Ukraine and a larger part of Europe. I came to this conclusion after analyzing thermodiffusion processes recently discovered by me and still unknown to the public. The essence of the discovery is this: Plutonium that is a component of the solid radioactive alloy of the fourth reactor (both earlier produced and the new one created by the disintegration of uranium), influenced by the heat emitted in the course of the process, is moving very slowly to certain points of the block and is accumulating at these points. As a result of this diffusion process, the amount of plutonium in one of these points may exceed the critical mass and lead to a nuclear explosion. It is impossible to reverse this process. I am assured that the explosion at the nuclear dump near Chelyabinsk was caused by the same factors, although a much smaller amount of uranium was involved. I think that Japanese thermodiffusionists can confirm my conclusions. These people are working on creating extra-large integrated microchips, and are currently the most qualified experts in the field of thermodiffusion in the world. I did not calculate the possible date of a new explosion at Chernobyl AES. However, I want to emphasize once again that an explosion is inevitable. There is no chance to avoid a catastrophe. However, I believe that a solution can be found if we do not waste time. No new ``sarcophagus'' should be constructed. The ``green meadow'' version must be urgently implemented at the AES. This is the only way to avoid a disaster. I have drafted a number of technical measures regarding this version. Unfortunately, my appeals to high officials in Ukraine brought only a partial result -- the version was accepted but it will be carried out within a five year period. The process for plutonium to exceed the critical mass will hardly wait that long. I have turned to the press to attract public attention to this issue and demand its expeditious resolution. Time will not wait!
