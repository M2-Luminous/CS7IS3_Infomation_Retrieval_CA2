During the last round of negotiations on March 1-2 at Lohusalu resort near Tallinn, Russia withdraw its earlier commitment to pull out its forces by August 31, 1994 and neglected to offer another date for negotiations. Yesterday the Foreign Ministry of Estonia announced that Estonia had accepted Russia's offer to resume negotiations despite "numerous and often vague statements from the Russian part on breaking off the negotiations". Svirin said that at the last round of negotiations "new, unexpected moments came up" and the Russian side had to think the situation over" to work out their position. [quotation marks as received] The next round will be held in Moscow on April 5-6. Commenting on the possible Estonian-Russian summit, Svirin said that it was extremely important, but declined to enlarge on the topic, saying only that it had to be prepared very thoroughly in order it to be "epochal" in the difficult relations between Estonia and Russia.
