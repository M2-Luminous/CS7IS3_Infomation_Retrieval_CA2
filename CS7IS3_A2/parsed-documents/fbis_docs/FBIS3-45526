Today's enterprise system--consisting mainly of shareholding corporations--is seen as a good way to invigorate enterprises and reform most of the country's large and medium-sized State-owned enterprises. But according to Lin Yifu, an economist with the Development and Research Centre of the State Council, a modern corporate system is not enough to ensure enterprise inefficiency. "Fair competition is the most important factor in improving enterprise efficiency, no matter what system is adopted," Lin said in an interview with China Daily. "Many shareholding corporations in developed countries run badly or even go bankrupt, while many State-owned enterprises, such as Singapore Airlines and the Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, are well operated," Lin said. In both shareholding corporations and these State-owned enterprises, management and ownership is separate. Profits Managers of shareholding corporations, who receive salaries but not stock bonuses, might be more concerned with increasing their own income than earning more profits for shareholders. Managers of State-owned enterprises might have a similar intention. Some of them might even sacrifice enterprise benefits for higher personal incomes. It is also impossible for shareholders (or the State) to closely monitor managers daily. This problem can only be solved through market competition, Lin said. Market competition will force managers to be faithful and diligent, lest they lose money. Owners of poorly run enterprises (shareholders or the State) will fire managers and appoint more competent people. For Chinese enterprises, competition has not been fair, Lin said, since reforms on prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates have lagged behind enterprise reform. These levers are still controlled by the State as well. Thus enterprises are still heavily affected by set prices and government interference in the market place. China began enterprise reform so as to give enterprises more decision-making power and a larger share of profits. The measures were efficient in the short term, but in the long-term they do not address the heart of the problem. Currently about two-thirds of State-owned enterprises are running at a loss. What's more serious, State-owned firms have lost money because of high salaries and welfare payments to managers and employees. The government has had difficulty in stopping this not only because of enterprises' enlarged power, but also because of a lack of self-restraint and appropriate supervision mechanisms, Lin said. Even if enterprises are transformed into shareholding corporations, these practices may continue if firms are still kept afloat by the State and not forced to deal with the threat of bankruptcy. Moreover, State-owned assets may still be siphoned off unless firms are forced to deal with market forces. To force enterprises to exercise self-restraint and become more efficient, they must be left to survive on their own in the market economy, Lin said. Furthermore he said, reforms in finance, taxation and the banking system should be carried out. Since the Party's Third Plenary Session of the 14th National Congress last October, such reforms have been strengthened. And it is expected huge steps will be made in these reforms this year. Labour Since China is short of capital but has an abundant labour force, labour-intensive light industries can survive and develop more easily than heavy industry. So Lin said that the government should put less control on prices to guarantee funds needed for development. The development of light industries can also accumulate funds to help develop heavy industry. Thus, China should put more emphasis on the development of light industry and cut the number of firms in heavy industry, Lin said. As for existing heavy industrial enterprises, large- and medium-sized ones that are vital to the country's economy should be maintained while small ones can be sold or leased to individuals, or merged with other enterprises. The enterprises that are kept--many of which are incapable of surviving on their own--should be supported by the State. To prevent additional losses, a responsibility system could be adopted, Lin said. Firms should be given a certain amount of leeway, but if their losses are too great the State should fine or fire the managers. Enterprises with good performances should be rewarded and allowed to retain their profits. With the development of light industry and the service sector, the demand for heavy industry commodities will increase. The country's capital will become more abundant and enterprises will be able to become autonomous and survive without government support.
