FBIS4-68377 "jpusr047___94039" FBIS-USR-94-047 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 15 April 1994 RUSSIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS News From St Petersburg News From St Petersburg Independent TV Network Director Interviewed 944F0582B St. Petersburg NEVSKOYE VREMYA in Russian 15 Apr 94 p 1 944F0582B St. Petersburg NEVSKOYE VREMYA Russian CSO [Interview with Igor Malashenko, general director of the NTV television company, by Andrey Yevdokimov under the rubric "First Hand"; date not given: "We Do Not Get Involved in Conspiracies"] [Text] Moscow-St. Petersburg --[Yevdokimov] Did you know that the leaders of St. Petersburg TV are explaining the "stirring up of scandal around St. Petersburg TV and its leaders as a unique kind of 'smoke screen' for large-scale operations for commercial structures to seize television broadcasting networks from NTV." They are saying that NTV is backed by Israeli capital and the abbreviation NTV, which is well known to the viewers, means nothing other than "Non-Russian Television." [Malashenko] I cannot say that we were very disturbed by Viktor Sergeyevich Pravdyuk's latest statements against us. They are more a characterization of him personally. If he allows himself to use as arguments things such as reproaches for "non-Russian" origin and the domination of Israeli capital, I can only express my amazement. That people who are proud of their impeccable credentials as democrats end up with such extraordinary ease among those who fan the flames of hysteria regarding the so-called worldwide Jewish conspiracy. Incidentally, Mr. Pravdyuk's patron, Mikhail Nikiforovich Poltoranin, has also taken to making such statements recently. [Yevdokimov] Has NTV made any attempt to seize the television broadcasting network of Channel 5? [Malashenko] As you know, NTV covers the network of Channel 4. And we have no intention of taking any network away from other television companies. I will tell you that quite definitely. Although I must note that the problem is much more complicated than it might seem at first glance. In Russia there is a complex system of radio relay lines, transmitters, and various auxiliary services that support television broadcasting. And no one television company may have any exclusive, fixed rights to them. I cannot deny that two oblasts came to us requesting assistance in switching their broadcasting from St. Petersburg's Channel 5 to NTV's Channel 4. The reason is that St. Petersburg TV is not attractive enough and there is delay in paying for the services of the communications workers. We made no decision regarding these requests and we will not do anything without notifying the Ministry of Communications, the Rostelekom joint-stock company, and other organizations. As for the GTRK [State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company] St. Petersburg..., they, of course, have problems of their own. But the company's leaders are deeply deceived if they think that these problems can be resolved by administrative pressure. I wish to emphasize that NTV is not involved in any conspiracies and in general we have too many problems of our own to think too frequently about the leadership of St. Petersburg television. [Yevdokimov] Please explain the causes of the conflict related to the rental of Russian films on our television... [Malashenko] We buy the rights to rent Russian and foreign films strictly in keeping with copyright legislation. The corresponding agreements stipulate the obligations of the holders of these rights to respond to all claims right down to a judicial investigation. I must say that I first learned from you that St. Petersburg TV has certain agreements for films that we show. I will take the liberty of questioning that--I am too familiar with the leasing practice of past years, when nobody at all was interested in the observance of copyrights. [Yevdokimov] But there is a generally accepted practice for resolving such disputes. Why can everything not be taken care of peacefully? [Malashenko] We have sent a letter about this to St. Petersburg and it contained similar proposals. But we have received no answer. Therefore we intend to go to court and resolve the dispute by purely legal methods. [Yevdokimov] Can you confirm or deny the version that says that one of the reasons for the scandal surrounding St. Petersburg television and its leaders is the backroom activity at NTV? [Malashenko] That is absolute baloney! You can use whatever epithets you like. I think the same mentality is at the bottom of these absurd accusations. If you believe in an immense, worldwide conspiracy against the duped people of Russia, there absolutely must be other, smaller conspiracies as well. It is very convenient to use such concepts to explain various mishaps and personal squabbles--the guilty parties are always at hand.
