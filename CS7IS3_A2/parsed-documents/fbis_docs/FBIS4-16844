Has anything changed since then? The answer is in the headline of this piece. As a participant in the adoption of the state budget for a fourth time through the voters' will I cannot fail to see how time after time its content is emasculated and the budget process is degraded and turned into a mockery. It makes sense to begin the discussion of the 1994 budget with certain results. The official account of the previous year has not been submitted by the government and no wonder -- there is little comfort in it. But there are some unofficial statistics, which are: Fall in industrial production: Prediction in the president's message: 7 percent; Actual figure for the year: 16.2 percent. Rise in Prices: Prediction in the president's message: Threefold; Actual figure for the year: Tenfold. Federal Budget Deficit (as a percentage of GDP): Prediction in the president's message: 5 percent; Actual figure for the year: 10.6 percent. According to the main socioeconomic indicators, this is a two- to three-fold discrepancy! Can that really be true? Yes, it can. The new program presented by the government looks no more realistic either. The prediction for the fall in production in 1994 is around 8 percent. But in the first quarter alone it was 25 percent and over the year, according to the specialists' estimates, it could be at a level of 30 percent. The budget has been calculated on the basis of an inflation rate of 490-510 percent (whereas in fact it was 730 percent in the first quarter). There is a further increase in taxes built into the budget: a 6 percent increase in profit tax, 3 percent in value-added tax, 2 percent in property tax, and so forth. The government intends to use the taxation system to gather into the budget a sum equal to 16.6 percent of GDP. But last year it managed to collect only 10.6 perecent of GDP and in the first quarter of this year the figure was even less -- 8 percent. So there you have it, the first result of the move toward the "market": Over 90 percent of created public wealth is bypassing the budget and being distributed outside state control. Have you felt the difference? It is obvious to the naked eye that the economic slump is assuming the character of chronic stagnation: State investments in the development of the economy are a token sum in terms of the budget -- around 2 percent of GDP -- and have fallen even when compared with last year's clearly understated level. The agrarian sector, science, education, and culture are being underfunded. While budget spending is rising by an average of fivefold, spending on social programs is rising by 4.1 times.... On the other hand, spending on the state apparatus is rising eightfold! Gaping holes are appearing in the revenue section of the budget, too. The planned transition from a voucher-based privatization to cash is being accompanied by...a sharp reduction in that item of revenue. In that case, where will the funds go? Into the pockets of brazen privatizers? It will cost hundreds of billions of rubles to maintain the tax benefits granted by the president and the government to individual, selected "favorites," in crude violation of the existing legislation. The conclusion: This discredited economic course is continuing in an even clearer and more overt form. Let us ask ourselves: Can such a budget be the basis of social accord? The budget is not just a mirror of the economy but a continuation of policy. Despite all the talk about the significance and importance of the budget, neither the president nor the chairman of the government turned up for the discussion of it. Acting Foreign Minister Dubinin "carried the can" for them all. The document which bears the solemn title "the budget" can only be called a budget if you really stretch a point: It contains no account of the execution of the budget for 1992 or preliminary results of the execution of the budget in 1993, it does not offer indicators forecasting the development of the economy in 1994, it has no list of state targeted programs, there is no explanation of the majority of budget items.... Essentially it is not a budget at all but a set of departmental items of expenditure linked by a single demand that unites them all: "Give us the money and clear off!" One can understand that there is no money in the state today, and that the threadbare Russian budget cannot satisfy everyone's needs. What is harder to understand is why the government cannot present even this budget on time? Why it is presented in an incomplete form without accounting documents and each time using a new methodology which prevents a comparison with the previous year's results? However, there is a most direct link between the first and second points: The present political leadership, which has led the country into the quagmire of the economic crisis, cannot stand being monitored and has no intention of answering to anyone, least of all to the deputies. You will not give us the money? We will take it without asking. And if you demand an account -- we will mislead you. And we will forbid you in the future from interfering in the executive's affairs. Well, what about the Duma? Two opposing standpoints clashed at the Duma session during the discussion of the budget: "Reject the budget and send it back to the government for revision," and "adopt the budget on first reading." I consider the former option correct. But in present conditions, when the Duma has been cut off from the mass media, it will find it difficult even to convey its view to the people, let alone explain it. And, conversely, it is very easy to become a target for those who are seeking scapegoats for their own mistakes (remember how last year the Supreme Soviet was castigated for the budget). That is why they could have accepted the moderate compromise proposed by the Duma's Budget and Finance Committee: "To consider the budget presented." But such a compromise did not suit the government -- it needed a "more soothing" formula. So the Duma committees headed by the chairman of the chamber looked for one. Eventually they found one: The budget is totally unsuitable and needs a fundamental revision but "is adopted as a basis." There was laughter and irritation: "Givi is sick, come and bury him," was how one Duma wag commented on the decision adopted. However, no verbal trickery can hide the unpleasant fact that Russia does not have a budget and is not going to get one in the near future. The government cannot produce one, the Duma is in no position to do so.... [passage omitted]
