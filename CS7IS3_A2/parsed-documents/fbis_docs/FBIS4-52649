Korean Puppets' Intrigue To Kidnap DPRK Lumbermen Denounced" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- If the South Korean rulers continue attempting to kidnap our lumbermen working in the far east of Russia, they will drink a bitter cup, warned the Ministry of Forestry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement today. The statement reads: On April 9, through a statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of Forestry, we made clear our principled stand toward the criminal intrigues of the South Korean rulers to kidnap our timber fellers working in the far east of Russia. The South Korean puppets, however, continue behaving arrogantly, ignoring our logical warning. According to recent reports from South Korea, the puppets, in an effort to make the kidnapping plot more organised, impudently "adopted" what they call "principle of allowing exile" at the "Unification and Security Policy Coordinating meeting" on April 15 and formed even a "working measure committee" on May 4 and are blaring that they will work out "comprehensive measures" for kidnapping our timber fellers. On the other hand, they have sent agents of the "Security Planning Board" and riff-raffs to various areas of the far east of Russia under various names for an operation to allure and kidnap our workers. This indicates that the kidnapping intrigues of the South Korean puppets have already entered a practical stage and the North-South confrontation aggravated by them is being expanded to the soil of Russia. The Ministry of Forestry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea bitterly denounces the intrigues of the South Korean puppets which are getting more desperate, branding them as an open challenge to our Republic, an anti-humanitarian act encroaching upon the dignity of our forestry workers and an act intended to undermine the traditional friendship between the Korean and Russian peoples. These intrigues of the South Korean puppets have become a serious matter related to the prospect of the North-South relations and the dignity of the nation. If they persist in their operation to kidnap our dignified workers by misrepresenting facts, in defiance of our reasonable warning, they will drink a bitter cup. Our lumbermen working in the far east of Russia are now getting very angry at their kidnapping operation. They are resolved to deal a hard blow at the South Korean puppets who are foolish enough to persistently try to make them defect to South Korea. If a mishap occurs to one of them, our lumbermen will make a decisive reprisal on the South Korean puppets. Their resolution is an entirely legitimate one for defending their dignity and honor. If the South Korean puppets continue attempting to kidnap fellow countrymen and perpetrating provocations causing national shame in an alien land in disregard of our patience, they will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom and the nation and history will pass a stern judgement on them. The South Korean puppets' plot to kidnap our lumbermen in the far east is an international crime to impair the traditional friendship between the Korean and Russian peoples and create unrest in the territories of Russia. Therefore, we consider that the Russian authorities must not allow the sinister acts of the South Korean puppets in the far east. We set store by the traditional friendship between the peoples of Korea and Russia and are actively striving to strengthen and develop it, and believe that the Russian authorities will ponder over our principled stand.
