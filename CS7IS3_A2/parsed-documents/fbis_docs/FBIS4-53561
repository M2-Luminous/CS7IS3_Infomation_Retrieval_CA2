"The ministry won't be adding anything extra onto the rises that were withheld this year," Futami said, dismissing speculation that expressway tolls and taxi fares could jump when the freeze ends. He said the hikes could be delayed from the planned Jan. 1 for political reasons, and that there could be another freeze if the economy still looks bad at that time. "A lifting of the freeze depends on an economic recovery. If the situation looks serious, we will be giving the matter further consideration," he said. The minister expressed caution toward exempting the fares of small regional taxi companies from the hike freeze this year. "People could be put off from using taxis, (if such companies are allowed to raise their fares)," he said.
