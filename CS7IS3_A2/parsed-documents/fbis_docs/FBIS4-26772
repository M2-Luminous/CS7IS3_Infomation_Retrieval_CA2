For instance, the region's 30 poor counties, several industrial bases, and two major grain-production bases have been hit by flooding and waterlogging. By 21 June, 13 out of 14 prefectures and cities and 67 out of 86 counties and county-level cities in the region had been hit by flooding and waterlogging, accounting for 77.9 percent of the region's total. In consequence, some 13.93 million people had suffered from flooding and waterlogging, accounting for 31 percent of the region's total. Preliminary statistics show that the region's flooding and waterlogging calamities have left some 224 people dead and have caused economic losses worth some 7.274 billion yuan. Cheng Kejie noted: Since being hit by flooding and waterlogging, the region's troops and people have actively thrown themselves into the flood-resistance and disaster-relief struggle. The CPC Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission have shown great concern for the region's afflicted areas. General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have made personal phone calls to the region to ask about the situation. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua has led a central work team to inspect the region's afflicted areas. In additiohn, the principal regional party and and government leaders have led cadres to the region's flood-resistance forefront, where they have dealt with a large number of emergencies. The cadres at all levels, as well as people in the afflicted areas in the region have been working hard, day and night, waging a tenacious struggle against the floods and braving all sorts of difficulties. Some 24,000 locally stationed People's Liberation Army [PLA] officers and soldiers have taken part in the region's flood-resistance struggle, with the result that many heroes and heroic deeds have emerged in the course of dealing with emergencies and providing disaster relief. Cheng Kejie noted: Thanks to the week-long flood-resistance and disaster-relief work, the situation in the afflicted areas has stabilized and returned to normal. After listening to the region's flood-resistance work report, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua made an important speech in which he discussed Guangxi's flood-resistance work. First and foremost, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission, Zou Jiahua extended cordial greetings to the region's party, government, and military leaders at all levels; the locally stationed PLA officers and soldiers taking part in the region's flood-resistance and disaster-relief work; and the broad masses of people in the afflicted areas. He said: Guangxi has successfully waged a struggle against flooding and has scored excellent results in this regard. While carrying on the flood-resistance struggle in the future, Guangxi should continue to carry forward the spirit of working hard and fearing no hardships; strengthen confidence; brace up; enhance solidarity; and rely on the party, government, people's troops, and broad masses of the people in tiding over difficulties and building the urban and rural areas into better places than before the flood disaster. Speaking of specific antiflood measures, Zou Jiahua pointed out: At most, we should strive, first of all, to protect people's lives and property, rescue people besieged by the flood, take precautions against future floods, heighten vigilance, and never slacken our efforts against natural calamities. As this year's flood season has just begun, Guangxi probably will witness more floods over the next two months. In view of this situation, we should make proper arrangements for people's livelihood; organize people to resume production by relying on themselves; mobilize people, households, and villages to help each other, urban areas to help rural areas, and unaffected areas to help afflicted areas; and carry out meticulous and down-to-earth work to this end. Comrade Zou Jiahua stated: The central work teams are formed by comrades in charge of various central ministries and commissions. The central organs concerned should make unreserved efforts to assist and contribute to Guangxi's flood-resistance and disaster-relief work. He urged the relevant central organs to take the initiative to actively and unreservedly support Guangxi's flood-resistance struggle by enhancing coordination among themselves. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua concluded his speech by saying: I am fully confident that with the concern of the CPC Central Committee and State Council and the assistance of the locally stationed PLA troops, and under the direct leadership of the regional party and government leaders, the Guangxi people of all nationalities will be able to tide over all sorts of difficulties and bring their flood-resistance struggle to a successful end. Comrades in charge of the relevant State Council departments also delivered speeches at the report meeting. It has been learned that on the afternoon of 23 June, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and his entourage left Nanning on board a special plane.
