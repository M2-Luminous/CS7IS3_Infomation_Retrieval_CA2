Boris Zolotukhin, who spoke next, informed the people's deputies of a coordinated decision by leaders of deputies' associations to hold a recess in the plenary sessions of the Duma to allow for the work of factions and deputies' groups. During the recess "the nominations for and the number of Duma deputy chairmen are to be agreed upon, as well as the nominations for the posts of heads of State Duma committees." The composition of the Duma Credentials Commission was also approved before the recess. The commission must now elect its own head.
