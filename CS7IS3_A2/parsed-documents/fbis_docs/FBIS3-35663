He graduated from the Faculty of Art at the Art and Theatrical Institute in Yerevan. He worked in the Department for CIS Countries in the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since January 1993, he has been representing the interests of Armenia in Georgia. [Abgarova]Sir, what is the specific nature of your work in Georgia? [Khachatryan] The fact that, until recently, we were part of the same state is the first thing that leaves its mark on diplomatic relations between our states. Therefore, we have very many similar problems that are of an objective nature. At the same time, it is easy for me to work in Georgia because our peoples are tied by ancient and close bonds of friendship. My one aim is to strengthen those constructive relations that already exist. Unfortunately, the events of recent years have had an effect on these relations. One cannot forget the reaction of Armenians living in Georgia to, let us say, the incorrect policy conducted between one and one-half and two years ago by the former authorities in Georgia regarding all national minorities and Armenians in particular. I am happy that the policy of justice has emerged victorious. The recent measures aimed at restoring order in the Dmanisskiy and Marneulskiy rayons are clear confirmation of this. [Abgarova]Traditional relations between our states were built on a mutually beneficial basis. How do matters stand today? [Khachatryan] Yes, common sense and a realistic policy have always determined our relations with Georgia. After all, all Armenia's vital communications pass through the territory of Georgia and this is how all cargoes of strategic importance for us are transported. Although there are, of course, problems -- I have in mind the explosions along the gas pipelines and the railroad -- these can be resolved. Georgia's policy at this stage makes us hope for the better. We hope that Georgia's entry into the CIS will create that basis that, in future, will enable us to resolve all problems between our states. As regards economic relations between our countries, they bear a clear interstate character: The transportation of goods through the territory of Georgia is paid for by Armenia according to universally accepted prices. Of course, the shortage of electric power in Georgia is also having an effect on our lives. However, I repeat that all these problems can be resolved. All Armenia's potential can be useful for Georgia. First and foremost, this concerns shipments to and from Iran and Turkey. The railroad to Turkey runs through Armenia. [Abgarova]How do you view the problem of the resolution of the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia? [Khachatryan] First of all, I would not like to draw parallels between these conflicts. I have been in Abkhazia several times and I have many friends there. Therefore, I cannot view those events wholly as an impartial observer. Unlike in Abkhazia where autonomy existed in the full sense of this word and where the Abkhazian population, despite being in the minority, was not oppressed in any way, the Armenian people in Nagorno-Karabakh, who form the overwhelming majority of the population, were subjected to terrible suppression. There were no contradictions in Abkhazia that could not have been resolved and, in general, I believe that this conflict was inflated from the start and was somewhat artificial. I believe that this conflict can only be resolved by peaceful means and this is precisely what will happen. The most important thing in Nagorno- Karabakh at the moment is a cease-fire and a halt to the bloodshed. Nagorno-Karabakh's status will be determined by Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia will sign any document in this respect that will suit both sides equally. Of course, both sides will have to seek a compromise solution.
