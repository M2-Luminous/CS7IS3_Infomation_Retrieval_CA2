Zieleniec on 14 May in Prague in a speech delivered at an international conference called "Europe and Us." Zieleniec pointed out that, while the danger in the East had previously been the adhesive of West European integration, the European Union [EU] must now look painstakingly for a firm integrating vision. He described the influence of the crisis of the so-called social state, which put down roots in Western Europe, as a major problem for European integration. The effect of this crisis has been that more and more discussion is being devoted to quotas or subsidies than to the political substance of Europe. "We think more about what divides us than about what unites us," said the minister with regard to the EU and its operation. In an exchange of views with German Social Democratic Deputy Glotz, Zieleniec expressed the opinion that Czech-German relations are better than they were following the CSFR's breakup last January. Glotz, on the other hand, thinks that these relations are worse than they were two or three years ago. The Czech Republic is now in many respects better prepared to enter the EU than the EU is to admit it, said Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony, at the conference. According to him, Germany will fully support the Czech Republic's entry into the Union, not only by voting for it but also by means of real cooperation and support for the Czech economy. In the interest of creating a genuinely integrated Europe, the EU states must put an end to manifestations of rampant egoism, said Austrian Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek at the conference. "We do not have enough common European values. We lack a European spirit," he said in the debate. The conference, held from 13 to 15 May, was attended by important European political figures.
