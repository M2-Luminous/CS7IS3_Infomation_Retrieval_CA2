Cerbello, who gave an interview following a telephone conversation with Ruben Zamora, candidate for the leftist coalition which also includes the FMLN, expressed his confidence that a second round will be necessary to elect a president because none of the candidates have won an absolute majority. Sergio Cerbello, who is in Madrid at the invitation of the Spanish United Left coalition (led by the Spanish Communist Party), expressed surprise for victory statements made by ARENA, the official party, since the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has not released definitive results yet. In light of the high abstentionism rate registered during the elections -- approximately 47 percent -- Cerbello said "it was the same as other elections held in the past ten years." Therefore, both the left and the right should concede that "they have not been able to motivate the people to vote." Regarding leftist candidate Ruben Zamora's chances vis-a-vis ARENA candidate Armando Calderon in a possible runoff for the presidency, Cerbello said that "it all depends on the Christian Democracy Party [PDC]. The PDC representative in Europe has guaranteed me that the PDC will support Ruben Zamora, but they cannot guarantee people will comply with the party's instructions." Cerbello announced that if the need for a second round is confirmed, Julio Anguita, leader of the Spanish United Left coalition, will travel to El Salvador to support Ruben Zamora in his race for the presidency.
