The announcement was made on Wednesday by Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin after talks with his Tajik counterpart Abdujalil Samadov. According to Samadov, Tajikistan's intentions are confirmed by a preliminary understanding with Russia on the unification of monetary systems as well as the agreement he signed in Moscow after the talks on an 80 Bn ruble Russian loan to his country. However, Chernomyrdin said that one should not simplify the complex and lengthy process of forming an economic union on which CIS members have agreed, as it is only a framework agreement which provides for the signing of bilateral treaties. The agreement with Belarus, for example, was under work for eight months and required the drafting of over 30 legal documents. This together with the difficulties accompanying the growth of the CIS only go to prove that generally the economic union belongs to the future. The prime-minister said that Kazakhstan intended to be the first one to sign such an agreement. But now that President Nursultan Nazarbayev has suggested forming a Eurasian union the contents and possibilities of which are so far vague, it is difficult to say anything about his plans concerning the economic union. The formation of an economic union does not have the purpose of trampling on the sovereignty of any third party, Chernomyrdin declared. He strongly opposed attempts to accuse Russia of having imperial ambitions and trying to subjugate former Soviet republics. Chernomyrdin stressed that economic integration with Tajikistan will largely depend on the settlement of the political situation in that Central Asian country. IF Note: Talks are currently under way in Moscow between the Tajik government and opposition. According to sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry, the two sides have made considerable progress. They agreed to sign a joint statement expressing readiness to work for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Russian diplomats think that even though the document is of general nature it can be viewed as an impressive step to normalize the situation in and around Tajikistan.
