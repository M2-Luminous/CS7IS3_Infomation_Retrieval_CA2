FR940913-2-00014 FR940913-2-00008 [A&hyph;475&hyph;813] Correction of Ministerial Errors in Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination: Stainless Steel Bar From Italy Agency: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: V. Irene Darzenta or Katherine Johnson, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;6320 or (202) 482&hyph;4929, respectively. Amended Preliminary Determination In accordance with section 733(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), on July 28, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) made its preliminary determination that stainless steel bar (SSB) from Italy was being sold at less than fair value (59 FR 39736, August 4, 1994). On August 3 and 4, 1994, we disclosed the calculations performed in our preliminary determination to counsel for respondent Acciaierie Valbruna S.r.l. (Valbruna) and petitioners, respectively, pursuant to their requests. On August 10, 1994, and August 11, 1994, we received timely submissions from Valbruna and petitioners, respectively, alleging ministerial errors in the Department's preliminary determination calculations. (For specific details of these allegations and our analysis of them, see Memorandum from David L. Binder to Richard W. Moreland dated August 29, 1994.) Respondent claimed that the Department: (1) Incorrectly added to the home market gross unit prices certain freight charges associated with one of their warehouses that should have been deducted; (2) did not convert home market indirect selling expenses and commissions to the appropriate unit of measure in its margin analysis; and (3) incorrectly calculated the impact of the value added tax (VAT) on the home market indirect selling expense offset (ESP offset) by adding the VAT adjustment relevant to the ESP offset to FMV, rather than deducting it. Petitioners claimed that the Department: (1) Incorrectly calculated a differences-in-merchandise (difmer) adjustment for U.S. sales with identical home market product matches; (2) incorrectly added the home market freight expenses associated with one of Valbruna's warehouses to the home market gross unit prices in testing whether Valbruna's related party sales prices were at arm's-length; (3) did not convert home market indirect selling expenses and commissions to the appropriate unit of measurement in calculating the commission offset and ESP offset caps; and (4) incorrectly calculated the VAT tax impact on ESP sales. We agree that the errors alleged by the parties are ministerial errors. These errors, taken together, will constitute a significant ministerial error within the meaning of the Department's proposed regulation regarding preliminary determinations, in that their correction will result in a difference between a dumping margin of de minimis and a margin of greater than de minimis. See section 353.15(g)(4)(ii) of the Department's proposed regulations (57 FR 1131, January 10, 1992); See also Correction of Ministerial Errors in Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination: Sillcomanganese from Ukraine, 59 FR 37969, July 26, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with the procedures set forth in that proposed regulations, we are amending Valbruna's preliminary dumping margin. The corrected dumping margin for Valbruna is 0.44 percent and that for ``All Others'' is 6.13 percent. Suspension of Liquidation We are directing Customs Service to correct our request to suspend liquidation, made in accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, for all entries of SSB from Italy. We are directing the Customs Service to discontinue suspension of liquidation of all entries of SSB from Italy for Valbruna that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 4, 1994, the date of publication of our preliminary determination notice in the Federal Register . Because Valbruna's dumping margin is de minimis, and de minimis margins are not included within the all other rate, we are directing the Customs Service to correct the All Others rate so that it will only reflect the rate for Foroni S.p.A., the only other company investigated. We are instructing the U.S. Customs Service that any cash deposits or bonds collected with respect to SSB from Italy for Valbruna should be released or refunded. In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of SSB from Italy for Foroni S.p.A. and All Others that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 4, 1994, the date of publication of our preliminary determination notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the revised estimated preliminary dumping margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Original margin (percent) 1Revised margin (percent) Acciaierie Valbruna S.R.L 0.57 0.44% de minimis Foroni S.p.A 6.13 6.13 All Others 4.11 6.13 Notification of International Trade Commission (ITC) In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our amended preliminary determination. This amended preliminary determination is published in accordance with Section 733(f) of the Act. Dated: September 2, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
