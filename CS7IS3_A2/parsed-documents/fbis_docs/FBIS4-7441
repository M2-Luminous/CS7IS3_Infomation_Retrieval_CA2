We are drawing close to the moment when you gentlemen and lady deputies in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly -- in line with your rights and duties -- have to decide with your vote on what we, as representatives of the two peoples, agreed on and signed in Washington, which is contained in the draft constitution before you for adoption. I have no doubt that today you will -- as individuals and as delegations of the Croatian and Bosniak peoples, or others -- give your vote and endorse our agreement. I share the hopes and convictions of all of you that -- after we adopt the constitution, which is to take effect tonight at 2400 -- we will start to implement it. Then your decision of today, and I have said that I am convinced that you will endorse it, will not only be a solemn act but also a historic moment, and you have the honor to be historic participants in this act. Both during the signing and the coordination of views concerning the contents of the constitution, I have stressed -- and I have the right to say this in the name of the Croatian people -- that the Croatian people are ready and willing to implement fully the agreement contained in the draft constitution. I would also like to say -- and express my gratitude at the same time to the delegation of the Bosniak Muslim people -- that through the coordination of views, and after long and exhausting talks, we have as a result a draft constitution that I am sure will enable us to realize all the interests of the Bosniak and the Croatia people. For that reason I appeal to you and call on you today to cast your votes as deputies for the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the principles envisaged in the document.
