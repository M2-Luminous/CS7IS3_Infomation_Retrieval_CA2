The serological structure of the delta antigen is studied at the level of individual etiotopes. To this end, the effect of a change in the peptide chain and amino acid replacements on the antigen activity of the section 65-80 HDAg peptides with the serum from hepatitis delta patients from various CIS regions is examined by the enzyme immuno assay method (IFA). The findings reveal that 65-80 and 69-80 peptides react in the ELISA test with all individual preparation of anti-HDV-positive sera of patients with acute hepatitis delta. It is speculated that delta antigens contain a nonlinear antigen determinant or a set of highly immunogenic etiotopes between the 69th and 80th amino acid radicals. Thus, a special confirmation test may be constructed on the basis of the 65-80 synthetic peptide and its fragments for confirming the positive outcome of human serum studies obtained with the help of standard commercial ELISA diagnostic sets.
