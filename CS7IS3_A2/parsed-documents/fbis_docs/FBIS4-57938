The bombs were hurled by hooded individuals and one of them exploded near the headquarters of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) headed by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate in the 16 May elections who has made accusations of fraud. A police report said there were no casualties but several individuals, presumably responsible for the attacks, were arrested. The police and Army initiated a surveillance operation along the streets to prevent another attack. The political crisis erupted when the elections closed with the PRD making accusations of a "scandalous fraud" planned by the followers of President Joaquin Balaguer at the Central Electoral Board (JCE) computer center. Tourism representatives reported that numerous trips, especially from Europe, were suspended because of the news generated by the crisis facing the country. "The Dominican Republic political situation is a threat to the tourism industry which generates substantial revenues for the country," an important tourism businessman pointed out. The Dominican Republic is visited by 1.4 million tourists, who generate more than $130 million, the equivalent of 70 percent of its exportable goods.
