For 10 years the International Bank of Finance has been operating in Cuba and was the first to carry out this type of financial activity, the local press indicated. BICSA has a capital worth 1 million pesos payable in German Marks contributed by local corporations that make up the group of shareholders. The banking institution seeks to encourage foreign trade and to participate in the development of local enterprises to produce products and services targeted for export or sale in a freely convertible currency. BICSA president Jose Vaz explained that the bank's creation "is in response to the nation's policy aimed at multiplying banking activity to strengthen and develop it." Until a decade ago, such activity was concentrated in the National Bank of Cuba and the People's Savings Bank, Vaz recalled. He added that among BICSA's possible main customers are the industrial and trade companies, as well as persons who wish to use the checking account and security box services. According to the official, a network of correspondents in approximately 70 nations "will guarantee that the users can carry out their transactions in Canada, almost all of Latin America, Europe, the main Asian trade centers, and some African nations."
