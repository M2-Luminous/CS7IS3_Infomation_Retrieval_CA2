And while President Liamine Zeroual has stressed his determination to continue the "serious dialogue," it has been learned that General Khaled Nezzar, former member of the ruling Higher State Council [HSC], has returned to Algeria from Switzerland to supervise the presidency's course. And signs of a campaign the authorities intend to launch against the National Liberation Front [FLN] have emerged. [passage omitted] In a statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH received in Peshawar (Pakistan), the Armed Islamic Group claimed responsibility for the operation. It said that it had carried out the attack "after months of planning and training." And that this proves the group's "ability -- with Almighty God's help -- to strike wherever and whenever it wants, God willing." It also said that "the daring operation resulted in the freeing of about 1,000 prisoners among them more than 400 mujahidin sentenced to life imprisonment or death." [passage omitted] In the statement the group claimed responsibility for murdering Abdelkadir Alloul, commander of the operations zone in Oran. In a separate statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, the "amir" of the Armed Islamic Front (eastern district) attacked some Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leaders like Kamal Boukhadra and Mohamed Karar, criticizing their recent statements that armed action would be suspended if the authorities offer certain concessions. He also attacked Cheikhs Abdallah Jaballah (Ennahda movement) and Mahfoud Nahnah (HAMAS) and other advocates of dialogue. [passage omitted] It has been learned that military officials will be removed from their posts as a result of the jailbreak operation. More than one source has confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Security Director Tolba has resigned and that General Bachin [as transliterated] (former military security director) is a candidate for the security minister's post. Maj. Gen. Zeroual received Bachin some time ago. Well-informed sources have stressed to AL-HAYAH that their information indicates that an "all-out confrontation" between the authorities and the armed groups is not ruled out. The sources pointed out that the authorities are "under pressure" to adopt this option, of which Maj. Gen. Zeroual does not seem to approve, as he stressed in a speech addressed to the Algerian people on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr his determination to continue the "serious dialogue" with anyone that respects the Constitution. [passage omitted] AL-HAYAH has learned that unknown elements sneaked into the residences of five ministers and a former wali in al-Sunubar Club (northwest of the capital) and managed -- despite the tight security -- to enter their homes and leave threatening messages and a warning in the form of a slaughtered or suffocated animal (cat) inside the ministers' bedrooms. Meanwhile, AL-HAYAH has learned from sources close to the Interior Ministry that a plan is being prepared to hit the FLN, because it has not cooperated with the government. And it has been reported that some Algerian wilayas have begun to announce their breakaway from the FLN and urge "loyalty" to the state. Some sources expect the campaign against the FLN to be represented in the expulsion of about 400 employees belonging to the FLN from their posts in government institutions. At another level, information -- almost corroborated -- says that the HSC is still in power. And that it is still in control of the keys to power, and that Fadhil Saidi, architect of the HSC, who mediated between Gen. Khaled Nezzar and Gen. Liamine Zeroual, is still an influential party to the power "appointments." The information says that he was behind Ahmed Yahya's appointment as director of the president's office, and that he is now making new nominations. The information says that Khaled Nezzar has returned from Swtizerland to run the "presidency" closely, and that Ali Kafi, former HSC chairman, has not yet moved out of his residence and has gone back to lead the "Veterans Organization." Tidjani Haddam, member of the council, has become President Liamine Zeroual's "envoy." As for Ali Haroun, he is conducting his "business" from Paris. Redha Malek, member of the council and prime minister, maintains that political stability is represented in his government's remaining in power.
