FR941121-0-00045 FR941121-0-00003 Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;32&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9069; AD 94&hyph;23&hyph;07] Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes, that requires various modifications and inspections of the flight controls, doors, and horizontal stabilizers. This amendment is prompted by a recommendation by the Systems Review Task Force (SRTF) for accomplishment of certain modifications and inspections that will enhance the controllability of these airplanes in the unlikely event of flight control malfunction or failure. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure airplane survivability in the event of damage to fully powered flight control systems. DATES: Effective December 21, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Support Company, Field Support Department, Dept. 693, Zone 0755, 2251 Lake Park Drive, Smyrna, Georgia 30080. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, Suite 210C, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Atlanta, Georgia; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas Peters, Aerospace Engineer, Flight Test Branch, ACE&hyph;160A, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, Suite 210C, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Atlanta, Georgia 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;3915; fax (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on June 9, 1994 (59 FR 29745). That action proposed to require various modifications and inspections of the flight controls, doors, and horizontal stabilizers. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposed rule. One commenter suggests that reworking and changing the part number of the cross-tie interlock bungees on the servo of the stabilizer, as described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;27&hyph;280, should be considered terminating action for reworking the bungee, as described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;27&hyph;279. The FAA recognizes that accomplishment of the actions in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;27&hyph;280 is an acceptable means of compliance for accomplishment of the inspection and modification described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;27&hyph;279. The FAA finds that no change to the final rule is necessary, since this provision was included in NOTE 2 under paragraph (a) of the proposed rule. One commenter requests that the compliance time of four years, as specified in paragraph(a) of the proposal, be revised to coincide with parts availability. The commenter suggests a compliance time of four years after all required parts kits are available or five years after the effective date of the AD. The FAA does not concur. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered not only the degree of urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe condition, but the availability of required parts and the practical aspect of installing the required modifications within a maximum interval of time allowable for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. The FAA is not aware of any parts availability problem at this time and, therefore, assumes that an ample number of required parts will be available for modification of the U.S. fleet within the proposed compliance period. However, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of the final rule, the FAA may approve requests for adjustments to the compliance time if data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would provide an acceptable level of safety. The same commenter requests that the compliance time for accomplishment of Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;55&hyph;030 be extended. This commenter performs work in the area addressed by the service bulletin at heavy maintenance checks, which occur at intervals of 27,000 flight hours. The commenter suggests that even a five-year compliance time would be inadequate for accomplishment of this service bulletin. However, the commenter does not request a specific compliance time. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to extend the compliance time. The actions described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;55&hyph;030 should take only five work hours to complete. The FAA has determined that these actions can be accomplished during regularly scheduled maintenance visits (other than heavy maintenance checks) or inspection activities without having a significant adverse effect on airplane scheduling. However, paragraph (b) of the final rule does provide affected operators the opportunity to apply for an adjustment of the compliance time if data are presented to justify such an adjustment. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 236 Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 117 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 87 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts for certain modifications will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Required parts for certain other modifications will be minimal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $559,845 or $4,785 per airplane.
