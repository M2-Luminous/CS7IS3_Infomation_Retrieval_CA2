Decree-Law No. 149 establishes the "confiscation and appropriation by the Cuban State, without any right to compensation, of goods and income acquired by persons who have increased their assets through the black market or the illegal purchase or sale of goods and products. The legislation seeks to stop money hoarders, called macetas here (from the Spanish word mazo that means wad, referring to the wads they hoard by exploiting the shortage of goods and services caused by the economic crisis Cuba has been experiencing since early this decade). The measure is part of an economic reactivation plan that was outlined during an extraordinary meeting of the ANPP held last weekend. The plan also seeks to eliminate an excess of currency of over 11 billion pesos (equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate) and a budget deficit of over 4 billion pesos. The decree-law, which contains nine articles, orders the confiscation of ill-gotten goods from the "owner or holder" and the investigation of owners and those who appear to be covert owners. The Republic's Attorney General and Finance Ministry will be the institutions tasked with conducting the investigation and confiscation [words indistinct] according to the law that voids the legal force "of actions taken to hide the improper nature of the acquisition of goods and income" in question.
