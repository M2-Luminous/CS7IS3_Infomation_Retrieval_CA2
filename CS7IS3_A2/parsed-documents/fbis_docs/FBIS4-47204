No one in the world is giving up the energy produced by nuclear power stations, and Ukraine is no exception to this. In 1993, Ukraine's AES produced 32.7% of the total volume of electricity generated by the country's electric power stations. From the standpoint of production effectiveness, the figure "32.7" can be regarded as a unique achievement, for as recently as 1990 this indicator measured only 25.5%. Understandably, a prolonged energy crisis makes it impossible to be overly particular regarding the choice of electric power sources, and it is for that reason that the government will never renounce the services of the nuclear power engineers at this time. A clear demonstration of the government's position on this issue was the visit on 27 May of the president and the acting prime minister of Ukraine to the Chernobyl AES, during which Leonid Kravchuk showed unusual interest in the methods of measuring radiation both at the Chernobyl AES and in the surrounding area. It also became clear after this visit that the Chernobyl AES would not be shut down in the near future (no matter how much many representatives of the relevant international organizations might want this). That is the only explanation for the president's promise to the residents of Slavutych near Chernobyl to build a 100-unit apartment building in the city using government funds appropriated for this purpose. On the other hand, the expansion of the production capacities of Ukraine's nuclear power plants in recent years also means that the load of the AES has increased, thereby increasing the theoretical probability of the occurrence of unexpected incidents at these stations. This is the other side of the coin, and control of this aspect must be the first order of priority. How to do this is up to the experts. As to the numerical analysis of the performance of Ukraine's electricity producers, the results are as follows: Of the 75.2 MWh of energy produced by nuclear electric power stations, 27.5 MWh were produced by the Zaporizhzhya AES, 11.8 MWh by the Rivne AES, 5.8 MWh by the Khmelnytskyy AES, 12.6 MWh by the Chernobyl AES, and 17.5 by the Southern Ukrainian AES. The most powerful thermal electric power stations TES today are those in Zaporizhzhya, Vuhlehirsk, Kryvyy Rih, and Burshtyn. The production of electric power began to decline in 1991 synchronously with the downturn in industrial output: the number of megawatts of electric power produced equals the amount of energy consumed by industrial customers. The inability to sell noncompetitive Ukrainian production because of its too high power-output ratio was the reason for the protracted idling of enterprises to conserve electric power. In 1993, according to the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, Ukraine exported 2.7 MWh of electric power as against the period up to 1990, when annual exports amounted to nearly 30 MW. According to Vasyl Protsenko, deputy chief of the administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, the sharp decrease in the export of electric power from Ukraine was due to the production of electric power for Western countries at a loss while its price dropped: the purchase price of one kilowatt of energy fell from from 5.1 to 2.3 cents. The production cost of one kW of Ukrainian electric power amounts to 2.55 cents. The Ministry of Energy and Electrification predicts a continuing decrease in electric power production in 1994. The state order for the production of energy by combined electric power and heat generating plants TETs amounts to 134 billion kWh, but in reality no more than 113.5 billion kWh will be produced. The production of electric power by hydroelectric power stations [HES] will decrease in 1994 to 9.46 MWh, and by nuclear electric power stations [AES] to 70 MWh. One of the reasons for the predicted decline in the production of electricity, apart from a decrease in industrial consumption, is a shortage of fuel needed to produce electric power. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

In physical terms, the amount of coal consumed was 42.9 million metric tons, mazut -- 4.8 million metric tons, and gas -- 20.2 billion cubic meters. According to Vasyl Protsenko, the deputy chief of the administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, in 1993 Ukraine imported 6 million metric tons of coal, mainly from Russia. Forecasts for this year estimate that only one million metric tons of coal will be imported. As expected, the main reason for this decrease in the volume of coal imports is a shortage of funds. Consequently, the predicted shortage of coal in Ukraine for this year will reach 9.3 million metric tons. The shortage of mazut in 1994 is expected to reach 2.9 million metric tons. Compared with 1990, when the annual demand for mazut was 18 million metric tons, the current level of consumption has dropped to 3.8 million metric tons, because 50% of Ukraine's power station units are not operating. During the summer, when, as a rule, electric power consumption drops 30%, electric power stations, for the most part, use mazut and gas as fuel, thus creating a reserve of coal for the winter ranging in amounts from 800,000 to one million metric tons. But the fuel shortage is already creating a potentially dangerous situation in the electric power system (in particular, the reduction of the frequency in the network below 49.5 Hertz) and threatens to result in the total collapse of Ukraine's power system. The Ministry of Energy and Electrification is solving the problem by disconnecting some consumers from the general network. Even now, close to 3,000 enterprises are disconnected every day from the power system. Last year, nuclear electric power stations used nearly 24 million metric tons of equivalent fuel and produced 32.7 percent of the total electric power generated in Ukraine. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Today these relations are in a state of crisis, which promises to be of long duration. According to Ivan Mahda, deputy minister of energy and electrification of Ukraine, his ministry is now totally bankrupt. To some extent, the financial collapse of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification has been brought about by consumers -- enterprises that pay back only 50% of what they owe daily. The principal consumers of electric power in Ukraine are listed in Table 2. In 1993, they received 187.9 MWh of power, while the electric power stations used 16.8 MWh for their own needs and 22.5 MWh were lost due to over heating in the transmission lines. Consumers are not paying the Ministry of Energy and Electrification what they owe, and, judging by the steady decline of production in Ukraine, they will not do so in the near future. At the same time, Alfred Turos, the chief of the administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, reports that government credits issued at the end of March to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Machinebuilding, Defense Industrial Complex, and Converstion for settling the debts owed by their enterprises for energy supplies were not used for this purpose. But even if consumers were to pay off their full debt to the supplier, which totalled 9.5 trillion karbovantsi at the beginning of May, the financial crisis at the Ministry of Energy and Electrification would not be completely solved. The reason is simple: the Ministry of Energy and Electrification owes its consumers 9.8 trillion karbovantsi, including 1.525 trillion for coal, 1.469 trillion for mazut, and 1.952 trillion karbovantsi for gas. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |ESTABLISHED CAPACITY OF UKRAINE'S ELECTRIC POWER STATIONS ON 1 JANUARY 1994 (| |in million kilowatts) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Electric power consumpti-|Established capacity |Actual | |on system | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |total -- 52.21 |33.11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including |TETs -- 34.7 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |HES -- 4.7 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |AES -- 12.82 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Power Production Associa-| | | |tions: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vinnytsyaenerho |total -- 3.57 |2.25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including |TETs -- 1.84 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |HES -- 0.73 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |AES -- 1.00 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dniproenerho |total -- 16.81 |7.64 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: |TETs -- 8.93 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |HES -- 2.88 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |AES -- 5.00 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Donbasenerho |total -- 12.96 |7.66 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: |TETs -- 12.96 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kyyivenerho |total -- 6.76 |4.62 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: |TETs -- 3.72 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |HES -- 1.05 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |AES -- 2.00 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Krymenerho |total -- 0.375 |1.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: |TETs -- 0.375 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lvivenerho |total -- 5.11 |3.13 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: |TETs -- 3.26 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |HES -- 0.032 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |AES -- 1.82 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Odesaenerho |total -- 3.36 |2.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: |TETs -- 0.35 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |HES -- 0.0035 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |AES -- 3.00 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kharkivenerho |total -- 3.27 |3.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: |TETs -- 3.27 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |HES -- 0.0048 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- P.S.: There are only 104 power units in operation at the thermal electric power stations of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification. Of these, eight have a capacity from 720 to 800 MW, 42 --from 282 to 300 MW, five -- 250 MW, 43 -- from 175 to 210 MW, and six turbines with 150 MW each. At present, half the power generators at the eight power associations named above are forced to stand idle. THE SECTOR'S PRODUCTION POTENTIAL IN MAY 1994 The base power load required by Ukraine's industrial consumers is carried by nuclear and thermal electric power stations. Hydroelectric power stations are put in service during peak hours of the day in order to prevent the frequency in the system from falling below 49.5 Hertz. Today, the power industry run by the Ministry of Energy and Electrification is comprised of 294 enterprises, including 42 electric power stations and 88 enterprises in the electric and thermal power systems. Consumers are supplied with electric power by 615 regional electric systems, including 493 rural regional systems. The total length of overhead and cable electric transmission lines [LEP] measures 1,014,000 kilometers, of which 951,604 km are overhead and 62,736 km are cable lines. The total length of high-voltage transmission lines (800 kW) measures 247 km. The total length of overhead electric transmission lines (750 kW) measures 4,081 km. There are 2,047,000 transformer substations with a total capacity of 197,062 MVA.
