Background Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (``CAA'' or ``the Act''), will require many small businesses to be regulated so that areas may attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and the emission of air toxics will be reduced. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM to be incorporated as a revision of the Federally approved SIP. In addition, the Act directs the USEPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Title V of the Act. In February 1992, USEPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the States on submitting an acceptable PROGRAM. In order to gain full approval, a State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.
