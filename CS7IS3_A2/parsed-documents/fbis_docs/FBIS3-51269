Mr. Government and Interior Minister Fabio Villegas, has the participation of the Army of National Liberation been confirmed? What steps will be taken? [Villegas] It has indeed been confirmed that the National Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNG] is at the root of the attack. We feel outraged, as all Colombians must feel, over this criminal attack, this murderous action by the CNG. The government reaffirms its will to maintain its policy of eradicating these criminal bands from the country. [Valderrama] A report from the Narino Palace stated that Economic Development Minister Luis Alberto Moreno resigned. The name of his replacement is being studied here at the Narino Palace. What names are being mentioned? [Villegas] [laughs] You have to ask the president.
