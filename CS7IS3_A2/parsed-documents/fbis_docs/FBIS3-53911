Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian delegation, said that the document will be relayed to the two leaderships for perusal. According to 'Asfur, over the weekend the PLO leadership will decide whether to change the directives given to the delegation and whether the negotiations will resume next week on the basis of this document. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 20 January carries a live report from Taba by Netan'el Semrik, adding that "the points of disagreement remain -- as previously -- the issues of symbols and procedures for checking those entering and departing the autonomy. The document itself is four-pages long and includes several dozens clauses and subclauses dealing with the various issues."] Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the Civilian Affairs Committee postponed the scheduled discussion regarding the establishment of television and radio stations because the Palestinian expert did not arrive in Taba.
