The "villain" who issued the order supposedly was Engineer Vladimir Zeman, director of the Communications Section at the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public Works. How did he pull this off? This is discussed by Eng. Zeman himself, who gave us an interview. [Mesaros] Are you really the person responsible for Eng. Ondrovic's "moment of weakness," in which he signed the decree on the abolition of RFE broadcasts in Slovakia? [Zeman] I do not know who has moments of weakness or when, but my opinion is that managers simply should not have them when they sign important documents. I also consider unfair Eng. Ondrovic's statement that I forced him to sign the document and, subsequently, a copy of it. I think that he signed the document quite voluntarily, of his own volition. As for the copy, why would I need the same document again? [Mesaros] Nevertheless, it seems strange that RFE broadcasts were cut off at the time a new government was taking shape. Was this not an act of defiance by the ministry's outgoing top leadership? [Zeman] Those who know the problems surrounding RFE broadcasts know they have been dragging on for quite some time. When someone tries to make the public believe that this issue has only a political background, he is not telling the truth. Some people may have the impression that politics, too, are involved. Personally, I am interested only in the technical and economic aspects of the matter. Apart from that, I ask myself why, if these are supposed to be broadcasts for Slovakia, almost 80 percent of them are in Czech. Are we a sovereign state or not? After all, the broadcasts for Poles are not in Russian but in Polish! I stress, however, that these circumstances did not determine the step that was taken. [Mesaros] At the aforementioned news conference, Eng. Ondrovic claimed that the RFE license, which entitles it to broadcast in Slovakia, is in perfect order. If that is the case, why were the broadcasts interrupted? [Zeman] Apparently, he is not adequately informed. Had he been adequately informed, he would have known that the broadcasting license for RFE was issued by the former Federal Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting. Besides the fact that we have never renewed it, the issued license has a number of formal shortcomings that make it virtually invalid. Far more problems exist in the technical and economic spheres. In January 1994, we proposed a solution to these problems with the draft of a new contract. Had the RFE management approached this matter more flexibly, the new contract, which is advantageous for them as well as for us, could have been signed a long time ago. Whereas at present they pay us $680,000 annually for the transmission of the signal, under the new contract they would pay $1.5 million, but for a signal of much better quality that would cover a wider area. At the talks, they were also asked to broadcast for ethnic minorities in the Slovak Republic, as well. [Mesaros] Do your words imply that the new management of the ministry, too, should reassess the terms under which RFE broadcasts? [Zeman] I subscribe to that view. [Mesaros] As we have learned, Eng. Ondrovic, whom you supposedly recalled [from the post of ST director general], has been reinstated by the new minister. Are you still in your post? [Zeman] First of all, I would like to say that I did not have the authority to appoint or recall anyone to or from his post. However, the fact that the new minister had to reappoint Eng. Ondrovic bears out the fact that he had been recalled in a legally valid way. Hence, when posing at his news conference on Wednesday as ST director general, he was not right. As for me, for the time being I am still in my previous post. In an interview yesterday, the new minister said that he would be assessing people according to their work performance. I had a good impression from his words.
