What is this -- a new policy from Tokyo or coincidence? After Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan, the process of the clarification of relations between Moscow and Tokyo through conflict and outrage has entered a sluggish stage: It is thought that there will be no more surprises, pleasant or unpleasant. Only professional Russian patriots still suspect President Yeltsin and Minister Kozyrev of harboring a secret desire to sell off the Kuril islands. In the president's entourage, beginning with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, there are no politicians prepared to fulfill the provisions of the 1956 Soviet-Japanese declaration and renounce either two or four islands at the southern end of the Kurils chain. When Tokyo objects to Russia's full-fledged participation in the G-7 conference, this looks like an attempt to obtain something from Russia by barter. When Koji Watanabe, Japanese ambassador in Moscow, spoke to me he protested keenly: The new prime minister cannot take a tough line. Hata came to Moscow as foreign minister and vice premier in mid-March and talked with Viktor Chernomyrdin and Andrey Kozyrev about expanding dialogue between the two countries and about Russia's role in the world economy. Meanwhile, the future premier was not received by Boris Yeltsin on that occasion, a fact which hardly left the Japanese visitor with fond memories. The top Moscow leadership has lost interest in political talks with Japan. The level of diplomacy has fallen to that of Poland. Ambassador Watanabe refuses to recognize that Russian-Japanese relations are deadlocked: "From the day that I arrived in Moscow back in January this year I have heard the most appalling predictions about hyperinflation, disorder, and political destabilization. Not one of them has come true." The 60-year old Koji Watanabe is well known for his love of an open fire, which he kindles himself, his nostalgia for the warmth of Italy, where he represented his country before coming to Moscow, and the frenetic energy with which he acquainted himself with all the even slightly well known people in the Russian capital in just a few months. "I do not know whether I understand correctly what is going on in Russia," Koji Watanabe remarked. "Sometimes it seems to me that I have understood something but then the next week I come to the conclusion that I was hasty..." Russian diplomats specializing in Japan consider Koji Watanabe a hypercautious diplomat who avoids improvization and adheres strictly to instructions received from Tokyo. The Washington embassy is regarded as Japan's most important mission; it has 50 percent more staffers than the Moscow embassy. The embassies in Moscow and Beijing are in second place. And Tokyo treats its embassies differently. The small embassy building on Kalashnyy Lane used to have a dining room for more than 60 diplomatic staff. The Japanese Foreign Ministry considered it an unnecessary luxury to pay for a chef and the dining room was closed. To make up for it, staffers at the Japanese embassy in Moscow have been given three weeks' extra recuperation leave. That detail provides the best illustration of how the Japanese see life in Russia.
