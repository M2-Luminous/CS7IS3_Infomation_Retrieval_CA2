Narcis Serra made these remarks at the presentation of the Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) candidates for the European Parliament. Criticisms of the People's Party, an absence of references to Convergence and Union, and the Socialists' firm commitment to the struggle against corruption dominated most of the speeches. The deputy prime minister began his address with optimistic remarks about the economic situation. "We are emerging from the tunnel of the crisis. The economy is reviving, we are correcting our shortcomings, and new jobs are being created thanks to the labor reform." In his opinion, "much remains to be done," because emerging from the crisis "requires more effort today," and so he advocated a new "social, trade union, and business culture. And it will be our involvement in Europe that will help us make this change of outlook a reality, provided that Europe is guided by a project of progress that will bar the way to the right." The Socialist leader warned that all the progress achieved "is in danger. The gravest threat to Spain's progress is the policy of the PP and Jose Maria Aznar, and this would be the case if they were in power, because they have no policy." He added that "the opposition's gravest threat is its sectarianism; wishing to attain power without taking the results of the polls into account. Their sectarianism even prevents them from acknowledging the effort that Spanish society is making." He reiterated the Socialists' pledge to combat corruption: "We will continue to the bitter end, whoever may fall." Serra stressed that the Socialists have a great deal at stake in this battle, "and so does society, because the democratic system's credibility could be at issue unless drastic action is taken, but it will be very difficult to ease the tension in political life as long as the PP is there." He pointed out differences from the PP in explaining that "we are different. Our voters are more demanding, and we have a higher idea of the political action that we put into practice. We will relinquish government responsibility when citizens so wish at the polls." In the deputy prime minister's opinion, the PP's own strategy "helps us surmount the situation. People know that the implementation of the PP's policy would be very bad for political stability. It has no arguments and has a lack of elementary ethics. They demand everything except respecting the results of the polls. They wish to turn what is their problem into everybody's problem." In his opinion, the PP's problem is the censure motion. "It does not submit one because the PP stands alone, in the solitude of those who persist in error; of those who for a handful of votes are capable of stirring up a language war in Catalonia; in the solitude of those who would like to place in the prime ministership a person who is unworthy of it. This is the real reason why they do not submit a censure motion -- not the parliamentary arithmetic." He added another reason to these arguments: "When a censure motion is submitted, an alternative government program must be presented, and they have none. Aznar would have to confront Gonzalez, and he cannot win that battle. The Spanish people will never be able to trust somebody who, in an act of real political effrontery, used statements by somebody who has fled justice that have been denied. Nobody will ever trust those ethics." Serra concluded with references to Europe, expressing his conviction that the Socialists will win the elections because "Europe has always seemed very distant to the PP; they do not believe in the social Europe, they are a danger to the structural funds, and their European partners defend interests detrimental to us."
