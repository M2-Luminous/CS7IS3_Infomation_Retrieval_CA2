According to the FRY president's general secretariat [as received], President Lilic added that it is the FRY's desire that this visit should to be an important step in the promotion of bilateral relations, especially in the sphere of economic cooperation which is of great importance for both countries, stressing that mutual trust and cooperation is what a true relationship between neighbors should be. "Within the framework of this cooperation," President Lilic said, "the Serbian minority in Hungary and the Hungarian minority in Yugoslavia should represent an important cohesive factor. As for the FRY, Hungarians living there enjoy all the rights of national minorities in accordance with the highest international standards, as well as full equality as citizens. I hope that the same criterion applies to the Serbian minority in Hungary," President Lilic said. Speaking about the aim of his visit, Minister Jeszenszky underscored that Hungary is aware of the importance and complexity of the present situation in the FRY and that it wishes peace to be established in war-affected areas of former Yugoslavia as soon as possible and that our two countries should consolidate their mutual relations. This visit reassured me that the FRY firmly intends to help resolve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in a peaceful way, Jeszenszky said, adding that he realizes Yugoslavia is doing everything in its power to fully achieve this aim. Minister Jeszenszky spoke in particular about prospects of the unification of Europe saying that the FRY should be included in this framework. "As we already know," the Hungarian foreign minister said, "Hungarians live in several countries and Hungary will try to resolve the issue of the cultural and national identity of its minority, not by changing the borders but through European processes of unification." "We are also in favor of a united Europe," President Lilic stressed, "but for a Europe where all peoples and countries are equal. The behavior of certain members of the European and international communities -- especially the introduction of the unprecedented and inhuman sanctions against our country -- shows that such an ideal has not yet been attained. The efforts made by the FRY are being ignored -- although certain changes have been detected recently and the truth is slowly becoming apparent -- despite the fact that, since the very outbreak of the crisis in former Yugoslavia and especially the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yugoslavia always advocated a peaceful solution to all disputes and a negotiated settlement. Our consistent adherence to a policy of peace, as well as our constructive stand and significant contribution to the acceptance of all the conditions set by the European Union at the latest round of the Geneva talks, did not result in the lifting of sanctions. It became obvious after the latest round of negotiations just how absurd it is to punish Yugoslavia because one side in Bosnia-Herzegovina opted for war, unfortunately with support from certain world circles. Evidently, President Lilic concluded, somebody in the world cares more about the sanctions against the FRY than about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Underlining that the sanctions against the FRY are inflicting severe damage to Yugoslavia and its neighbors, President Lilic said he hopes Hungary will significantly alter its stands on the sanctions and urge the international community more resolutely to lift them. We all have to make an appraisal of the consequences of this unhappy period for our entire region, Geza Jeszenszky said, which should be forgotten -- like a bad dream. The Hungarian Government and people wish to see mutual relations and economic cooperation develop. In this respect, Minister Jeszenszky added, Hungary will work within the framework of the international community to improve conditions for the realization of all that is in our mutual interest. The meeting was also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic.
