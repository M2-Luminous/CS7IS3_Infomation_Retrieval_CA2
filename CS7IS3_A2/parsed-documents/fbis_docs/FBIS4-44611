Applications for this device--whose demand is indicated by a 200 percent growth rate abroad over the past few years--include indicators, gunsights, optical disk storage, bar code scanners, and laser printers. For interested manufacturers, equipment investment costs are about 5 million yuan, which should generate an output value of 15 million yuan within 3 years, after which profits should begin.
