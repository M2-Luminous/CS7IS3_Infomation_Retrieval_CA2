The Cyprus New Agency reports that an official statement on Abu's appointment will be issued Monday [7 February] by EU Commissioner on Foreign Policy Hans van den Broek during the EU Council of Ministers' meeting. Speaking to correspondents following a meeting with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis in Brussels today, van den Broek noted that the observer, as an employee of the EU, will brief the relevant commissioners directly with special reports and follow the developments in the negotiations. He said the EU Commission will have a credible and responsible witness if it ever wants a briefing. He added that Turkey accepts the observer because he will only observe not participate the negotiations. Mr. van den Broek expressed the conviction that Turkey will cooperate in the promotion of the confidence-building measures. Furthermore, van den Broek said after his meeting with Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis that Cyprus' membership in the EU will definitely take place but it is a matter of time. We proceed very well and have good cooperation in the economic and technical fields, said the commissioner. However, he added, we cannot underestimate the political difficulties and obstacles that must be overcome. Responding to a question on whether if progress is made on the Cyprus talks the country's application for membership will be discussed earlier than 1995, the commissioner said that any positive development will be seriously considered. However, he said he believes that the political problems that must first be resolved are many and serious, and that is why the January 1995 date remains. Our efforts toward a solution to the Cyprus problem will continue, he concluded, so that by January 1995 the dialogue will have progressed with the achievement of significant steps. In Brussels, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also met EU Commissioner on Foreign Economic Trade Sir Leon Brittan. Mikhailidhis asked the EU commissioner for the improvement and expansion of the terms of the association agreement between the EU and Cyprus beyond the fields defined by the agreement. Our correspondent reports that Mikhailidhis asked for the dispatch of EU experts to contribute to a better harmonization of the Cyprus legislation with that of the EU. Mikhailidhis described his two meetings, with van den Broek and Brittan, as substantial and added that they took place in a very positive atmosphere. Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis left Brussels for London, where he will meet with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
