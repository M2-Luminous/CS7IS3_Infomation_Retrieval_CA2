After talks are concluded, all negotiators normally say that they are pleased, and Swedish Minister for Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel was no exception when he met journalists in Brussels this afternoon. [Begin Dinkelspiel recording, in English] This is a historic date, a historic date. We have, for all practical purposes concluded our negotiations for membership of the European Union. [end recording] [Reporter] This is a historic day for Sweden, Minister for Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel said when he met the international press in Brussels today. [passage omitted] Most of the questions which were solved in the final spurt concerned agriculture and the budget. And as to the budget, Sweden had demanded a so-called phasing-in stage, i.e., a reduced EU membership fee during the first years. The EU has never accepted this model; instead, the EU will send money directly to Anne Wibble, and the finance minister says today that she does not know yet what will be printed on the check, that means it is not certain what the EU will call the subsidy. In figures this means that Sweden will pay the full fee of almost 20 billion Swedish crowns only in the fourth year of membership. During the first year Sweden will pay 450 million Swedish crowns more than what the EU is paying to Sweden in the form of various kinds of support and subsidies. [passage omitted] As to the subsidies for agriculture in Norrland, Sweden will have the right to continue to support the three northern areas. Money from the EU will be in the form of three different forms of support, where the so-called environment subsidies cover the whole of Sweden. The regional subsidies were a less disputed question during the last 24 hours because it was already clear earlier that Sweden would receive subsidies similar to those given to the poorest areas of the EU. The subsidies will concern 450,000 people in the areas of Norrbotten, Vaesterbotten, and Jaemtland and, in addition, 11 provinces in Dalarna, western Norrland, Vaermland, and Gaevleborg. Two major questions are unsolved because the EU member countries have not been able to agree among themselves. In conflict with other countries, Spain demands that Sweden's entry to the future foreign exchange union be delayed so that Spain will not be in a worse situation when qualifying itself. Spain and Britain have demands which concern the number of votes that can get a proposal rejected in the Council of Ministers. Those questions are expected to make next week's foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels a stormy affair.
