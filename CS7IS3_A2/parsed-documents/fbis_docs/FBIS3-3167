Lots of peasants no longer consider "leaving their own native place" to make a living as a big deal. They flock into towns and cities to do business or work, picking up jobs no matter whether they are full-time or not. They also go outside their counties or provinces. Some even venture into the international business or labor markets to make a living. Since mainland China began its reform and opening to the world, the bondage of registered permanent residence has been loosened. Big, lateral economic asociations formed by various provincial and regional enterprises have broken through regional obstacles and separation. This change also provides objective conditions for peasants to do business or engage in industry. The contingent of "engaging in industry and doing business" organized by peasants has set their footprints all over the country. Some people go to Taiwan. Still more dare to leave the country to travel far away across the sea to do business and engage in industry, giving full play to their talents and abilities in more than 20 countries and regions. The transnational labor markets which mainland peasants enter are chiefly located in China's neighboring countries and areas. According to statistics from the mainland department concerned, in the China's coastal provinces alone tens of thousands of peasants have been engaged in transnational businesses and employment. Of these, the peasant supply and marketing teams from Gutian, Fujian Province, have traveled north and south, leaving their footprints in Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Burmese border areas in the south as well as the Sino-Russian and Sino-North Korean border areas in the north. They have succeeded in opening up foreign markets for Gutian's mushrooms. The peasants from Jinjiang and Shishi sell Russia a large amount of Western-style suits and jeans produced in their hometowns. The polyester fiber goods made in Changle have entered the markets of countries such as Laos, Vietnam, and Burma. The peasants from Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, sell several hundred thousand pieces of children's clothing and dresses to Russia annually and a large amount of piece goods to Vietnam and Burma. Several hundred peasants from Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, have been shuttling between trade fairs in Guangxi and Vietnam, in Yunnan and Thailand, and between Yunnan and Burma purchasing the local Chinese herbal medicines and selling them to Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philipines after processing. A few hundred peasants from the Daba Shan area in Sichuan Province have set up several enterprises in Burma. The official government planned labor exports in recent years have also changed the fate of millions of peasants in mainland China. In Lu County, Sichuan Province, known as the "home of builders," there is a peasant construction team composed of more than 100 good technicians. This team has excelled itself by undertaking nearly 1000 projects in the Middle East, Africa, etc. After inspection, all the projects they undertook were up to standard. In 1992 alone, the production value stood at nearly 200 million yuan. In Sichuan Province alone, there are already more than a dozen counties which have realized their goal of earning over 100 million yuan through labor export. Thousands of peasants from Qidong and Haian in Jiangsu Province are now actively engaged in a dozen trades such as building construction, cooking, nursing, textile garments, chemical industry, decorating, machine repair, and ocean fishery. Of these, the peasants in Qidong concluded labor export contracts worth over $11 million last year. In Heilongjiang Province, each year there are over 10,000 peasants who display their skills to the full in agricultural planting and construction work in the CIS. The peasants in mainland China leave their small peasant courtyards and play an active role in the domestic and international markets. No matter whether they are engaged in international trade or paid employment, all these engagements enable them to increase their income and quicken their steps toward the goal of becoming well-to-do. Labor export has become an important economic development measure, especially for those townships and towns which get involved in official government labor exports because it needs less investment but can achieve quick results. It can not only find placements for the local surplus labor force but also bring back capital, techniques, and information from outside to help develop the local economy and promote the peasants' sense of commodities.
