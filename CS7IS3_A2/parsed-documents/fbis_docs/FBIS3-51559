Carles--whom his opponents have accused of having obstructed the disbursement of budget funds for social programs while in the Comptroller General's Office--was elected by a majority vote at the Molirena national convention held at the convention center in the capital. Molirena decided last night to cease supporting the government alliance which has led the country since 1989. This has prompted Panamanian President Guillermo Endara to announce that he will reshuffle his cabinet in view of the possible withdrawal of Molirena ministers from the government. The path toward the election of the septuagenarian was cleared after Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford renounced during its convention his aspirations to be the presidential candidate for this political group. Guillermo Guijano, the Molirena former housing minister who suffered heart problems in the past hours, was chosen first vice president candidate, and Tomas Herrera, of the Civic Renewal Party (PRC), was chosen for the second vice president slot. Carles will be nominated by new right-wing parties, namely, the National Renewal Movement, PRC, and a faction of Popular Alliance (AP), led by former Mayor Mayin Correa, which were left out of the elections by the Electoral Tribunal (TE). The Arnulfista Party (PA) also held its national convention today. This party, to which President Guillermo Endara belongs, elected as is presidential candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, widow of Arnulfo Arias Madrid, a caudillo and three-time Panamanian president. Moscoso, who is a novice in politics, is the sole female presidential candidate and will head a new alliance supported by the minority Authentic Liberal Party (PLA), the only remaining party of the 1989 opposition alliance. PLA leader Arnulfo Escalona was nominated for the slot of first vice president, and Jose Teran, of the minority Liberal Party (PL), which was part of the previous military government, was chosen for the second vice president position. These three parties were joined by other minority groups, namely, the Popular Nationalist Party (PNP), Independent Democratic Union (UDI), and an AP faction. A reply from the National Unity Mission (MUN), which objected to Escalona's candidacy, is expected.
