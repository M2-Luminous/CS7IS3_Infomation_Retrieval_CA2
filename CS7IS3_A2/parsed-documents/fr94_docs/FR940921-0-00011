FR940921-0-00011 FR940921-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary 24 CFR Part 888 [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3741; FR&hyph;3686&hyph;C&hyph;03] Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program; Contract Rent Annual Adjustment Factors and Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program; Fair Market Rents; Correction AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HUD. ACTION: Fair Market Rents; correction. SUMMARY: This action makes a correction to the document on Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program; Contract Rent Annual Adjustments Factors published on April 26, 1994 (59 FR 21832). EFFECTIVE DATE: April 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael R. Allard, Economic and Market Analysis Division, Office of Policy Development and Research, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410, (202) 708&hyph;0577 (TDD: (202) 708&hyph;0770). (These telephone numbers are not toll-free). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act) requires that the assistance contracts signed by owners participating in the Department's Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs provide for annual or more frequent adjustment in the maximum monthly rentals for units covered by the contract to reflect changes based on fair market rents prevailing in a particular market area, or on a reasonable formula. The AAF Notice published on April 26, 1994, announced the revised FY 1994 Annual Adjustment Factors (AAF), but contained a technical error. The state of Nevada should have been identified as being part of HUD Region IX. (Under HUD's reorganization, the designation ``HUD Region IX'' will be ``Pacific/Hawaii'' in future AAF publications.) Accordingly, the AAF document published in the Federal Register on April 26, 1994 (59 FR 21832), is corrected at page 21850 as set forth in the following table: SCHEDULE C_CONTRACT RENT ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT FACTORS_AREA DEFINITIONS NEVADA (HUD REGION IX) METROPOLITAN COUNTIES Clark, Nye, Washoe NONMETROPOLITAN COUNTIES Churchill, Douglas, Elko, Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Lincoln, Lyon, Mineral, Pershing, Storey, White Pine, Carson City Dated: September 15, 1994.
