Mark Robinson, Tory MP for Somerton and Frome, and Tony Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, were taken hostage along with an Action Aid employee. The Action Aid employee is believed to be Jeff Chinnock. They were taken in Northwest Somalia near a place called Erigavo some time last night. A spokeswoman at Worthington's office told Reuters: "I can confirm the reports. We have heard this morning that Tony is well." She said the two were on a fact-finding tour of Somalia with the charity Action Aid. "I believe they were kidnapped yesterday. We do not know who is holding them," she said. The Foreign Office spokesman said he believed an Action Aid employee "was also involved" but could give no details. "We are in close touch with our ambassador in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) who is speaking to local elders," said the spokesman. There had been no ransom demand, he added. The British embassy in neighbouring Ethiopia also has responsibility for Somalia. The Foreign Office believe the three had been taken in a dispute between rival clansmen. The British Embassy in Addis Ababa has been assured the men are not in any danger. They were on a trip to look at work by the charity Action Aid in the region when they were taken.
