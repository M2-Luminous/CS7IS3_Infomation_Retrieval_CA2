Responsible for the main guidelines of foreign policy, he spoke to EXPRESSO by telephone. [Meireles] Following a period of apparent self-effacement with respect to the Balkans, Russia has taken up active involvement. Why? [Adamishin] Russia has not begun to act just now. We have been seeking for months a political agreement for Bosnia and for other conflict areas in the former Yugoslavia. At the last UN session we proposed the demilitarization of Sarajevo, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev suggested 24 January a ministerial meeting with the Security Council members in order to examine the city's problems, demilitarization, and placement under UN administration. The NATO ultimatum prevented the completion of the process. The political and diplomatic actions were the culmination of many months of efforts by Russian diplomacy. [Meireles] But it was the credible threat of the use of force which produced the first positive results.... [Adamishin] I would say that it was the nonuse of force which made possible this result. I am not certain that the Serbs would have withdrawn their weapons if Russia had not asked them to do so in accordance with the UN secretary general's plan, without our resorting to ultimatums or threats. The important thing is the results, not the laurels, but if anybody says that the decisive role was played by NATO, I disagree, and if NATO had shelled the Serb positions, I do not know what the consequences would have been. [Meireles] Did the West try to sideline Russia in resolving the conflict? [Adamishin] We did not like this ultimatum. In the first place, because it is not for NATO to deliver ultimatums and threaten the use of force in international relations, which is exclusively the Security Council's responsibility. Second, we agree with the West on the demilitarization of Sarajevo and its administration by the United Nations, and the overall political agreement, but the method chosen by the West would place Russia outside the decisionmaking framework, and here we disagree. Third, we believe that it prevented -- or at least did not facilitate -- the continuation of the negotiations which were already taking place in Sarajevo between Serbs and Muslims and which were suspended by the latter in anticipation of an intervention. The Muslims are the greatest obstacle to an agreement right now because they still hope to achieve on the battlefield what they could secure at the negotiating table, and when they learned that somebody was prepared to wage war for them, they lost interest in the talks. [Meireles] When you said that Russia had carried out its task and that it is now for the West to perform its own, were you referring to the exertion of pressure on the Muslims? [Adamishin] What I mean is that we used a powerful argument -- our influence on the Serbs. Nobody else would have it. It stems from our balanced policy with respect to the crisis, not from our belonging to the same ethnic and religious group. We do not seek to vindicate the Serbs, but we do not regard them as the sole culprits. It is known that the United States or some other countries have greater prospects of influencing the Muslims and making them see that it is time to sit down at the negotiating table and achieve peace by accepting the plan for a political agreement which was virtually approved by the three sides and was withdrawn from the negotiating table. [Meireles] In the talks with the United States, did Moscow inform it of that viewpoint? [Adamishin] We must all work together to influence the three sides, using everybody's assets. The Americans told us not to pressure the Muslims yet deemed themselves to be in a position to tell us to pressure the Serbs. They did not wish to impose conditions on the Muslims for an agreement -- only on the Serbs. This is not a fair stance. [Meireles] In Moscow, all the political forces have supported the initiative in Bosnia. Does the Slav-Orthodox alliance remain valid? [Adamishin] Our historical ties with the Serbs are one of the factors, but it is very dangerous to see the conflict in ethnic and religious terms: If the Slav countries supported the Serbs, the Islamic countries would have to support the Muslims, and the Catholics would have to support the Croats. It is not correct to say that only the Serbs are to blame, because it is untrue and politically incorrect. [Meireles] Do you believe that the West has made that mistake? [Adamishin] That is not what I mean. It is not possible to be unaware that Islamic countries are intervening for religious reasons. The important thing is to end the conflict, but an external act of force does not facilitate an agreement. We do not reject the possibility of its being necessary to use force -- such as, for instance, the UN forces having the right to defend themselves in the event of an attack -- but these are very specific and limited cases. [Meireles] Could the model applied in Sarajevo be used in other Bosnian cities? [Adamishin] Another ultimatum? Let them try it, and maybe they will reach the conclusion that it does not work! If one of the sides believes that it is possible the other will be attacked, there ceases to be a need to negotiate. [Meireles] What are Russia's means for resolving the conflict? [Adamishin] In the first place, we have political influence; second, we are prepared to work with all the Western countries; third, we have our troops there. They are under UN command, integrated into the peacekeeping forces, and this participation gives us greater ability to influence decisions. [Meireles] Are you in favor of U.S. troops' participation in the UN Protection Force? [Adamishin] Why not? We are inviting them! [Meireles] Have you asked President Clinton? [Adamishin] President Clinton has always said that he does not wish to send U.S. troops to Bosnia. It is not for us to tell him to send them. It is the United Nations which should say which troops it needs in Bosnia. When Butrus-Ghali said that he needed more forces in Sarajevo, we responded to his request. [Meireles] If the ultimatum were carried out, could a grave conflict develop between East and West? [Adamishin] That is a hypothetical question. Let us keep our fingers crossed and be thankful that this has not happened, and let us all be more sensible in the future in order to avert that possibility.
