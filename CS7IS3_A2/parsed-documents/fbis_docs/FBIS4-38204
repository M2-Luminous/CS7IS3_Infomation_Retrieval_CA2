He said because Jordan was unable to organize the flow of the al-Yarmuk River by constructing dams, Israel increased both pumping the al-Yarmuk waters for storage in the Tiberias lake and utilizing them directly. Mr. Haddadin said much of the water used by Israel from the al-Yarmuk River is of Jordan's rights. He said Israel uses about 80 million cubic meters per annum well over its natural rights of the river, which do not exceed irrigation of 16,000 donums. He said considering these facts, Jordan was obliged to insist that water rights be included under item three of the joint agenda agreed upon with Israel on September 14, 1993. Mr. Haddadin said in order to negotiate the water issue, Jordan proposed a secondary agenda for detailed discussions, adding that this is what was agreed upon between both sides following four sessions of talks on June 7, 1994.
