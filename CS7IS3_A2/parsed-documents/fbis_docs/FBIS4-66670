President of the organization Abdelaziz Bennani said Monday at a news conference economic, cultural and social rights are intrinsically linked to civil and political rights and the OMDH has received several complaints from citizens citing violations of these rights, mainly the right to work and unionist rights. The OMDH president added he notified to the authorities reports of violations of these rights but received no answer. The organization has also compiled several reports on abuses harming economic, social and cultural rights which are mainly noted in the practice of the right to unionist activities as several complaints that reached the organization cited restrictions of this right. Bennani also deplored that the government's commitments vis-a-vis this right are not observed. Concerning the right to work, the OMDH president said violations in this regard are reflected by collective laying down of workers, precarious jobs and the non-enforcement of the minimum guaranteed salary by employers. He said the government should shoulder its responsibilities in the respect of labor rights which are regulated by texts that date back to the protectorate era. On the occasion of the celebration this May 3 of the world press freedom day, the OMDH made public a statement pointing out that recommendations of the national colloquy on information and communication which called for the setting forth of an information and communication strategy based on freedom of speech and the democratization of the media were not respected. The OMDH calls the legislative body to set in motion recommendations adopted by the colloquy, on the basis of a transparent and public debate of legislative texts. It also urged for the setting up of a multi-party and independent body stemming from the executive body which will see to the respect of the mutli-party system and the audio-visual media freedom. For the Moroccan human rights organization, `respect of the press freedom, the right to information and the entire human rights closely depends on the continuous action of journalists, an action that is itself linked to the improvement of their work and living conditions, the efficiency of the human rights movement and the consolidation of the state of law foundations'.
