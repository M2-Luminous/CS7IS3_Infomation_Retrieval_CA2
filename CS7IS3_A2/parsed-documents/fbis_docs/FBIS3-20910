Bull, Air France: the French government is paying considerable sums to these state-owned companies without submitting to the European Commission the recovery programs it is preparing. Before giving its green light, the EC must evaluate whether the efforts undertaken are likely to restore the viability of the troubled groups. Karel Van Miert, the commissioner in charge of competition, is losing patience at the French government's procrastination, especially in Bull's case. "We have reached a completely illegal situation," he told LE MONDE. "The French government has been promising us a restructuring plan for months, but nothing is coming and there are complaints from competing manufacturers in other Community countries. This puts the Commission in an impossible position. The Commission cannot approve any more payments, or it will have to refer the case to the European Court." Unpleasant Surprise The commissioner noted that the French are quick to protest when they find that Brussels is not diligent enough in going after abusive state subsidies: Francis Mer, the Usinor-Sacilor CEO [chief executive officer], recently regretted that the Commission does not impose a more severe rationalization of state-owned steelmakers in Italy, Spain, and the East German provinces. It was also at France's and the United Kingdom's request that the Commission demanded--and obtained--that the Austrian government recover two-thirds of the subsidies granted to Grundig to build a plant in Austria. "The Commission must be able to act consistently," he said. Mr. Van Miert recalled the episodes of the Bull serial: 4 billion francs [Fr] in 1992, which the French government presented as a capital increase but which the Commission actually viewed as state subsidies; Fr2.5 billion in February 1993, paid by the State and France Telecom. In October, after many contacts with the French government, the Commission started the procedure on state subsidies contained in the treaty. The plan promised by Mr. Longuet before the summer holidays, then after the summer, was not disclosed. The Brussels departments were given "broad orientations"! In December, the Commission was unpleasantly surprised to learn that a new Fr4 billion instalment was granted to Bull. "In addition, new payments are scheduled for this year, so that total subsidies might reach Fr15 billion, i.e. Fr1,000 per taxpaying household!," Mr. Van Miert worries; he is obviously determined to prevent France from allowing itself to follow that course. Abel Matutes, the transportation commissioner, is in charge of the Air France case, but Mr. Van Miert observed that, in this case too, the French government is doing exactly as it likes. The State already paid Fr1.5 billion and intends to grant a total of Fr6 billion to Fr7 billion. However, under pressure from strikers, the restructuring plan devised by Bernard Attali, the former Air France CEO, was abandoned. What will his successor, Christian Blanc's plan be like? Will it be convincing enough for the Commission to approve the injection of the billions required to save the national airline? Mr. Van Miert seems skeptical, noting in passing that Lufthansa, the German company, eliminated 7,000 jobs but is about to restore its financial balance. Without state subsidies.
