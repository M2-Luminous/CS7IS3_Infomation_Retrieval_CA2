"The project will also serve China's target of keeping the nationwide jobless rate within three percent", said Zhang Xiaojian, head of the Employment Department of the Labor Ministry, in an interview with XINHUA today. The project will create more job chances for the unemployed by offering special services and administration through the country's 10,000 job-introduction agencies, 2,200 job-training centers and over 200,000 labor service enterprises. China has already achieved marked results in arranging jobs for the jobless, according to the official. Statistics from the Labor Ministry showed that in 1993 alone a total of 7 million jobless people found jobs. The total unemployed nationwide has dropped sharply from 11 million to the present four million in the past couple of years. The official said that the vast majority of the unemployed can now find new jobs within six months with the help of China's employment service system. The jobless people who have been out of work for over six months account for 20 percent of the total jobless figure. "The employment project will focus on helping these long-term jobless people," the official stressed. The Labor Ministry stipulates that enterprises which employ long- term unemployed people are entitled to receive their previous unemployment relief fund partially or wholly, as subsidies for wage payment. Preferential treatment in terms of finance, taxation and choice of sites will be granted to jobless people who are to be self- employed, the official said. The long-term jobless who cannot find jobs even after job training will be given temporary jobs in the locally-run labor service enterprises until they find new jobs. For those who reject any form of employment without any sensible reasons, the government will cease to grant them unemployment relief funds. The official said that the employment project will first be launched in a dozen provinces and municipalities, including Beijing and Shanghai Cities, and Shandong, Hebei and Zhejiang Provinces. The project will then be carried out on a nationwide scale in 1995.
