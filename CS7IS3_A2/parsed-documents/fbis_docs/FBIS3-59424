In contrast to "high-level policy," the demarcation of the boundaries on the ground had very practical consequences. The border between Serbia and Macedonia was contested in almost every segment on the basis of the usual criteria for determining a border (geographic proximitity of a region to the center, national affiliation of the inhabitants, the desire of inhabitants to belong to a particular district, the economic ties of a village to a particular center). The freshest issue in the memory of the Macedonian reader concerns the polemics over the Sveti Prohor Pcinjski monastery, which was on the territory of the People's Republic of Macedonia [NRM] according to maps made immediately after World War II but was later attached to Serbia (although the government of the NRM had a contrary view and on several instances sought reasons for the monastery to belong to Macedonia). In 1946, on the initiative of the prime minister of the government of the People's Republic of Serbia, Blagoja Neskovic, the federal government directed an official note to the government of the People's Republic of Macedonia in which it offered its view of disputed territory in the Kumanovo-Skopje sector, the Kozjak-German sector, General Jankovic, the Sar cement plant in General Jankovic, the Sveti Prohor Pcinjski monastery, and other places. In response to this note, the government of the NRM requested the views of the district people's council in Skopje. The opinion of this council (dated 6 September 1946) was that the local council in General Jankovic (together with an additional 11 villages) should be separated from Kosmet (Kacanik srez [district]) and should be attached to the NRM (the Djorce Petrov okolija [district], the Sveti Prohor Pcinjski monastery (just the monastery) should be separated from the NRS [People's Republic of Serbia] (Presev srez) and should be attached to the NRM (Kosjak okolija), and the village of Nerav and half of the village of German (Krivo Palanka okolija) should be separated from the NRM and should be joined to the NRS. In the explanation, it was said that the local council in General Jankovic (with the villages of General Jankovic, Seliste, Palivodenica, Rezanci, Goranci, Pustenik, Krvenik, Divci, Strinjak, Djurdjev Dol, and Mekjovci) was tied administratively to the Kocanik srez, but "such an administrative connection with Kocanik was a condition based on an established belief among the Shiptars [Albanians] from these villages (immediately after the Liberation) if they were attached to the NRM, that it would be more `difficult' for them, or that they might be `mistreated' by the Macedonians, and so forth. And now that they realize that there is nothing to fear, they have changed their minds about it and want to belong to the NRM." Apart from the psychological motives, the okrug [district] council, in its deposition, tried to find objective reasons as well: the economic proximity of the area to Skopje, the geographic gravitation to the NRM, the origins and residence of the workers in the mine and the Sar cement factory.... As far as the monastery of Sv. Prohor Pcinjski is concerned, among the reasons for it to belong to the NRM, it was mentioned that almost the entire property formerly belonging to the monastery was within the territory of the NRM, but the most important reason was its significance in the history of the Macedonian people. The report of the presidium of the People's Government of Macedonia was almost identical. It was sent to the presidium of the government of the FNR [Federal People's Republic] of Yugoslavia, and was dated 12 September 1946 and signed by Vice President Ljupco Arsov. Much has also been said about the statement of 19 November 1952 by Boro Pekevski, the then director of the Institute for Statistics and Records, which was subordinate to the government of the NRM, concerning the manner in which the border between Macedonia and Serbia came into existence. According to Pekevski, Blagoja Neskovic insisted several times that the case of the Sar cement plant in General Jankovic should be re-examined (that plant was under the administrative jurisdiction of the government of the NRM). Accordingly, in December 1947, the secretary of the federal control commission, Lepa Perovic; Boro Pekevski; and the secretary of the Oblast [district] People's Council for Kosovo-Metohija, Djoko Pejakovic, visited the region and held discussions with the chairman and members of the MNO [Macedonian People's Council] in General Jankovic; with the director and members of the board of directors of the Sar cement plant, and with some of the workers and local inhabitants. The joint report to the federal control commission suggested that the territory of General Jankovic, with several additional villages, be part of the NRM and that the plant and so forth remain under the jurisdiction of Macedonia. The extent to which these suggestions were honored can be seen in the fact that, soon thereafter, the federal government decided that the plant should be removed [from the NRM's jurisdiction] and belong territorily to the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohija Oblast, that is, to Serbia. The most typical case of demarcating the border, however, arose with the demand of the villages of Germna, Neeav, Ogut, Metezevo, and Podrikonj in the Kriva Palanka okolija to belong to Serbia. The initiative for this rearrangement came from the famous Stamenko Stosic, a prewar representative (who was elected in 1931, 1935, and 1938) and a representative in the people's assembly of the People's Republic of Serbia after the war. Probably because of his origins in these villages, Stosic divided the local population, convincing some people that the neighboring villages were Bulgarian, but that they were Serbian. The villagers were persuaded that if they opted for adhesion to the Pcinje srez (with its center in Trgoviste), they would be able to purchase leather sandals on the free market (and not by using ration coupons), that they would not pay excise taxes or fees for pastures, and so on. And one day, a free market for rubber sandals was organized in Trgoviste just for the inhabitants of German and Nerav, using their connections and funds. The results of this propaganda could be seen in the first postwar census in which the older members of a family identified themselves as Macedonians, while the younger ones declared themselves Serbs. In January 1948, Stosic officially requested the adhesion of these villages to Serbia with the explanation that the local population spoke Serbian, wore Serbian clothes, and followed Serbian customs. Commissions were formed to examine this question, and the highest of these was the federal commission whose members included Lepa Perovic, Radovan Stijacic, Milovan Butanovic, and Boro Pekevski. According to the commission's report dated 16 March 1948, only the village of Nerav and part of the village of German gravitated more toward Trgoviste (before the war, Trgoviste was also within the Krivo Palanka okolija), but the language, customs, and dress in these villages were identical with those of other villages in the Krivo Palanka area. Such examples, of course, are numerous, and even witnesses from that time acknowledge that the determination of the border was conducted mainly through psychological prescriptions, propaganda, and persuasion in some villages that the inhabitants would profit economically if their area were tied to the market in another region.
