Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Current Population Survey &hyph; November 1994 Computer Ownership and Usage Supplement. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 715 hours. Number of Respondents: 55,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 0.8 minutes. Needs and Uses: We request OMB approval to collect data concerning ownership and usage of home computers as a one&hyph;time supplement to the November 1994 Current Population Survey which will be conducted during the week of November 13 &hyph; 19. Questions will concern current use of computers and on&hyph;line services, interest in using such services if they are not being currently used, price sensitivity, privacy concerns, and use by school&hyph;age children. We will collect these data at the request of the Department of Commerce (DOC). The data gathered will allow DOC to analyze computer ownership and use (including use of on&hyph;line services) by various demographic and geographic segments of the population. The information will permit a better understanding of the actions required to meet the goal of ``universal service'' (ensuring that information resources are available to all at affordable prices) contained in the ``Agenda for Action'' released by the Information Infrastructure Task Force on September 15, 1993. It will also provide data for evaluating the size of the market for National Information Infrastructure services and products, which is important for stimulating private investment &hyph;&hyph;another goal of the agenda. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: One time only. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313.
