FBIS4-12835 "drnes072_s_94013" FBIS-NES-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Iran Paper Views Status of Relations With Pakistan Paper Views Status of Relations With Pakistan LD1404105794 Tehran IRNA in English 0939 GMT 14 Apr 94 LD1404105794 Tehran IRNA English BFN [Text] Tehran, April 14, IRNA -- The English daily `KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL' here Thursday commented on Iran-Pakistan ties and said that all the official and flowery expressions of 'concrete fraternal relations' were rich in rhetoric but poor in action. The daily wrote in its editorial that though the two leaderships thought alike in almost all areas, regional and international, they moved with delay when it came to reinforcing their economic, social, scientific and cultural ties. The level of economic and cultural exchanges between Pakistan and Iran in the two years had been far from satisfactory, it added. Referring to Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri's visit to Pakistan and the agreements reached between officials of the two countries, the article hoped that the follow-up work would be coordinated and implemented professionally as planned and the senior officials would not get so pre-occupied with 'priority issues' on their return home that they would forget what was agreed upon and signed during the visit. The paper concluded by saying that "the existing situation is disturbing and may damage the excellent political ties Tehran and Islamabad enjoy. Our president and the leadership in Islamabad should identify and address issues to promote relations beneficial to the two Muslim peoples."
