FR940325-2-00177 FR940325-2-00084 The only effective means of removing reactor core decay heat is with the shutdown cooling mode of the RHR system. This requires both of the stated isolation valves to be in the open position. The shutdown cooling mode of the RHR system must be removed from service for approximately 24 hours to perform a local leak rate test (Type C) of its isolation valves. This is the time required to tag-out the system, drain the line, perform the test, refill the line, and return the system to service. To avoid overheating the reactor coolant system with the shutdown cooling mode inoperable, one of the following two conditions must exist: 1. The reactor needs to be shutdown for several months to permit sufficient reduction in decay heat levels for use of an alternate shutdown cooling method without placing the plant in the refueling condition. The alternate cooling method with the highest heat removal capacity is the Reactor Water Cleanup system in the blowdown mode. However, the reactor must be shutdown for more than 3 months before this method can handle the decay heat load. 2. The plant needs to be in the refueling condition; i.e., reactor head removed, reactor cavity flooded up and connected to the spent fuel pool. This permits the removal of the normal shutdown cooling system from operation and testing of these valves. A three week surveillance/maintenance outage is planned for spring 1994. However, the decay heat levels present during any outage less than several months precludes the use of the alternate cooling method without placing the plant in the refueling configuration. The exemption would preclude the need to place the plant in the refueling configuration prior to the next scheduled refueling outage. Without the exemption, the licensee would be required to remove the drywell and reactor heads and connect the reactor cavity to the spent fuel pool solely for the purpose of testing the shutdown cooling isolation valves. Placing the plant in the refueling configuration would significantly lengthen the spring 1994 outage and would require significant resources. Furthermore, placing the plant in the refueling configuration to accommodate testing of the isolation valves would significantly increase occupational radiation exposures. For these reasons, the licensee has determined that compliance with the regulation would result in undue hardship and costs. IV Section III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 states that Type C tests shall be performed during reactor shutdowns for refueling, at an interval not to exceed 2 years. The licensee has requested a one-time exemption from the regulations. The operating configuration of the shutdown cooling isolation valves and the RHR system when the reactor coolant system is pressurized (greater than 75 psig) substantially minimizes the possibility of gross leakage through these valves. A high reactor pressure interlock, as well as plant operating procedures, assures that these isolation valves are closed whenever reactor pressure is above 75 psig. This protects the low pressure RHR system from overpressurization. The RHR system suction piping is designed for 450 psig. Gross leakage while the reactor is pressurized would be detected by high pressure on the RHR suction piping or an increase in suppression pool inventory. Consequently, the maintenance of normal operating status of the RHR system assures the absence of gross leakage through these valves. These valves also receive an isolation signal in the event of a plant accident (reactor vessel low water level or high drywell pressure). This assures isolation of a potential leakage path from the reactor coolant system to the reactor building. For this path to exist, leakage through both isolation valves, and a breach of the RHR system piping would need to occur simultaneously. Since the isolation valves are maintained closed with the reactor pressurized, it is improbable the leakage through the valves will increase while the plant is operating. The redundant isolation valves provide two leakage barriers which limit the pathway leakage rate to that experienced by the valve with smallest leakage rate. For these reasons, the potential for significant leakage to the reactor building by way of the shutdown cooling line is minimal.
