Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the enlarged meeting. Attending the meeting were leading comrades, including Sun Weiben, Zhou Wenhua, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Chen Yunlin, Yang Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li Qinglin, and Yu Jingchang. During the meeting Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech in which he made arrangements for the province's central work at present. He pointed out: It is imperative to display the spirit of being highly responsible for the party and the people to realistically do a good job in dealing with the practical difficulties cropping up in the people's livelihood and to tighten the flesh-blood ties between the party and the people. He said: During the period before the Spring Festival, the party and government leading organs at all levels throughout the province should do a good job in organizing their personnel to go deep into grass-roots levels to deal with the practical problems. Leading cadres in the party and government organs at all levels should go deep into enterprises, rural villages, schools, and poor households in line with their work division and duty share so as to directly listen to the opinions and demands raised by workers, peasants, and intellectuals, as well as to deal with on the spot the prominent difficulties cropping up in the people's livelihood. The provincial level departments should follow the system of being responsible for helping the difficulty-plagued units to go deep into the money-losing enterprises and poor counties to deal with as much as possible the problems cropping up in production and livelihood. They should concentrate their efforts on successfully dealing with the prominent difficulties cropping up in the following three fields of the people's livelihood: 1) Efforts should be made to adopt every possible way and means to deal with the problem of having staff members and workers be in arrears with pay. 2) A good job should be done in realistically giving a helping hand to poor households. 3) A good job should be done in realistically providing supplies for festive markets and stabilizing commodity prices. As for these problems, it is necessary to strictly assign duties for personnel to deal with them. As for localities and departments that have encountered problems because of paying less attention to the difficulties and adopting ineffective measures, their leading personnel should be held responsible for the problems. Sun Weiben pointed out at the same time: It is imperative to correctly deal with the relation between reform or development and stability. Party committees should regard the work of maintaining the social peace as the first-grade matter of their current work and be greatly determined to correct the phenomena of passiveness and corruption. They should vigorously publicize the social morales of selflessly making contributions, waging arduous struggles, and stressing thriftiness. He said: All of these require us to be greatly determined to deal with the problems of seeking private gains by taking advantage of power through the methods of extorting money from the masses by making things difficult and to handle the problems of extravagance and waste as well as of abnormal consumption. Sun Weiben also pointed out: It is imperative to enhance the comprehensive management of public security, to create a safe and orderly environment for the people's work and livelihood, and to mobilize the entire party and society to make concerted efforts to consolidate or develop the political situation of stability and unity.
