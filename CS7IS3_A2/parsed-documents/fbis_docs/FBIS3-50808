These statements were made following publication of an edition of the U.S. newspaper THE NEW HERALD, in which an official of the U.S. Embassy in Honduras warned investors about the risks of investing in Honduras due to a disrespect for the law. Chahin expressed his surprise over the publication since U.S. authorities have spoken "highly" of Honduras following the approval of the Copyright Law. However, Chahin said, the problem now is that illegal expropriations "leave a lot to be desired from the Honduran legal system, which makes me very sorry. Therefore, I must tell the next legal authorities so that they will be punctual and legalistic." Chahin regretted that situations of this type tarnish the level of competitiveness Honduras offers to foreign investors by having the least expensive manual labor in Central America. In Honduras, one minute of work only costs nine cents, while in other countries, such as Costa Rica, it costs about 13.5 cents. Chahin added, "We are efficient and competitive, our assembly plants have the highest quality in the area, and we have the cheapest food staples. The only aspect we do not handle very well is bank interest rates because of the high legal cost." Chahin noted that situations of this type jeopardize Honduras' benefits in the Generalized System of Preferences, under which over $100-million worth of products are exported annually to the United States.
