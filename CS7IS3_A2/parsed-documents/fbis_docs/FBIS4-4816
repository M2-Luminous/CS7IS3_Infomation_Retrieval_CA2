It is very significant that the national meeting of party cell secretaries is held at a time when all party members and people firmly defend and adhere to the socialism of our own style, and demonstrate its superiority and vitality by smashing all sorts of challenges and obstructive maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries. [applause] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a message in which he warmly congratulated the delegates to the meeting, as well as all the party cell secretaries of the entire party. He also clearly expounded the programmatic tasks of the work of party secretaries, and ways and means of its implementation to bring about a new upturn in the work in conformity with the requirements of development of the party and revolution. [applause] This is a highest honor to the delegates to the meeting, as well as the party cell secretaries of the entire party, and greatly encourages them. [applause] The current conference initiated by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il personally is a historic meeting, the first of its kind since the founding of the WPK. [applause] It will powerfully demonstrate the revolutionary faith and unshakable will of the entire party cell secretaries and party members who have resolved to remain loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] and have accomplished the cause of socialism to the end without the slightest vacillation under today's complex situation. Likewise, it will also mark an epochal turning point in further strengthening the WPK into an invincible party and accelerating the general march of socialism of our own style by enhancing party cell secretaries' role and function. [applause] Comrades: A long time has passed since our party's history took root and the Korean revolution grew. The WPK scored great accomplishments on the road of a long and arduous struggle, which contributes greatly to realizing mankind's independent cause and triumphantly advancing the Korean revolution. [applause] Under the revolutionary banner of the chuche idea, our party audaciously overcame manifold difficulties and trials by organizing and mobilizing the popular masses, firmly believing in them. In so doing, our party turned our country into an independent, self-reliant, and self-defending socialist power that is the envy of all the people of the world. Furthermore, it staunchly defended the most superior socialism of our own style centered on the fatherland, the revolution, and the popular masses, smashing all the enemies' aggressive and provocative maneuvers. [applause] Our party is highly trusted by all the Korean people, as well as by international progressive people, because it excellently carried out the national and international duty of the Korean revolution and the international revolution. [applause] Through the long, difficult, and glorious struggle, the WPK has been strengthened and has developed into a mature and tested party with accumulated great revolutionary achievements and extraordinarily rich experience and into the most mighty revolutionary party that can advocate and complete the chuche revolutionary cause and the socialist and communist cause to the end through any storm and trial. [applause] For the past few decades, taking the opportunity of the collapse of communist and labor parties, which had pioneered socialist causes in various countries, the imperialists and reactionaries unprecedentedly strengthened their antisocialist and anti-republic maneuvers. Amid such a circumstance, it is a great source of pride and unequaled dignity of our party members and people that they are vigorously advancing in front of the times and mankind, while firmly defending and advocating the chuche socialism following the leadership of the indomitable party. [applause] Party cells, which are the most basic organization of the party to strengthen and develop our party and to enable the Korean revolution to advance in victory, and which are direct combat units for implementing the party's line and policy, played a very important role. In a congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the meeting, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: The founding, strengthening, and development of our party cannot be separated from the strengthening and development of the basic party organization -- party cells. Party cells are the most basic organizations of the party, which is a organic body of party organizations. A man is healthy when all cells composing the human body are healthy. The party can become stronger and properly carry out its mission and duty as the guide of society only when all party cells composing the party smoothly play their functions and roles. A party without strong party cells deeply rooted in party members and popular masses is merely a building in the sky that cannot even maintain its own existence. This is a lofty truth and a serious lesson that was proven during the process of the construction of our party and by the history of the international communist movement. For the first time in the history of the communist movement, the WPK had the chuche idea -- the most scientific and revolutionary world outlook of the working class -- as the guideline and brilliantly embodied it and uniquely pioneered a new road for building a revolutionary party. The WPK is a new chuche-type revolutionary party founded by the method of forming basic party organizations first, and then expanding and strengthening them. [applause] In the historic Karun meeting held in 1930, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song presented a unique party founding policy of founding a party not by promulgating the party center first, but by forming basic party organizations after sufficient arrangements and then endlessly expanding and strengthening them. This policy put forth by the great leader was the chuche-oriented policy that elucidated the most correct way to make it possible to solve all the problems in founding the party smoothly in conformity with the specific reality of our country and the demand of our revolution and to build a strong and mighty revolutionary party of the working class. [applause] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the first party organization, the origin of our party, with the new generation young communists, whom he himself had brought up immediately after the Karun meeting. This became the original form and mother's body of the party organizations that were organized one after another thereafter. The anti-Japanese armed struggle, which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song organized and led, was a sacred war for democracy and liberation to defeat the Japanese imperialist aggressors and restore the stolen country under the banner of the chuche idea. At the same time, it was a glorious struggle to establish the revolutionary party, the general staff of the Korean revolution. [applause] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, organizing and leading the overall Korean revolution, with the anti-Japanese armed struggle at its center, brought up numerous communists who were firmly armed with the working class revolutionary idea and tempered in the practice of the revolutionary struggle. At the same time, he firmly realized the purity of the communist ranks and their ideological and volitional unity. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song saw to it that many party organizations were formed in the country and in the Korean residential areas in the northeastern region of China, and orderly established the uniform guiding system of party organizations of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, thus firmly realizing the party's leadership for the overall Korean revolution. Because our party had a strong organizational and ideological foundation of party building and the glorious revolutionary tradition, which were formed in the blaze of the long and arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, it was able to promulgate its founding to the entire world without delay on a solid base in the difficult and complicated condition after the liberation. [applause] After its founding, our party accepted many advanced elements from the working popular masses, including workers, peasants, and intellectuals; expanded the party ranks; and organized many party cells everywhere there were party members and the masses, including plants and rural areas. At the same time, our party emphasized strongly bringing up the organized party cells and enhancing their role. Under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the party cells and party cores increased in great numbers and the party members' political and ideological standard and vanguard roles were enhanced. Therefore, our party was brought up strong organizationally and ideologically within a short period of its founding, took root deep in the masses, and was able to smoothly carry out its leadership role for the revolution and construction as a ruling party following its founding. During the Fatherland Liberation War, our party further strengthened the party cells' militant function and role and enhanced the party members' party consciousness in conformity with the wartime conditions. By so doing, our party vigorously organized and mobilized all party members, soldiers of the People's Army, and all the people of the country to the struggle to win the war. By forming the party organizations, including party cells, in the units, large and small, of the Korean People's Army [KPA] of all levels, our party ensured that the party's leadership of the People's Army is strengthened and the party's political work is vigorously conducted in the Army. Even in those busy days of shouldering the heavy burden of the war all by himself, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song went deep among the soldiers of the People's Army and the people and vigorously aroused them to new victories and exploits. At the same time, he exercised his leadership so that the party cell work is militantly conducted and core party members are brought up in large numbers in conformity with wartime conditions. During the days of fierce war, the heroic defenders of Wolmido and 1211 Meter Hill, the 10 party members of Nagwon, and all other party members, soldiers of the People's Army, and people highly displayed the boundless loyalty to the party and the leader, enthusiastic love for the country, and mass heroism, and attained a historic victory in the difficult war with the joint imperialist forces led by the U.S. imperialists, thus demonstrating the spirit of the heroic Korea to the entire world. [applause] Our party firmly established the chuche in all fields after the war, firmly and strongly brought up the basic party organizations, including the party cells, and enhanced the party members' party consciousness and vanguard role in order to vigorously push ahead with the socialist revolution and construction. In the difficult days after the war, our party cells and party members, with the firm faith to believe and follow the great leader with all their hearts and minds, resolutely protected and defended the party Central Committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song. Effecting the Chollima upsurge in socialist construction, they resolutely crushed the anticommunist offensive and push-to-the-North commotion of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges and the antiparty and counterrevolutionary maneuvers of the factionalist elements colluding with outside forces. After the liquidation of factions, which did enormous harm to the party and the revolution's development with the establishment of the socialist system and with the passage of its history, our party vigorously organized and mobilized all the party cells and party members to the struggle to further enhance the party's unity and cohesion and leadership role and to effect a revolutionary upsurge in all fronts of socialist construction. The great leader put forth the formula for the first time in history that the basis of party work is work with people, and exercised his leadership so that the party organizations of all levels, including the party cells, may conduct effective organizational and political work to firmly rally the party members and masses around the party and organize and mobilize them to the implementation of the party policy. With ceaseless on-the-spot guidance, he energetically guided the party cells' work. Under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the party organizations of all levels, including the party cells, were brought up strong and the party members' party consciousness and vanguard role were further enhanced. This enabled our party to strengthen its militant might and leadership role enormously, thereby bringing forth an unprecedented revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction. As a result, the relations of kinship between the party and the popular masses became so firm that no force could break them. [applause] In conformity with the demand of our party's chuche-oriented party building ideology, the work to strengthen the party cells was more vigorously pushed ahead in the grand struggle to model the entire party membership and entire society on the chuche idea under the outstanding and tested leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il wisely led the work to bring up strong the party cells, the lowest level basic party organization, and enhance their role in order to strengthen and develop our party to be the chuche-type revolutionary party forever and to develop the chuche revolutionary cause continuously and vigorously. The works the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published early in the 1960's: "On Effectively Conducting the Guidance for Party Members' Party Life in Conformity With the Party Cells' Duty," "The Party Cells Should Correctly Organize the Party Assignment and Sum It Up in a Timely Manner," "Let Us Strengthen the Party Members' Ideological and Volitional Unity and Cohesion Based on the Leader's Revolutionary Idea," and many other works of his became a programmatic guideline to improve the party cell work and the party members' party life. [applause] In that period, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave on-the-spot guidance in detail to the party cells of the Department of Political and Economic Science of the College of Economics of Kim Il-song University; of the No. 1 machinery work team of Pyongyang Spinning Machinery Plant's tool shop; of the rolling machine repairing team of Hungnam Fertilizer Plant synthetic shop; of Komidae, Ohyon-ri, Yanan county, South Hwanghae Province; of the No. 6 party cell of the actors and actresses group of the Korean Film Studio; and many other party cells. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il declared it as our party's supreme program to model the entire society after the chuche idea and presented the party construction policy on modeling the entire society after the chuche idea in the 1970's. He presented principles for establishing the party's unitary ideological system in accordance with the new demand of our party and the developing revolution and enabled party cells to vigorously push out with the work of raising party members as enthusiastic, chuche-type communist revolutionaries, who are boundlessly loyal to the party and the leader, and who uphold the leadership of the party central. [applause] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has led party cells to effectively carry out work to firmly arm all party members with our party's chuche idea and to make them firmly establish the view of revolution, the view of leader, the view of organization, and the view of masses. Developing the way of summing up the party life, which was used by anti-Japanese guerrillas, in accordance with today's reality, he established a new system of summing up the party life for the entire party. He has also made it possible to regularize and standardize the party life and has led party members to constantly season their party-oriented traits [tangsong] by participating in the party life with a sincere and self-conscious attitude and with a correct view of party organization. The national party cell secretaries training held in May 1991 was a remarkable momentum in strengthening our party cells. In the historic letter "Let Us Strengthen Party Cells" he sent to the national party cell secretaries training, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il presented the programmatic task of further strengthening party cells in accordance with the development of our party and the revolution to create a new turning point in party cells' activities, and he clearly elucidated the way to implement it. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: "Let us make all party cells loyal ones." This is an important slogan presented by our party today, as well as a primary task that party organizations should implement. All party cells and cell secretaries have vigorously struggled for the past three years to make each party cell a cell with boundless loyalty to the party and the leader, upholding the historic letter "Let Us Strengthen Party Cells" that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent to the national party cell secretaries training. Many party members of various party cells, including the party cells of the No. 1 machinery work team of Pyongyang spinning machinery plant's tool shop and of the high-speed heading section of Tokchon mine's No. 4 pit in the Tokchon district mining complex, humbly sent letters of loyalty to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il expressing their will to be faithful to the chuche revolutionary cause to the end and to entirely entrust their destinies to him, following the party invariably, and they have been brilliantly putting their determination into practice. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent his personal letter of love to many party cells and party members, extending his sublime intent to give them the greatest honor and confidence and boundless expectations and encouragement. [applause] As mentioned above, the leader [yongdoja] firmly trusts party members and gives them great confidence and benevolence, and party members absolutely trust and follow the leader and fulfill their loyal and filial duties for him. Therefore, our party has become great today, and socialism of our own style becomes more victorious as days go by. [applause] In the course of the vigorous movement to create loyal party cells, many people have grown to be genuine loyal servants, who faithfully trust and follow the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as well as resolutely protect and defend the party and the leader [suryong] politically, ideologically, and death-defyingly. There are lofty examples and steady efforts of cell secretaries, who are boundlessly loyal to our party, in the heroic struggle and precious feats registered by many party members and working people, who protected and defended the party and the leader politically, ideologically, and death-defyingly by sacrificing even their valuable lives in unexpected emergencies. The lofty traits of Comrade Hyon Chang-sik, a party cell secretary of the Pukkyongju railway section of the Kaechon Railway General Bureau's Chongju railway division, who guaranteed the safety of a train in a heavily rainy midnight by displaying his peerless self-sacrificing and heroic spirit; of Comrade Yi Chong-hun, a secretary of No. 1 party cell of the fishing sector of the Pochon Fishery Cooperative in Myongchun County, North Hamgyong Province, who threw himself into the dark blue sea without hesitation after handing over his life vest and portraits of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to a young member of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea as all fishermen who were with him on a fishing boat adopted the general party cells meeting's decision to keep their portraits undamaged, risking their lives when the boat faced a crisis of shipwreck due to a sudden typhoon and a tidal wave; and of party members of this cell show our party members' firm and pure loyalty to the party and the leader. [applause] Party cells and cell secretaries are devotedly struggling to resolutely protect, defend, and add luster to the achievements made by the party and the leader. Considering our party's honorable, chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition to be the lifeline of our revolution, party cells and cell secretaries are resolutely struggling to firmly protect it under any stormy circumstances and to thoroughly embody it in all areas of the revolution and construction. A great number of party cell secretaries and party members throughout the country have discovered scores of thousands of new revolutionary slogans, remains, and relics in the past several years alone, going up and down the rocky mountains, with the revolutionary determination to glorify our party's honorable revolutionary tradition through generations. When an unexpected fire took place in the mountains one day several years ago, party cell secretaries of Yongsindae, Saebyol County, North Hamgyong Province surrounded trees engraved with slogans thick and threefold and ultimately protected the slogans despite of being seriously burnt in the fierce fire. [applause] There are many party cell secretaries who are making devoted efforts to further glorify our party's revolutionary tradition. For example, Comrade Choe Chae-yong, a party cell secretary of the Sinpa Revolutionary Museum, has located and examined many underground revolutionary organizations and revolutionary remains of the anti-Japanese struggling period for the past 26 years. Party cells of units, to which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave on-the-spot guidance, are protecting and defending the great achievements of the party and the leader by completely implementing tasks presented during their on-the-spot guidance. In the work to follow and learn about the No. 2 cell party members of the fifth bureau of KCNA, the party cells and cell secretaries are closely linking and substantially carrying out a living example of loyally upholding the great leader by all the generations of the revolution and the work to follow and learn the positive example that is being manifested in their party. Thus, many loyalists and dutiful children of the nineties were fostered. Through the loyal party cell creation movement, the party cells are fostering the party members to advocate, adhere to, and all the more elucidate socialism of our own style centered on the popular masses so they can become resolute fighters. In the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's immortal classical works including, "Socialism of Our Own Style Centered on the Popular Masses Is Invincible and Ever-Victorious," "The Historical Lesson in Socialist Construction and Our Party's General Line," "On the Fundamental Problem of the Revolutionary Party Construction," and "Slander of Socialism Cannot Be Tolerated," he wholly analyzed and summed up our party's immortal revolutionary achievements and struggle experiences that were achieved through his iron-like theories and gem-like theses while walking along the long and glorious road of the historical lesson of socialist construction and as the socialist ruling party. He also made it possible to all the more adhere to and elucidate socialism of our own style, and brightly elucidated the future road to revive socialism from a worldwide scope. [applause] The party cells and cell secretaries regarded the chuche-oriented scientific socialist ideology and theory elucidated by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as a firm guiding principle. They also freshly carried out through various forms and methods the indoctrination work for the party members and workers to deeply recognize the truth of the true superiority and invincible vitality of socialism of our own style, the inevitability of the ultimate victory of socialist cause, and that we will be victorious if we defend socialism and die if we throw it away, by linking them with the lively reality. Today, as long as our party members and people are possessed with the spirit that the Korean nation is the best--that is the spirit that our leader is the best, that our party is the best, that our chuche idea is the best, and that the spirit that socialism of our own style centered on the popular masses is the best--and are possessed with the wise leadership of the party and the leader; the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses; and a strong self-supporting national economy and self-defensive national defense power--they have the firm faith that our socialism is invincible and ever-victorious. With this, they are carrying out a devoted and heroic struggle to thoroughly advocate, adhere to, and all the more elucidate socialism of our own style that is their living and life. [applause] The party cells and party members of the ship, Loyalty No. 5, of the 24 May export goods fishery work site were confronted with the South Korean puppet naval vessels many times on the high seas during the past several years. However, each time they triumphantly fully loaded their ship with goods by smashing [chitbusyoborigo] the rascals' provocative maneuvers with the faith of victory and spirit of exterminating the enemy without the slightest wavering. Also, when the enemies made provocations by burying thousands of explosives, the party members of (Yiman)-ri, Panmun county, Kaesong city, held open party meetings and vigorously sang songs like "Let's Defend Socialism," at places where the rascals were clearly looking and removed all the explosives, thus making the enemies shiver with fear. Such struggle feats, as well as other struggle feats carried out by many party cells and party members, show well the resoluteness and firmness of the faith and will of our party members and people, which are preciously treasured in their hearts. However, the imperialists and reactionaries rave to block, suffocate, and crush [apsal] us, they cannot by any means surprise our party members and people who are resolutely fighting for the just cause by impregnably uniting around the party and the leader. The rascals' maneuver is rather all the more encouraging the revolutionary will and struggle enthusiasm of our party members and people who are highly upholding the revolutionary banner and socialist banner. [applause] Upholding the slogan, "What the party decides, we will do!" the party cells and cell secretaries are vigorously inspiring party members and workers to the valuable struggle to strengthen the might of socialism in our country and to fully demonstrate its genuine superiority and vitality to the entire world. The party members and workers registered proud feats on all fronts of socialist construction by more highly displaying loyalty and filial piety to the party and to the leader and invincible faith in and indomitable will for the socialist cause even under complex situations and repeated difficulties. Thanks to their devoted struggle, the might of our socialism has been consolidated into an ever-victorious and indomitable one. [applause] By vigorously waging the struggle to thoroughly carry to accomplishment our party's self-defense military line, party cells are greatly contributing to strengthening the nation's defense capabilities so we can smash the enemy in a stroke, no matter how strong it may be. Since we have highly upheld the respected general Kim Chong-il as supreme commander of the KPA and chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission, the traditional fine custom of military-civilian unity has bloomed more brilliantly. Our party members and workers are sincerely looking after soldiers of the People's Army--fighters of comrade supreme commander--just like their own brothers, and soldiers of the People's Army are unhesitatingly dedicating their youth and lives to defending happy life, property, and lives of the people. [applause] Last year, when the U.S. imperialists frantically waged a nuclear inspection row and the Team Spirit 1993 joint military exercise in a bid to isolate and crush our republic--the stronghold of socialism--a touch-and-go crisis resulted in which a war threatened to break out at any time, all soldiers of the People's Army, who heartily accepted the order of the respected general Kim Chong-il, and people, rose like a rigorous mountain and honorably defended the socialist fatherland and revolutionary gains. [applause] The party cells and cell secretaries are devotedly struggling to further consolidate and develop the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses, which is the most precious asset of our party and the revolution and invincible might of our socialism. The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught us that the whole party and all people, inheriting the glorious tradition of our party and revolution on the single-hearted unity, should firmly unite with dear Comrade Kim Chong-il. By upholding his teaching, the party cells and cell secretaries firmly grasped as the key task in the work of party cells to further strengthen the single-hearted unity of the party and revolutionary ranks, which is a decisive factor for success in the chuche revolutionary cause and for the destiny of socialism. [applause] Today all party members and people, in firm unity with the party and the leader in one mind and one intention, are breathing only according to the party's idea and will, no matter how many of us there may be; are making exactly the same remarks as that of the party; and are moving as one only according to the party's order. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il inherited intact the respected leader's lofty intent for welfare of the people and society, and implemented politics of boundlessly lofty benevolence and humanity. Highly praising the fine custom of communists and beautiful acts of pioneers who dedicated everything to the nation, to the people, to society and to groups, he saw to it that all party members and people follow and learn from them. The fine custom of communists has brilliantly bloomed each day among our party members and workers, such as an act of voluntarily advancing to mines and cooperative farms, to which the party directs strength, without wishing any reward, honor, and comfortable life, by departing their beloved home and work site; an act of unhesitatingly offering their own lives to rescue people who are at the point of death; an act of sharing their lives with soldiers who were wounded and disabled in the sacred struggle to defend the nation, by marrying them; and an act of fostering and sincerely looking after orphans and old men without sons, like their own sons and daughters and parents. This is a great pride of our party and people, and is the true shape of our-style socialism under which the whole country constitutes a great harmonious and happy family, sharing the destiny. [applause] In the course of vigorously waging the movement to create loyal party cells, the party cells and cell secretaries effected great improvement in strengthening the organization and guidance of party life of the party members. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il stressed that the party cells are the stronghold in the party life of party members, and that proper organization and guidance of party life are the basic mission of the party cells. Only when the party's cell secretaries properly carry out organization and guidance of the party life of party members can they successfully resolve all problems raised in strengthening our party and in enhancing its guiding role. Keenly realizing this, the party's cell secretaries are making active efforts to establish a diversified and revolutionary outlook on the party life among the party members. The party's cell secretaries are consciously leading the party members so they realize that party organizations are their protector that forges blood ties between the leader [suryong] and party members and that looks after and leads them to constantly glorify their political life and to love and respect party organizations. The party's cell secretaries are leading the party members so that they consciously accept guidance and control by party organizations. Today our party members truly follow party organizations, just as a son does his mother, and call on their party cells to frankly speak out what they cannot speak even to their own family and relatives, thus seeking new encouragement and strength from party organizations and party cells. All of our party members are participating in the party life voluntarily and faithfully according to the demand of the party's regulations and of the rule in the party life. They assumed the position of equal party members worthy of revolutionaries who voluntarily joined the party, not at a directive of anyone else, for the party and for the revolution, regardless of their positions, merits, conditions and circumstances. Thus, they are constantly disciplining their loyalty to the party. The party's cell secretaries are leading party members so that they enhance their consciousness of the party, making such consciousness their constitution, and put emphasis on enhancing their loyalty to the party and to the leader in the course of faithfully implementing the decision of party organization and assignment given by the party. They are leading the party members so they will successfully carry out the revolutionary tasks on a lofty political and ideological level. The party's cell secretaries are leading the party members so that they correctly realize that the party life is a course of implementing the revolutionary tasks assigned by the party and the purpose of strengthening the party life is to satisfactorily carry out the revolutionary tasks. The party's cell secretaries make efforts to ensure that all factors involving party conference, summing up of the party life, organization of assignments, study, and guidance of party life, will contribute to implementing revolutionary tasks. The party's cell secretaries are leading the party members so that they play the vanguard role in satisfactorily implementing the revolutionary tasks. By establishing the revolutionary outlook on study among the party members, the party's cell secretaries are leading the party members so that they will educate the masses with temperament and traits as political activists, and will fulfill honorable missions and duties as educator and propagandist of the masses to actively inspire the masses to implementing the revolutionary tasks. The party's cell secretaries are the core of our party and primary political functionaries who directly organize and guide the party life of party members by bearing the responsibility for our party's lowest [maltan] basic organizations. Therefore, it is a prerequisite and important guarantee for strengthening the party cells to properly organize the party's cell secretaries and to enhance their role. After the national lecture of party cell secretaries party committees at all levels held more firmly meetings of party cell secretaries, attended by those party members who are infinitely loyal to the party and the leader [suryong], whose party and working class position are firm, and who enjoy confidence among party members and are firmly prepared politically and administratively. Party organizations, including party committees of Mangyongdae-kuyok of Pyongyang, Onsong County of North Hamgyong Province, and Songjin Steel Works, have given the work directives to party cell secretaries in a timely manner, and organized lectures, workshops, and discussion sessions for party cell secretaries on a regular basis and in a substantial manner. In these party organizations, party functionaries directly go on the spot to assist party cell secretaries in conformity with the party's demand, "Let us party functionaries mingle with party cells and the masses." Today, our party has hundreds of thousands of vigorous and militant party cells which have grown up with the first party organization organized by a few young communists in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle as the parent body. Through these party cells our party members and people are breathing together with our party regardless of whether they live in remote rural villages, islands, and oceans which are far from the fatherland. [applause] Party cells and party cell secretaries have more firmly rallied the masses of all strata around the party by properly carrying out their work with the masses. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has elucidated that properly carrying out the work with the masses is an important problem related to the destiny of the party and the revolution and that it is an important duty of party cells and party cell secretaries. Party cells and cell secretaries, by concentrating special efforts on their work with the masses, have seen to it that they thoroughly abide by their class position without forgetting their past situation and class origin and play the leading role in upholding the party and the leader [suryong] and safeguarding and defending socialism. Party cells have led the bereaved families of revolutionaries, the families of fallen soldiers, the families of those killed by the enemy, disabled veterans, and discharged soldiers, and other core masses to be model in all fields of their work and life and to be loyal to the party and the leader generation after generation. By paying interest to indoctrinating young people of new generations, who are the successors to our revolution, in a revolutionary manner party cells and cell secretaries are fostering all of them into young vanguards who are infinitely loyal to the party, the leader, and the socialist cause like the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters--who were infinitely loyal to the great leader [suryong] on the days of anti-Japanese struggle--and like the heroic fighters--who struggled for the party, the leader, the fatherland, and the people at the risk of their lives during the fatherland liberation war. Party cell secretaries have become the standard bearers who lead intellectuals in their units to carry out the oath they swore before the party at the Korean intellectuals meeting and, thus, to perform the honorable mission and duty as the party's eternal companion, faithful supporter, and outstanding adviser and as the enthusiastic protector and thorough implementer of the party's policy in the rewarding struggle of resolutely safeguard and defend the party and the leader [suryong] and of demonstrating the honor of chuche Korea and further strengthening the might of our own style socialism. Party cells and cell secretaries trust the masses as indicated in the party policy of putting emphasis on their present work and lives, rather than on their family background and social and political life habit. They are also leading the masses to sincerely trust the party and follow it. It is thanks to the devoted struggle and unheralded efforts of all party cell secretaries that the WPK has been strengthened and developed into an ever-victorious revolutionary party taking roots deep among the masses and that our party and people are winning victory in succession in the political and military confrontation with the enemies who are running wild to crush our socialist cause. [applause] By exerting efforts to possess the 10 characters of cell secretaries set forth by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, our party cell secretaries are fondly called "our cell secretary," "our cell secretary father" among party members and working people and are highly respected and loved. Among our party cell secretaries, there are martyrs like Comrade Nam Sung-u, the late party cell secretary of Unit 3, Pit No. 3 of Chuhung Mine, who sacrificed himself without hesitation to save a revolution comrade at a critical moment; and there are models of war victory movement of the nineties like Comrade Son Suk-chin, secretary cell No. 7 of the People's Clinic of Hosan County, who devoted her all for the recovery of patients working as a nurse for 35 years since her days as a short-haired young girl. The tens of thousands of party cell secretaries, who are endlessly loyal to the party and the leader and devoting their everything for the fatherland and the people, are precious treasures for our party and revolution. It is our party and people's great pride to have such outstanding party cell secretaries. [applause] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are putting the party cell secretaries at the highest by calling them our party's core, professional revolutionaries without particular position, and unpaid and unheralded heroes, and are warmly holding their hands and leading them to properly implement their honorable mission and duty as the supervisors of the lowest basic-level party organization and elementary political functionaries. The WPK was given birth and brought up by the mother body Construction Comrades Company, which was our party's first party organization personally formed by the great leader. The fact that the WPK was able to strengthen and develop itself into an ever-victorious indomitable party with tens of thousands of combat party cells endlessly loyal to the party, the leader, and the chuche revolutionary cause; and the fact that our party cell secretaries were able to fulfill their honorable mission and obligations as elementary political functionaries in charge of the party's basic organizations while leading happy lives and walking along the single rewarding road of struggle are indeed wholly a result of the wise leadership and family love of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and a great victory and lofty fruition of our party's unique line for the construction of party organizations. [applause] Taking the opportunity of the meaningful occasion of the meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party, I pay the utmost honor and the warmest thanks to the great leader of our party and our people Comrade Kim Il-song, and to our party's outstanding leader and the supreme commander of the Korea People's Army [KPA] dear Comrade Kim Chong-il with the single heart of enthusiastic admiration and endless loyalty from the meeting participants and all the party members and people. [applause] Comrades, our revolution, which has victoriously advanced under the banner of chuche ideology, stepped into a new stage of development today, and our party and people are faced with the weighty and honorable task of defending and advocating the popular masses-centered socialism of our style from the challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries, endlessly developing it, and expediting the achievement of the nation's long-cherished desire of the cause of fatherland reunification. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To smash [chitpusigo] all kinds of challenges and interfering maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries, and to defend, advocate and further glorify our socialism is an honorable task of our party and people. As in the past, so in the future, we should vigorously expedite the ultimate victory of chuche revolutionary cause and socialist cause by courageously overcoming all trials and difficulties with the might of the single-hearted unity displayed by all the party members and people, who are firmly united around the party and the leader, and with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, and by continued reform and advancement while upholding the banner of chuche ideology. Our-style socialism, which has embodied and built chuche ideology under the leadership of our party, is true socialism designed in conformity with the popular masses' aspiration and demand for independence. Our people have acquired the belief through experience from actual living that the road of defending, advocating, and glorifying our socialism, which guarantees true freedom and equality, and a happy and rewarding life, is the only way to a glorious life and to victory. Socialism is our people's living and life. The question of smashing the vicious political and ideological offensives, military threats, and economic blockade maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries, and defending, advocating, and completing to the end the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style depends on how to strengthen the party, which is the staff department of revolution, and how to enhance the leader role of the party. The party cells are the bedrock which upholds our party, and the revolutionary outposts which defend our socialism. The party cells are the bases for assimilating the party members as revolutionaries and working class, linking them with the party Central Committee, and achieving the blood-tie relationship between the party and the masses. They are the direct combat units for organizing and mobilizing the party members and working people to follow and implement the party's line and policy. To strengthen the party cells is to strengthen the main body of our party and our revolution and an important guarantee for advocating and glorifying our socialism. All party cells must be strong so that our party becomes strong, and that the main body of our revolution can bear indomitable might. When party cells properly carry out their functions and roles, the superiority and vitality of our country's socialism can be highly demonstrated. [applause] In his congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the meeting, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: With high responsibility and sense of honor, all the party cell secretaries should make their cells as loyal cells endlessly faithful to the party and as combat cells that vigorously organize and mobilize the masses to the struggle to defend, advocate, and glorify the socialist cause. In order to make all the party cells endlessly faithful to the party and the leader, and in order to make them combat organizations for defending, advocating, and glorifying the socialist cause, the five major tasks of the party cell presented in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the meeting, and the pragmatic tasks presented by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in his historic letter "Let Us Strengthen the Party Cells" sent to the participants of the national party cell secretaries training held in May 1991 should be thoroughly implemented. These are the basic duty and the most honorable and responsible revolutionary tasks of the party cell and cell secretaries today. [applause] To uphold the unitary leadership of the party and the leader with loyalty is the very life of the party cells. [applause] To guarantee the unitarity of leadership within the party is the fundamental principle of the party construction and activities. When all party cells become loyal cells endlessly faithful to the leadership of the party and the leader, the party can be strengthened and developed into an ever-victorious and indomitable revolutionary party. The socialist cause is the cause of the working class, and also the cause of the leader and the party. The leadership of the party and the leader is the decisive guarantee for the victorious advance of the socialist cause. [applause] Today, our party's cause, the chuche revolutionary cause, has been brilliantly inherited and is being developed under the outstanding and tested leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has an excellent appearance and qualification of the people-oriented leader [yongdoja]. [applause] Our party has satisfactorily resolved [wonmanhui haegyol] the issue of inheriting leadership in compliance with the demand of the revolution's development and the popular masses' aspirations. This is the proudest achievement in party building and firmly guarantees the bright future and brilliant victory of our party and our revolution. [applause] All party cell secretaries must persistently carry out the work to establish the party's monolithic leadership [yuilchok yongdo] system, cherish deep in their hearts great pride in upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center of unity, the center of unity, and the supreme commander of the revolutionary armed forces, and uphold the party's leadership with loyalty, devotion, and single-mindedness. [applause] To have single-hearted, unchanging loyalty toward the party, it is important for party cell secretaries and party members to positively learn from the firm attitude and position of Comrade Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will, toward the leader [suryong]. Because Comrade Yi In-mo had an incomparable faith and will for his leader [suryong], his leader [chidoja], he adhered to to the end the revolutionary principle and clear conscience as a WPK member despite the enemy's harsh tortures and various appeasement ploys when he was serving his prison term behind the enemy lines for as many as 34 years. And, after entering the embrace of the socialist fatherland, he tried to repay the love and considerations of the party and the leader [suryong] and wrote refined dedicated poems and lyrics which extol the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the savior of his destiny [unmyongui kuseju]. Those poems and lyrics impressed all people. Party cell secretaries must substantially carry out the educational work of instilling a revolutionary outlook on the leader [suryong], an outlook on morality, and an outlook on life among the party members by closely linking this work to the work of learning from the firm attitude and position of Comrade Yi In-mo toward the party and the leader [suryong] and his high party spirits. In this way, party cell secretaries must raise the party members into indomitable communist revolutionaries who adhere to the resolves, which they conveyed when joining the party, share the same destiny with the party, and sincerely uphold the party and the leader [suryong] without any personal desire, change of mind, or hypocrisy under any circumstances or environment. Loyalty toward the party and the leader [suryong] must be demonstrated in the struggle for revolution and construction. Party cell secretaries must have a revolutionary habit of unconditionally accepting and completely implementing the great leader's teachings, the dear comrade leader's words [malssum], and the party's lines and policies which embodied those teachings and words. Party cells and party cell secretaries must positively make efforts to more thoroughly establish the revolutionary discipline under which the entire party, all the people, and the entire Army move like one under the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's monolithic leadership. They also must not allow the slightest phenomena to obstruct [chohae] the party's monolithic leadership but powerfully wage struggles to overcome [kukpok] them in a timely manner. Party cells and party cell secretaries must make all party members impregnable fortresses and enthusiastic guns and bombs who resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong] politically and ideologically by devoting their lives under any circumstances and environment. [applause] Defending and maintaining the achievements by the party and the leader [suryong] and glorifying them generation after generation is an important demand for upholding the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] with loyalty and completing our party's revolutionary cause to the end. Party cells and cell secretaries should lead all party members and the working people so that they can firmly arm themselves with our party's revolutionary tradition, resolutely safeguard and defend it, and thoroughly embody it in their work and life. Those party cells which received the on-the-spot guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il should thoroughly implement the tasks presented at the on- the-spot guidance to demonstrate a model in all aspects. It is the basic duty of party cells to foster party members to be resolute revolutionaries who carry out indomitable struggles for the party, for the revolution, and for the victory of the socialist cause by properly organizing and guiding party members' party life. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Properly carrying out the organization and guidance for party members' party life is the basic duty of party cells and is also an important key to successfully solve all problems. Party cells are the strongpoint of the party life of party members. They are also the basic unit which directly organize and guide their party life. Party cells should grasp the organization and guidance to party members' party life as the basis of party cells' work and concentrate great efforts on this. Thus, party cells should foster party members into indomitable revolutionaries who are infinitely loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] and who risk their lives to struggle for the victory of the socialist cause of chuche. Party cells should strengthen the organization and guidance to the party life of cadres, who are the commanding members of the revolution, and, thus, should thoroughly revolutionize them. Party cells and cell secretaries should see to it that cadres who lead party lives under their units become standard bearers and hands in upholding the party and the leader [suryong], enthusiastic communist revolutionaries who fight to the end with loyalty for the party and the leader with the firm determination to defend the revolutionary outposts assigned by the party at the risk of their lives, and genuine servants who devotedly serve the people. Important in party life organization and guidance is to establish a voluntary and revolutionary party life habit among party members. Party members cannot live for even a moment nor maintain their political life apart from their party organization. Party cells should see to it that all party members emulate the lofty model of the view of the party organization that the great leader Comrade and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il have personally shown and, thus, respect and treasure party organizations and make active efforts to willingly receive the guidance and control of party organizations. Party cells should see to it that party members are clearly aware of the regulations of the party and the rule of party life, lead their party life in accordance with these regulations and rule, and sincerely implement party organizations' decisions and assignments. Party meetings, summing-up sessions of party life, and party lectures are important in party organizational and ideological life. Party cells should thoroughly do away with such phenomenon of sticking to unnecessary formalities and conducting empty talks in their general cell meetings and should see to it that all party members fully present their creative and constructive opinions at the general meetings by properly carrying out meeting preparations and operations. At the same time, party cells should also establish a strong discipline under which party members do not fail to implement the problems discussed and decided on at party cell meetings in a timely manner. Party cells should lead party members so that they can sincerely and conscientiously present summaries at their party life summing-up meetings and frankly accept fellow comrades' criticism and make sincere efforts to correct their mistakes. Party cells should properly hold study sessions and lectures in close combination with reality so that party members can obtain political nutrition and good knowledge and technology which can be used in carrying out revoltuionary tasks. Party cells should correctly organize and guide party members' party life in close combination with the implementation of their revolutionary tasks so that all party members can play a leading and model role in the implementation of their revolutionary tasks. It is the responsible duty of the party cell to make the broad masses firmly unite around the party by properly carrying out the work with the masses. The work with them is an important work to consolidate the party's mass-oriented foundation and to strengthen the main force of the revolution. Our people were able to become ever-victorious in the ardent and harsh road of the revolution in which they had to go through a sea of fire and blood in fighting against Japan; conduct a fierce battle against the U.S. imperialists -- who are proud of being the greatest power in the world; rise to their own feet again on the ruins of war in which everything was destroyed; and fiercely struggle against the imperialists who wanted to crush [apsal] our socialism. This is due to the single-hearted unity of all the people firmly united as one around the party and the leader [suryong]. Today our revolution is being vigorously advanced under the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is endlessly loyal to the popular masses' cause for independence. Also, the tradition of single-hearted unity has been excellently inherited. [applause] To firmly consolidate the great unity and cohesion of loyalty and filial piety which have been handed down generation after generation, we must lead all people to more firmly unite around the party by constantly concentrating great efforts on the work with the broad masses. In carrying out the work with the masses, it is very important to enhance the role of party cells and the party cell secretaries who are directly engaged in the work with the masses and who live together with them. The party cells and the party cell secretaries must foster the popular masses to become the cornerstone [chosok] that can truly and constantly uphold the party and the leader [suryong] and to be the enthusiastic revolutionaries loyal to the socialist cause and not forgetful of their origins, by concentrating preferential efforts on the work with the masses, a class foundation of the party. The party cells must lead the bereaved family members of the revolutionaries, the bereaved war family members, the family members victimized by enemy barbarities, and the key members of our party, including heroes and veterans, to set an example for their works and lives by excellently carrying out their pledge of loyalty made to the party during the national meeting of heroes, the national meeting of the family members of martyrs, and the national meeting of veterans, and to be endlessly loyal and dutiful to the party and the leader [suryong] generation after generation. [applause] The party cells must vigorously carry out the work of making all agricultural working people become loyal to the party, the leader [suryong], and the socialist cause to the end by constantly strengthening the leadership role of the working class. Youth are the successors to our revolution, flowers of the future, and the most powerful army units in our society. Only when the loyalty and revolutionary spirit of the previous generation who braved the ardent storm of the revolution under the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] are constantly handed down to the next generation can our revolution's life be strongly retained and the socialist cause be endlessly consummated. The party cells must foster all members of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] to become the true vanguard fighters who resolutely safeguard the party and the leader [suryong] and take the lead in implementing our party's plans and intents after becoming five million rifles and bombs, as well as 5 million (Yi Su-poks), by actively backing the work of the primary LSWYK organizations to implement their pledge made to the party during the eighth meeting of the LSWYK. [applause] The party cells must properly carry out the work with intellectuals so that they can properly carry out their honorable mission and duty with their high revolutionary awareness and clean communist consciousness, as the eternal companions, the faithful supporters, the outstanding advisers of our party, and as the warm supporters and the thorough implementors of party policy, thus brilliantly carrying out their pledge made to the party during the meeting of Korean intellectuals. [applause] Party cells should properly carry out work with the masses of all strata who have different social and political life circumstances, upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's noble polititics of benevolence, so that they sincerely trust and follow our party and faithfully work, devoting their all for the party, the leader, the fatherland, and the people. [applause] Party cells and cell secretaries should properly lead cadres to take the initiative, party members to play the leading and key role, and public organizations to vigorously wage work with their members in conformity with their duty and characteristics in further strengthening the singlehearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks by embodying our party's traditional work method in which one person indoctrinates and moves 10 persons, 10 persons indoctrinate and move 100 persons, 100 persons indoctrinate and move 1,000 persons, and 1,000 persons indoctrinate and move 10,000 persons. Effecting constant innovations and upsurges in socialist construction by vigorously waging the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--is an important revolutionary task facing party cells. The three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--are the revolutions at the highest plane to completely realize the popular masses' independence. Therefore, the key and basic way of effecting revolutionary upsurges on a continuous basis in socialist construction lies precisely in vigorously waging the three revolutions. Party cells should vigorously carry out the ideological revolution, grasping it as a most priority revolution. The ideological revolution is an important work which strengthens the main force of the construction of socialist and communist society by making all people revolutionary, assimilating them into the working class, making them socialist, and modeling them after the chuche idea. It is also the basis in human reform work. Confrontation between socialism and capitalism is synonymous with ideological confrontation. The imperialists are strengthening more viciously then ever before the ideological and cultural offensives to break up the peosple's faith in socialism and to destroy the revolutionary ranks politically and ideologically. To thoroughly smash ideological and cultural infiltration by imperialism and to firmly protect the purity of socialist ideology, it is imperative to give priority to the ideological revolution over all work and, thus, to firmly arm all party members and the working people with independent ideological consciousness. The basis in carrying out the ideological revolution is to firmly arm all people with the chuche idea, which is the only guiding ideology of our party, the revolution, and socialism. Party cells should constantly strengthen indoctrination in the chuche idea among party members and the working people so that they take the chuche idea as their firm faith and think, work, and live in accordance with the demands of the chuche idea wherever and whenever. Party cells should resolutely struggle against all sorts of old and reactionary ideologies, including capitalist ideology, revisionism, dogmatism, and flunkeyism, and, thus, should prevent different ideologies running counter to the chuche idea from infiltrating into our society. Party cells should conduct ideological indoctrination work among party members and the working people in a substantial manner to make loyalty to the party and the leader the faith, conscience, morality, and routine life, to firmly arm them with the Korean-nation-is-first spirit, and to lead them to live our own style. Thus, party cells should foster party members and the working people to become enthusiastic revolutionaries and genuine patriots who struggle for the party, the leader, the grandeur and prosperity of the socialist fatherland, and the final victory of the chuche revolutionary cause, devoting their all. Socialism is mankind's ideal. It is the rule of history that socialism wins victory in the struggle against capitalism. Party cells and cell secretaries should conduct in various up-to-date forms and methods not only the indoctrination to plant firm faith in and strong will of the victory of the chuche revolutionary cause, the socialist cause, among party members and the working people, but also the indoctrination to lead them to view and judge all social phenomena from a working class viewpoint and from the revolutionary principle, to clearly know the inherent nature of imperialist aggression and the inevitability of defeat of capitalism, and to resolutely struggle for the victory of the socialist cause. Party cells should conduct indoctrination to influence people substantially by positive examples to make the beautiful communist virtues of helping and leading each other, of being all for one and one for all, and of sharing joy and sorrow bloom further throughout the whole society. At the same time, party cells should also fill the whole society with the noble and revolutionary ethos. Party cells should concentrate great efforts on carrying out the cultural revolution so that all party members and the working people have high creative ability and enjoy a genuine socialist cultural life. The cultural revolution is a task to lead all people to enjoy a cultural life to their hearts' content by liberating them from the constraint of old culture, making them have a high technological and cultural level, and creating a socialist culture which serves the popular masses. Party cells should actively contribute to making intelligentsia of the whole society by establishing a revolutionary study habit among party members and the working class. Party cells should assiduously build all work sites, villages, streets, and houses so that all the people can enjoy working and living under cultural circumstances and conditions. In particular, party cells should thoroughly implement the five major tasks of completing electrification, the introduction of piped water services, and (urbanization) of rural areas to a higher level and of realizing the introduction of the central-heating system and the introduction of the gas system in rural villages. Thus, they should eliminate differences in living conditions between the urban and rural people. Party cells should see to it that party members and the working people bring their wisdom and talent into full bloom in developing the socialist culture and enjoy their socialistic cultural life to their hearts' content with a lofty cultural ability. Party cells at the front of socialist cultural construction, including education, science, culture, arts, public health, sports, should actively struggle to thoroughly implement our party's line of socialist cultural construction to fully demonstrate our nation's outstanding ability and wisdom. At the same time, party cells at this front should vigorously demonstrate the superiority of our own style socialism over capitalism in the scientific, technological, and cultural fields. [applause] Developing socialist culture is an important condition to successfully blocking the imperialists' ideological and cultural infiltration. Party cells should vigorously organize and proceed the cultural life of party members and the working people in conformity with the ideological feelings of our people and with the demands of our revolution to block corrupt bourgeois culture from infiltrating our society. Party cells should actively inspire party members and the working people into the implementation of the technological revolution and, thus, should lead them to effect new and great upsurges in socialist economic construction. The technological revolution is the basic way of remolding nature, liberating workers from arduous work, and providing the material and technological foundation that complies with the demands of the socialist, communist society. Party cells should vigorously inspire party members and the working people into implementing the technological revolution and, thus, should lift our science and technology to the advanced level of the world at the earliest possible date. Based on the scientific analysis of today's situation and the present status of our country's socialist construction, our party has designated an adjustment year of three years and presented its economic strategy of thoroughly implementing the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy, of giving priority to the coal industry, power industry, and railway transport, and of developing the metal industry during this adjustment period. The basic goal of our party's revolutionary economic strategy is to decisively solve the problem of the people's livelihood in the two to three years to come by concentrating efforts on developing agriculture, light industry, and trade; to regularize production in all sectors by giving priority to the leading sectors of the national economy; and to fully enhance the might of existing economic foundations. Party cells and cell secretaries should vigorously wage the struggle to thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy, holding aloft the slogan of loyalty, "What the party decides we will do." [applause] Party cells should continue to struggle vigorously to carry out the technological revolution in rural areas, upholding the historic letter sent by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song to the National Agricultural Conference, so as to actively accelerate industrializing and modernizing agriculture. Party members and agricultural working people of the rural economic sector should do farm work scientifically and technologically in accordance with the demand of the chuche farming method, with self-awareness as masters in charge of the country's food supply. By doing so, they should realize, without fail, the high goal of agricultural production presented by the party this year, which marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses. Party cells in the light industry sector should well maintain, strengthen, and modernize light industrial plants, and should operate all facilities at full capacity to produce various quality consumer goods at a large scale, upholding the party's light industry-first policy. Party cells in various sectors of the national economy should actively support light industry and drastically increase the production of daily necessities and 3 August people's consumer goods in all units. Party cells in all sectors and units of the national economy should actively inspire party members to struggle to produce many quality export items and to develop processing trade by firmly preparing export item production bases and by actively exploring and mobilizing technological resources [kisul wonchon], upholding the party's trade-first policy. Party cells and party members in the sector of trade with foreign countries should actively explore [kaechok] overseas markets and gain our credit in trade [muyok korae-eso sinyongul cholchohi chikidorok hayoya], in conformity with changing environments. In order to realize the party's strategic goals of economic construction, it is important to give priority to the coal and electric power industries and railway transportation, which are primary sectors of the national economy, as well as to develop the metal industry. Party cells of the coal industry sector should vigorously struggle to firmly uphold our party and our socialism by increasing coal production. Party cells and party members of the electric power industry sector should use our existing power generation capability to the utmost and hasten the ongoing construction of many power plants, so that they can smoothly supply people's ever- increasing demand for electricity. Party cells of the railway transportation sector should strengthen the sector's material and technological basis and completely implement the party policy on revolutionizing transportation so they can deliver materials required by each sector of the national economy in a timely manner. Party cells of the metal industry sector should vigorously carry out the struggle to increase steel products, with the Chollima revolutionary spirit, which was demonstrated in the great postwar Chollima upswing period. We should greatly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude in order to completely implement the party's revolutionary economic strategies, to smash the imperialists' maneuver to apply economic sanctions [kyongje pongswoe chaektong], and to constantly effect upsurges in socialist construction. All party members and working people [as heard] should organize and mobilize party members and working people for the struggle to completely implement the party's revolutionary slogan "Let us accelerate the general onward march of socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude." They should also create a new, great revolutionary upsurge in all sectors of the national economy with the spirit of the nineties' speed added to Chollima, by finding what is lacking and creating what does not exist. [applause] It is the party cells' important duty to reliably protect the socialist fatherland and revolutionary gains from the enemy's aggression. We must not, even for a moment, neglect the work of strengthening the national defense ability, under today's condition that the imperialists are posing military threats against us and are viciously conducting war provocation maneuvers to crush our republic. Party cells and party cell secretaries should help all party members and working people always maintain great revolutionary awareness to cope with the war provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique and help them make every preparation to firmly defend the socialist fatherland and revolutionary gains under any unexpected situation. Party cells and party cell secretaries should firmly arm all party members and people with the chuche-oriented view of war and establish a social trait of valuing and learning from the military [kunsa] in a sincere attitude, so that they can make the whole country an impregnable fortress and make thorough material preparations to cope with any enemy attack. [applause] Party cells should vigorously wage the organizational and political work to more highly display the traditional fine custom of military-civilian unity. The fine custom of military-civilian unity, which blooms brilliantly in our country today, is the expression of one intention and one will of the entire Army and all the people to uphold General Kim Chong-il, our respected supreme commander, to the end. It is also the expression of their lofty idea and spirit to share the destiny with the party, no matter how violent a storm may blow. [applause] Only when the military actively helps the people while the people sincerely support the military to achieve perfect harmony and unity, can the People's Army be strengthened and developed into an indomitable army and win victory in the fight with the enemy, regardless of how strong it may be. Party cells should encourage all party members and workers to always love and care for soldiers of the People's Army as their own brothers and sons, who are defending the fatherland in snowstorms and cold rain. Thus, they should help the soldiers actively, sincerely, and warm-heartily. If the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppet clique provoke a new war, the Army and people, in firm unity with respected supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, should rise, like a stern mountain, in the struggle to defend the party, the leader and popular mass-centered socialism of our own style which we gained with blood, and should land an exterminatory blow to the aggressors. Thus, we should again display dignity and honor of heroic Korea. [applause] National reunification is the supreme national task which should no longer be delayed for our party and people. Upholding the 10-point programs for great unity of the whole country which was personally prepared and published by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and lodestar of national reunification, party cells and cell secretaries should achieve the unity of the whole country. They should vigorously carry out the struggle to achieve national reunification in accordance with the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, based on the confederal system. We should make all party cells endlessly loyal to the party and the leader and the militant organization to staunchly defend and protect and carry to accomplishment the socialist cause, and should enhance more highly the role and responsibility of the party's cell secretaries. By deeply cherishing a lofty pride and a sense of responsibility in being our party's core responsible for the lowest basic party organizations, all party cell secretaries should devotedly struggle to satisfactorily carry out the work for party cells. For the party cell secretaries to fulfill their honorable and responsible missions and duties, they should completely and perfectly preserve loyalty, revolutionary spirit, principle, sense of responsibility, creativeness, sense of dedication, the mass spirit [kunjungsong], humanity, optimism, and integrity--the basic outlook defined by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--and should make efforts to constantly enhance their political working level. [applause] By cherishing the firm determination to share their destiny with the party forever, the party's cell secretaries should make loyalty to the party and leader their faith and constitution, and should struggle by dedicating their lives to the party, the leader, and victory of the chuche revolutionary cause, without the slightest degree of wavering or change of heart [pyonsim] in whatever trial they may face. The party's cell secretaries should carry out all works in the interest of the party and revolution with the lofty revolutionary spirit and firm principle of the party and class, and should staunchly defend the party's policies and line. Thus, they should become the standard-bearers of the revolution and struggle to lead the masses at the van of the struggle to implement the party's policies and lines. The party cell secretaries should endlessly love and respect the people with a precise outlook on the masses, and should become genuine servants who faithfully serve the people. The party cell secretaries should always share the joys and pains of the people according to the demand of the slogan put forward by the party, "We serve the people," and should listen to their voices. The party's cell secretaries should strive to determine the difficulties and demands of the people with a motherly love and should resolve them in a timely manner. The party cell secretaries should never wield power or expect privileges and special favors. Instead, they should always lead a clean and upright life. The party cell secretaries should make constant efforts to enhance their political working level. Unless they constantly enhance their standard in compliance with the demand of developing realities, they cannot precisely organize and lead the party life of the party members nor can they rightfully organize and mobilize the party members to implement the party's policies. By studying hard and making constant efforts, the party cell secretaries should firmly arm themselves with our party's chuche idea, policies, and lines. Thus, they should prepare themselves to become able functionaries with lofty working-level capabilities. Party organizations at all levels, including city and county party committees, should make the conference of the party cell secretaries a meeting of the core party members who are unswervingly loyal to the party and to the leader, whose party spirit and working-class position are firm, who are trusted by the masses, and who have lofty, political, working-level ability. All party functionaries should go down to the party cells, and should properly help and substantively teach cell secretaries. Our party treasures the party cell secretaries as its core and precious valuables. Through cell secretaries, our party is leading the party life of all cadre members and party members, and has forged blood ties with all people. Thus, our party organizes and mobilizes party members and workers to implement the party's policies and lines. Trust in and expectations for the party cell secretaries by our party and people are indeed great. The participants in the meeting and all cell secretaries of the whole party should excellently fulfill their honorable missions and duties in the struggle to further strengthen our party and to defend, protect, and accomplish the chuche revolutionary cause--the socialist cause--and should meet without fail the lofty trust and expectations by the party and people. [applause] Our revolutionary cause is just, and our victory is sure. As long as we have the ever-victorious, invincible revolutionary leadership of the great leader and great party, the immortal chuche idea, the heroic people firmly rallied behind the outstanding leader, the firm, self-reliant national economy, and the one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary armed forces, no strength in the world can block our victorious advance. [applause] Our party and people will not retreat even a step from the revolutionary road which we chose ourselves, no matter how complex or how acute a situation may be created and no matter how grave the trial or difficulties of our revolution become. We will effect a greater victory in the future, as we have in the past, in the struggle to further glorify popular mass-centered socialism of our own style by following the wise leadership of the great leader [widaehan suryong] and outstanding leader [tagwolhan yongdoja] with revolutionary optimism and with the firm conviction in the justness of our cause and of our victory. [applause] Let us all vigorously fight to strengthen and develop our party into a glorious chuche-type revolutionary party forever in firm unity with the party Central Committee headed by the respected Comrade Kim Il-song by upholding the ever-victorious banner of the chuche idea. Let us all vigorously advance to the final victory of the socialist cause, the party's cause. [applause] [shouting of slogans, "Let us become the vanguard and shields to defend with our lives the great leader and dear comrade leader!" "All party cell secretaries should thoroughly carry to accomplishment the five-point tasks of the party cells!" "Let us uphold supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il with single-hearted unity!"]
