The first group of nine items has been started, with the participation of dozens of scientific research institutes, institutes of higher learning, and enterprises. In developing these items, the scope of industrialization has been expanded and commodity production has been organized simultaneously. Initial success has been won in this to increase the industrial output value by nearly 200 million yuan and to lead the development of a number of relevant industries. Beginning this year, the scientific and technological 10-billion-yuan project plans to build 10 high technology industries in five years with an annual output value exceeding 500 million yuan each so as to promote the development of a group of high technology products and establish a group of industries whose output value totals 10 billion yuan. Since last March when the municipal scientific and technological congress put forward the targets of the 10-billion-yuan project, the municipal scientific research units stationed in Tianjin, the research institutes of the schools of higher learning, scientific research institutes under the municipality, large and medium-sized enterprises, and high technology enterprises of various types have actively participated in the project. After screening, the municipal science and technology commission decided to cultivate on a priority basis a group of high technology achievements with broad market prospects and then gradually include them in the 10-billion-yuan project. To date, the production of study-oriented video game machine, cortex hormone, nickel-hydrogen battery, new-type pesticide, and numerical-controlled machine tool has been officially listed as items for implementation, and coating technique and three other items have also been listed as ones for cultivation on a priority basis and given particular support. The first group of items to be implemented are high technology products developed by the large contingents of scientific and technical personnel in various fields after many years of research. The technological levels and technical measures of these items are among the best in the country or up to the advanced levels of the world, their market prospects are very broad at home and abroad, and they possess fairly good basic conditions for expanding the scope of industrialization. They can be turned into highly competitive products in a short time, and their output value is estimated at 1 billion yuan this year. Take the 16-bit study-oriented video game machines first produced by the Xinxing Electronic Company, which was established by the no. 46 institute of the Ministry of Electronic Industry. From January to April, 60,000 such machines were produced and sold, and orders keep pouring in from domestic areas and foreign countries. Including this product in the 10-billion-yuan project will help increase its production capacity to 600,000 and its annual output value to 300 million yuan this year. The scientific and technological 10-billion-yuan project not only helps accelerate the industrialization of the scientific and technological achievements of scientific research institutes but also leads a group of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to the new road of pursuit of high technology. The items on new-type pesticides, numerical-controlled machine tools, and other products have been carried out at some dozen large and medium-sized enterprises. The municipal general pesticide plant cooperated with Nankai University to carry out scientific and technological development, thus continuously upgrading and updating its products and creating notable economic returns. In the first four months of this year, the output value created by its new-type pesticides exceeded 70 million yuan.
