FR940224-0-00035 FR940224-0-00003 Individual Census Tracts and Census Blocks, by their nature, do not appear to be reasonable alternatives to Zip Codes to utilize on a general basis. According to the Census Bureau, Census Blocks are small areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, property lines, and short, imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Bureau of the Census, Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF HOUSING, GENERAL HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS (1992). Individual Census Blocks because of their size appear to be inappropriate for determining the boundaries of a neighborhood served by a financial institution, or a branch thereof on a general basis. Census Tracts, 3 although larger than Census Blocks, are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a country which usually have between 2,500 and 8,000 persons, and when first delineated, are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Bureau of the Census, Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF HOUSING, GENERAL HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS (1992). 3 Starting with the 1990 Census those areas which are not covered by Census Tracts have been subdivided into ``Block Numbering Areas'' (BNA's). These BNA's are essentially the equivalent of Census Tracts, except that they have been delineated by a State agency instead of a local committee. Individual Census Tracts or Census Blocks are generally impractical for use in defining the boundaries of a neighborhood served by a financial institution, or a branch thereof, on a generally uniform basis and are inconsistent with the spirit of the legislation. However, use of Census Tracts or Census Blocks on an individual or aggregate basis may be appropriate on an exception basis. The Act is intended to enhance opportunities for Minorities to acquire institutions and branches which primarily ``serve'' Minority residents. 139 Cong. Rec. H10899&hyph;900 (daily ed. November 22, 1993) (statement of Rep. Mfume). The people served by a depository institution or branch may be located over a relatively large geographic area, generally transcending Census Block boundaries and, most likely, Census Tract boundaries as well. Census Tracts and Census Blocks tend to be small areas, focused only on residences and are generally not focused on all residential neighborhoods served by a local financial institution, or a branch office thereof. The Zip Codes (and the boundaries thereof) of offices of a failed institution tend to be larger areas and are readily ascertainable both by RTC personnel and by potential bidders. Such is not the case for Census Tracts. The addresses of each of the offices of a failed institution already contain the Zip Code, and the boundaries of each Zip Code area are available at the local Post Office. Notwithstanding the obvious advantages of a definition based on fixed methodology, circumstances may arise where that approach fails to accurately reflect the reality of the relevant neighborhood. For example, if an institution or branch is physically located within Zip Code 00001, near the boundary with Zip Code 00002, a mechanical application of the Zip Code approach would indicate that the branch serves customers in the neighborhood defined by Zip Code 00001. Or for example, a rigid application of the Zip Code approach to the individual offices of an institution might preclude the designation of the whole institution as being located in a predominantly minority neighborhood, although other rational bases might exist for a determination that the institution as a whole is located in a predominantly minority neighborhood. Therefore, rather than rigidly applying the Zip Code approach, if the RTC determines, in its sole discretion and subject to its Cost Constraints, that other reasonably reliable information and data, that is readily accessible to it, indicates different boundaries which more accurately reflect the relevant neighborhood, the RTC may define the relevant neighborhood in terms of those different boundaries. Conclusion The RTC's definition of ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' is based on readily available, established and accepted information: Zip Codes and Census Data. A ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' can, therefore, be identified using existing, objective standards: (1) A Zip Code to define the geographic area which generally constitutes the neighborhood and (2) Census Data to determine the minority composition of that neighborhood. In the event that the RTC, in its sole discretion, determines that other reasonably reliable information and data, that is readily accessible to it, indicates more accurate boundaries for such neighborhood, the RTC will define such neighborhood using those more accurate boundaries. The proposed definition permits the RTC to quickly identify ``predominantly minority neighborhoods'' without delaying the resolution of an institution consistent with the RTC's statutory Cost Constraints. The methodology adopted by this interim rule constitutes a reasonable basis upon which to define ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' consistent with the purposes of sections 21A(s) and (w)(17) of the FHLBA and consistent with the RTC's duties in resolving failed institutions. Administrative Procedure Act The RTC is adopting this rule as an interim rule. It will be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register without the usual notice and comment period or delayed effective date as provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. These requirements may be waived for ``good cause.'' The definition provided by the interim rule implements the Act. Promulgation of the rule on an expedited basis is necessary to permit the immediate implementation of the new statute in order to avoid the additional losses that would otherwise be incurred due to the delay in the resolution of failed institutions pending the usual delayed effective date. Thus, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public in adopting the interim rule outweigh any possible harm resulting from not seeking comment on the proposed rule in advance of its effective date. The RTC actively solicits comment on this interim rule and will consider those comments in the adoption of the rule as final. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis is provided: 1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim rule. These elements have been discussed above in the Supplementary Information section. 2. Small entities to which the rule would apply. This rule applies equally to acquiring institutions of all sizes inasmuch as the RTC has been given no discretion in this matter by Congress. 3. Impact of the interim rule on small businesses. There is no burden imposed on small businesses by this rule which merely defines, pursuant to Congressional direction, a term utilized in the statute.
