The gross domestic product fell by 34 percent compared to the corresponding period of 1993 and the national income by 36 percent. The decline in production reached the highest level since the beginning of the year. Compared to the first quarter of 1993, the volume of production fell by 38 percent and labor productivity fell by 32 percent. More than 75 percent of the industrial enterprises reduced the volume of production. The greatest drop in the output of products was registered in ferrous metallurgy, the chemical, petrochemical, refinery, light and pulp-and-paper industries, machine building, and the construction materials industry. A decline in the production of the main types of energy resources in the fuel and energy industries was also registered. On the whole, 27.3 million tonnes of fuel were produced, which was 4.3 million tonnes (or 14 percent) less than in the first quarter of 1993. The volume of primary oil refining fell by more than one-half, and the production of motor gasoline, diesel fuel, and heavy fuel oil diminished accordingly. The drop in production has affected a majority of the key types of products in the chemical and petrochemical industries, mineral fertilizers, tires for trucks and passenger cars, synthetic resins, and plastics. The procurement of commercial wood and timber products fell in the timber industry; consequently, the output of the key types of products of the woodworking and pulp-and-paper industries declined substantially. The production of pulp, paper, and cardboard fell by a factor of five. Agriculture Spring field work is underway in the entire territory of Ukraine. Before the beginning of May, farms had been planted: in spring crops--an area of 10 million hectares, which was 64.5 percent more than was planted at that time the year before; in sugar beets-- 1.1459 million hectares; in sunflowers--592,300 hectares; and in potatoes--73,800 hectares. The situation in animal husbandry remains difficult although the first signs of its stabilization have appeared. The average daily increment in cattle and hog breeding and finishing increased for the first time in recent years. The average milk yield per cow on public-sector farms came to 424 kilograms in the first quarter compared to 413 kilograms during the corresponding period of 1993. However, in the first quarter of 1994, the collective, interfarm agricultural enterprises, and sovkhozes produced almost one-third less meat in live weight than during the corresponding period of last year and 21 percent fewer eggs. Milk production was almost at the 1993 level. The volume of cattle and poultry breeding dropped by 11 percent. Construction The pace of construction of facilities in the social sphere slowed down. Residential buildings, with a total floor space of 967,000 square meters, with all forms of ownership were built, which is 46 percent less than in the corresponding period of last year. Less housing was built in Crimea, Kiev, and Sevastopol, as well as in 18 other oblasts. Transportation Carriage The work of transportation has continued to deteriorate as a result of cutbacks in production, the disruption of economic relations, a failure to meet contractual obligations, and a fuel shortage. In the first quarter of this year, all modes of public-use transportation carried 206 million tonnes of freight (336 million tonnes during the corresponding period of 1993). The carriage of freight by railway transportation fell by 35 percent. The volume of carriage by highway transportation fell by a factor of more than two (52 million tonnes of freight were carried). Some 6.3 million tonnes of freight were carried since the beginning of the year by all modes of transportation. The rate of decline in carriage came to 8 percent. Since the beginning of the year, all modes of transportation carried 1.1 billion passengers. The rate of decline in carriage was 18 percent. Finance and Prices The processes of imbalance in state finances, as one of the manifestations of economic crisis, grew stronger. The Ukrainian state budget had a deficit of 8.6 percent. The emission of currency in the first quarter of this year came to 10.8 trillion karbovantsy and, compared to the corresponding period of 1993, increased by a factor of more than 36. At the same time, a decline in the inflation rate was registered on a monthly basis in the first quarter of 1994. In January, the inflation index came to 119.2 percent, in February to 112.6 percent, and in March to 105.7 percent. On the whole, consumer prices grew by a factor of 1.4 during the quarter (by a factor of 2.7 during the corresponding period of 1993). In the first quarter of 1994, the rate of growth of prices for nonfood goods and paid services for the population outpaced the rate of growth of prices for foodstuffs by a factor of two. Prices for certain groups of foodstuffs (meat products, butter, eggs, and citrus fruit) fell. For the most part, goods in the fruit and vegetable group became more expensive. Prices increased the most for children's clothing, children's footwear, books and newspapers, office supplies, and pharmaceuticals from among the nonfood consumer staples. From among paid services to the population, prices grew the most, by a factor of 2.8, for the services of public-use transportation (in view of higher airfares and railway fares), as well as for recreation, cultural services, and services of barber shops. Before the beginning of January, the Ukrainian unemployment rate as a whole came to 0.29 percent of the population in the able-bodied age bracket. The average size of benefits per each unemployed individual came to 169,000 karbovantsy in March, compared to 100,000 karbovantsy in December 1993. The Ukrainian population number stood at 52.1 million on 1 April 1994. In the first quarter, the number of deaths exceeded that of births by 75,000. Production of Consumer Goods In the first quarter of this year, such goods worth 55 trillion karbovantsy were produced (this was 39 percent less than in the first quarter of 1993). Almost three-fourths of the enterprises reduced their output and, compared to the first quarter of 1993, failed to turn out goods worth 38 trillion karbovantsy. The output of the enterprises of the State Committee for the Food Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs accounted for more than 45 percent of this total, and that of the enterprises of the State Committee for the Light and Textile Industries, for almost 20 percent.
