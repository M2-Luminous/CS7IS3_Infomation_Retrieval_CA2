The market -- to which one-fifth of Finnish exports used to go -- no longer exists, and the security guarantees provided by the neutrality forced onto the Finns -- and guaranteed -- by the Soviets has expired. In the words of Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, who granted an interview to MLADA FRONTA DNES, however, as opposed to the central European countries, Finland is not afraid of its large neighbor and is interested neither in joining NATO nor in an active part in a future defense structure of the European Union [EU] (it does want to join the EU itself). It only wants to join as an observer. [Harantova] Do you believe that observer status would do for your security needs? [Haavisto] Yes. We feel completely safe, and want only to be included in the joint structures with other European states also in the security sphere. [Harantova] Do you have any specific reason for this? [Haavisto] We do not feel the need to contemplate new security structures and defense solutions. We have decided to be impartial and our own military defense. [Harantova] Do you want to reinforce your Army like Sweden, for instance, which is afraid of Russia? [Haavisto] No. I believe that our Army is quite good, and we maintain very normal and very good relations with Russia. [Harantova] Like with any other state? [Haavisto] Yes, very normal and very good relations. [Harantova] So, you are not afraid of Russia? [Haavisto] I believe that the developments there are moving in a democratic direction. [Harantova] Even after the latest changes in the government, when it seems that the reform route will be abandoned? [Haavisto] We are not afraid of the current development. We do not expect the new parliament to alter fundamentally the foreign policy, and there is also the president, who has extensive powers. [Harantova] What if there no longer is President Yeltsin but, let us say, President Zhirinovskiy? [Haavisto] I believe that they will know how to choose another wise president. Furthermore, aggressive persons of Zhirinovskiy's type appear now and then in every country. [Harantova] Your special relations with the USSR enriched the international glossary by the term Finlandization. Does the term still have a real basis today? [Haavisto] No. And the term itself has always been rather dumb. I believe that if a country has very good relations with its neighbor, it always is a positive phenomenon. [Harantova] Would Russia mind if you wanted to join NATO? [Haavisto] There is no need to discuss this because we do not want to join NATO. [Harantova] Does Finland want to join at least Partnership for Peace? [Haavisto] I believe that Partnership for Peace is meant particularly for the central European countries, which do not have such a great feeling of security, and not for a neutral country like Finland. [Harantova] What were the major problems for Finland in the talks concerning the entry into the EU? [Haavisto] I believe that it is ridden with problems if the country involved is an agrarian one, because the rules applied to this area have been conceived for the central European region. The countries there have summer two to three months longer, and the temperatures are twice as high as in our country. Therefore, we have asked for special adjustments that would guarantee the equal position of our farmers. We should join the EU at the beginning of 1995. I believe, however, that this term cannot be kept. [Harantova] What is the major benefit you expect from your entry? [Haavisto] The most important is that we will remain together with the other European states and will partake in the joint building of the European economy so that the continent can compete with the southern and eastern Asia.
