FBIS4-1449 "drafr082_cs94003" FBIS-AFR-94-082-S Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IEC Chairman Comments IEC Chairman Comments MB2804145194 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English 1345 GMT 28 Apr 94 MB2804145194 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network English BFN [News conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler in Johannesburg with correspondents at IEC headquarters at the Gallagher Estate, Midrand; conference moderated by the IEC's Pieter Cronje--live, broadcast in progress] [Text] [Kriegler]... the Cape, the [Orange] Free State, North West -- I am proud and pleased to say in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] everything is under control, voting ID going well, we are reasonably satisfied that all prospective voters will be able to cast their votes in those areas, if not by seven o'clock tonight, within the extended hours that will be allowed by the presiding officers at any voting stations where there are still people waiting. With regard to the Eastern Transvaal, overall the picture is good; in KwaMahlangu there was a problem that has been resolved and we are satisfied that there also the prospective voters will be able to exercise their franchise by close of business tonight. With regard to the Northern Transvaal, the Eastern Cape, and KwaZulu/Natal, there are distinct problems in the erstwhile homeland or self-governing or independent territories namely Venda, Gazankulu and Lebowa in Northern Transvaal, in the KwaZulu part of KwaZulu/Natal and in the Transkei/Ciskei components of the Eastern Cape Province. The IEC is satisfied that because of its difficulties in provisioning those areas, the voters there have not had a fair and free opportunity to express their view. It is therefore The IEC's view that extension of voting for those areas for tomorrow should be instituted. It is not within the power of the IEC to do so, and a recommendation to that effect has been made to the Transitional Executive Council, and via that body to the state president. I'm confident in the light of the strong evidence of substantial inadequacy of voting, that the citizens of those areas will be granted the opportunity. But I reiterate it's not within my power, nor that of the commission. [Cronje] May we take the questions singly? Would you please introduce yourself, no supplementary at this stage until we've had a first round of questions. [Correspondent John Baptist] Judge, I would like to ask, Mr. Mandela made an allegation earlier today that there had been massive sabotage at the polls. Could you comment on this please? [Kriegler] I dealt yesterday with sabotage as one of the possible inferences to be drawn from the gross undersupply in various parts of the country of IEC material. I will not at this stage be prepared to express a preference form anyone of the inferences. It is certainly one of them. [Correspondent Desmond Howell] Judge, when will counting start in those areas where voting ends today, and when will you start announcing those results? [Kriegler] Counting will not start until voting has closed so that there can be no influencing of voters still voting, by possible leakage of count figures from counting stations. But I should say counting is a much more complex exercise than most people realize, there are many hours of reconciliation of returns from voting stations, from districts, from areas to be done, allocations to be done, and ballot boxes according to the particular voting district. In addition a possible volkstaat [homeland] concept, consideration of the debate in that respect necessitates a special subdivision of voting stations and there are many hours of work to be done long before awe get around to actual counting. To answer your question firmly and unequivocally, counting will not start, that is counting proper will not start until Saturday morning. [Crone] Reg Nkondo, REUTERS. [Nkondo] I'm Reg Nkondo from REUTERS. I just want to find out whether in the areas where people will be allowed to vote tomorrow, is there going to be a holiday or is it going to a be a normal working day. [Kriegler] Decidedly not a holiday, maybe a happy day because it is a voting day, but not a holiday. [Crone] Karin Brynard. Karin? [Correspondent Karin Brynard] I am Karin Brynard, RAPPORT. The areas you referred to as the areas that had problems. What is the extent of the problems? [Kriegler] It is clear that voters were not given a reasonable opportunity to cast their votes. In some areas for instance in the Northern Transvaal as many as 120 voting stations did not open at all until three o'clock this afternoon. [Cronje] Kaiser with THE STAR, please. [Correspondent Kaiser Motsumi] Mr. Justice Kriegler, Kaiser Motsumi from THE STAR. The fact that voting will be taking place in some parts of the country, are you in a position to tell us whether the voting will be going on for the whole day until 7 P.M. again, of if it will be closing a little earlier tomorrow? [Kriegler] The recommendation will be 7 o'clock so as not to confuse voters. Those have been the voting hours and it's as well that it remain like that. [Cronje] Over there, please. [Correspondent Gregory Katz] Justice Kriegler, Gregory Katz from the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. What will be the status of ballots in which there was no IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] sticker and presiding officers were told to hand write IFP and to sign the ballot themselves, and to hand write a square? Will those ballots be allowed or are those spoiled ballots? [Kriegler] I have dealt with this a couple of times and I think I will have to deal with it a couple of times more. That is not a regular ballot, it is an irregular ballot. It does not comply with the letter of the law. However, it is a ballot which expresses unequivocally the wish of the voter. Therefore, although an irregular ballot, it may well be taken into account as an adequate expression of the voter's choice of party. Could I... Pieter, Pieter? [Cronje] Yes, I am here, judge. [Kriegler] I am terribly sorry to be rude to the media there. I simply have to -- I've got to go back to this meeting and go and get this extension finalized one way or another. [Cronje] Can I limit it to three more questions? Will you take them? [Kriegler] Can we take two and call it a day, please? [Cronje] Fine. I have the gentleman over here and then the gentleman over here. [Correspondent Sonny Raboch] I am Sonny Raboch, Radio Nigeria. Judge, the situation, well, we are getting clearer pictures now, but what I would like to find out -- in the event that there is an act for an act of Parliament, since you've said that IEC cannot take a decision of this nature except by an act of Parliament, are we expecting that the voting may be forced to continue as far as midnight tomorrow? [Kriegler] No, no! No, if the Transitional Executive Council and the state president accept the IEC's recommendation, it is (?down more or less) to proclaim, formally to proclaim the amendment of the Electoral Act as a matter of detail. [Correspondent Paolo Banard] Paolo Banard from [name indistinct] in Italy. Judge, to what extent did you liaise with the chief minister, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in the past 24 hours to come to the recommendation that in these areas the elections should be extended? [Kriegler] The Inkatha Freedom Party's representatives and I have been in contact this morning, as I have been in contact with the leaders of many other parties. Dr. Mzimela, cabinet minister of the former KwaZulu government and an IFP Central Committee member is sitting in the meeting to which I will ask your permission now to return. [Cronje] Judge, thank you very much. Go well. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. [Kriegler] Thank you.
