At one end are the prospects in the Asian economies and at the other end are prospective investors in Western Europe and elsewhere. Summing up his visits to Germany and Britain, Mr. Goh said Singapore wants to act as an intermediary to tie the knot. This is part of Singapore's overall strategy of going regional. The Singapore delegation's spokesman said Mr. Goh's trip to Germany had brought bilateral relations to a higher level. This is because of new steps being taken such as the formation of the Singapore-German Business Forum, the GSBF. On Britain, the spokesman said the level of Singapore's relations with the country has been high. British leaders shared Mr. Goh's concern on the need to build on this relationship. One concrete way to assert the strengthened ties is through the setting up of the Singapore-British Business Council to be ready in about one to two months' time. Mr. Goh returned home this evening after his official visits to Germany and Britain.
