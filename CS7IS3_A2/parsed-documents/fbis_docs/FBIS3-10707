In the 1994 budget, the sale of these shares is expected to bring in $900 million. According to the latest decree's foundations, autonomous corporations and state companies must turn over the minority stock they hold to the National Privatization Fund, which is managed by BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social Development], which will handle the sale. BNDES Director Elena Landau stated in Rio de Janeiro that her bank is waiting for the state companies to provide an inventory of minority stock that they have in other companies. The new decree was prompted by the failure of the first attempt to force the state companies to sell the minority shares they own. Put together, these shares are estimated to be worth $900 million. Government experts believe the actual income from the sale of these shares will surpass the initial estimate because some of the state companies have been privatized since the estimate was made and the value of their shares has gone up. Thus, state companies that own shares of companies that have been privatized will obtain more funds and this, in turn, will improve the value of their own shares. There are cases of government companies that are minority stockholders in other companies because of fiscal incentives, such is the case of Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] and Conab [National Supply Company], which own shares of hotels; informatics corporations like Dataprev [Social Security Data Processing Enterprise], which owns shares of a petrochemical company; and Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications Corporation], which owns shares of the Uberaba Water Supply Company.
