[Begin Reina recording] I ask all of you to repudiate the article. I am sure you are all patriots and you cannot accept such rude remarks. Honduras is a country that is making huge efforts to ensure legal security and to compare Honduras with Bosnia-Hercegovina, where even the bodies of the dead are being eaten, is unforgivable rudeness. [end recording] [passage omitted] While the article that appeared in THE ECONOMIST continues to provoke reactions and the awakening of patriotism in some sectors, the Honduran Foreign Ministry did not give much importance to the article and denied that it will protest the article published in that important magazine.
