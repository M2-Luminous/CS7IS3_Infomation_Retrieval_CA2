[Fialkova] Not at all. This is the first. [Sulek] Everyone wants to know if the Czech Republic really wants to join Europe, NATO, and the EU alone. [Fialkova] It lies in our interests that the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary belong to the same security group. [Sulek] But as far as PFP and NATO are concerned, the Czechs have definitely gone further than the others. [Fialkova] The PFP declaration clearly states that all the countries will be assessed individually. It calls for the admission to NATO of each country individually, not as a group. [Sulek] Prime Minister Klaus has himself said that he would like the Czech Republic to join Europe without Visegrad. [Fialkova] I do not think Prime Minister Klaus has firmly rejected Visegrad cooperation, but what he wants is genuine cooperation, not just gestures and meetings. He is in favor of cooperation, but at an appropriate level. He does not insist on a total coordination of Visegrad activity. [Sulek] But without this coordination, the Visegrad countries appear at odds with each other and incapable of joint, steady action. Perhaps a strong and cohesive Visegrad group does not lie in the interests of the United States and Russia? [Fialkova] President Clinton made it clear that everyone is concerned about good practical regional cooperation, and that is what we want as well. A major feature of this cooperation is CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Agreement]. The Czech Parliament has already ratified this agreement, but the Polish Parliament was prevented from doing so by the parliamentary elections. CEFTA offers a very good scope of cooperation. Prime Minister Klaus wants this cooperation to start as soon as possible, so that a complete liberalization of trade may occur. Our trade with Poland has slumped in recent years, which is a great pity. [Sulek] How do you explain that? [Fialkova] It is largely due to Poland's protectionist policy and an absence of credit mechanisms to encourage trade. A major obstacle is the high Polish customs tariffs on our products, including cars. It lies in our interests that these tariffs disappear in regional cooperation. A prosperous Poland lies in our interests for it is good to have a rich neighbor with whom one can conduct trade at a profit. It also lies in our interests for the entire Visegrad group to belong to one single security system. We do not insist that we join NATO first. If Poland joins NATO first, we will be very happy about it. Our vice minister for national defense said at the defense ministers' summit that in such a case, we will be second, and we will use Poland's experience. [Sulek] Do you not consider it possible that the Visegrad group might split up and some countries might join NATO and others not? [Fialkova] We Czechs really do not want to split up the Visegrad group. [Sulek] I am not saying the Czechs would do it. [Fialkova] Well, anything is possible in politics. However such an eventuality is unlikely, because it takes two sides to do that. Even if someone on the outside wanted to stop our trade, he would not be able to do so because we are neighbors, and between neighbors there are natural economic, cultural, and political relations. And how can one stop trade? One cannot, if we ourselves do not want to stop it. [Sulek] The Czech Republic is the only former communist country (not counting the GDR) to have clearly dissociated itself from its former structures, hierarchy, and influence. Do you think this had a bearing on your NATO talks and on the different treatment accorded to your country? [Fialkova] There is no indication that NATO has treated us differently, and no one has said anything to this effect. [passage omitted] [Sulek] You have been ambassador in Poland since April 1990. Has the Polish-Czech friendship established during the Solidarity era survived, and do you still have your old acquaintances? [Fialkova] Yes. I have not quarreled with any of my old friends, and I am pleased to say that Polish-Czech relations have never been better. The Poles are liked by the Czechs and by the Slovaks, which is fantastic. I would be very happy if I could contribute something to that friendship.
