FR940721-2-00130 FR940721-2-00073 c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted by the Federal Government; and d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law. Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in FAR Part 150, ยง150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal, state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project grants must be submitted to the FAA Detroit Airports District Office in Belleville, Michigan. Kent County submitted to the FAA on May 4, 1992, noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from September 24, 1987 through May 4, 1992. The Kent County International Airport noise exposure maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on March 4, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1993. The Kent County International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to the year 1995. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on October 29, 1993, and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period would have been deemed to be an approval of such program. The submitted program contained ten (10) proposed actions for noise mitigation. The FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective April 26, 1994. Outright approval was granted for nine (9) of the specific program elements. ``Land Use Measure No. 2'' was partially approved. The measure included non-noise related zoning (height and safety). For the purpose of Part 150, only the noise zoning was approved. The other approved measures include: Noise Abatement Advisory Committee, Noise Complaint Program, Noise Abatement Departure Procedures, Greater Percent of Stage 3 Aircraft, Portable Noise Monitoring Equipment, Comprehensive Land Use Planning and Zoning, Utilize Disclosure Ordinance, Acoustical Treatment/Aviation Easements, and Purchase Assurance Program. These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports on April 26, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and documents which comprised the submittal to the FAA, are available for review at the following locations.
