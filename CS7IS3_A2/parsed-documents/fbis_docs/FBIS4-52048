At the outset of the interview, Kuroiwa asks Mori to comment on the Hata coalition government. Mori stresses: "If the LDP--the largest political party--had formed a coalition government, the current political upheaval would have not occurred." Calling the Hosokawa coalition government a "failure," Mori notes that the ruling coalition partners had difficulty in coordinating policy amongst themselves, then stresses: "The coalition partners should have turned over power to the LDP in accordance with the principle of constitutional government." Discussing the fate of the Hata government, Mori notes the 206 seats held by the LDP in the House of Representatives, stating: "The Hata cabinet is saddled with too many problems in various aspects." During the interview, Mori criticizes Prime Minister Hata for not apologizing to the people for supporting former Prime Minister Hosokawa while he served as deputy prime minister in the Hosokawa cabinet. Mori emphatically states: "In any case, we have to get a budget bill for fiscal 1994 passed in the Diet. He adds: "Various changes are expected to take place once the budget bill is enacted." Discussing the prospects of the LDP retaking power, Mori states: "The LDP is presently engaged in soul-searching on its losing power, using the time to make various efforts and study various things." He adds: "From now on, the LDP will have to consider the process of retaking power and work on polishing its public image." Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the LDP seeking an alliance with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in a bid to return to power, Mori states: "It would be very difficult to reach an agreement with the SDPJ on policies." Noting that an FNN poll shows 64.3 percent of the voters believe the House of Representatives must be dissolved prior to general elections once the budget bill is enacted in the Diet, Kuroiwa asks Mori to comment. Mori discusses how the LDP worked on political reform, particularly the reform of the current electoral system in the past, stating: "The next general elections must be held under a new electoral system called the combined electoral system of proportional representation and single-seat constituency." Hinting at the possibility of the LDP submitting a no-confidence motion to the Diet against the Hata cabinet for delaying the enactment of the budget bill, Mori stresses: "All Diet members are responsible for speedy deliberation of the budget bill and its quick enactment." Discussing how the LDP intends to retake power, Mori points out: "Hata has virtually no knowledge of how to stimulate the economy." He discovered this when Hata served as finance minister in the LDP government. Noting that "industrialists and business managers have come to find that only the LDP's policies can make it possible to run Japan's economy smoothly," Mori says: "The LDP is presently working hard to polish its public image." Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the LDP splitting again, Mori states: "The LDP is formed by politicians with differing views." Kuroiwa concludes the interview at 2351 GMT after thanking the participants.
