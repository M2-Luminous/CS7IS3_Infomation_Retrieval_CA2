He told INTERFAX that "from the very beginning both sides had succeeded in overcoming the cooling of relations, caused by the recent spy scandal, and that the Americans had agreed that the new Russia could not be responsible for everything that had taken place in the past." To quote Rybkin, the leaders of the State Duma committees for international affairs, defense, budget and economic policies had established good contacts with colleagues in the U.S. Congress. He also announced that at the end of March or at the beginning of April Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate, George Mitchell and Robert Dole, would arrive in Moscow on the State Duma's invitation. At the end of the current year or at the beginning of 1995 Speaker of the U.S. Congress's House of Representatives Thomas Foley is likely to visit Moscow, he said. Rybkin stated that cooperation with the U.S. was Russia's absolute priority, because the two countries cannot live without one another in the present-day world. "We also assured our American colleagues that we would promote the reforms which are absolutely irreversible," he said On Wednesday afternoon, the Russian deputies are to meet with President Bill Clinton and Vice President Albert Gore, after which the State Duma delegation will leave for Moscow.
