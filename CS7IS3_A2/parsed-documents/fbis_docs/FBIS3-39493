In this interview -- "the first with a foreign paper, I am greatly looking forward to it" -- he gives a preview of the approach that he intends to take: in the footsteps of Marchais, whom he considers a man of change; against the Europe of Maastricht; cautious and unbending toward the PS [Socialist Party], and caustic on the subject of the left-wing "big bang" so dear to Rocard. [Marsilli] Robert Hue, do you believe that Marchais' membership of the party executive is compatible with your plans for change? How can you avoid being considered a "sponsored" secretary? [Hue] Let us make one thing clear: The initiative was mine. Marchais was against it, and I had to put a lot of pressure on him. [Marsilli] Why did you do it? [Hue] First of all because we cannot do without the contribution of a man like Marchais. Where top-ranking leaders are concerned, moreover, I see similar things happening in other parties, though they do not give rise to the same comments. As for me, I have my own personality as an individual and as a politician. Believe me, I am not under anybody's wing. [Marsilli] Will you opt for continuity or change? [Hue] I want to implement the policies that the communists want and have decided on, those that emerged from our last conference. If we want to give it a name, we may call it "change within continuity." This party is evolving like a multistage rocket. The first stage was launched in the seventies and eighties, when we broke with the Soviet model.... [Marsilli] Broke? [Hue] Yes. Wait a moment, let me finish what I was saying. The second stage was launched at the 28th conference: renewal that spreads and broadens as the communists continue the debate, in a process taking us from a communist tradition bound up with one model to a different analysis, another conception of the party in which there is no place for false unanimity or uniformity. Above all, there are a lot of people in this country who deeply resent the policies of the Right now in power and who are asking themselves just where society, dominated by King Mammon, is going. We do not intend to propose that the French people should do what has failed elsewhere. We do not intend to repeat tomorrow what failed in France in the eighties. [Marsilli] Do you regret the departure of Charles Fiterman (leader of the reformists)? [Hue] I respect his decision to resign his executive responsibilities, but it saddens me. However, I hope to work with him again and with those comrades within the party who wholly or partly share his convictions. Moreover, I have publicly expressed my displeasure at the instances of ostracism that have occurred in the past: Party unity has nothing to do with party uniformity. Indeed, the present executive comprises comrades with different views. [Marsilli] Allow me to run briefly over the party's history. 1956: We have to wait until the seventies before the French communists are officially informed of the Khrushev report. 1968: The PCF dissociates itself from the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia but does not break off relations with the Soviet-controlled puppet government, quite the contrary. 1979: Marchais gives his blessing to the invasion of Afghanistan. The eighties: The PCF mistrusts Gorbachev and perestroyka. Never an in-depth consideration of the relationship between democracy and socialism. Will there be one with you? [Hue] You say "never." Allow me to say that I find this unfair. It is true, as far as 1956 is concerned, we reacted late, very late, and this damaged us. I would add that in the sixties, when the time came to provide a fresh answer to the questions confronting French society following the establishment of the institutions of the Fifth Republic, we were unable to propose anything more than a remake of the People's Front. Not enough. With regard to 1968, our condemnation of the Soviet intervention was unequivocal, despite the fact that we did not break with the "model." But from the early seventies things have changed with Marchais. [Marsilli] Oh yes, such as? [Hue] We have worked out a self-managing socialism for France, we have abandoned the dictatorship of the proletariat for democracy. We now say that the great contemporary issues center on the need for democracy. It is this need that capitalism suffocates, barring the path to progress of any kind: This path lies in fostering the individual's capacity for initiative. [Marsilli] Could you imagine abandoning the term "communist"? [Hue] It is up to each party, and I respect the decisions of each one. As far as I am concerned, I believe that the discredit deriving from a whole historical experience cannot be miraculously shaken off merely by abandoning a word, especially as we lay claim to our name as communists for reasons quite different from events in the East. The term has existed in France since 1789. In our eyes, it expresses, in spite of everything, the finest struggle, the struggle for human liberation.... The mentality that constituted our reference model in the past has failed once and for all, and we reject it to build something else. But what we are fighting for is a real change in society that owes nothing to capitalism, a communist society. [Marsilli] What do you think of the "big bang" that Rocard was talking about a year ago, and about the recent negotiations on the Left? [Hue] I saw "big bang" as exemplifying a frenetic search for a new slogan, which the socialist defeat reduced to more realistic proportions a few weeks later. That idea of Rocard's set out to realign the French political scene toward the center, excluding us. It was suicide for the Left: You cannot build anything on division. I should welcome a more realistic approach on the part of the PS today. [Marsilli] The PS is now much weaker. Do you intend to take advantage of this? [Hue] I have no ambition to strengthen the PCF to the detriment of the others, but I know that millions of people are profoundly disappointed, that the left wing of the population is out there, waiting. And so I want the PCF to be a force that advances proposals, that attracts support. To this extent, the answer is yes, but I do not intend to invert the claim that the PS used to make: We shall take 3 million votes from the PCF.... [Marsilli] How do you see relations on the Left? [Hue] I hope that the Left, and the PS in particular, which has exercised governing power, will look itself hard in the face. We have done so, but the socialists have not. I also want the progressive forces, left-wing people, all those who will not be seduced by the Right, to unite. We must join forces, not in a logic of alternation, mere electoral majority, but as a deep-rooted political alternative. [Marsilli] What do you expect from the Socialist Party? [Hue] That it should talk in concrete terms. That it should reflect on its error in presenting Maastricht as an opportunity for France. That it should seriously weigh up its experience in government. This is what I hope; I do not want to be quarrelsome or aggressive. What I ask for is not displays of public breast-beating, but serious thought. [Marsilli] To which political movement in Europe do you currently feel closest? [Hue] The distinguishing mark of the progressive movement in Europe nowadays is its diversity.... All these forces are confronting the problems involved in constituting an alternative to the neoliberal austerity policies in different conditions. We are working to foster all potential convergences, without prejudices. The problems are the same, the labels are of secondary importance. [Marsilli] What is the motto that you will be taking into the European elections? [Hue] The line of demarcation is not drawn nowadays between pro-Europeans and anti-Europeans, but between those with a progressive concept of Europe and the neomarketeers. We are in favor of building a Europe united in the service of work and social progress, a democratic Europe that shifts the decisionmaking centers toward the people and enhances the sovereignty of nations and peoples, incorporating present-day needs for cooperation. We are in favor of a demilitarized Europe.... [Marsilli] Should we look eternally to the United States to solve our defense and security problems? [Hue] No, we need an autonomous Europe. We are in favor of demilitarization. We have to continue along the road toward disarmament. We think that European security should be founded on a political basis of cooperation.
