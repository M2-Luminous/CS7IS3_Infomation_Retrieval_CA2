FR940627-0-00084 FR940627-0-00014 On March 30, 1994, the U.S. District Court for Alaska issued a decision in the consolidated Katie John, et al. v. the United States, et al. litigation. The court concluded that the Secretaries are entitled to manage fish and wildlife on public lands in Alaska for the purposes of providing the subsistence priority mandated in Title VIII of ANILCA. The court further concluded that, for the purposes of Title VIII, ``public lands'' includes all navigable waterways in Alaska. The court then issued a stay of the decision for 60 days to allow the filing of an appeal and ordered that the stay would remain in effect, pending an appellate decision, if one or more appeals were filed. Because the Federal government has successfully petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to appeal from the district court's decision, the stay presently remains in effect. Because the petition for rulemaking is still under consideration by the Secretaries and because of the stayed court decision relative to actual Federal jurisdiction, the Board believes that issuing regulations immediately, assuming additional authority or revising existing regulations are not warranted and, in fact, appear to be inappropriate at this time. However, any comments or proposals received will be carefully considered and retained for use when the regulations are revised the next time. This interim rule effectively extends the existing regulations until December 31, 1995, or until the Secretaries direct the revision of the subsistence fish and shellfish regulations based on a revised area of jurisdiction, or until the court directs the preparation of regulations implementing its order. The Board finds that public notice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) for this extension are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. A lapse in regulatory control after July 1 could seriously affect the continued viability of fish and shellfish populations, adversely impact future subsistence opportunities for rural Alaskans, and would generally fail to serve the overall public interest. Therefore, the Board finds that good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive the public notice and comment procedures prior to publication of this extension. The Board also finds good cause for the existing rule to be extended until December 31, 1995, (or until they are revoked or superseded whichever comes earlier). This December 31 date is consistent with earlier Board discussions proposing to change the regulatory year for fisheries regulations to January 1 through December 31 to avoid having changes occur during the middle of a fishing season. The Board therefore finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to make this extension effective upon publication. Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities National Environmental Policy Act Compliance_A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence Management Program was distributed for public comment on October 7, 1991. That document described the major issues associated with Federal subsistence management as identified through public meetings, written comments and staff analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the four alternatives. Proposed regulations (Subparts A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence hunting and fishing regulations (Subpart D). The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February 28, 1992. Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, it was the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Forest Service, to implement Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964) implements the Federal Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. Compliance With Section 810 of ANILCA The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A Section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process. The final Section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that the Federal Subsistence Management Program, under Alternative IV with an annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations, may have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but it does not appear that the program may significantly restrict subsistence uses.
