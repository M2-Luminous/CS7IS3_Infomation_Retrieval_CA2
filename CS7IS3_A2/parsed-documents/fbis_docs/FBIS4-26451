So far, a total of 154 senior Army cadres have attended the classes. To assemble senior cadres from the whole Army to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and discuss current major issues in the country and the army's modernization drive was an important measure adopted by the CMC in order to further implement the strategic task of arming the whole army with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and other CMC leaders attended discussions on two occasions with members of the first and second study classes. According to a briefing, members of the study classes diligently studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the light of the realities in the work of each unit or department. They discussed in particular the theme of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist market economy, the building of spiritual civilization under the condition of market economy, and the Army's ideological and political work. Through study, members deepened their understanding of Deng Xiaoping's scientific exposition on the essence of socialism, grasped a deeper insight of the intrinsic meaning of socialism, and enhanced their consciousness and steadfastness in implementing the party's basic line. Meanwhile, they obtained a better understanding of Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist market economy -- especially the theory's formulation, contents, and great significance -- thereby raising their awareness of safeguarding the overall interests and of subordinating themselves to the overall interests. They also further clarified their ideas for work and improved their leadership quality. It is understood that, inspired by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, members of the study class wrote more than 100 theses with keen insight.
