Not much. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today dismissed as total nonsense reports that he had told Egyptian President Husni Mubarak that Israel would agree to implement a full withdrawal on the Golan Heights. Rabin was speaking before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Rabin added that in his opinion, the United States had exhausted its role in the negotiations with Syria and expressed the assessment that the talks in Washington would not resume. [passage omitted] The prime minister opined that the Syrians would not continue the talks in Washington. Incidentally, Mr. Rabin said that the talks held in Washington so far had led to nothing. Rabin also sent a message to the Americans: I believe that Washington has already exhausted its role with regard to the Syrian track, he said. Israel, however, continues to have an interest in occasional visits by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. I am neither pessimistic nor optimistic, the prime minister concluded. The Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem were also discussed at the session. We are currently preparing a list of all the Palestinian institutions and examining the issue not on the basis of goodwill but rather from the viewpoint of the legal measures at our disposal, Rabin said.
