When she heard his voice on the phone, she was very excited as this was unthinkable in the past. The old woman had come from the Ulanqab grassland, in the north of Inner Mongolia. She had a good word to say for the region's booming telecommunications, and with good reason. With the expansion of the region's transportation and telecommunications networks, more than 20 million herdsmen are finding themselves closer to the outside world. They can travel by plane and train to other provinces or even abroad. Through international telecommunications, they speak with their overseas relatives and friends, and television enables them to obtain all kinds of information without leaving home. In Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia, telecommunications systems have connected the city with more than 180 countries and regions throughout the world. Over 200 phone booths are scattered round the city, providing people with domestic and international telephone service. Last year, the region's postal and telecommunications sector invested 760 million yuan (85 million U.S. dollars) in constructing or renovating over 250 telecommunications projects, automating all telephone exchange systems in the region's counties and cities. Meanwhile, more micro-wave lines and optical fiber cables were laid, adding thousands of new long-distance switching networks and telephone exchanges. Improved posts and telecommunications enable the region to get access to changes in the outside, greatly promoting local economy. The region tops the country in its length of micro-wave lines, which measure nearly 5,000 kilometers. Over 75 percent of the region is covered by a television network. In the region are 28 TV stations and over 800 TV transmission stations, as well as over 800 satellite land stations. In addition, the region's transportation network has improved. Inner Mongolia has now opened 35 commercial air routes, carrying more than 100,000 passengers annually. From Hohhot, people can directly reach a dozen major cities in and out of the country. The region has expanded seven airports, among which, the Baita Airport in Hohhot has been approved by the state as an international port. The Manzhouli airport, located at the intersection of several international lines, is expected to become one of China's major international ports and handle all kinds of large cargo and passenger planes after being put into use this year. Also in 1993, rail transport in the region was on the rise. Last year, about 100,000 overseas tourists visited Inner Mongolia. At the same time, thousands of workers, students, technicians, doctors, experts, artists and merchants in the region went abroad.
