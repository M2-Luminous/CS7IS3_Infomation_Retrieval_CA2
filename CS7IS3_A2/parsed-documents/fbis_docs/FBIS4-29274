The agency said the ten persons, charged with violating the National Security Law, were led by An Chae-ku, age 61, a lecturer at Kyonghee University. An was previouly arrested in October 1979 and was given a life term for his involvement in the case of "Namminjon" or the "South Korean Front for National Liberation." He was released in a special parole in December 1988. His colleagues arrested included Chong Hwa-yo, 30, chief editor of Hanbaek Planning Co.; Hong Chung-hui, 37, head of the Wonju Labor Training Institute; Yu Nak-chin, 66, a calligrapher and former North Korean agent; and Pak Nae-kun, 42, head of the Ilsin Foreign Language Institute in Suwon. The announcement said An set up the underground organization at the instructions of North Korea after he was won over in May 1991 by a visiting North Korean operative active in Japan who was identified only as a "Paek" aged 58. He received an operation fund of 10 million won from Paek and joined the Workers' Party. An then recruited co-workers and set up the "Kukuk Chonwi" or "Front for National Salvation" in January 1993, the agency said. A number of evidential materials such as the organization's statute, a congratulatory message from North Korea, copies of reports to North Korea and a short-wave radio were collected through searches of his home at Kalhyon-tong and private office at Taehung- tong in Seoul last June 14, it said.
