In a statement issued today in light of the bloody clashes currently taking place in the Autonomous Region in northern Iraq between the subversive, agent, and treasonous cliques, the party said that the new crimes which are being perpetrated by these cliques clearly reconfirm an established fact; namely, that the Iraqi Kurds will not enjoy peace, security, and true prosperity until the return of legitimacy and the central authority to the all Iraqi Kurdistan. The statement noted that the humiliated enemies, conspirators, and traitors, who have imposed themselves as trustees on the Iraqi Kurds by force, coercion, compulsion, and terrorism, have spread destruction, sabotage, killing, and terrorism all over Kurdistan, and perpetrated all forms of crimes, including the plundering of the Kurdish people's food. They have also spread chaos to the point where the citizens have begun to feel insecure. In its statement, the Kurdistan Democratic Party said that the bloody confrontations taking place between the agent and reactionary symbols and elements were the result of a conflict between their selfish, parochial personal interests, which are linked to the colonialist interests, without taking the Kurdish people's aspirations and hopes into consideration. The party called for solidarity between the Iraqi Kurds and all the honest people in the world to expose these cliques and their relations with the foreigners, to reject all their actions, and to call for the return of legitimacy and the constitutional authority to all Iraqi Kurdistan.
