The objective conditions in China have undergone tremendous changes since 1985, when the country undertook to comprehensively sort out the administrative regulations promulgated by or with the approval of the State Council (including its predecessor the Government Administration Council) before the end of 1984. To meet the needs of the new situation -- that is, reform, opening up to the outside world, and establishing a socialist market economy -- and in accordance with State Council requirements for sorting out the rules and regulations, the State Council ministries undertook again to comprehensively sort out the 286 administrative regulations (excluding the regulations governing foreign-related matters that were declared annulled by a 1988 State Council circular or had become invalid automatically but including administrative regulations promulgated in 1985), the 33 administration regulations that were left out the first time, and the 365 administrative regulations by the State Council between 1986 and 1993 -- 684 pieces in all. After the State Council Bureau of Legislative Affairs item-by-item examination of the sorted out regulations, the State Council has decided to announce the annulment of 21 items (including those that have become invalid automatically). Of them, 13 were annulled by corresponding new laws or replaced by new administrative regulations while the eight others have become invalid automatically because the intended objects of the regulations disappeared, the period of applicability has expired, or because the specific, legally binding provisions formulated in reference to a specific issue have become obsolete. Rulings that were made on the basis of these administrative regulations remain valid. Moreover, 86 administrative regulations have been specifically declared annulled by laws and administrative regulations promulgated between 1986 and 1993. A catalog of the invalid regulations is also included here to help various regions and departments obtain an overall understanding of the condition of those invalid administrative regulations, thereby facilitating their work. Annex I: A catalog of invalid administrative regulations promulgated before the end of 1993 that were annulled or have become invalid automatically (21 items). Annex II: A catalog of administrative regulations that were specifically annulled by laws and administrative regulations promulgated between 1986 and 1993 (86 items).
