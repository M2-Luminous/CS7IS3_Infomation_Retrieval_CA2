FR941012-1-00003 FR941012-1-00001 The Department notes that §§200.1220(a) and 760.20(a) of HUD's current regulations (24 CFR 200.1220(a), 24 CFR 760.20(a)) already require that the collection of employee income, wage and claim information be conducted, to the extent applicable, in accordance with the Privacy Act. Accordingly, this rule does not propose to make any changes to implement this statutory requirement. Section 904(e) also requires that the consent to release such information be limited with respect to time, and only cover information relevant and necessary to meet the requirements of section 904. In compliance with this statutory mandate, the Department is preposing to remove the regulatory provisions which authorize the collection of information, ``including information which can be obtained under other laws, regulations and handbooks.'' The rule also proposes to make the consent to release effective for 15 months from the time of execution, which is responsive to the recommendation in the House conference report. (H.R. Rep. No. 760, 102 Cong., 2d Sess. at 158 (1992).) Last, section 903 of 1992 Act requires that the Department develop a new consent form. This consent form has been issued by the Department; therefore, this proposed rule does not cover this release form. Section 3003 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 requires that applicants and participants sign a consent form authorizing the Secretary of HUD to request that the Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury release information pursuant to section 6103(l)(7)(D)(ix) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Information released under this authority would be provided to HUD for the sole purpose of verifying income information pertinent to the applicant's or participant's eligibility or level of assisted housing benefits. Also, Section 3003 amends section 904 of the McKinney Act to allow HUD to use income return data, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. This information will include: wages, net earnings from self-employment, payments of retirement income, and unearned income as referenced in sections 6103(l)(7)(A) and 6103(l)7)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. HUD may match this information to information provided by applicants or participants when applying for initial or continued eligibility for assisted housing programs. Other Matters A. Environmental Impact In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this proposed rule relate to internal administrative procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project areas or building sites and, therefore are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.
