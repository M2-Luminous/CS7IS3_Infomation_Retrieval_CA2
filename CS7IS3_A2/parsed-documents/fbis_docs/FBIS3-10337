The president refused to consider the recommendations made by the World Bank. He said efforts are being made to overcome the crisis, particularly the energy crisis and its repercussions on the economic stability of our country. Members of the World Bank and international credit organizations have recommended that the government privatize the National Enterprise for Electric Power [ENEE], the Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise (Hondutel), and the National Autonomous Aqueduct and Sewage Service (SANAA), among others. They also recommended that the National Autonomous University of Honduras be privatized, and school tuition be increased. These financial institutions suggested that other restrictive actions be taken so that the government reduces decentralized institutions and some of them disappear. All these actions have been included in a document that was delivered to the government on 2 February 1994. President Carlos Roberto Reina has said several times he was not going to yield to international credit organizations. At this time, Reina ratified that the intentions of the international credit institutions will not even be taken into consideration, much less those of the World Bank. Reina made the aforementioned statements after being questioned on his visit to the Foreign Ministry. [Begin recording] [Reina] I come from a meeting with the foreign minister and the members of the Commission of Sovereignty and Borders. I gave specific instructions to the Foreign Ministry. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, what do you know about the measures the Reina administration must adopt regarding the World Bank recommendations? [Reina] I am not aware of those measures. You are better informed than I am. [Reporter] But what will the government's position be? Will the recommendations made by these institutions be observed? [Reina] Our position is unchanged. The sovereignty corresponds to the Honduran people who spoke at the polls. No measure recommended by any international organization will even be considered if it does not respect the basic interests of our people. [end recording] President Reina's statements were very clear. He said he will not even consider the recommendations made by international credit organizations. When asked about the devaluation, this is what he said: [Begin recording] [Reina] Those are very technical terms. What we must do is improve the country's economy. If we do not improve the country's economy, if we do not produce more, if we do not close the commercial deficit of Honduras, it will be useless to have wise people handling these affairs. I want the Honduran economy to improve because we produce more, we export more. In addition, the secure supply of food that I offered during my campaign is a fundamental objective of my administration, on which we are working tenaciously and with determination. [Unidentified reporter]) Are you concerned about the situation of the ENEE in the face of the latest power outages and the announcements made by this institution? Will the supply of energy receive priority treatment? [Reina] Of course. The situation of the ENEE is serious. It has been dragging on for some time. It is partly the result of nature. The deforestation of the Francisco Morazan Dam basin is part of the problem, but we are seeking, through the most honest persons we have been able to find, adequate solutions. [Reporter] Mr. President, another problem that concerns society is the situation of the ENEE. Some sectors believe this situation may deteriorate irreversibly if specific and necessary actions are not taken. It is believed this situation may result in an increase in energy rates of over 100 percent. A business leader stated that the ENEE must file for bankruptcy so it can be turned over to private enterprise. To what degree does this statement affect the image of the ENEE before the eyes of international organizations. [Reina] I do not think that is the solution. This may undermine the prestige of the country. We must seek correct solutions at the appropriate time. [end recording] These were statements by President Carlos Roberto Reina on the recommendations of the World Bank and the actions to be taken regarding the ENEE, Hondutel, and SANAA, and specifically the problem presented by the announced devaluation.
