A provincial official said that Zhejiang will draw on the experience of other provinces and overseas in the development of its maritime economy, and encourage people to tap the natural resources under the principle of "those who invest in and develop the economy will benefit from it." With a vast population but limited territory, Zhejiang has 2,100 islands with combined coastlines of more than 6,300 km. Its rapid economic development with poor natural resources on land has forced the province to focus on the ocean. So far, Zhejiang has set up eight breeding bases for aquatic products, and sent more than 100 ocean-going ships to the Pacific Ocean to catch fish, and process and sell it in neighboring countries. Last year saw the province reap a good fishing harvest for the tenth year running. It caught 1.56 million tons of aquatic products and exported 200 million U.S. dollars-worth of them. According to the official, localities in Zhejiang have spent more than 300 million yuan on building 35 ports and docks over the past five years. At present, Zhejiang has a total of 58 sea ports, which have relations with more than 200 ports overseas. The province has formed an integrated group of ports with Ningbo and Zhoushan as the centers. The power industry is developing alongside the port construction, according to the official, as state enterprises have invested more than 10 billion yuan in this field over the past five years. So far, a number of power plants have gone into operation. Included are the Beilun Power Plant, Jiaxing Power Plant and Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, which have helped the province to raise its power-generating capacity by more than 40 percent. In addition, the province is making full use of wind, water and tidal power to generate electricity. Being an up-and-coming area in tapping ocean resources, Zhejiang has improved tourist facilities and services to attract more tourists from overseas. Islands that have opened to tourists at home and abroad include Putuo mountain, one of China's four sacred places of Buddhism, and the Chengsi isles, known as the "Oriental Hawaii". A survey shows that the number of visitors to these islands had increased to more than two million last year. The official noted that the discovery of oil and natural gas deposits in the east China sea has enhanced the provincial government's determination to expand the oceanic economy. About 20 trans-national corporations from Europe and America have come to the offshore areas off Wenzhou, Zhejiang, to prospect for crude oil and natural gas since last year. "All this indicates that Zhejiang's maritime economy is in the ascendant," the official said.
