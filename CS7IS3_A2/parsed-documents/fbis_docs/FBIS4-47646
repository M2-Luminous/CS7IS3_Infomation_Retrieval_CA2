Bureaucrats Resist Tokyo's Deregulation Efforts Bureaucrats Resist Tokyo's Deregulation Efforts SUMMARY Opposition from officials in Japan's key economic ministries appears to be slowing the Japanese Government's progress in drawing up measures to deregulate the Japanese economy and open Japanese markets. The ruling coalition is searching for ways to undercut this opposition, but so far appears to have had little success. The coalition may ultimately be able to gain some leverage against the bureaucrats by drawing on support from those in Japan's business community who see the relaxation of some regulations as a means to jumpstart the Japanese economy and who are increasingly critical of the Japanese bureaucracy for resisting deregulation. END SUMMARY Some elements of the Japanese bureaucracy appear to be trying to limit the scope of the measures the Japanese Government is attempting to draw up as part of the detailed market opening package it has promised to announce by the end of June. -- According to the 12 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, at a 12 May meeting of the Working Group on Import Promotion, Market Access Improvement, and Distribution--one of the subpanels under the prime minister's Administrative Reform Council charged with compiling detailed proposals for deregulation--bureau chiefs from ministries and agencies involved in deregulation efforts gave briefings in which they stressed that it would be difficult to relax many of the regulations under review. -- At another meeting of the same group on 18 May, the directors general of the Ministries of Finance, International Trade and Industry, and Transport reportedly attempted to defend many of the current regulations governing commodity distribution, the granting of permits, and import procedures. The 18 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that most of the officials at the meeting argued that, "under present conditions," they could not abolish many of these regulations. -- When the private sector recently submitted a package of 71 deregulation proposals to the Working Group, the ministries and agencies involved reportedly rejected the vast majority of them in whole or in part. According to a report compiled by the working group, summarized in the 22 May Yomiuri Shimbun, the government offices indicated that they were prepared to fully implement only two of the proposals--suggestions for shortening the time required to obtain a license to engage in the food business and for relaxing regulations governing foreign investment in certain telecommunications projects. The ministries said they would "consider" 29 of the remaining proposals--including a suggestion for simplifying the procedures for obtaining a license to deal in antiques. They refused to act on 25 of the proposals because they argued they were "based on misunderstandings." On the 15 remaining suggestions, they asserted that some action had already been taken, making further steps unnecessary. -- Some of the private sector proposals that the ministries reportedly rejected--such as a plan to lift restrictions on the establishment of holding companies--were also reported to be in the guidelines the ruling coalition drew up to guide intragovernmental discussions of deregulation (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 4 May), suggesting that the bureaucracy is also resisting parts of the government guidelines. The resistance from sections of the bureaucracy appears to be significantly slowing the government's efforts to draw up detailed deregulation proposals in some areas. In an article in the 23 May Nikkei Weekly, Shojiro Makino, a businessman who serves on the Working Group on Import Promotion, Market Access Improvement, and Distribution, described how a Transport Ministry official held up work at a recent working group meeting by arguing at length with panel members over the merits of a rather minor change that would allow individuals to operate trucking businesses. Whenever panel members tried to support the change by citing other areas where individuals were allowed to operate businesses, the official countered with a host of reasons why the precedents did not apply. Iwao Nakatani, a professor at Hitotsubashi University and member of the working group, wrote in the 23 May Yomiuri Shimbun that he thought the working group would not be able to "hammer out fundamental deregulation measures that can meet expectations both at home and abroad" because of the "government offices' posture of defending regulations." Government Countermeasures Leaders of the ruling coalition appear to be searching for ways to circumvent the bureaucracy, pressuring the ministers in charge of the key economic ministries to play a more active role in guiding the deliberations on deregulation and overruling bureaucrats if necessary. At a 12 May news conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai reportedly warned that deregulation could not be left in the hands of bureaucrats, who would "drag their feet" over the issue, according to the 12 May Asahi Shimbun. He added that "all ministers must make every possible effort to achieve deregulation even if this means risking their political careers." Several days later, on 17 May, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reportedly held a special meeting with key economic ministers at which he urged them to take the initiative in formulating deregulation measures (Kyodo, 17 May). On 19 May, Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, held talks on deregulation with six key cabinet members, according to the 20 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun. Speaking with Ishida later in the day, Prime Minister Hata appeared to allude to the need to overcome bureaucratic opposition to deregulation by commenting that Ishida should "spread determination to promote deregulation among various ministries and agencies." The ruling coalition, however, appears to have made little progress so far. According to a 17 May Kyodo report, Economic Planning Agency head Yoshio Terasawa acknowledged to reporters after Prime Minister Hata's 17 May meeting with key economic ministers that the ministers had not been able to formulate any specific plans for handling deregulation. Business Support for Deregulation Although the ruling coalition is politically weak, it may be able to draw on support in the Japanese business community--which sees deregulation as a way to stimulate the moribund Japanese economy- -to gain leverage with the bureaucracy. Several leading Japanese business groups have actively lobbied the government in favor of deregulation, particularly in areas where these groups see deregulation as benefiting Japanese business. For example, Masaru Hayami, chairman of Japan's second largest business group, the Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) met with Prime Minister Hata on 1O May to urge him to vigorously promote economic reform and deregulation, which Hayami described as "vital" to Japan's economic recovery. On 13 May, Japan's largest business organization, the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), reportedly sent a letter supporting deregulation to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai (Kyodo, 13 May). The same day, Keidanren presented Prime Minister Hata with a 196- point proposal for deregulating such areas as land and housing regulations, communications, distribution, and agriculture, and Keidanren Vice Chairman Nakauchi met with Hata to discuss his views on deregulation (Kyodo, 13 May; Yomiuri Shimbun, 15 May). Business leaders who support deregulation have also been increasingly critical of the bureaucracy for resisting reform. According to the 12 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a group of businessmen represented on the Working Group on Import Promotion, Market Access Improvement, and Distribution--including Keidanren Vice Chairman Nakauchi--sharply criticized senior government bureaucrats attending the working group's 12 May meeting for failing to vigorously promote deregulation. Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted one private sector representative as stating that the panel--composed of businessmen and scholars--believed that "it is time for the ministries and agencies concerned to pool their wisdom and announce plans for productive deregulation." At the 18 May meeting of the panel, private sector members reportedly once again upbraided senior officials briefing the group, accusing them of foot-dragging. According to the 18 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, private sector representatives told the officials that they "must change their attitude of arguing that regulations are justified by Japan's special circumstances." The same day, Keidanren Vice Chairman Nakauchi reportedly sent a letter to various ministries, criticizing them for "trying to protect their authority" by resisting deregulation. Business support for some aspects of deregulation appears to have had some success in getting the government to consider more extensive changes than it originally planned. For example, the 4 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the government originally planned to include in its deregulation package some modifications of the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law that regulates the operation of larger retail outlets. When influential parts of the business community began to call for the abolition of the law, however, the government began to examine the possibility of gradually phasing it out. Outlook Because of opposition from the bureaucracy, the Japanese government will probably be able to draw up only a relatively unambitious package of deregulation measures by the June deadline. Although some of the politicians in the ruling coalition appear committed to deregulation, most have only a general knowledge of the regulations they seek to abolish and are heavily dependent on the bureaucracy to supply the details needed to draw up and carry out a comprehensive program of deregulation. In addition, the coalition is currently preoccupied with a number of other concerns, including the volatile political climate in Japan and the government's shaky political standing, and may be unable to focus sufficient attention on breaking the logjam over deregulation. Business community support for deregulation may provide leverage against bureaucratic opposition and secure more extensive reforms in some instances. However, the government will probably be able to count on this support only in areas where deregulation serves the interests of Japanese business, and not in those areas where business sees deregulation as less beneficial or even harmful.
