The Greek Government is now considering the likelihood of being compelled to send Greek troops to join the peace forces in Bosnia. According to information available at the Foreign Ministry and the National Defense Ministry, the United Nations will accept the Turkish proposal for the dispatch of Turkish troops as Blue Helmets [UN forces] in Bosnia. Referring to this possibility, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said yesterday that a new situation is developing with pressure by Turkey, which the Greek Government has to address. The Greek Government has been intensely preoccupied since yesterday with the new developments. Our diplomats have already put pressure on UN officials so that the Turkish proposal will not be accepted because Turkey falls within the guidelines of international conventions that define which states cannot participate in the peace forces. Along with the diplomatic moves, the competent departments of the National Defense Ministry are also vigilant. A number of meetings have been held at the National Defense Ministry and officials of the [Greek] Pentagon said that Greece is prepared to address any eventualities. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos also stressed in a statement the requirement that no Balkan country should participate in the UN peace forces in Bosnia. Mr. Venizelos said that Greece is following the developments with particular attention and makes a joint appraisal of all the facts. The spokesman stressed: What is of primary importance is that Balkan countries and countries that have historically been involved in the problem must not participate in the UN military forces in Bosnia. Responding to a question on convening the party leaders' council under the chairmanship of the president, the government spokesman said that the government does not oppose the principle of such meetings but it does not seem that there is a specific reason now for a party leaders' meeting under the president. Besides, he added, the basic options of the government's foreign policy cover a broad political spectrum and move within the framework that was formulated at the recent meetings of the party leader under the president. Deputy National Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris, in a statement to a private radio station, said: The Greek position on the participation of military forces from other Balkan countries in the former Yugoslavia is firm. However, if there is a case of military involvement by other Balkan countries in the situation that now prevails in the Balkan region, then the government might find itself in need of reconsidering its position. This is something that we will see in the course of things, Mr. Kouris concluded.
