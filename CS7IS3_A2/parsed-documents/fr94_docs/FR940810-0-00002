ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to implement the ``Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89), which provides for the temporary extension and orderly termination of the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) and specifies how former PMRS employees will be paid. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 9, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Weddel, (202) 606&hyph;2858, concerning questions about the changes in 5 CFR parts 511, 530, 531, 536, 575, 591, and 595; and Barbara Colchao, (202) 606&hyph;2720, concerning questions about the changes in 5 CFR parts 293, 351, 430, 432, 451, 540, and 771. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 15, 1993, at 58 FR 65531, OPM published interim regulations to implement the ``Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89), with a 60-day comment period. These regulations were made effective retroactive to November 1, 1993. On December 30, 1993, at 58 FR 69169, OPM published final regulations to implement locality-based comparability payments under the ``Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990'' (FEPCA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;509). The locality pay regulations revised the definitions of scheduled annual rate of pay in §§531.101 and 531.301 which were previously published in the interim regulations implementing the PMRS Termination Act. The final regulations on locality pay were made effective January 1, 1994, and were applicable on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. On February 3, 1994, at 59 FR 5223, OPM published corrections to fix three typographical errors in the interim regulations for PMRS termination. During the comment period, which ended February 14, 1994, OPM received three comments, each from a different Federal agency. One agency suggested revising the regulations to clarify that employees cannot ``become'' GM employees after November 1, 1993, and to specify the personnel actions that would trigger loss of GM status. A second agency asked for clarification of whether an employee who loses coverage as a result of a temporary promotion regains coverage when the temporary promotion ends, and if so, how the employee's pay would be set. A third agency felt that the text of §531.406(b)(2) (i)&hyph;(iii) specifying when time in a non-pay status is creditable service for a within-grade increase should be simplified. The agency also asserted that certain definitions in §§531.101 and 531.301 were superseded by revised definitions in the final locality pay regulations. Finally, it was called to our attention that the instructions for setting pay on loss of GM status should be revised to clarify that pay retention is not required if an employee requests a reduction in grade. Following are the major issues raised, a summary of comments on each issue, and a discussion of changes made to the interim regulations. 1. The definition of GM employee and loss of status as a GM employee. Summary of Comments: One agency suggested that the statutory basis (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89) for the definition of GM employee should be introduced in its regulatory definition in §531.202. The agency also noted that the timing and basis for GM status could be clarified. Another agency specifically asked for clarification of whether an employee who loses GM status when temporarily promoted after October 31, 1993, regains GM status when the temporary promotion ends. Discussion and Changes: OPM is adopting the suggestion that section 4 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;89, the Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993, be introduced in the definition of GM employee (see §531.202(e)). Where possible, we are replacing references to coverage under section 4 of the Act with references to the amended definition of GM employee and, where appropriate, to a new paragraph, ``status as a GM employee'' (see §531.203(g)), which specifies personnel actions under which an employee would retain or permanently lose GM status (see 531.204 (d), (e) and (f), and §536.308(b)(3)). Also, §531.204(d) and the definition of GM employee have been amended to remove any suggestion that status as a GM employee can be acquired any time other than on November 1, 1993, the effective date of section 4 of the Act. When a temporary promotion begins after October 31, 1993, coverage under section 4 of the PMRS Termination Act (GM status) ends because of the change in grade. Coverage cannot be regained once it is lost because it is linked to continuous service as a supervisor or management official in the same grade and in the same agency after October 31, 1993. Coverage is acquired only once, on November 1, 1993.
