The live-firing exercise was the fifth such exercise since the beginning of this year. During his observation, the lieutenant governor surveyed how the highway was blockaded during the live-firing exercise and how the exercise affected the lives of residents. This is the first time that the lieutenant governor has observed an exercise since taking office. Meanwhile, a rally was staged to protest the live-firing exercise in Kodai, Igei District, under the auspices of the Okinawa Peace Movement Center. Rally participants blocked about 70 armed U.S. Marines trying to march through the rally, sparking a brief jostle between the Marines and labor unionists. Lieutenant Governor Masanori and other prefectural government officials arrived at Prefectural Highway 14 at 0800 on the morning of 14 June when the live-fire exercise began. Katsuhiro Yoshida, chief of Kin town, told the lieutenant governor: "Forty years of live-firing exercise have turned Mt. Onna into a treeless mountain. Nature there is being destroyed. Red soil from training grounds where trees and rocks have disappeared are destroying Kin Bay. I want the live-firing exercise halted immediately." The town chief also pleaded with the lieutenant governor for an early enactment of the Military Land Conversion Law to promote the effective use of military lands to be returned. In response, the lieutenant governor said: "U.S. Forces in Okinawa are certainly moving to cut back their training. However, the live-firing exercise is not a problem that can be resolved simply by streamlining and scaling back U.S. military bases in Okinawa. The exercises should be halted completely. I intend to speak out against the exercises with the residents' sufferings in mind." One shell after another was fired into Mt. Onna when the lieutenant governor observed the live-firing exercise.
