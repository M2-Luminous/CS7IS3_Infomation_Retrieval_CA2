T. Potapov, A. M. Mamedov, S. V. Shatalin, R. V. Yushkaytis; UDC 681.586:681.7.068] [Abstract] A method is proposed for construction of multiplex systems of fiber-optical interferometric sensors entirely without optical directional couplers. In these systems, the signal waves are formed by reflecting a portion of the radiation, propagating in the fiber lightguide, from semi- transparent mirrors, built within it, or from the internal nonhomogenieties of the lightguide itself. When they arrive back into the laser cavity, the lasing amplitude changes. Small changes in the length of the optical path in the lightguide, caused by the physical effects, which are being examined, can be detected by controlling the laser output. Theoretical relationships are developed for a frequency-modulated laser with optical feedback and the carrier frequency modulation method for multiplex sensors is discussed. Modulation characteristics of a He-Ne laser, the bistability of the longitudinal modes are examined and the effect of cross-talk is estimated. Autodyne multiplex sensors including underwater acoustics antenna and temperature sensors are also briefly discussed. The experimental study of frequency-scanned He-Ne-laser operating with different lightguide systems demonstrated that an autodyne detection is suitable for application with distributed sensors employing a Rayleigh scattering signal.
