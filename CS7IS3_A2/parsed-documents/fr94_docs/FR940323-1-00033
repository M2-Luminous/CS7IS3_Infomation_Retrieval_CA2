Section 435.117 is revised to read as follows: §435.117 Newborn children. (a) The agency must provide categorically needy Medicaid eligibility to a child born to a woman who is eligible as categorically needy and is receiving Medicaid on the date of the child's birth. The child is deemed to have applied and been found eligible for Medicaid on the date of birth and remains eligible as categorically needy for one year so long as the woman remains eligible or (with respect to infants born on or after January 1, 1991) would have remained eligible if still pregnant and the child is a member of the woman's household. If the mother's basis of eligibility changes to medically needy, the child is eligible as medically needy under §435.301(b)(1)(iii). (b) An infant is considered to be a member of his or her mother's household for so long as he or she is continuously hospitalized after birth, unless the mother has legally relinquished control of the child or the State has established that she has abandoned the child. After the infant's release from the hospital, or in situations not involving hospitalization, States must apply the AFDC rules to determine if an infant (who is not an SSI beneficiary) is a member of his or her mother's household. 6.
