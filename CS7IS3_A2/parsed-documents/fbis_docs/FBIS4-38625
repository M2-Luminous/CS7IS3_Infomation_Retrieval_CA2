Addressing the Latin American parliament on Saturday, Shumeyko who leads a group of Russian parliamentarians on a Latin American tour, said that "Latin American countries deserve our efforts to promptly develop effective cooperation with them in the spheres of inter-parliamentary activity, economics, culture, science and education." Shumeyko informed Latin American parliamentarians about the activity of the Russian Federal Assembly and its upper house, the Federation Council, stressing that the experience of Latin American lawmakers is worth studying and using in Russia. He said that the Latin American parliament and the CIS Inter- Parliamentary Assembly that he heads have much in common, adding that both organisations have a large and yet untapped potential. "The closer we are to each other, the more we help each other, the stronger and richer our countries will be," he said. From Sao Paulo the Russian delegation left for Rio de Janeiro.
