According to the Ministry's press release, as of 1 April 1994, foreign capital investments in Ukraine totalled $180.5 million having increased by $66.7 million over the January-March 1994 period. Canada topped the list of major investors (32.7 per cent of the aggregate amount), followed by Germany (11.6 per cent), the United States (11.1 per cent), Cyprus and Switzerland (4.2 per cent each nation), the United Kingdom and Poland (2.9 per cent each nation). Russia topped the list of former Union nations, which invested in Ukraine (1.7 million US dollars, or 73.7 per cent of the former Union nations' total investments). Other nations' investments in Ukraine's economy were much more sluggish and totalled $3.9 million by the first quarter's close, or just one-forty-fifth of the total investment amount. However, their first quarter increment amounted to 2.9 million dollars in the first quarter of 1994. Ukraine's capital investments in the January-March 1994 period were channeled predominantly into economies of European nations (99 per cent of the total) with Austria having topped the list of recipient nations ($2.9 million).

Ukrainian enterprises with foreign investments, in particular, those located in Kiev, are basically engaged in trading and go-between activities (80 per cent of the total amount of enterprises). Product manufacture and rendering services are basic types of activities for respectively 15 and 5 per cent of the enterprises. The Cabinet's Decree of 20 May 1993, "On the State Program for foreign investment attraction", provides the legal foundation for effecting foreign capital investments in Ukraine. Following the Decree's provisions, the Law on the State Program for foreign investment attraction was passed in December 1993 (see UBN no. 7/1994). The State Program is designed to stimulate investments in large state-owned enterprises with preference given to 11 key branches of the national economy. Ukraine's very immediate foreign capital investment requirements to cover just a few years to come are estimated at $5 billion. The Ukrainian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations is currently drafting a list of Ukrainian enterprises, which need foreign capital perfusions with specified amounts of investments, forms of cooperation and areas of activities. The list is supposed to be annually revised and complemented.
