FBIS4-17618 "drsov080_m_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Tajikistan Increased Opposition on Afghan Border Increased Opposition on Afghan Border LD2504125094 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1044 GMT 25 Apr 94 LD2504125094 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Colonel-General Grigoriy Bessmertniy, the chief of staff of the joint peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, told INTERFAX that the opposition was stepping up its activity on the Tajik-Afghan border. Military experts estimate that about 8,000 militants have been concentrated along the Tajik-Afghan border, he said. The situation is particularly tense in the Pyanj section, where militants attempt to cross the border and bring weapons to Tajikistan. The opposition formations are equipped with automatic rifles, Stinger missiles, grenade launchers, recoilless rifles and self-made rocket launchers, and are much better trained than the Tajik forces. Despite this, the Tajik opposition will not be able to break the defense line and penetrate into Tajikistan, said Bessmertniy. Tajikistan is strong enough to prevent civil war, he added. Speaking about the role of the peacekeeping forces, he said that fighting against the Islamic opposition was not their goal. "Our goal is to prevent armed conflicts and help border guards," said Bessmertniy.
