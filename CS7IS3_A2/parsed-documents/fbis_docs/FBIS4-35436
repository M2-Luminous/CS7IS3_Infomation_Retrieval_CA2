He demands that "status quo" be preserved in the city and vows that Arabs will pursue their struggle for city control. He is not speaking of negotiations, he is speaking of control. Agreements are the last thing on his mind, and he is, as a matter of fact, saying precisely the same things his master 'Arafat did, although he is using more refined phrases. His remarks are neither baloney nor poppycock. They demand a reaction, an immediate one. The required reaction is clear: The Orient House offices must be closed down, all PLO offices -- however they may be disguised or named -- must be moved from Jerusalem to Gaza or Jericho, and an unequivocal clarification must be issued -- in deed, not in words -- that the autonomy will not penetrate Jerusalem, either overtly or covertly. As far as we are concerned, al-Husayni's remarks, too, are a call for jihad, a jihad without the commentators' smart-alecky interpretations. The only difference between the PLO head and his representative in Jerusalem is that 'Arafat made his remarks in Johannesburg, in what he believed was a closed setting. Al-Husayni dares make his statements in Jerusalem, striving to do it as publicly as possible.
