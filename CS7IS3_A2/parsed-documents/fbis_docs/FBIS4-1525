On behalf of the Central Military Commission (CMC), Yu Yongbo, member of the CMC and director of the General Political Department, attended a ceremonial meeting to express his congratulations. He urged all-army theoretical workers to shoulder their historical mission and provide better services to army building and reform; to the strategic mission of arming the whole army with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the improvement of the army's Marxist theoretical level; and to the self-awareness and resolution of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in carrying out the party's basic line. The center, which is located in the PLA National Defense University, is one of five devoted to the study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Establishing these centers is a strategic move by the CPC Central Committee, aimed at strengthening the whole party's ideological construction and pushing forward China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. The center's fundamental tasks are to deepen the whole army's theoretical studies, continuously enhance the quality and effectiveness of such studies, and to guide cadres and soldiers to accurately assess, based on the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, various new experiences and problems cropping up in today's society; and to help them sum up new experiences and conduct new theoretical explorations by closely integrating the realities of reform and opening up to further enrich and develop the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. During his speech, Yu Yongbo pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics represents an energetic Marxism for contemporary China, a strong ideological weapon for pushing forward China's cause of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and a fundamental guiding principle for all our work. The fundamental task for the ideological and theoretical front lies in arming the thinking of the whole party, whole army, and people across the country with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. At present, China's economic restructuring has developed to a critical stage where major breakthroughs are integrated with overall progress. Only when we strengthen the study and publicity of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and turn it into a genuinely strong spiritual pillar for the whole party, whole army, and all nationalities across the country, and enable them to conscientiously apply it in answering and solving various important issues encountered during the course of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, can we make new contributions to reform, development, and stability; and ensure the success of the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Yu Yongbo said: The center's tasks include the following points: First, by summing up our party's past experiences, it should comprehensively and accurately master the scientific system of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It should unswervingly uphold and carry out the party's basic line, and play an exemplary role in studying and mastering the guiding spirit of this theory. Second, by closely combining the realities of reform and opening up and with the help of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, it should explore and answer various important theoretical and practical issues in our society; and play a leading role in explaining and giving publicity to the party's various principled policies. Third, while giving prominence to the army's own characteristics, it should strive to implement Comrade's Deng Xiaoping's ideological thinking concerning army building in the actual work of troops during the new period. It should provide theoretical explanations for some important issues in army building, and play a consultative role for the CMC and the three headquarters in making scientific decisions. Fourth, it should pay attention to the situation of the army's ideological construction at all times and guide the troops to do a good job in instilling this theory. It should make great efforts to encourage healthy trends, and play a guiding role in improving spiritual civilization construction. Fifth, guided by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, it should continuously strengthen contacts and cooperation with research centers of the Central Party School, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and State Education Commission as well as other research institutes. It should play a linking role in facilitating the flow of exchanges and results of civil-military research activities. It should shoulder the great responsibility of "arming the people with scientific theories" and provide better services to the state's reform, opening up, and modernization drive as well as to the enhancement of the troops' combat effectiveness. Attending the meeting were responsible comrades of the General Political Department, PLA National Defense University, Propaganda Department, Central Party School, State Education Commission, and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
