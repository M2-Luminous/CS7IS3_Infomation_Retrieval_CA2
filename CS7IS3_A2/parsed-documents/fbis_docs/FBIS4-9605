Cimoszewicz stated that he knows nothing about the drawing up by the government of a timetable for implementing Solidarity's demands, with the intention of presenting it to the trade unionists, as the strikers are demanding. "Any kind of serious negotiations on any kind of demands in circumstances when strikes are continuing are hard to imagine," Cimoszewicz stressed. He announced that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will put forward the government's position on the strikes in the Sejm on 29 April. [passage omitted]
