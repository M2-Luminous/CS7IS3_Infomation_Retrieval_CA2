FR940413-2-00010 FR940413-2-00005 They state that the VAT adjustment probably did not affect dumping margins where net U.S. prices were compared to net third-country prices, but it likely resulted in more below-cost sales which, in turn, increased the dumping margin. They state that the Department should recalculate costs and exclude the relevant VATs. Department's Position: We agree with respondents and have changed our calculations accordingly. Comment 4: Respondents contend that the Department should not include U.S. and third-country sample sales and resales in its dumping calculations. Resales occurred when a customer cancelled an order, and the manufacturer found another buyer for the merchandise. They argue that these sales did not occur in the ordinary course of trade and that their inclusion affected the dumping margins. They claim that sample sales and resales are unrepresentative of sales routinely undertaken by Korean companies, and that the inclusion of such sales is patently unfair, as they are not a means of price discrimination, but of promoting sweater sales and disposing of small volumes of cancelled orders. Respondents argue that the Department has in the past excluded small quantity/high price sales when the transactions in question are ``trial sales for evaluation'' or ``sales of sample merchandise'' and are ``not for consumption but rather for evaluation purposes.'' To support this argument they cite Tapered Roller Bearings; Finished and Unfinished, and Parts Thereof, From Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review, 57 FR 4951, 4959 (February 11, 1992) (TRBs from Japan), and Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 58 FR 50343, 50345 (September 27, 1993) (PTFE from Japan). Department's Position: It is our established practice not to exclude sample sales or resales in the U.S. market in administrative reviews, and respondents provide no justification for doing so in this case. There is no statutory or regulatory authority for excluding U.S. sales from review. Section 353.46(a) provides for the exclusion of sales made outside the ordinary course of trade from the calculation of FMV; however, no such provision is made for disregarding sales made outside the ordinary course of trade from the calculation of U.S. price. In a less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation we have the discretion to eliminate unusual sales from our analysis; in an administrative review, however, the statute and the regulations require that we analyze all U.S. sales, except when sampling techniques are used. (See 19 U.S.C. 1677f-1; 19 C.F.R. 353.59 (1994). See, also, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, 58 FR 39729, 39776 (July 26, 1993) and Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan, 56 FR 14072, 14079 (April 5, 1991).) In PTFE from Japan we noted that, historically, the Department has considered all transactions to be sales whenever ownership transfers to an unrelated party. Due to the peculiar nature of PTFE resin, the consideration of transfer of ownership was inapplicable, because samples of resin, once used in testing, could not be returned in the original form to the seller. In the present case, sample sales made in the United States involved a transfer of ownership between parties, and respondents have not shown the existence of any special circumstances, such as obtained in PTFE from Japan, that would cause us to deviate from our practice. TRBs from Japan, which respondents cite, does not address sample sales and resales in the United States. We have in the past excluded sales outside the ordinary course of trade only in the home and third-country markets for administrative reviews. In order for us to exclude sales, a firm must provide substantial evidence that such sales are outside the ordinary course of trade. (See Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts From France, et al. 57 FR 28360, 28395 (June 24, 1992).) Respondents in this case have not provided convincing evidence that third-country sample sales and resales were outside the ordinary course of trade. For the final results, we attempted, when possible, to match sample sales in the United States to sample sales in the third country, and resales in the United States to resales in the third country, within the constraints of our model-matching criteria.
