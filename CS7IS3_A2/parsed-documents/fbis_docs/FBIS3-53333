[passage omitted] In an interview with AL-HAYAH, the Afghan president has welcomed the mediation of the brothers in the Islamic states. However, he warned that his two rivals, Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and Uzbek militia leader Abdul Rashid Dostam, "have always broken the pledges and failed to abide by the agreements." This comes while the Iranian mediation between Rabbani and Hekmatyar has failed to achieve its aims. The Afghan prime minister informed the Iranian envoy Ibrahim Zaheryan of the opposition alliance's refusal to stop the fighting until the Afghan president submits his resignation. In a telephone interview conducted with him from Jeddah, President Rabbani told AL-HAYAH that the Hekmatyar-Dostam alliance is a "devil's alliance," and that "its aim is to seize power in Kabul over the bodies and corpses of the innocent." Pointing clearly to Hekmatyar and Dostam, he said that "the alliance between them was established secretly long ago, and when the time came to implement the conspiracy, they announced it." Rabbani added that "recent events have provoked the indignation of the Islamic world, especially as the aggressors have shelled mosques, houses of worships, and hospitals inside Kabul." Rabbani welcomed the mediation of the brothers in the Islamic states but stressed that Hekmatyar and Dostam "have persisted in breaking pledges and not abiding by agreements." [passage omitted]
