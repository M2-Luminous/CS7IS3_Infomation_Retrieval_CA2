Several indicators of the immigration of non-Europeans were in decline even before the Pasqua laws of 1993 took effect, according to the DPM's annual report. The report states that 135,372 foreign nationals became permanent residents of France in 1992 compared to 123,413 who did so in 1991 (up 10.9 percent). Of this number, approximately 100,000 were natives of countries outside the European Union (representing a decrease of 5 percent from the figure for 1992) while 35,000 were Europeans (representing a very sharp increase of 100 percent, for statistical reasons associated with the unrestricted movement of Spaniards and Portuguese). In similar fashion, the principal immigration flows--family reunifications (down 8.3 percent) and the granting of political refugee status (down 30 percent), both of which are subject to the provisions of the Pasqua laws--decreased sharply in 1992. Family reunifications--which peaked in 1990 with the arrival of approximately 37,000 women and children--dropped to 32,665 in 1992. The spectacular decline in the number of new refugees is explained by the fact that since 1990 the number of requests for asylum has decreased and the requests are being processed more rapidly. More foreign nationals, however, were acquiring the status of wage earner between 1991 and 1992, with 18,487 non-Europeans being admitted compared to 17,056 the previous year (up 8.4 percent, which rises to 65 percent if you count only Europeans). This development is explained largely by changed circumstances. In the case of the Spaniards and Portuguese, it resulted from the registration of individual cases not previously declared. The increase in the number of non-EC nationals, on the other hand, reflects the regularization of the status of applicants for asylum whose applications had previously been rejected. Less Rapid Increase in the Number of "Mixed" Marriages A complete analysis of the immigration flows should take account not only of the arrivals but also of the departures. The French statistical apparatus is deficient with respect to departures, because it records only the forced departures--expulsions, and escorted (or "assisted," i.e., subsidized) returns to the border--without providing the slightest indication of the numerous spontaneous departures. With respect to the forced departures--which the present interior minister has promised to double--the DPM report points out that the number of escorted returns actually carried out has remained stable (8,638 in 1991 compared to 9,160 in 1987). The program of "assisted" departures that was resumed in 1991 has been only minimally effective, inasmuch as it aided only 1,212 foreign nationals in 1992. The ultimate "way out" of foreign national status is the acquisition of French nationality. A total of 95,300 foreign nationals became French citizens in 1992 either by naturalization (39,346), by marriage or declaration of one's parents (32,249), or by informal acquisition of citizenship at age 18 (23,700) (the latter two methods were abolished by the Pasqua-Mehaignerie law of 22 July 1993). The DPM report confirms the increasing proportion of Africans--and especially of emigres from the Maghreb--among these new French citizens. It also confirms the increase in the number of "mixed" marriages, which accounted for approximately 12 percent of the total number of marriages contracted in France in 1991. This increase--which is one of the "thermometers" used to measure the integration of foreign populations--is, however, slowing down after two years of very strong growth. [Box, p 10] 1.
