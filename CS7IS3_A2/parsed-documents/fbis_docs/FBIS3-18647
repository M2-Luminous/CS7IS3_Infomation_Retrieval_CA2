The 17 February Lisbon weekly VISAO detailed the composition of the Armed Forces. According to the weekly, the Army has 21,648 men and women (447 women officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates in administrative positions). The ranks of officers and noncommissioned officers were thinned out in recent years: There were 10,911 in 1973, 7,728 in 1990, and 6,381 at the end of 1993, at which time volunteers represented 32 percent of the force (6,905 officers and noncommissioned officers), almost equal to the career force. The Navy's total strength is 11,210, including 151 women. Some 5,026 sailors are career and 1,088 are volunteers. The Air Forces' total strength is 7,754, of whom 1,752 are officers, 2,609 are noncommissioned officers, and 3,393 are airmen. There is one four-star general and 10 three-star generals, 804 captains, 362 lieutenants, 184 majors, 166 second lieutenants, 140 lieutenant colonels, 60 colonels, 16 brigadiers, and two cadets. The Air Force has the highest number of women volunteers, including a lieutenant colonel and five lieutenants. According to Cesar Camacho writing in the 24 February Lisbon daily PUBLICO, while the Independent Mechanized Brigade dedicated to NATO needs volunteers to maintain the necessary level of preparedness and operational capability, it does have the required number of officers and noncommissioned officers. Camacho notes that the lack of privates stems from the "drastic" reduction of compulsory military service to no more than four months, "sufficient for little else besides basic training." Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira is cited as believing that the offer of technical-professional training to new recruits will attract volunteers. He has therefore given his approval to the creation of a professional training center in the field of civil engineering, including disciplines such as civil construction design, stone masonry, carpentry, electricity, etc. Other, higher-level courses in accounting, civil construction, and technical management are already offered.
