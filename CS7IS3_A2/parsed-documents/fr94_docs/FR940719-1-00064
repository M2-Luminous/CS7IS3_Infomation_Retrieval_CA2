FR940719-1-00064 FR940719-1-00015 Regardless of whether the compressor is located in a noncombustible structure or area or operated while attended, existing paragraph (b)(1) requires that the compressor, if not ventilated with air coursed directly into a return air course or to the surface, be operated only while it can be seen by a person designated by the operator. The difference between proposed paragraph (a)(1), and the existing paragraph (b)(1) would be the distance the designated person could be from the compressor. Under proposed paragraph (a)(1) the designated person would be required to be close enough to activate the fire suppression system, to deenergize or shut off the compressor, and to see the compressor. Under paragraph (b)(1), the designated person need only be able to see the compressor. In response to comments, the Agency is proposing paragraph (b)(2), which provides additional flexibility for compressor installations while maintaining the same level of protection. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would add an alternative that would apply to compressors located immediately adjacent to a return air course where a substantial pressure differential exists. This alternative would not be appropriate for applications near working sections where low ventilation pressure differentials exist. Substantial pressure differentials are necessary to provide the air velocities required to prevent smoke rollback. Under proposed (b)(2), a compressor could be situated adjacent to a return air course, between two permanent ventilation controls through which an air split would be maintained from a small diameter opening in the intake-side control to a larger diameter opening in the return-side control. In lieu of the intake-side ventilation control, a door may be constructed in accordance with ยง75.333 (d)(1) and (d)(2). Section 75.333(d)(3), which requires doors to be constructed in pairs, would not apply in this case. The Agency intends that this door remain closed at all times while the compressor is operating. This door would provide easy access to the compressor. The Agency would continue the practice of accepting as doors the fire-resistant check curtains described by Steven J. Luzik in ``MSHA Develops New Fire-Resistant Check Curtains,'' Coal magazine, pages 102&hyph;104, June 1993. The ventilating air quantity must be adequate to provide the essential cooling of the compressor. The Agency expects operators to provide the air quantity necessary to assure that the maximum ambient operating temperature specified by the compressor's manufacturer is not exceeded. Similarly, any other ventilating or temperature parameters specified by the manufacturer would be considered in determining an adequate ventilating air quantity. In addition to an air quantity necessary to provide cooling, the air velocity through the intake-side opening would be required to be sufficient to prevent any air reversal or possible smoke rollback in the event of a compressor fire. In determining sufficient air velocities, the Agency has placed in the rulemaking record the 1977 MESA Informational Report, Ventilation to Control the Smoke From a Fireproof Structure, (IR 1054). That report concludes that smoke rollback should not occur if the centerline velocity through the intake-side opening (not to exceed 16 x 24 inches) is at least 1,100 feet per minute (fpm) and the discharge opening is not smaller than the intake opening with at least 10 feet between the ventilation controls. The report also indicates that the intake opening should be close to the floor and the discharge opening should be near the roof. The Agency solicits comments on whether the velocity and associated parameters outlined in IR 1054 are appropriate. The proposed paragraph (b)(2) alternative also requires sensors for heat or carbon monoxide or smoke to be installed between the two permanent ventilation controls. The sensors would be required to activate a visual and audible alarm located outside of the enclosure on the intake side when either condition specified in paragraph (b)(3) (i) or (ii) occurs. The visual alarm should be situated so that it can be seen by persons traveling in the intake entry immediately adjacent to the enclosure. Paragraph (e) of the proposal has been added in response to suggestions that compressors have an automatic shutdown feature that deenergizes or shuts off the compressor when the required fire suppression system is activated. The Agency recognizes that under ยง75.1107&hyph;4 automatic deenergization is required if the automatic fire suppression system is activated on unattended electrically powered compressors. However, paragraph (e) would clarify that automatic deenergization or shutdown is required for both attended and unattended electric and diesel powered compressors. This paragraph also would require the compressor to be automatically deenergized or shut off if one or more of the doors (required by paragraph (b)(3)) close. Historically, fires on compressors that continue to operate have resulted in oil being released, which has contributed to the severity of the fire. For this reason, the Agency believes that safety is best served by requiring compressors to be automatically deenergized or shut off when the fire suppression system is activated. It was suggested that the cutoff for application of ยง75.344 be changed from 5 horsepower for all compressors to 30 horsepower for reciprocating compressors and 5 horsepower for all other types of compressors. The rationale presented for this suggestion is that reciprocating compressors of up to 30 horsepower contain about the same amount of lubricating oil as a 5 horsepower oil-flooded rotary compressor. This suggestion is not adopted in the proposal because the Agency has information (Report No. 06&hyph;292&hyph;87 of the Industrial Safety Division, Pittsburgh Safety and Health Technology Center) that the predominant hazard for fire or explosion in reciprocating compressors is not the lubricating oil but rather the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the discharge system. A review of accident reports indicated that nine mine fires started in compressors between 1970 and 1992. Two of these nine fires occurred in compressors of the type subject to a buildup of carbonaceous deposits. Although it is not known that this buildup was the cause of these fires and the compressors involved were larger than 30 HP, these fires are of concern to the Agency. The Agency solicits additional comments on the safety considerations associated with reciprocating compressors.
