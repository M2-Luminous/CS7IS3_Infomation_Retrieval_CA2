FR940610-0-00006 FR940610-0-00004 This action clarifies the existing rule and does not place any new restriction or requirements on the public. Furthermore, the FAA finds that this amendment does not involve a change in the dimensions or operating requirements of the airspace listings incorporated by reference in part 71. These errors are insignificant in nature and impact and inconsequential to the industry and public. Therefore, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Additionally, in consideration of the immediate need to advise pilots of the corrections to the classification and description of certain airspace areas, the FAA finds good cause, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days in order to promote the safe operation of aircraft in this area.
