'Arafat rejected any attempt to categorize or divide the prisoners and insisted that all of them be treated equally. 'Arafat emphasized the need to close ranks and achieve national unity. He called on everyone to behave as one man and one heart, to think with responsibility, and to confront the immense challenges we are facing with all methods available. This, at a time when the Palestinians are knocking on the doors of independence and freedom under the PLO's leadership and the international community is looking forward to seeing the embodiment of Palestinian rights in a way that would end the suffering of our people and nation and provide them with the opportunity to build the life for which they have always dreamed. 'Arafat said that the Palestinian people have the right to live in security, dignity, stability, and prosperity. 'Arafat criticized the foot-dragging and procrastination inherent in Israeli policy on implementing the Palestinian-Israeli accord signed on 13 September in Washington. He described this policy as a rejected blackmail attempt that will only lead to wasting more time and deprive the peace process of credibility. 'Arafat held the Israeli Government responsible for this delay and the ensuing continuation of the cycle of violence in the occupied territories. He expressed the hope that Israel will stop procrastinating and will respond to realities and the requirements of the era on the dissemination of the climate of peace and stability among states and peoples. This requires that every people be guaranteed the right to self-determination and the establishment of its independent political entity over the soil of its homeland in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations and the resolutions of its institutions issued in this regard. In this context, 'Arafat stressed the PLO's adherence to the Palestinian people's legitimate rights and said: The day of return is near and the attainment of our people's dream is not impossible but possible. We must achieve that dream regardless of how difficult the march may be and irrespective of the obstacles it faces.
