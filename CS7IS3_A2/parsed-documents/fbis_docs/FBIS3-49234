Surprised, not to use a stronger word, by this assessment, we approached Mr. Alexandru Radocea, president of the National Statistics Commission, asking him to comment on the article published by the aforementioned daily and to review, in general terms, the year that has almost come to an end. I accept your invitation with pleasure, he said, especially since, now that the Cassandras have multiplied, DIMINEATA is among the few newspapers trying to inform its readers correctly by abiding by the truth, which is not all that black as some people, who are interested in an end-of-the-world atmosphere, describe it. [Pavelescu] Mr. Radocea, what is the situation of our economy? Is the economy the beginning and the end of everything? [Radocea] It would be premature to talk about abundance in our country. Certainly, however, the main commitment assumed by the Vacaroiu government when it was invested -- namely to halt the decline of the production -- has been fulfilled. Here are figures to prove this. Throughout the 11 months that have elapsed in 1993, industrial production increased 0.4 percent, in comparable prices, compared with the same period last year. In agriculture, despite the unfavorable conditions that affected four counties in the southern part of our country -- one of our bread baskets -- where not a drop of rain fell for months on end, this recovery process can be clearly noted because the volume of grain production is 11 percent higher than in 1992, and the animal breeding sector also shows signs of recovery. [Pavelescu] Mr. Radocea, which industrial branches have made the balance tip toward a positive direction? [Radocea] These are the weighty and prevalently modern branches. They include such branches as chemistry, certain machine- building and mining branches, and the furniture industry. As a conclusion that exceeds the competence of the statistician but which should not be omitted, we have to mention that the new economic mechanism has begun to function and that branches and units recording positive results do so because of the judicious blend between mature personnel and the dynamism of young specialists. [Pavelescu] There still are, however, areas in which stagnation persists and in which things do not develop with the necessary vigor.... [Radocea] That is correct. Metallurgy, the garment industry, and the food industry, as well as the tobacco processing industry, are not moving at all. There would be explanations, but this is not the right time to dwell on them. [Pavelescu] For this reason, for the time being, we have a trade balance deficit in the sense that we import more than we export. [Radocea] This is a fact that we cannot ignore. But even in this respect, one can note signs of recovery, albeit modest ones. [Pavelescu] What is the employment situation of our labor force? [Radocea] Unemployment continues to grow. The current unemployment rate is approximately 9.9 percent of the active labor force. A comparison with the countries surrounding us or with more distant ones could render false projections. We have a smaller number of unemployed than Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and even France. But can anyone be at peace when more than a million people have no jobs? [Pavelescu] In this context, would it seem ill-timed to ask you about the standard of living? [Radocea] Not in the least. The incomes of the population have considerably increased. And conditions exist that in December they may be even higher. [Pavelescu] A key question: How will 1994 start off? [Radocea] I am convinced that conditions are in place for next year to mark the much-awaited relaunching of the economy. The economic mechanism based on market laws has been broken in and has been perfected. Numerous branches, including metallurgy, have come up with promising anticrisis programs. The contracts that have been concluded, including exports, seem to be encouraging. Agriculture will unmistakably progress. In the area of utilizing the labor force, the indicators will improve along with the relaunching of the construction activity in the spring. I believe that we have embarked on the right road. And since from the very beginning I talked to you about my friendly feelings toward the paper for which you work, permit me to conclude in the same vein by using this opportunity to convey wishes for good health and work energy to the editorial team, and best wishes for your readers in 1994, together with the traditional Romanian wish of "Many Happy Returns!"
