FR941025-1-00048 FR941025-1-00013 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In 1983, a 20-agency task force explored streamlining grants management and reviewed OMB Circular A&hyph;102, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants to State and Local Governments.'' As part of that effort, on June 18, 1984, OMB published a Notice in the Federal Register (49 FR 24958&hyph;24959) seeking comments on over 50 issues and possible options for each. OMB and the agencies then drafted a governmentwide ``common rule.'' The proposed common rule contained fiscal and administrative requirements for grants and cooperative agreements to State and local governments (grantees) and subrecipients which are State and local governments (subgrantees). At the same time, OMB and the agencies prepared a revised OMB Circular A&hyph;102_directed solely to Federal agencies_containing guidance to Federal agencies on how they should manage the award and administration of Federal grants. On March 12, 1987, the President directed all affected agencies to simultaneously propose and subsequently adopt a common rule verbatim, except where inconsistent with specific statutory requirements. Twenty-three agencies proposed a governmentwide grants management common rule in the June 9, 1987 Federal Register (52 FR 21820&hyph;21862). On March 11, 1988, OMB published the final revised Circular A&hyph;102, dated March 3, 1988, in the Federal Register (53 FR 8028&hyph;8032). On the same date, 24 Federal agencies published the final governmentwide common rule in the Federal Register (53 FR 8034&hyph;8103). The Circular became effective immediately while the common rule did not become effective until October 1, 1988. On June 30, 1992, the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution closed and thus will not be joining this proposed rulemaking. On November 24, 1992 and August 16, 1993, two more agencies co-signed the governmentwide common rule (at 57 FR 55092 and 58 FR 43270). On April 4, 1994, the functions of ACTION were transferred to the Corporation for National and Community Service. On November 4, 1988, OMB published a proposal in the Federal Register (53 FR 44710&hyph;44714) to replace OMB Circulars A&hyph;102 and A&hyph;110 with a circular that would provide OMB guidance to Federal agencies on how they should manage the award and administration of Federal grants to both governmental and non-governmental organizations. In addition, the Federal agencies simultaneously issued a proposed rule in the Federal Register (53 FR 44716&hyph;44812) to amend the March 11, 1988, common rule to establish fiscal and administrative requirements on non-governmental grantees as well. However, based on comments received, on October 29, 1990, in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations, OMB stated that it ``no longer plans to merge these circulars'' (55 FR 45289&hyph;45290). In September 1993, in Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less, the National Performance Review (NPR) made a recommendation to ``Simplify administration by modifying the common grant rules on small purchases'' (FSL05). Specifically, NPR recommended an increase in the dollar threshold for small purchases (simplified acquisition threshold) by local governments from $25,000 to $100,000. NPR also made a companion recommendation in the area of reinventing Federal procurement to ``Establish new simplified acquisition threshold and procedures'' (PROC04). This recommendation sought legislation to simplify small purchases by raising the threshold for the use of simplified acquisition procedures from $25,000 to $100,000. In a February 1994 accompanying report of the NPR entitled Creating a Government that Works Better & Costs Less_Strengthening the Partnership in Intergovernmental Service Delivery, NPR elaborated on recommendation FSL05. NPR stated, ``Local governments have found the $25,000 limit to be overly restrictive, especially for the purchase of small vehicles that often exceed this amount. For example, to procure one small van with federal funds to satisfy Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, grantees must formally advertise and solicit sealed public bids. This requirement delays the procurement process and prevents grantees from acquiring rolling stock quickly'' (page 21). Therefore, we are proposing to amend the grants management common rule accordingly.
