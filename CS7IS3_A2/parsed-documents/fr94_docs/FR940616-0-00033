List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 214 Bridges, Incorporation by reference, Occupational safety and health, Personal protective equipment, Railroad operating practices, Railroad safety, Scaffolding. The Final Rule In consideration of the foregoing, Part 214, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: 1. The authority for this part continues to read as follows: Authority: 45 U.S.C. 431, 438, as amended; 49 CFR 1.49(m). 2. By amending §214.103 to revise paragraphs (b) and (c) to read as follows: §214.103 Fall protection, generally. * * * * * (b)(1) This section shall not apply if the installation of the fall arrest system poses a greater exposure to risk than the work to be performed. In any action brought by FRA to enforce the fall protection requirements, the railroad or railroad contractor shall have the burden of proving that the installation of such device poses greater exposure to risk than performance of the work itself. (2) This section shall not apply to employees engaged in inspection of railroad bridges conducted in full compliance with the following conditions: (i) the railroad or railroad contractor has a written program in place that requires training in, adherence to, and use of safe procedures associated with climbing techniques and procedures to be used; (ii) the employee to whom this exception applies has been trained and qualified according to that program to perform bridge inspections, has been previously and voluntarily designated to perform inspections under the provisions of that program, and has accepted the designation; (iii) the employee to whom this exception applies is familiar with the appropriate climbing techniques associated with all bridge structures the employee is responsible for inspecting; (iv) the employee to whom this exception applies is engaged solely in moving on or about the bridge or observing, measuring, and recording the dimensions and condition of the bridge and its components; and (v) the employee to whom this exception applies is provided all equipment necessary to meet the needs of safety, including any specialized or alternative systems required. (c) This section shall not apply where employees are working on a railroad bridge equipped with walkways and railings of sufficient height, width, and strength to prevent a fall, provided that the employee does not work beyond the railings, over the side of the bridge, on ladders or other elevation devices, or where gaps or holes exist through which a body could fall. Where used in place of fall protection as provided for in §214.105, this paragraph (c) is satisfied by: (1) Walkways and railings meeting the standards set forth in the American Railway Engineering Association's Manual for Railway Engineering; and (2) Roadways attached to railroad bridges, provided that employees on the roadway deck work or move at a distance of six feet or more from the edge of the roadway deck, or from an opening through which a person could fall. * * * * * 3. By revising §214.111 to read as follows: §214.111 Personal protective equipment, generally. With the exception of foot protection, the railroad or railroad contractor shall provide and the employee shall use all appropriate personal protective equipment described in this subpart in all operations where there is exposure to hazardous conditions, or where this subpart indicates the need for using such equipment to reduce hazards to railroad employees. The railroad or railroad contractor shall require the use of foot protection when the potential for foot injury exists.
