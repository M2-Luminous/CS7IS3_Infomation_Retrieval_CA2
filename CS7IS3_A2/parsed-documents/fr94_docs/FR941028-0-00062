FR941028-0-00062 FR941028-0-00009 Further, neither of the provisions of proposed sections are redundant with 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) do not delineate the means by which a regulatory authority may comply with the mandates of section 510(c) of the Act or 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Proposed §§773.22 and 773.23 fill this need. These proposed sections provide the specific steps to be taken by a regulatory authority to achieve compliance with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). One industry commenter suggested that all of these provisions should be consolidated into a single violations review provision. While this is a reasonable alternative, OSM is convinced that the approach contained in the proposed rules is a better alternative. The placement of the required tasks in separate sections of the regulations, with appropriate cross references, better highlights the particular duties necessary at each stage of the permit application review process in a way which is more likely to support compliance. Also, as the above discussion demonstrates, the tasks are sufficiently separable that they lend themselves to separate regulatory sections. Such separation, however, does not mean that there must be unnecessary delays. A regulatory authority can move forward methodically through each required task in a timely manner. A commenter representing State regulatory authorities criticized the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of proposed §773.23 because such provision would prohibit the issuance of a permit if there are outstanding violations. He asserted that these provisions would significantly increase the burden on applicants, because the provisions did not incorporate the presumption that an NOV is considered abated unless an FTACO has been issued. In this preamble, OSM has already addressed the matter of the presumption of NOV abatement within the discussion of the amendments to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which have been adopted today. As indicated, OSM has determined to retain a presumption of NOV abatement where the abatement period for the NOV has not expired and the applicant has provided certification that the violation is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. Since the provisions of proposed §773.23 incorporate the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1), such presumption would be similarly applied as part of proposed §773.23. Thus, the substance of commenter's concern has been addressed. Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups urged that paragraph (a) of proposed §773.23 be clarified with respect to the regulatory authority's duty to review the accuracy of ownership or control information. They pointed out that there are many additional sources of ownership or control information beyond those listed in the regulation which a regulatory authority could review. They asserted that the regulatory authority should be required to review the sources listed in the regulation, the AVS and the regulatory authority's own records, at a minimum. OSM agrees that there are many potential sources of ownership or control information and that the sources for review listed in the proposed regulation are those which the regulatory authority should be required to review, at a minimum. OSM disagrees, however, that the proposed regulation needs to be further clarified or modified. There is already language in the proposed regulation which meets the substance of commenters' concerns. In paragraph (a) of proposed §773.23, the regulatory authority is required to ``review all reasonably available information concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant *␣*␣*.'' (Emphasis added.) In addition, the language makes clear that ``[s]uch information shall include'' the listed items which follow in paragraphs (a)(1&hyph;2) of the proposed regulation. The clear meaning of this proposed language is that the listed examples are those sources which the regulatory authority must review. In addition, the regulatory authority can choose to review other sources.
