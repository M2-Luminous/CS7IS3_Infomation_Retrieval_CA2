Taran; place and date not given: "Yevgeniy Bogachev: `Emergency Measures Are Needed'"] [Text] [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, at the recent conference held by the president, in the press, and at the latest session of the republic Supreme Soviet the issue of nonpayments has been raised many times. It is assumed that this problem will receive priority attention in the anticrisis program currently being drafted by the government. It is obvious that the nonpayments crisis is a Russia-wide phenomenon. Still, can this problem be resolved at least partially at republic level? How can the National Bank of Tatarstan help? [Bogachev] At the National Bank's initiative, the republic government adopted a decree and prepared on its basis a statute on mutual clearing between producers, processors of agricultural products, and trade organizations. You understand that the nonpayments problem cannot be solved in one strike, overnight; therefore, on an experimental basis we intend to untangle this knot first in the sectors that supply the population with foodstuffs--bread, milk, meat, confectionery items, etc.--and trade. For these enterprises and organizations we introduced the so-called file No. 2. We established a payments schedule for them. First they settle accounts with the budget (pay taxes into it), then the pension fund, and then with producers and processors of agricultural products. [Taran] That is, the file means that if the enterprise received money into its account in the bank, it is... [Bogachev] ...transferred to pay taxes to the budget, to the pension fund, and then--to pay for agricultural products delivered to them. If there is not much money, not much will be paid. But it will get paid instead of the money just sitting there! How were things before this decree? For instance, a rayon food trade administration receives money from stores, pays taxes to the budget, pays into dozens of various funds, pays out wages, and disposes of the rest of the money at its discretion. If it wishes, it uses it to buy imported candy or sausage, or, if it wishes, it will pay the Zarya factory or the meat combine... Now if a trade administration or food processing enterprise attempts to violate the procedures set by the decree, the banks will not allow it to do so. They will withdraw money from the account and send it where it is supposed to go. Otherwise we will not be able to get the money to the countryside--it will constantly be diverted along interim stages of the chain. [Taran] If the chain links kolkhozes and sovkhozes with the trade sector and, in the final analysis, with the republic population, and is located inside Tatarstan, then you can probably attempt to untangle the knots using both the command methods envisaged in the decree and economic levers. What about enterprises whose suppliers and consumers are in Russia and other CIS countries? Or how do you settle financial relations between the AO [joint-stock company] Tatneft and Nizhnekamskneftekhim? [Bogachev] Speaking of Nizhnekamskneftekhim, it is actually owed a lot of money by many CIS enterprises, while inside the republic it owes money to many suppliers. Some chains, wherever possible, we cut short by a bill of exchange or so-called barter applied to debt. For instance, the Nizhegorodskiy oil refinery pays the AO Tatneft for oil with gasoline; this gasoline goes to the Tatneftprodukty association, and we count it as payment by the oil producers' to the budget. By the way, the National Bank already has set up a commission that will look more closely at these chains of nonpayments and, if possible, shortcut them, apply mutual clearing, even extending to Russian enterprises and CIS countries. I can even give you an example of how we untangled such a chain. A Chisinau tractor plant owed money to the Nizhnekamskneftekhim association for products shipped. We came to an agreement that Moldova would deliver spare parts for tractors to Tatselkhoztekhnika, and we would count this as Nizhnekamsk producer payments into the budget. Most often, however, credits are needed in order to accomplish mutual clearing. We will be allocating resources to the extent possible, especially if insignificant amounts are needed, in order to complete mutual clearing. Not everyone agrees to such mutual clearing, however. For instance, the Novomoskovsk plant, which produces gasoline, owes a substantial amount of money to Tatneft, but is in no hurry to pay with fuel, and in this situation offers gasoline at a price hiked up by 15-20 percent if we want it faster. See what is happening in the economy! We can demand sanctions, file a claim with the arbitration court, of course. But how much time this will take!... Meanwhile, Muscovites advise us: Do not ship the oil. But you cannot just stop the wells. [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, I understand that enterprises must, of course, settle accounts with the budget and agricultural producers. But there also is another line item on which calm and stability in the republic depend. I mean paying wages--and paying them on time. At many enterprises people have not been paid for three to four months. I do not know whether there is any truth to the rumor that 50 percent of the money received will be reserved specifically for paying wages. [Bogachev] I cannot either confirm or deny this information. At the recent meeting held by the president I submitted a proposal for the anticrisis program: to let enterprises keep at minimum 5 percent of the money received for their immediate needs. [Taran] Is this an emergency reserve? [Bogachev] Yes, and no one--not the budget, not the funds, not the banks--can touch this money. It happens sometimes that an enterprise cannot send people on vacation, provide financial assistance, and so on. This proposal was supported, and in one document there is even the figure of 30 percent. But if this passes, it will hit the budget hard. [Taran] But you have to pay people, too. They have to live on something... [Bogachev] Yes, there are enterprises in the republic where wages have not yet been paid for February, and in some kolkhozes and sovkhozes--for January. But overall as of 1 May the back pay owed amounted to 160 billion rubles [R]. This is one month's worth of back pay. In certain sectors, however--agriculture, the defense industry, light industry, the budget sphere--the arrears are substantial. Measures are being taken, however, to pay off these arrears at least through April. It looks as if we will be issuing credits in order to get out of this situation. [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, will we find credit resources? [Bogachev] I will give you these figures. As of 1 January our credit resources amounted to R600 billion; as of 1 May--already R900 billion. I know the interest rate is very high, and it is hard for enterprises to carry the debt, but what can we do? Just recently our bank charged 210 percent interest, then 205 percent, then 200 percent. At the latest auction we acquired centralized resources at 190 percent. Of course, commercial banks charge a higher interest rate. We have to keep in mind, however, that we issue credit to agriculture on average at 20 percent, and to some farms--at 10 percent. For instance, the bread products association received most of its credit at 10 percent. But even this money is difficult to get back. The enterprise ships flour and cereal, but the money does not come back, it gets stuck somewhere. Consumers do not pay. [Taran] How do you explain the lowering of the Central Bank's interest rate? [Bogachev] I want to remind you of the statements of Central Bank of Russia Chairman Gerashchenko that by the end of this year the interest rate will be 100 percent. But in my opinion even this is too much. If interest rates were no higher than 20-30 percent, prices would go down, too. The lowering of interest rates is a result of the decline in the inflation rate. In my opinion, there is no particular reason to rejoice. We have achieved it at the cost of reducing consumer demand--people do not have any money, they are not paid wages. This is the way to entirely ruin industry, which will stop producing any output. [Taran] We were talking mostly about noncash clearing. But there also are quite a few problems with cash, are there not? [Bogachev] The National Bank has now put into circulation about R600 billion in cash. Republic banks have only R21 billion. Where is the rest of the money? I do not think it is in the hands of the population, because people are not being paid wages. It is possible that it is circulating hand-to-hand, bypassing the budget and other taxes. This is my first guess. The second is that the money is at enterprises. I do not know of a single instance of any manager being penalized for using cash in lieu of noncash transactions. When the money goes through the bank, taxes are withheld, along with other deductions. Quite often, however, enterprises get cash through their own trade network and immediately use it to purchase goods, pay wages, etc. I am against repressive measures. The National Bank of Tatarstan is proposing other ways. We need to make it possible to buy in the market shares of profitable, prestigious enterprises and banks, without restrictions, for money. Right now, however, many banks are privately-held joint-stock companies. But if enterprises have the money (the R600 billion is sitting around somewhere unused, after all!), why not buy shares if good dividends are paid on them? We need to speed up the creation of a securities market. Then this money will surface. The situation today is such that we simply do not have time to spend months developing programs and laws, and then more months adopting and amending them. We need to give our president the powers to resolve some matters through decrees. We need urgent measures to save our economy, first and foremost industry. This is where the budget revenue is formed. To a certain degree I am beginning to support those politicians and economists who maintain that the road to the market should go through dictatorship. Chaos is not going to get us anywhere.
