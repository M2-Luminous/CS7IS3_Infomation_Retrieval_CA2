More than 800 people jammed the Paarl East community hall to hear Mr Manuel and constitutional expert Dullah Omar. "We have done all the sums," Mr Manuel said in response to National Party [NP] criticism that the ANC was offering the impossible. "We must tell the NP we can pay for it with existing resources." Explaining the ANC's arithmetic, he said working people paid extremely high taxes with married women in effect being punished for having left their kitchens to earn salaries. "We are going to turn it all around. We are going to look to companies which are so lightly taxed and strengthen our base from there..." Furthermore there were the imbalances in the budget itself. "Defence is getting more then six times the money allocated to housing. There's definitely something wrong there. The secret special defence fund alone is R3.83 billion [rand]-- what are they doing with it? Printing election posters for the NP? Such funds cannot only create housing but jobs. It will have to change after April 27." Mr Manuel said insurance companies would be told South Africa had enough office blocks and super shopping malls. Factories were needed where the people could work and money needed to be channelled into the townships. "Do it, or we will pass laws to help you do it," he said. International agencies were begging to lend the country money "but we're saying to them wait a bit, not yet". Mr Dullah Omar said the ANC had demanded from President F. W. de Klerk and Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha the restoration of citizenship to the people of the TVBC [Transkei - Bophuthatswana - Venda - Ciskei] states and the re-incorporation of the homelands at the start of negotiations more than two years ago. "They refused. The fact that they propped up the regime of (former Bophuthatswana president) Lucas Mangope for so long has cost us dearly. He could have been out of the way a long time ago."
