The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] says there should be an amendment in the electoral law and a change in the composition of the National Electoral Council. It wants a more active role by the United Nations and UNITA in this organ. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, UNITA information secretary and chief negotiator, says on the issue: [Begin Valentim recording] The UNITA delegation has prepared and delivered to the UN representative a document containing its views on the conclusion of the electoral process, which are an innovation in that they give the United Nations the right to help the electoral commission prepare for the election. There is also the need to alter the electoral law concerning the counting of votes at the polling booths, and to ensure significant UNITA participation in all the electoral process. When we talk of elections, we are assuming there will be peace in Angola. Afterward, can the elections be held. [end recording] Paradoxically in Angola, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party has intensified its air raids against civilian targets. [Begin Valentim recording] However, while we are preparing peace in Lusaka, very alarming reports from Huambo say that yesterday as of 1000 [0900 GMT] there were massive air raids against the city of Huambo, in which dozens of people died and a number of houses were completely destroyed. The government aircraft dropped every kind of bomb on Huambo residents. We believe that this intensification of war in Angola does not meet the wishes of the Angolan people or the expectations of the international community. The UNITA delegation once more reiterates that it is willing to continue with the talks. It will remain in Lusaka, but it appeals to the international community, the UN Security Council, and observer countries to firmly condemn this intensification of war and the government's air raids.
