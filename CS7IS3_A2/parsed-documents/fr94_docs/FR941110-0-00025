FR941110-0-00025 FR941110-0-00013 With the passage of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), responsibilities for hazardous waste permitting in North Carolina were split between EPA and the State. Upon receiving interim authorization for HSWA corrective action, North Carolina assumed responsibility for HSWA corrective action for new permits. EPA continued to administer and enforce federal permits issued prior to the interim authorization. Upon final authorization of the State program for those provisions specified above, EPA will suspend issuance of federal permits in those areas for which the State is receiving authorization. Additionally, EPA will terminate, pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d), federal permits or portions of permits containing those provisions specified above and issued prior to the effective date of this authorization. A discussion of how North Carolina and EPA will delineate permitting responsibilities is contained in the EPA-North Carolina Memorandum of Agreement. North Carolina is not authorized to operate the federal program on Indian lands. This authority remains with EPA unless provided otherwise in a future statute or regulation. C. Decision I conclude that North Carolina's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Carolina is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. North Carolina now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of HSWA, the Memorandum of Agreement, and this notice. North Carolina also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under Section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under Sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Carolina's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
