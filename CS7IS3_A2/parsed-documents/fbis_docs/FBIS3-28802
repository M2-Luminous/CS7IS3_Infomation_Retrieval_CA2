However, Hosokawa offered no clues as to how he will break the impasse. He reiterated that Japan cannot accept a U.S. proposal to set numerical targets to gauge the openness of its markets to imports, but said he will strive to reach an accord on bilateral trade, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. He said the premier told a cabinet meeting that the trade negotiations are a key to further promoting friendly and constructive ties between Japan and the U.S. Hosokawa will fly to Washington later Thursday and hold a summit with Clinton on Friday to assess progress in the economic negotiations being held under a bilateral trade framework accord concluded last July. It will be Hosokawa's third meeting with Clinton since he took office last August. They first met in New York in September and again in Seattle in November. In his afternoon news conference, Takemura reiterated that Tokyo cannot accept the U.S. demand on numerical targets, saying, "I don't think we will depart from that principle." On Hata's arrival in Washington, Takemura said the foreign minister will do everything he can in a last-ditch effort to break the gridlock in the bilateral trade talks before the Hosokawa- Clinton summit. Asked about International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai's remark suggesting the possibility of a partial agreement in the negotiations, the chief government spokesman said Tokyo is still trying to reach a comprehensive accord with Washington. Japan and the U.S. have been negotiating on three priority trade areas -- government procurement of goods and services, auto and auto parts trade, and insurance. They remain at odds over the U.S. demand that "objective criteria" be set to measure how open Japanese markets are to imports.
