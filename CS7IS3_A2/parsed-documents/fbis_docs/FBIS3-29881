Korea's exports to China grew by a whopping 165 percent in 1992 and again by 90 percent in 1993. Bilateral trade between the two countries is expected to grow by an annual average rate of 33.2 percent between 1993 and 1997 and by 18.9 percent for the 1998- 2001 period. China has also become the most preferred country for direct investments among Korean firms. Last year, the government authorized 616 applications for investment in China, the largest number for a single target country. The aggregate amount of Korean investments in China, however, is still small because direct investment by Korean firms began to surge only from 1992. As of the end of 1993, the aggregate amount of investment authorized by the government is still less than $1 billion. Of this, $465 million had actually been invested by the end of last year. China, however, is considered to be more than a simple trading partner; it is regarded as a crucial partner for industrial cooperation as well. During President Kim's visit, the foundation will be laid for strategic industrial alliance between the two countries. The government will seek, among other things, an industrial cooperation agreement with China. Based on the framework to be provided by the agreement, the soon-to-be-formed Korea-China Joint Committee for Industrial Cooperation will systematically promote the industrial alliance. To finance the committee's activities, the Seoul government will soon inaugurate a fund, hopefully together with China, of some $6 million. In the inaugural meeting in Beijing, the committee will hammer out the principles and types of cooperation, select the primary areas of cooperation and discuss other avenues of cooperation. For Korea, the main fields of cooperation include aircraft, autos, digital telephone exchanges and nuclear power plants, while China is interested in cooperation in high-definition TV (HDTV), facsimile and large-screen color TVs. In case of aircraft, Korea wants to jointly develop, produce and sell a commuter aircraft of up to 100 seats. Korea has already announced an aircraft development plan and China is expected to be invited to participate in this plan. In the automobile sector, Korea has been asking China to allow imports of finished Korean autos and will encourage Korean parts producers to invest in China. The Seoul government has also been eager to participate in China's telephone network modernization programs with Korean- developed digital telephone exchanges. Cooperation in developing a next-generation telephone exchanges is also on the agenda. The nuclear power sector is another promising avenue of cooperation as China will construct new nuclear power plants. The Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) has signed an agreement to provide operational and management service to the nuclear power plant in Guangdong Province. Korea may be able to supply power generation equipment and participate in plant construction. Korea also plans to help China accumulate technology in such fields of interest as HDTV [high definition television], facsimile and large-size color TVs. Industrial cooperation also involves joint sponsorship of the so- called technology mart and exchange of engineers to facilitate technological exchange in specific sectors and to help individual firms to address firm-specific needs. To expand trade further and stimulate direct investment, the Seoul government will also implement a set of new measures. First, it intends to increase the provision of loans by the Export-Import Bank of Korea for deferred payment exports of Korean industrial facilities to be used for economic development in China. According to an official of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), the bank is currently evaluating nine applications for loans amounting to $1.2 billion. Among them is an application for loans to finance $250 million exports of rolling stocks to the Guangdong Province of China. The Ex-Im Bank's loans carry 7-8 percent annual interest rates, not so low compared with ordinary bank interest rates of around 12 percent. To alleviate the burden of interest rates on Korean exporters to China, the government plans to provide them with the Economic Development Cooperation Funds (EDCF) whose interest rates are 2-2.5 percent a year. The government will expand the coverage of export insurance for plant exports to China, while at the same time holding exhibitions of Korean goods in major cities in China every year. Within first half of this year, the MOTIE will also come up with a plan to encourage Korean distributors to advance into China and build up their own distribution networks. Up till now, according to a MOTIE official, Korean exports to China have largely been materials for reexports; Korean goods have not yet penetrated into the domestic consumption market of China. Partly, this was the result of the discriminatory tariff rates against Korean goods which were abolished only in 1992. Now that Korean goods can compete with foreign products on an equal footing, Korean exporters are in need of well-functioning distribution networks just as their Japanese and Hong Kong rivals do. This year, the Seoul government will be more prudent in invoking antidumping and adjustment tariffs against imports from China to head off unnecessary trade disputes. To stimulate direct investment in China, MOTIE will select industrial sectors suitable for production plant transfer to China and will provide administrative and financial assistance to those who actually relocate plants. Candidate sectors for this encouragement measure include footwear and textiles. Korean investments in China tend to cluster in such northeastern parts as Shantung and Liaoning Provinces and Tianjin City near Beijing. According to MOTIE officials, investments need to be more diversified geographically as each of the 10 major regions of China has its own development plan. MOTIE has requested the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Technology to draw up a detailed investment plan tailored to the development programs of the 10 regions. The ministry has also told the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) to set up trade centers in Dalian and Chonqing this year. Currently, KOTRA operates trade centers in Beijing and Shanghai. Korean banks will be encouraged to expand their branch networks in China and a Korea-China joint venture lease firm will be promoted to provide Korean firms in China with an easier access to capital. According to a MOTIE official, the Daewoo and Halla Business Groups have expressed interest in setting up the envisioned lease firm. All these measures are expected to help economic ties between Seoul and Beijing evolve into a new dimension. The two economies are, according to experts, basically complementary in nature, although in some sectors, they do compete. In approaching each other, the two countries may as well try to expand and capitalize on complementarity.
