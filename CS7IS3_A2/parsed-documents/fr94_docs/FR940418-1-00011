FR940418-1-00011 FR940418-1-00004 PANAMA CANAL COMMISSION 35 CFR Parts 133 and 135 RIN 3207&hyph;AA23 Tolls for Use of Canal and Rules for Measurement of Vessels AGENCY: Panama Canal Commission. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; request for comments; notice of hearing. SUMMARY: The Panama Canal Commission proposes a major revision of the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal to become effective October 1, 1994. The existing rules of measurement will be replaced with a simplified, objective approach which brings the Commission's system in line with an international practice which will enter into full application worldwide on July 18, 1994. The proposed rules apply a mathematical formula to the vessel's total volume to produce the basis for assessing tolls. The tonnage values computed under the proposed system are comparable to those calculated under the Commission's existing rules and, in the aggregate, are equal to existing tonnages; accordingly, no changes are proposed to the rates of toll for use of the Canal; however, certain administrative changes to the regulations dealing with Canal tolls are necessary to ensure their consistency with the revised rules of measurement. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking announces the availability from the Commission of an analysis showing the basis of and justification for the proposed changes, solicits written data and comments from interested parties, and sets the time and place for a public hearing. DATES: Written comments and requests to present oral testimony must be received on or before May 19, 1994; a public hearing will be held on May 25, 1994 at 9:30 a.m. ADDRESSES: Comments and requests to testify at the hearing may be mailed to: Michael Rhode, Jr., Secretary, Panama Canal Commission, 1825 I Street NW., suite 1050, Washington, DC 20006&hyph;5402, (Telephone: (202) 634&hyph;6441) (Facsimile: (202) 634&hyph;6439); copies of the Commission's analysis showing the basis of and justification for the proposed changes are available from the Commission (at the above address) or from the Office of Financial Management, Panama Canal Commission, Balboa Heights, Republic of Panama (Telephone: 011&hyph;507&hyph;52- 3194) (Facsimile: 011&hyph;507&hyph;52&hyph;3040). The hearing will be held in the ANA Hotel, 2401 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20037. Oral presentations should be limited to 20 minutes. Regulations governing the content of the notice of appearance or intention to present supplementary data at the hearing appear in 35 CFR 70.8 and 70.10. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Rhode, Jr. at the above address and telephone. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A complete revision to the Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal contained in 35 CFR part 135 is proposed. The proposed revision is designed to simplify the Commission's measurement procedures which since the Canal's inception have been based on the Moorsom system. The change is designed to bring measurement rules at the Canal in line with the worldwide standard of tonnage measurement and achieve compatibility with the 1969 International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships (Convention). The Convention, which establishes a universal system of measurement for vessels engaged on an international voyage, came into effect in the United States on February 10, 1983. This new 35 CFR part 135 would provide for: a. Establishment of measurement rules for the Panama Canal Commission which are based on Annex 1 of the Convention; b. Transitional relief measures for certain vessels, provided they do not have a structural change which results in an alteration of 10 percent or more in their total volume; c. Continued use of foreign tonnage authorities, and for acceptance of reasonably accurate volumes provided by them; d. Correction of tonnage values as necessary to satisfy the Commission's desire for accuracy; and
