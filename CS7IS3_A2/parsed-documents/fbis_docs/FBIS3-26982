China's National General Institute of Animal and Plant Quarantine has recently agreed to the apple imports, provided they meet a number of conditions. It has signed an agreement with its counterpart in the United States on the hygiene conditions of the apples of Washington state to be exported to China, and the conditions of the orchards. Under the agreement, the apples to be exported to China must be produced in the area designated by the Chinese National Animal and Plant Quarantine Institute. That area must be free of the Mediterranean fruit fly. The fruit must be packed, frozen and stored by designated factories after being strictly quarantined by the U.S. quarantine institutes. The fruit will have to meet the quarantine requirements of China and must enter the country through designated ports. Only after being quarantined by the Chinese quarantine institutes can the fruit be put on sale in China. Mediterranean fruit fly is destructive to fruit. So far, China is free from the pest. But it has been found in some parts of the United States, though not in Washington state. In recent years, the demands of the Chinese market for foreign fruit have kept growing.
