The massacre at the al-Ibrahimi mosque at dawn today opens the gates to major questions relating to the entire peace process. Are we proceeding along the correct path? Or is there something else that ought to be seen, studied, and paused at? This is because with such a terrible murder that our people were subjected to today, we cannot be assured of a future without guarantees that will insure that our murder will not become a daily annihilation. Perhaps one of the most important and prominent questions concerns the settlers and the settlements, and whether a practical consolidation of any agreement could be realized if the settlers were living round the towns, villages, and the most important Palestinian housing concentrations? Everyone knows that the settlements that were built in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 were established on military bases; the aim was that they should encircle the Palestinians, surrounding them with a military belt in which zealous settlers, who are trained in the use of arms and had served in the Israeli Army, live. Therefore, there is a gross malfunction in the negotiations that basically relate to the settlements and the settlers. It is quite true that the Oslo and Washington agreements do not place the matter along these lines, but today's massacre gives a clear signal that there can be no solution with the presence of the settlers, and that the problem of the settlements should jump the list to become the priority over all other issues. This is because the Palestinians cannot have security while the settlers are there, and cannot feel safe while the settlements are present. Today's massacre is terrible and atrocious to the extent that it cannot be tolerated. It does not only give rise to questions, but raises the issue of protecting our people, and gives pause to the entire world -- especially the two cosponsors, the Russians and the Americans -- and the Security Council and the United Nations questions regarding the presence of an international force to protect our people -- forces that separate this unarmed people and the settlers, who this morning fired the signal of the beginning, that was received by the Israeli Army who indulged with the settlers in the killing of the sons of our people. We ought to understand the massacre, not only as an atrocious and mass crime, but as an early declaration of Israeli intentions regarding their belief in peace. Those who allow all those killings, and those who participate in such murders, cannot have a definite intention to strive for peace. This, now more than ever before, make our people and the PLO pause at our security and the guarantees that are being offered by the world for this security. The entire world has celebrated the accord of principles that was signed in Washington. What does the world say about this massacre and these killings? How can the world guarantee for us that such a massacre will not be repeated? How can this world punish the Israeli Government, Israeli Army, and Israeli settlers? The United Nations and the Security Council and all the states are now called upon to adopt a clear attitude. The Security Council, which in recent years has become an establishment for intervention in the explosive spots in the world, should take practical resolutions and steps to protect the Palestinian blood. We will not list the issue under the title: Settler or settlers? The issue is not like that. The Israeli Army was not only responsible, but was the one who carried out the massacre. The Israeli prime minister, who at the same time is the well-known general who broke the Palestinians bones, is also totally and practically responsible. Matters will not be rectified in this way. Negotiations could not be continued, not only as a protest, but because of the bigger question of whether such negotiations and the results they may reach are worthwhile if the beginnings witness such terrible massacres? It is a black day in the history of our people. It is a bloody day, a day when they violated our sanctities in a holy month and killed and slaughtered; a day when blood smeared the walls of the al-Ibrahimi mosque while they went on in their celebration of our murder. How can murder lead to peace? We ought to stop and not proceed along the path of negotiation without being assured that the mowing down by bullets of innocent worshipers who were kneeling in prayers to their God would not be repeated, even if it was individual killing. How about their ugliness and racialism? Then there is a last question that the massacre raises. Is the Arab situation in need of a bigger reconsideration in order to become more solid and firm? Is such solidarity still a costly demand, while the massacres fully expose the facts before the Arab world? Is there anyone who is safe from danger and threats while the life, security, and safety of the entire region are in a most critical situation?
