In his report at the meeting, Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK], said the classical work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a highly important work of great significance in rallying the young people around the party in one mind and firmly preparing them to be young vanguards who defend the party and the leader with their lives and to be lifeguards and death-defying corps who defend and exalt Korean-style socialism centred on the masses, in face of the vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate and stifle our country, the bastion of socialism. The reporter noted that the dear leader called upon the young people to remain loyal to the socialist cause, supporting the party's ideas and leadership and play the vanguard role in the nationwide struggle for the reunification of the country and advanced tasks to develop the overseas Korean youth movement and strengthen unity and solidarity with the progressive youths of the world. "It is a heavy yet honorable task facing the youth league organisations and officials to unite the young people around the party and the leader in one mind, prepare them to be rifles and bombs defending the party and the socialist system in the van with their lives and put them at the head of the drive to implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy for hastening the final victory of the socialist cause and the cause of national reunification", the reporter said. Stating that the dear leader's guidance is the life and soul of the LSWYK and the source of unconquerable might, the reporter said the whole league should thoroughly establish a strong revolutionary discipline of acting as one under his unitary guidance so that the party's line and policy can be the faith and will of the young people at all times. The meeting was attended by Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Kim Chung-nin.
