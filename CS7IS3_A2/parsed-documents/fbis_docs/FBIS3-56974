We will continue to adhere to all deadlines and conditions for the repayment of our foreign debt, which were agreed with the IMF, the World Bank, and other financial organizations, he stressed. Russia's policies toward individual foreign countries will also remain unchanged. The president is the guarantee of this, Chernomyrdin noted. The prime minister does not feel that renewal in the country depends all that greatly on the role of individual personalities. Cabinet changes are a natural process. Russia cannot be deflected from the path of reform. But the main task is to carry out these reforms with the least possible harm to each member of society, the head of the Russian Government believes.
