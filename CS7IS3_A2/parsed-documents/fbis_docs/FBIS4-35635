He told AL-HAYAH: "The allegation that there are disagreements inside the YSP leadership is a cracked record, because since the unity was established Sanaa has worked to split the YSP. It exerted every effort, allocated huge sums of money, and conspired against many people, but it failed to achieved its aim of splitting the YSP, which is now more united than ever before. The Political Bureau replied to Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani's statement on a split two days ago. All this confirms that Sanaa is desperately trying to play this card, but to no avail. Sanaa's behavior reflects the secessionist spirit it has exercised with all national leaderships in all parties on the national scene. It is pursuing its known policy based on the divide-and-rule principle. It has worked to cause splits among tribes and numerous national parties, and the Yemeni scene bears witness to that."
