It shows Chinese and foreigners, who are concerned about the future and destiny of China's reform and development, that the 56 nationalities around China have unprecedentedly gathered under the banner of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in one mind. The overall situation of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability" in the [party's] work has become the will of the state and the people. A Common Ground Formed at the `Two Sessions' This year's "two sessions" were convened at the crucial moment when we were implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. During this unusual half month, over 5,000 deputies and members have formed a common ground on the 20-character overall situation for the work of the party and the state. The common ground was first of all demonstrated in their understanding of the magnificent cause of reform. Reviewing the unprecedented achievements in China's history, which were accomplished in the course of great practice, deputies and members further realized: It was the great fortune yielded by the productive forces liberated through reform that made China's national economy grow at an average annual rate of 9 percent in the 15 years of reform and opening up, far higher than the average growth rate during the 26 years from 1953 to 1978, thus people's lives were remarkably improved with visible and tangible benefits. Reform should also be regarded as the tremendous driving force for future development, and reform measures should be used to promote transfer of the old system to the new one. Henan Deputy Li Changchun said: The new idea for development is to seek development through reform. Development will become empty talk, if we fail to promote the establishment of a socialist market economic structure by developing the five links as a whole through reform and if we did not resolve the difficulties in the microeconomic foundation and macroeconomic system for the market economy with reform. The common ground is distinctively illustrated in the essential criterion of development. Without development, there would be no better life for the people, political stability, and China's position in the world. Liaoning Deputy Quan Shuren maintained: We are really facing a highly favorable opportunity for development. If we take a giant step in development, our overall economic and social levels will be greatly promoted. Deputies and members agreed with such a view of development: We can by no means merely pursue output value and speed in economic development and develop a "bubble economy." A high-efficiency development should be the important thing. Our development should not only be rapid, but also stable; it should not only be healthy, but also sustained. Development should proceed in a down-to-earth and step-by-step manner. The common ground is also expressed in stability. Without political stability and unity, without the state's long-term peace and stability, we could achieve nothing. This point was hotly discussed at the "two sessions." Guangxi Deputy Zhao Fulin's remarks have struck a sympathetic chord: Many important reform measures launched this year have touched on the transformation in some ideas and concepts, renovation of systems, and interest readjustment. We should simultaneously adopt economic and administrative means and conduct ideological and political work to properly handle new contradictions and problems arising from the interest readjustment in the course of reform and eliminate unstable factors. We should take the overall situation of stability into consideration and consciously subject local, partial, current, and microinterests to central, overall, long-term, and macrointerests. Only when we have this common ground can we unify our action and have a foundation for forging ahead in unity. It Takes Team Spirit To Overcome Difficulties Today, reform has begun to increase in depth; we have shifted from advancing in particular areas to taking well-organized and comprehensive reform measures, and have shifted from setting our eyes on gaining benefits brought by conflicting reform measures to setting our eyes on forming new economic relationships in all sectors. Various contradictions are interwoven in the process of these changes, and all kinds of advantages and disadvantages have begun to surface. Therefore, to carry out reform in depth, we must fight an arduous battle to overcome major difficulties. Deputies attending the current NPC session and members of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] attending the current CPPCC National Committee session have been deeply concerned about the difficulties and critical issues affecting reform. We should face up to difficulties, gain a good understanding of the situation, and fully make ourselves ideologically prepared. As Shandong deputy Zhao Zhihao said: The depth, scope, and intensity of reform are unprecedented, all kinds of interrelated reform measures have been initiated one after another, and we will deepen reforms and make breakthroughs in various areas. We should be ideologically prepared for the difficulties that may come up in carrying out this complicated and arduous systems project. We must insist on taking a scientific approach, doing work cautiously, and preventing major missteps. It takes team spirit to overcome difficulties. The NPC deputies are 100 percent in favor of what Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Whether it is the revolutionary war in the past or the current reform, opening up, and modernization drive, we can succeed only if we closely rely on the vast numbers of cadres and the masses, fully rally the enthusiasm of people in all sectors, and pool our wisdom and efforts." The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members offered from various perspectives their ideas on uniting efforts of the whole country to overcome difficulties: -- We should work with one heart and one mind, help each other, give primary consideration to the overall situation, and abide by discipline. Since we are on the country's big boat of reform, we should obey the commanding voice and follow the drumbeats, as rowers of a boat do, and go forward braving the wind and waves. -- We should respect the masses' creative spirit in making reforms; sum up in a timely manner the experience of practice accumulated by the masses; and properly guide, protect, and make use of the masses' enthusiasm. We should show concern for the masses' hardships, listen to the masses, and help them solve their problems to enable the work to overcome difficult reform problems to be established on a broad and solid base of the masses. -- We should resolvedly eradicate the practice of taking countermeasures to deal with the policies adopted by authorities at a higher level. Even Tai Mountain can be moved if we work with one heart and one mind. No matter how good the principle and policies are, they cannot be effective if we do not have a unified will and action. -- We should iron out all kinds of contradictions in a timely manner, give play to all positive factors, concentrate the efforts of all sectors on the great cause of reform, and do our best to reduce frictions and shocks resulting from readjusting the interests of various sectors. In fighting the war of overcoming difficult reform problems, we should not be too hasty nor should we miss the opportunity to win. -- We should not be conceited when we achieve something and we should not complain when we suffer setbacks. We should be of one mind and be prudent in beginning the war; we should be determined to win a total victory ... These voices from the NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are loud and eloquent and concern the nation's overall situation. Our reform is hopeful! Our country is hopeful! Being Realistic Is the Key to Making Reform Successful The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are of the opinion that the two current sessions are democratic meetings, meetings of seeking truth, meetings of solidarity, and meetings with a motivational atmosphere. After the two sessions end, the NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members, who are shouldering sacred missions, will join people working on all fronts across the country in carrying out the guidelines of the two sessions. The most realistic problem lying ahead of us is how to faithfully carry out these guidelines. At a time when the NPC session is about to close, deputies to the session have stressed that we no longer should engage in empty talk and hesitate and lack resolve, and must take action. Guangxi deputy Cheng Kejie said: Currently the party Central Committee and the State Council are devising the strategies, are in command of the overall situation, and are guiding the ship. The policy of reform is clearly defined and is in line with the reality, and the established policies and guidelines have enjoyed popular support; so, the only thing we need to do is to work in a down-to-earth manner. If every unit and locality takes action in all areas of endeavor, our reform will be substantiated and full of vigor. By reviewing the stormy process of reform and opening up over the last 15 years, people can see that our reform has yielded solid results. So long as we sweat and toil, we will reap a good harvest. Some deputies cited these examples: During the early years of reform, the contract responsibility system with output linked to remuneration brought great prosperity to the rural areas; enterprise reform in the 1980's increased enterprises' vitality to varying degrees; since the beginning of 1990's, we have quickened the pace of reforming the system of budgeting resources, enabling the market to become unprecedentedly brisk, and setting a good beginning to establishing a socialist market economic system. We should do things step by step; the difficulties of reform and development should be overcome one by one. We should stick to it, firm up our will, keep going, knowing that there are difficulties ahead, and be determined to win. After analyzing the general situation of reform in the new year, the NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members pointed out that, among the various reform programs, we should concentrate our efforts on dealing with two difficult tasks: First, while working to transform the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, we should make positive efforts to establish new enterprise systems and seek effective ways to develop a modern enterprise system. Second, we should quicken the pace of reforming the financial, taxation, planning, and investment systems, and take an important step forward in establishing a macroeconomic regulation and control system that meets market economic requirements. These are both difficult tasks and an opportunity. If we can overcome the various difficulties, we will see a new horizon. The current situation reflects people's wishes and pulls people's hearts together. This is a year of great hope for China's construction and development, and definitely will be one in which we reap a bumper harvest of reform. This is a message of spring brought to people across the country by the Second Session of the Eighth NPC and the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee.
