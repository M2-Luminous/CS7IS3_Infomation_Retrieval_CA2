What do you have to say about this? [Al-Ahmad] Who told you that it has failed. As an official, who is aware of the situation, I announce that it has succeeded on all fronts to protect its sovereignty and independence. Everyone knows that the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] member states all participated, even shed their blood, in the liberation of Kuwait. After liberation, we have continued to coordinate joint defense among the GCC states. This shows cooperation among these states. On the Arab front, there is no difference. There are Arab states that participated in the battle of liberation such as Egypt and Syria. After this, we cooperated within the framework of the Damascus Declaration. [Abu-'Ubayd] How true are reports about the collapse of the Damascus Declaration? [Al-Ahmad] May God forgive us. Where did you get such an idea? If this is true, then we must say that all our meetings in the Arab world are unsuccessful. [Abu-'Ubayd] This year is expected to witness important developments in the Western stands toward Iraq. The recent visits by three senior Western personalities to Iraq indicate the possibility of ending Iraq's diplomatic isolation. Are you concerned about the exertion of pressure on Kuwait in this regard? [Al-Ahmad] First of all, it saddens me to even have to deny any reports on the existence of pressure on Kuwait concerning its policy. Basically, this is something that should not be said. Second, these personalities' visits to Iraq took place for specific reasons pertaining to the release of Western hostages. However, we should not say that there are no interests in ending the isolation. However, these interests will begin when the problems end. From this premise, everyone now wants to stake claim, pending a solution of the current issues. I would like to reaffirm that the diplomatic isolation imposed on the Iraqi regime should not be lifted for two simple reasons: First, If some say that Iraq has agreed to implement Resolution 715, which was issued as a result of the occupation of Kuwait, then this resolution is still linked to other resolutions. In this case, the implementation must be full and comprehensive, including all UN resolutions. As regards the Iraqi regime, I believe that no state should extend bridges to those who starve and displace their own people and carry out the ugliest forms of torture against them. [Abu-'Ubayd] Your statements in which you call for differentiating between the Iraqi regime and people appear contrary to the facts on the ground. [Al-Ahmad] What you are saying is very strange. You might not know that Kuwait has sent relief aid to the Iraqi people, particularly those expelled by the Iraqi regime in the north and south. We differentiate between the regime and the people. We hope we can help the people inside Iraq, because we are not pleased to hear that a fraternal people are being exposed to starvation and coercion. [Abu-'Ubayd] Your continuous denial of secret talks with "anti- Kuwait" states shows that Arab reconciliation is more unlikely than before, despite the continuous attempts by these countries and some Arabian Gulf states to bring you closer together with these countries. Will the coming days witness the success of these attempts? [Al-Ahmad] I want you to answer this question: On what basis shall these attempts succeed and the reconciliation be achieved? What happened was caused by a problem. Therefore, if the problem ends the reconciliation will begin. If reconciliation takes place now it will be futile. I hope peace will prevail and all repercussions of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will end. I hope peace will be achieved. But, when? I do not know. As long as differences exist in the Arab world everything will remain unresolved. [Abu-'Ubayd] What is your opinion of the [Arab-Israeli peace] settlement? [Al-Ahmad] Regarding the settlement, we welcomed the Palestinian-Israeli agreement as a first step. We hope that agreements will be reached on all levels, otherwise, there will be no progress on the path to peace. [Abu-'Ubayd] What will happen if this step fails? [Al-Ahmad] I hope this will not happen. Even if this step fails, the road to peace will not be closed. This road has been opened and the first steps have begun. [passage omitted]
