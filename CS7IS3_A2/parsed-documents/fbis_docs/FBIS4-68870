[Text] As is known, the Armenian authorities have blamed the grave socioeconomic conditions in the republic mainly on the blockade and the Karabakh war. Indeed it is a known fact that war is "an expensive habit" and that any country at war, declared or undeclared, cannot seriously think about developing its economy. Naturally, the opposition occasionally tries to refute the government's explanations that the Karabakh war is the cause of the disastrous state of the economy. Thus, during the discussion of the republic's budget in the parliament, deputy Garnik Isagulyan came forth with a sensational statement that Karabakh sent to 2 and 1/2 more aid to Armenia during 1993 than the other way around. During a conversation with us, Mr Isagulyan reaffirmed his charges and said that he can prove what he has alleged point by point. According to Mr Isagulyan the value of goods sent from Karabakh to Armenia totals 140 billion rubles, while those that went from Armenia to Karabakh are valued at 64 billion rubles. In other words, war-weary Karabakh, one third of whose territory is completely devastated and whose entire male population is in military service, has a positive trade balance with Armenia. No one doubts that in peacetime Karabakh's exports can exceed its imports. It is also true that all of Karabakh's industrial enterprises, without exception, are operating today unlike those in Armenia. Even so, the charge that is being made in today's war conditions is unusual, to say the least, especially since Mr Isagulyan says that his figures include the military assistance that Armenia provides to Karabakh. However, as unusual as the charge may be, none of the government representatives have denied the deputy's allegations, perhaps because a full refutation of the charges would require the discussion of undesirable topics, such as Armenia's nonhumanitarian assistance or the goods that have been taken from the so-called occupied territories. Leonard Petrosyan, the head of Armenia's State Administration for Special Programs, described Mr Isagulyan's charges as ludicrous and pointed out that Armenia pays for 90 percent of Nagorno-Karabakh's budget deficit with interest-free loans. He said: "Armenia sends nearly 9,200 tonnes of flour each year to Karabakh, in addition to everything else. I cannot imagine what Karabakh can send back in return. It is true that one can bring from Karabakh, say, firewood, but that is so little that it may constitute perhaps 1 percent of what we send them. As for the alcoholic beverages that are brought from Karabakh, they cannot be consumed in Armenia because of their low quality. Armenia simply plays a transit role for those goods. Today, a minimum of 15 trucks depart for Karabakh each day without counting the vehicles that carry specific cargoes. All these trucks return to Armenia empty because there is nothing to bring back. It is true that they may bring, for example, scrap metal, and work is under way in that direction." According to Mr Petrosyan, Karabakh has been exporting its surplus electricity to Armenia in recent months, but that it is improper to talk about that even qualitatively because 90 percent of the goods that are vitally needed in Karabakh are imported in one way or another from Armenia. He added: "Obviously, Karabakh would like to help Armenia economically, but it is superfluous to talk about that in the present conditions." We were also able to contact Zhirayr Poghosyan, the deputy prime minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, who, it turned out, was aware of Mr Isagulyan's allegations. Mr Poghosyan said: "The first point is that Mr Isagulyan is far removed from economic structures and economics in general. It is true that Nagorno-Karabakh has very significant means, and in peaceful conditions we may be able to support ourselves and Armenia with our own products alone. But today most of Karabakh's land is not cultivated for known reasons. Karabakh imports from Armenia virtually everything. It exports, basically, shoes, marble slabs, electrical equipment, and so forth. In terms of numbers, one can say that Karabakh imports four times as much as it exports." In general it is difficult to express any final opinion on this subject, because after all it is a matter of approach. One can take into account, for example, the fact that the equipment taken by Karabakh forces from the enemy is worth millions of dollars. One can take into account the fact that valuable equipment is occasionally ferried into Armenia over the Stepanakert-Goris road. After all, not everything in the relationship between Armenia and Karabakh can be counted with money. It is hard to think that a Karabakh at war can help Armenia economically. On the other hand, it appears that Karabakh's role in Armenia's economic difficulties is quite exaggerated.
