Martynov; place and date not given; fron the "Vesti" newscast -- recorded] [Text] [Martynov] What was the aim of your visit to Yugoslavia, the territory of the former Yugoslavia, today? [Churkin] It was very simple: to prevent the renowned air strikes around Sarajevo. [Martynov] What do you think, can Russia really prevent the bombing of the Serb positions and, more generally, the bombing of Bosnia by NATO forces? [Churkin] All of our efforts are directed toward this, but I would like to stress the following, that we have a dual task. I have tried to underline this. Although the prevention of air strikes is important, the lifting of the blockade of Sarajevo is important too, because we really can no longer tolerate what has been happening around this city for almost two years now. We were perhaps even the first to state after the well-known, tragic events in Sarajevo on 5 February that it there should be agreement during the next few days, that this task, the lifting of the blockade on the city, should be carried out.
