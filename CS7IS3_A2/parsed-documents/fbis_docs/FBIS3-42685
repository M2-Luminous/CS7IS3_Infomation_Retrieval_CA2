The president has formed a new structure in the Kremlin. On 6 January Boris Yeltsin signed an edict appointing the 44-year-old lawyer Yuriy Baturin to the office of the president's national security adviser. The pre-New Year reform of the former KGB was continued on Christmas Eve. The new Kremlin institution has an obvious counterpart in the office of the American President. In the United States the security adviser not only coordinates the activity of the power departments and intelligence. His role is far more important. It is sufficient to recall the influence of Zbigniew Brzezinski under Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger under Richard Nixon on the foreign policy of the White House administration. Considering also that Russia is today a state with predominant presidential power, it may be assumed that the president's new adviser could have considerable influence in the affairs of state. For What Merits? Yuriy Baturin is, evidently, destined to play the part of chief strategist in the president's team on matters of national security. What merits and qualities should such a person possess? What is the nature of his interaction with the president and the president's circle? Bill Clinton's assistant for national security, Anthony Lake, has several features in common with Yuriy Baturin. Lake is a college lecturer, teaching a course in international relations. Yuriy Baturin has also been involved in lecturing activity in the Moscow State University Journalism Faculty. Both are distinguished by plain dealing. True, the experienced Lake has had more opportunities to demonstrate it. Back in 1970 he tendered his resignation as assistant to U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in protest against the war in Vietnam. Baturin displayed a certain refractoriness in criticizing the president's actions at the time of the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet last fall. According to THE NEW YORK TIMES, Lake "can alter his position on any issue if he believes that this is what the situation requires." The adviser to the Russian president also amended his words when Boris Yeltsin's decisiveness fell into the category of strict but necessary measures. Both advisers say very little about their foreign policy views, preferring silent but eloquent action. The differences in the position of Lake and Baturin in the presidential teams are more appreciable than the similarities. Anthony Lake has known Bill Clinton for 24 years now. Yuriy Baturin became a member of the Presidential Council less than a year ago, on 17 March 1993. In addition, as distinct from Anthony Lake's well-oiled relations with the American President's entire team and the power ministers, Yuriy Baturin is closely acquainted with practically no one. He met Nikolay Golushko only last August. He met Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, only a few days ago at a news conference. He knows no one from Pavel Grachev's ministry. He has met with Viktor Yerin only a few times. Yuriy Baturin's closest acquaintance is Yevgeniy Primakov. They got to know one another at the end of the 1980's. So who is he--this mysterious national security adviser? He Did Not Sleep at Night Having graduated from a Moscow school, in 1967 Yuriy Baturin entered what was at that time the strongest technical higher educational institution--the Moscow Physico-Technical Institute. But even during his schooling he thought of working not only in the exact sciences but in current affairs activity also. Journalism was his dream. He retains the habit of resolving all problems by the inveterate "grease-monkey" method--studying the range of questions, identifying the essence, finding an effective solution. Such a method helps him confront all difficulties. Another habit has been retained also--sleeping little and working a lot. As his former classmates tell it, even against the background of the customary industriousness of many of the "phys-tech" students Baturin was distinguished by an incredible capacity for work. Aside from his main classes, he studied philosophy, political science, and literature. He wrote his first article on international relations in the institute. Having as a student chosen for himself the hobby of study of foreign languages, today he knows English, Japanese, French, Swedish, Serbo-Croatian, and German. It is said that there were evenings when Yuriy Baturin, as a listener, could not hold out and fell asleep from overtiredness. But when the power of narrator switched to him, he was transformed and forgot about his tiredness. Graduating from the "phys-tech" in 1973, Yuriy Baturin went to work at the Space Research Institute. Having spent seven years there, he abruptly, at first sight, changed the nature of his activity, switching to the Institute of State and Law. At the start of the 1980's Baturin acquired a further two educations--at the All-Union Legal Institute and at the Moscow State University Journalism Faculty. For some period Yuriy Baturin acknowledged that he had acquired a "second wind" in the field of current affairs writing. He forced himself to discourse lightly on the most diverse topics. As of a particular moment it was all the same to him what subject he took--the law, politics, or computer crime.... He was published in our journal also. Many of his works are distinguished by a saturation with ironical passages. And his political articles were sometimes nontraditional also. In one highly serious digest, for example, he published an article entitled "The Songs of Vladimir Vysotskiy as Poetical-Political Journalism." It was thanks to the original work "Law and Policy in the Computer Sphere," incidentally, that Yuriy Baturin was invited to the American Prospective Russian Research Institute [as published] in Washington in 1990 in order that he might take part in devising support backing for computer security in U.S. legislation. Translator of Pamphlets Nor did Candidate of Legal Sciences Yuriy Baturin escape the notice of Soviet legislators. In 1989 he devised in conjunction with two authorities, one of whom was Mikhail Fedotov, former minister of press and information, the first originating draft constitutional law in Soviet legislation. This was the News Media Act. The coauthors offered the public the act before the USSR Supreme Soviet made public its draft. In 1991 Yuriy Baturin began work on the staff of Georgiy Shakhnazarov, the former editor of his scientific articles, who at that time was an assistant to Mikhail Gorbachev. Baturin was one of those who prepared the well-known Union Treaty. After the 1991 putsch and the departure of the president of the USSR and his team from the political arena which followed this, Yuriy Baturin retired into the background, although continuing to work at the Gorbachev Foundation. The year following the putsch Yuriy Baturin became a doctor of legal sciences. He devoted much time, as before, to current affairs writing, frequently locking himself in his book-strewn two-room apartment on Leninskiy prospekt. He published a translation of a pamphlet by Lewis Carroll. In order to remain in the public view Yuriy Baturin accepted an offer of the producers of the television program "Itogi" that he be its chief political consultant. Last March Yuriy Baturin switched to a position on the Presidential Council. Analytical Center in Place of a Network of Spies It is hard to say on whose recommendation, it was surely someone's, but Boris Yeltsin noticed Yuriy Baturin. Last March and somewhat later, when, on 2 June, Baturin became the president's assistant for legal matters, and on 6 January of this year. It can be seen, in any event, that the protection has been of a purely professional nature. It is also important that the position of specialist connected with the work of the security authorities and army structures has for the first time been offered to a person who has studied warfare only in an institute department. Who, for all that, was that adviser from the "small group," as Baturin himself said? The "small group" could have included Yuriy Skokov, leader of the Security Council, and Gennadiy Burbulis, who, probably, knows Yuriy Baturin from the times of the work on the Union Treaty. It could have been Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, whose favorite, Mikhail Fedotov, knows Baturin's merits well enough. What remains of most importance in the appointment of the new adviser is, undoubtedly, not "who proposed him" but "what he will do." In the immediate future he will, obviously, devise the concept of the work of the new structure. This will, possibly, be a massive analytical office designed to coordinate the activity of the power ministries. The center of gravity of the control of the state security authorities will in this case be in the president's camp instead of the Ministry of Security. Especially since certain functions of the security authority are already being performed by the Office of Protection of the President. And, obviously, the strategic function, not the function of all-powerful "state within a state" for all of life's contingencies, will be predominant with the new office.
