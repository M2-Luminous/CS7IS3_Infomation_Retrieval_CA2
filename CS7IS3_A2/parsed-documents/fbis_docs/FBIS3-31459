Members of the negotiating delegation will be elected by the Chamber of Deputies or some other body in the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna. The newly elected president of the Presidential Council of Herzeg-Bosna informed the deputies about the current situation at the Geneva peace negotiations. He said that certain new initiatives on the set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina had been presented in Geneva, but added that it was too early to discuss them. However, the new initiatives refer to the involvement of the United States into the solving of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to NATO's decision to bomb Serb positions around Sarajevo if the Serbs do not withdraw their weapons.
