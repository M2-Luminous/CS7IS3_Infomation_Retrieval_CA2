The committee prepared a corresponding draft law and a report on the need to reduce foreign loans. This year the Russian government intends to repay 4.7 billion dollars of foreign debts. The State Duma Committee believes that the reduction of loans by the same amount would make the size of attracted credits dependent upon the ability of Russia's economy to service the foreign debt. Russia's foreign debt without taking into account the debt to East European countries and delayed commercial payments exceeded 80 billion dollars by the beginning of 1994. Annual payments which Russia is to make according to the schedule of servicing and repayments of the principal amount of the debt exceeded 20 billion dollars in 1992-1993. Holding talks with the clubs of Russia's creditors allowed it to reduce repayments of the foreign debt to 2 billion dollars in 1992 and 2.2 billion dollars in 1993. The servicing and repayment of the foreign debt in 1994, taking into account the amount delayed from last year, demands the granting of 32 billion dollars.
