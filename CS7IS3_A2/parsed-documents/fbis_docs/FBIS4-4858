Economic indictors have been patchy and the experts are split in their views, Fujii told a regular evening press meeting. After describing the current state of the economy as "extremely delicate," he reiterated the importance now of steadily implementing the 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package launched in February. Fujii made the comments after Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno virtually declared an end to the three-year recession at an earlier news conference, saying the economy is gradually showing signs of bottoming out. Considering a full-fledged tax reform to be enacted by the end of the year, Fujii said the coalition government's basic policy is unchanged from the aborted "National Welfare Tax" plan announced by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The plan called for a permanent income tax cut and an offsetting 7 percent welfare tax to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax. A tax reform panel of the coalition parties reportedly decided at Wednesday's meeting to compile an outline in late June. Japan promised in its March market-opening package it would reveal the details in June. The Social Democratic Party, which strongly rejected the welfare tax plan and forced Hosokawa to drop it, indicated in its policy report Tuesday it would accept a consumption tax hike.
