Authority: 42 U.S.C. 12501 et seq. §2523.10 Are Federal agencies eligible to apply for AmeriCorps program funds? Yes. Federal agencies may apply for and receive AmeriCorps funds under parts 2521 and 2522 of this chapter, and they are eligible to receive up to one-third of the funds available for competitive distribution under §2521.30(b)(3) of this chapter. The Corporation may enter into a grant, contract or cooperative agreement with another Federal agency to support an AmeriCorps program carried out by the agency. The Corporation may transfer funds available to it to other Federal agencies. §2523.20 Which Federal agencies may apply for such funds? The Corporation will consider applications only from Executive Branch agencies or departments. Bureaus, divisions, and local and regional offices of such departments and agencies can only apply through the central department or agency; however, it is possible for the department or agency to submit an application proposing more than one program. §2523.30 Must Federal agencies meet the requirements imposed on grantees under parts 2521 and 2522 of this chapter? Yes, except as provided in §2523.90. Federal agency programs must meet the same requirements and serve the same purposes as all other applicants seeking support under part 2522 of this chapter. §2523.40 For what purposes should Federal agencies use AmeriCorps program funds? AmeriCorps funds should enable Federal agencies to establish programs that leverage agencies' existing resources and grant-making powers toward the goal of integrating service more fully into agencies' programs and activities. Agencies should plan to ultimately support new service initiatives out of their own budgets and appropriations. §2523.50 What types of funds are Federal agencies eligible to receive? Federal agencies may apply for planning and operating funds subject to the terms established by the Corporation in §2521.20 of this chapter, except that operating grants will be awarded with the expectation that the Federal agencies will support the proposed programs from their own budgets once the Corporation grant(s) expire. §2523.60 May Federal agencies enter into partnerships or participate in consortia? Yes. Such partnerships or consortia may consist of other Federal agencies, Indian Tribes, subdivisions of States, community based organizations, institutions of higher education, or other non-profit organizations. Partnerships and consortia must be approved by the Corporation.
