During this final stage, workers are expected to repair and reconstruct ancillary parts of the Potala Palace, including the Western Buddhist Scriptural Printing House and the numerous turrets on the ancient city wall. Located on a hill in the heart of the Lhasa River Valley, the 13- story palace, with 10,000 separate buildings, houses a great number of precious cultural relics as well as eight pearl-inlaid and gold- plated stupas holding the remains of the fifth and seventh to 13th Dalai Lamas. The renovation of the whole Potala Palace started in October 1989. The entire reconstruction work, which is carried out in four main phases, will cost the central government 33 million yuan. After four periods of repair work, reconstruction of all principal parts of the palace has been completed and has passed appraisal by experts. Palace maintenance workers have now been working hard on the restoration of cultural relics in each of the halls. Some of the halls have been opened to visitors and believers. Besides working out a set of comprehensive, scientific, strict management rules and regulations, local officials said that they planned to install some advanced security equipment to help prevent fires, guard against theft, give alarms, and carry out visual supervision through closed circuit TV. The officials added that the final stage of the restoration is expected to be completed at the end of next July. A grand ceremony will be held in early August to mark the completion of the entire rebuilding project.
