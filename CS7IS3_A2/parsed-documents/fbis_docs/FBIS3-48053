He said so far only one resolution -- the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina -- had been enforced. This resolution is against the interest of Bosnians as they are unable to defend themselves from the Serb atrocities, he told the international conference of parliamentarians on Bosnia-Herzegovina here. The two-day conference attended by about 180 parliamentarians from more than 30 countries was opened by Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. Referring to Article 51 of the UN Charter which says that an independent state under atteck had every right to defend itself, Izetbegovic called on the UN to lift the embargo. He said his people were not seeking an ideological state of any kind but only wanted to preserve a democratic secular state. He dismissed the misconception that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was either a civil war or religious war. It is actually genocide... It's the war against every religion, he said. Izetbegovic said the war could not be stopped through appeals or resolutions. The aggressors don't understand this type of logic. We have to confront force with force, he added. After the failure of the recent peace negotiations in Geneva, we (the Bosnian Muslims) have been accused of rejecting calls for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We don't reject peace, he said. He added that the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into three mini-ethnic states was meant to confine Bosnian Muslims and deprive them of access to the sea. Izetbegovic said children and adults, young and old, were being murdered and driven from their homes, while the women faced constant rape in bosnia where concentration camps just like those during World War II have reemerged. He expressed appreciation to Dr. Mahathir and the Malaysian people for their continued support to seek and ensure justice and fairness for the Bosnians. He said Malaysia's multicultural and multireligious population was similar to that of his country. Malaysia has proven that there can be tolerance in such a society, he added. Izetbegovic hoped the conference would pave the way for an international campaign against Serb atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
