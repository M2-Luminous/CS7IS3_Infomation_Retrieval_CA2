Zdenko Vranjes reports from Sarajevo. [Vranjes] According to last night's agreements between Croat and Muslim representatives, the constituent assembly should today simply proclaim the federal constitution, but not elect the president and vice president of the Federation for a transitional period. According to the leadership of the Croatian representatives, the election of the president and vice president of the Federation has been postponed for one month at most, because the Bosniak Muslim side has not agreed to the proposal put forward by Croatian representatives, to the effect that the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation be a Croatian during the transitional period.
