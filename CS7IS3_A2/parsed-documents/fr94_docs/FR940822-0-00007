FR940822-0-00007 FR940822-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;44; Amendment 39&hyph;9006; AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;11] Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors (Formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 Series Magnetos AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos, that currently requires replacing Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets, regardless of total time in service (TIS), with improved TCM ignition coils, rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this AD, except for the S&hyph;1200 series magnetos on which the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as that series magneto already incorporates rotating magnets with the improved TCM design. This amendment limits the number of magnetos requiring replacement. This amendment is prompted by a report from the manufacturer that there is an error in the serial number listing of affected magnetos. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent magneto failure and subsequent engine failure. DATES: Effective September 6, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 6, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;44, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Teledyne Continental Motors, P.O. Box 90, Mobile, AL 36601; telephone (205) 438&hyph;3411. This information may be examined at the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerry Robinette, Aerospace Engineer, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, GA 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;3810, fax (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 29, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 94&hyph;01&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8785 (59 FR 4555, February 1, 1994), to require replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets, regardless of time in service (TIS), with improved serviceable Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) ignition coils and rotating magnets at either the next 100-hour inspection, the next annual inspection, the next progressive inspection, or the next 100 hours TIS after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs first. For S&hyph;1200 series magnetos, the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as the rotating magnets on that series magneto already incorporates the improved TCM design. Additionally, the AD requires remarking magnetos to indicate compliance with the AD. That action was prompted by recent reports of accidents caused by failures of magnetos incorporating older Bendix components that had not been replaced in accordance with superseded AD 73&hyph;07&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;1731 (38 FR 27600, October 5, 1973). That condition, if not corrected, could result in magneto failure and subsequent engine failure. Since the issuance of that AD, TCM has informed the FAA that an error in the serial number listing in TCM Service Bulletin (SB) No. 637, dated December 1992, resulted in too many affected magnetos requiring AD compliance. The AD should apply only to certain magnetos manufactured by Bendix in Sidney, New York, and not to any Bendix magnetos built in either Jacksonville, Florida, or Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, the S&hyph;600 series magnetos require replacement of only the rotating magnets and not the ignition coils. Finally, the FAA received reports that there is some confusion as to how the S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos are referenced in the TCM SB and the AD. TCM has issued a revised SB that corrects these errors. The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB644, dated April 4, 1994, that describes procedures for replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets with improved serviceable TCM ignition coils and rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this MSB.
