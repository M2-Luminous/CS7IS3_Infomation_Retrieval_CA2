Sparks flew at a joint press conference given here by EU Commissioner Leon Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, which was cut short after a heated exchange over the issue of Hong Kong and Sino-British trade ties. The press briefing followed the 13th meeting here of the EU-China Joint Committee, which was co-chaired by Brittan and Wu and focussed on the EU's support for China's re-entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Responding to comments by Wu that Britain's "unfriendly and uncooperative" stance on Hong Kong would inevitably damage Sino-British trade ties and economic cooperation, Brittan stressed that the basis of EU-China relations was non-dicrimination against separate EU member states. "Any action that discriminated against one member state on polticial grounds would be a very serious matter, not just for that member state but for the European Union as a whole," Brittan said. He declined to specify what action the EU might take should China disrupt trade ties with Britain, but the union's main leverage on Beijing would appear to be continued support for China's GATT re-entry.
