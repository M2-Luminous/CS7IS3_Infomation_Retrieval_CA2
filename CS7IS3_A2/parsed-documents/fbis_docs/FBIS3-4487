"The worry is whether or not they are capable of carrying out feats of brinksmanship without stumbling over," Evans said here ahead of a week-long visit to China. "It may be that they just want diplomatic gains and economic gains," he said. "If that is so, they ought to be achievable without raising the stakes to the level to which they have been raised so far." Evans told reporters that he would discuss North Korea with Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen -- "my friend and colleague" -- when they meet in Beijing. He declined to say what specific ideas he might discuss with Qian, but he stressed that China had an "extremely important" role to play in convincing North Korea to accept international inspection of its nuclear facilities. "They do probably know more about what's going on in North Korea than anybody else -- and they have a greater capacity than anybody else in the world to influence North Korea," he said. "I am sure that the last thing on earth that the Chinese want is to see the North Koreans acquiring a nuclear capability ... and an erosion of the credibility and integrity of the nuclear non- proliferation process," he added. North Korea, the world's last hardline Stalinist state, is alleged to be developing nuclear weapons as it continues blocking inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of what it insists are non-military nuclear installations. Many analysts suspect it is using the nuclear issue as a lever to win diplomatic recognition and economic support from Western nations, particuarly the United States, which remains South Korea's main ally. Australia has a special interest as it chairs the IAEA, the nuclear watchdog responsible for inspecting the North Korean facilities. The issue is liable to overtake human rights concerns in China during Evans' trip, although he stressed that he will be taking up such topics as jailed dissidents and repression in Tibet. "We'd like to see some significant gains made... Human rights these days are everybody's business," he said. But earlier, Evans was taken aback when he was asked at an Asia Society luncheon what he might do in Beijing for the release of Sydney businessman James Peng, jailed without charge in China for the past 5-1/2 months. "I will seek a brief on that particular matter," he said, without elaborating. Peng is being held in Shenzhen city, adjacent to Hong Kong, in connection with a business dispute. Australian diplomats are able to see him only three minutes per month. In his speech to the luncheon, Evans argued for a "pragmatic" approach over human rights. "Very often, particularly in Asian contexts, quiet dialogue and persuasion -- systematically pursued -- will give better results than drum-beating," the senator said. He also reaffirmed support for Governor Chris Patten's democratic reforms for Hong Kong -- despite the lukewarm endorsement given earlier this year by Prime Minister Paul Keating when Patten visited Australia. China has bitterly opposed Patten's reforms, pledging to scrap them immediately after taking back the British colony in 1997. But Evans told reporters that in his view, the Sino-British row over Hong Kong is "rather a lot to do about little. China should be prepared to take a deep breath and accept these relatively modest changes."
