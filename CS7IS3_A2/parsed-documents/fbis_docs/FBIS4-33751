During the second day of talks in Belem, Para State, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim reintroduced the topic of Cuba's readmittance before the OAS meeting and reiterated the need for "reviewing the Cuban situation within the hemispheric community." During the inauguration of the 24th OAS Assembly on Monday, outgoing OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares as well as Brazilian President Itamar Franco recommended that Cuba's readmittance be considered, although this topic is not part of the agenda to be discussed at the meeting which will conclude Friday. In his speech to the foreign ministers and representatives of the 34 OAS-member countries, Amorim recalled that his country "maintains friendly relations and has significant cultural links with Cuba." "Despite everything, we do not believe that economic and political isolation is the best way to contribute to a transition that is already in the making in that country," Amorim added. Baena Soares, who will conclude almost a decade as head of the OAS on 20 June, made similar statements yesterday. "As everyone knows, I have been inquiring whether this is the right moment for OAS members to review the measure adopted over 30 years ago when the Cuban Government was suspended ... the 90's are not the 60's," he stated. According to diplomatic sources, this was the first time the outgoing OAS head has dealt with this topic officially before a regular OAS General Assembly. "Cuba's removal is not in keeping with the political revolution the world has faced in the past years," he added. Meanwhile, President Franco supports that Cuba be readmitted and the OAS reassess its position regarding Cuba. "Brazil favors a harmonious dialogue among all nations, without exceptions," he added. In statements to the media in Belem, Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar expressed his support for Cuba's readmittance into the OAS while his Costa Rican counterpart Fernando Naranjo proposed that the OAS establish channels of communication with the Cuban Government.
