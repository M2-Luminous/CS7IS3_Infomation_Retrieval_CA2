The company, Castrol-Cuba, today introduced two guests of honor: Jim Alexander, director of the main office in London; and Michael Viejo, financial manager of (Abeille-Life), a branch of Castrol- Burmah. Both executives expounded on prospects for producing greater amounts of lubricants under the Castrol name. Mr. Alexander has met, these past few days, with various representatives of Cuban industry and government, and although there were no specific contracts, there is agreement regarding expansion of the relations that Castrol has maintained with Cuba for over 30 years and that reached a zenith two years ago when Cuba and Castrol polled their capital and formed the joint enterprise [empresa mixta] Castrol-Cuba S.A. [Begin Jim Alexander recording, in English, with superimposed translation into Spanish] I think that through further joint efforts, we will be able to ensure that there will be many more advances, greater development, in Cuban industry. [end recording] Jim Alexander's visit shows the commitment of the firm toward its company in Havana, which means that the power of the world's most important lubricant company is at Cuba's service. Mr. Viejo, who is visiting to participate in the Isla chess tournament, sponsored by Castrol-Cuba, which is under way here, is taking advantage of the visit to learn about the banking world, oil, industry, and insurance. This executive is confident that he will be able to support projects and, in short, expand Castrol-Cuba's relations.
