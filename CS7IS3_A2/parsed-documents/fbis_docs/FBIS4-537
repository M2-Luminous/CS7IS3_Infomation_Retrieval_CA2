FBIS4-537 "drafr071_a_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Fighting Between Army, RPF Continues in Kigali Fighting Between Army, RPF Continues in Kigali Army Reports Shelling Near Parliament EA1204153094 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise in French 0840 GMT 12 Apr 94 EA1204153094 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise French BFN [Text] The country, Rwanda, as you know, is going through the most difficult time in its history, ever since last week's events which followed the tragic death of the late president Juvenal Habyarimana. He was killed with his Burundian counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira, in an attempt against the presidential plane which was hit by a rocket while approaching Kigali airport. It is known what followed: an instant wave of violence, first in Kigali, then in other regions of the country. However, high-ranking cadres of the Army and the Gendarmerie very quickly carried out their responsibilities, since civilian power had been curtailed with the death of the head of state followed by that of the prime minister and other high-ranking personalities of the country who died as a result of events. [Words indistinct] officials of political parties who took part in the previous transitional government met and formed another government. This was done on 8 April. Since then, the president of the National Development Council, Dr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, in accordance with the relevant article of the Constitution of 10 June 1991, has assumed the interim presidency of the Republic. From the moment of the swearing-in ceremony on 9 April, the new government headed by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda has consistently called for peace and the situation clearly improved. However, following the threat of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to march on Kigali, tension increased. That is why the government decided, among other objectives, to pursue a dialogue with the armed opposition so as to set up a broad-based transitional government. It called upon the RPF to favor peace, instead of plunging the country once again into misery. For the time being, the RPF declares that it does not recognize the new Rwandan Government and seems unwilling to reject the resumption of war. The Rwandan Armed Forces, however, are confident that the punitive [word indistinct] of the RPF will not be a walkover. This brings us to the military situation in the country. Last night Kigali was relatively peaceful in most suburbs. However, there was an exception. There was heavy shelling around the Parliament Palace where the RPF battalion of 600 men, who arrived in Kigali at the end of December to protect political officials of the rebel movement, is stationed. This morning, there was also relative peace in most parts of Kigali, however shots were heard below (Rebero) District towards (Butamwa) District. We learn from informed sources that the Rwandan Armed Forces are chasing elements of the RPF battalion which did not return to its camp after leaving it to attack the Presidential Guard camp. On the northern and northeastern fronts, the Rwandan Armed Forces have the upper hand, according to the same sources. However, the people must redouble their awareness since RPF units are attempting to infiltrate Kigali in small groups. On the humanitarian level, the situation will very quickly become catastrophic. It may already be catastrophic, since all officials and personnel working in humanitarian assistance organizations have left the country. The camps of war-displaced and Burundi refugees have been left to fend for themselves, and the next few days will be chaotic. In short, that is the situation prevailing in the country today. Militarily, the Rwandan Armed Forces are in control of the situation but on the humanitarian level, one should soon fear the worst. In order to ensure that supplies reach the town of Kigali, Trade and Industry Minister Justin Mugenzi yesterday asked the prefects meeting here in Kigali to facilitate the arrival of supplies with the assistance of security service officials.
