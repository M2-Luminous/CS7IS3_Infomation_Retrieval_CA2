The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has denounced what it called the observers deal in Hebron and regarding it as an ineffectual deal confined to the presence of a limited number of European observers with no security powers and without any deterrent measures against the settlers and settlements. It also considered this a new concession in the 'Arafat leadership's long line of concessions under the pressure and blackmail of the United States and Israel. Those who speak on behalf of the ten Palestinian factions opposed to the Oslo agreement say that the measures which have been agreed on in Hebron will not prevent new massacres of Palestinians. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Organization, says that yesterday's agreement in Cairo does not ensure for the Palestinians a minimum level of security and the international presence is useless because the international observers will not play the role of policemen. He said the Islamic Jihad will continue against the Zionists in all parts of occupied Palestine and asked the Palestinian police personnel not to hinder his organization's operations against the Israeli enemy, as he put it.
