They are demanding the recognition of the EZLN as a belligerent force, a cease-fire by both parties, the Army's withdrawal from all the communities--with a full respect for human rights--and the suspension of the indiscriminate bombardment of rural towns. In the communique, in which it discloses this proposal, the EZLN says that it does not have in its ranks or its leadership any foreigner nor has it ever received any support or advice from revolutionary movements of other countries or foreign governments. We have a report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de las Casas: [Santoyo] The EZLN has issued its first official communique describing as unacceptable the federal government's conditions for a dialogue. It added that it will put down its weapons when its demands are fully met. In the five-page document delivered to the newspaper EL TIEMPO of San Cristobal de las Casas, the EZLN establishes five points that must be followed to begin a dialogue: 1. The recognition of the EZLN as a belligerent force. 2. A cease-fire by both parties throughout the territory involved in the conflict. 3. The withdrawal of federal troops from all the communities, with a full respect for the human rights of the rural population and the return of federal troops to their respective garrisons in the different places of the country. 4. The suspension of the bombardment of rural towns. 5. Based on the compliance with the previous conditions, the EZLN is proposing the creation of a national commission for intermediation [intermediacion]. The EZLN adds that its troops vow to respect these conditions if the federal government does likewise; otherwise, it warns, the EZLN will continue its military actions in the various regions. It says that it will abide by the laws of war as approved by the Geneva Convention, respecting the civilian population, the Red Cross, the media, the wounded, and the enemy troops that surrender without a fight. Furthermore, in six points, it explains the reason for its struggle and the reason to clarify various matters regarding the EZLN movement. First, it says that it has no foreigners in its ranks or among its leadership. Second, it also denies that it has any ties or links with Catholic religious authorities or of any other denomination. A third point stresses that its ranks consist of Chiapas Indians who are the most humiliated and unprotected people in Mexico. In the fourth point, the EZLN admits that it has sophisticated modern weapons and communications equipment which, it explains, were acquired by contributions from civilians. A fifth point notes that this struggle was started because throughout 10 years they resorted to every peaceful and legal means to solve their problems. The sixth point lists the conditions for dialogue. The subversive group also assesses the situation. It states that nine EZLN members were killed and another 20 were seriously wounded. It adds that the enemy casualties, including policemen and federal soldiers, amount to 27 dead, 40 wounded, and 180 prisoners who were already released. It also says that during the attacks against four jails, they released 200 inmates. This first EZLN official communique was signed with an explanation handwritten by subcommander Marcos and states that it was issued somewhere in Mexico's southwestern mountains. For its part, the special commission for the dialogue of Chiapas' social sectors, which consists of Senator Eduardo Robledo Rincon, Heraclio Cepeda, and (Andres Falgas Quic), stated that if they are asked to form a negotiating commission with the rebel forces, they will be glad to participate. Meanwhile, Senator Robledo Rincon has made the following announcement: [Begin Robledo Rincon recording] We have been talking with different organizations and parties, and they have expressed their concern for their rank and file. We were allowed to permit several leaders of these organizations and representatives of relatives, as well as government officials, to tour parts of the region, especially the Ocosingo area, so that they can establish contacts in the different regions of the state. [end recording] [Santoyo] At the same time, the National Human Rights Commission has reported that members of its delegation, which consists of lawyers and doctors, has visited Altamirano and Chanal, where there had been heavy fighting. They have said they went to San Carlos Hospital and Santo Domingo Convent, where they have received complaints of alleged violations of human rights. Different townspeople have filed the complaints, complaints, they said, which are being investigated.
