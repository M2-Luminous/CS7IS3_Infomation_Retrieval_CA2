The head of the North side's delegation said at the contact that the exchange of presidential envoys between the two sides had been proposed by the North side and it had made all sincere efforts for its realisation. Noting that the South side which had opposed this exchange last year has accepted our proposal and is willing to exchange special envoys, he said he was going to make clear the following points now. He said: Firstly, it is required of the South side to admit that it had categorically opposed the exchange of special envoys when we proposed it. It is a matter which must be clarified for a successful realisation of the exchange of special envoys in the future. Secondly, the South side had consistently refused top- level talks which we had proposed in the past. As far back as more than 20 years ago when the first North-South dialogue began, our side proposed to the then authority of the South side to have top-level talks between the two sides and, in the later period, proposed to the South side a summit meeting between the two sides officially and unofficially several times. Especially, in early April, 1992, a special envoy of our side visited Seoul and invited the South Korean top authority to Pyongyang. At that time, heads of state and government and prominent figures of many countries came to Pyongyang and congratulated our respected leader President Kim Il-song on his 80th birthday and had significant meetings with him. The South side of the same nation, however, turned down our special envoy's invitation to visit Pyongyang and so a summit between the North and the South could not be held. But we had never mentioned it. Today we are clarifying these facts in the hope of strictly preventing the recurrence of the unhappy things of the past concerning the question of the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South. Stating that the North side had deeply studied and examined the proposals and remarks made by the South side at the last working contact and the one-to-one contact between the heads of both sides, the head of the North side said: In this we have reached the conclusion that your side suggested that the issues of discontinuing all large-scale nuclear war manoeuvres and stopping seeking an "international cooperation system," which were raised by the North side, might be discussed and resolved when the sides exchanged special envoys. Your side also said that it had decided not to stage the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and greater efforts should be made from the national viewpoint with regard to the issue of the "international cooperation system." And your side said the situation has changed now because your side had already decided to shelve the plan to introduce Patriot missiles and as for the remarks of your side's top authority that he "cannot shake hands with a party possessed of nuclear weapons", he made them in June last year and later said judging from information available, the North had no nuclear weapons. The head of the North side delegation said although this position of the South side was still not satisfactory enough, the North side took note of it, regarding it as an expression of understanding of the reasonableness of the four-point demand raised by the North side. Then he proposed to the South side, as a dramatic step for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South, to announce at home and abroad in the form of joint communique that the North and the South confirmed again each other's intention to exchange special envoys and reached a complete agreement on the exchange of special envoys at the earliest possible date, and to discuss the drafts of agreement on working procedures put forward by both sides and finalize it at the contact today. After the speech of the North side the two sides entered into the discussion of detailed matters. The North side repeatedly urged the other side to take a joint step of announcing to the nation in a joint communique that they confirmed again each other's intention to exchange special envoys and agreed to realize it at the earliest possible date. The South side, however, refused to accept it under unreasonable excuses and pretexts. The North side stressed again that because both sides confirmed their will for the exchange of presidential envoys and agreed to realise it at the earliest date possible, there is no reason to refrain from reporting about it. It suggested releasing news reports separately according to each side's convenience if a joint communique was not to be published. The South side opposed it, too. The North side said it would publish a news report of its own in disregard of the South side's opinion. The sides entered into a discussion of the working procedures for the exchange of presidential envoys. Out of the 28 points of 13 articles contained in the drafts put forward by the sides, they reached an agreement in principle on all but four articles. The South side insisted on its unreasonable position and took a negative attitude toward principled and important matters related to the tasks of the special envoys such as adherence of the North and the South to the principle of national independence, confirmation of the way of national reunification and promotion of great unity of the whole nation. Then followed a tete-a-tete contact of the chief delegates of both sides. It was agreed that the seventh working contact would be held at the Thongil House in the North side's portion of Panmunjom on March 16.
