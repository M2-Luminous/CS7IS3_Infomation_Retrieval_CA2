Addressing an IFP victory rally in the KwaZulu/Natal region on Saturday, Chief Buthelezi said: "We had no money, we had the media against us, we had gurus at universities against us." "I thank the editors and journalists who had a field day vilifying me both here and abroad." He decried the fact that the IFP, which entered the election race late had only six days to campaign, adding that the confidence ordinary people had in his leadership assured him victory. "Never in the history of democracy has any political party entered an election with just six days left to campaign and then go on to win as the IFP has done in KwaZulu/Natal." Chief Buthelezi implored his supporters to work for reconciliation to overcome the hostilities in the townships and rural areas, caused by a drawn out internecine conflict which has claimed more than 10,000 lives in KwaZulu/Natal. "Go out and break down the barriers that divide you from your political opponents. Go out and spread the word of peace and reconciliation." Chief Buthelezi said: "There can be no economic development in the region until we achieve peace. No businessman will want to invest in this region if his life is in danger. No investor will want to build factories if their factories are going to be burned down. We will have to work at political reconciliation if we are to end up with a national will to make democracy work for the benefit of the people." He said South Africa's new coalition government faced a difficult task, adding that the politics of the dominant ANC partner differed in many respects from Inkatha's. "And yet, through this so-called government of national unity, we have to operate together jointly as a cabinet. It is not going to be easy," he warned. But he assured President Nelson Mandela of his cooperation. Chief Buthelezi made it clear the IFP's election win in KwaZulu- Natal meant the government of KwaZulu-Natal was an IFP government. "The future of this region in relation to everything that has still to be settled can only be settled with the full agreement of the IFP and its leadership." Chief Buthelezi said the IFP shared the objectives of the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme, but cast doubt on the ability of the programme to achieve its stated goals. "We fear it that it may not work simply because it says that the government will provide everything to the people. Nowhere in the world has the state been able to provide for all the needs of a country's people."
