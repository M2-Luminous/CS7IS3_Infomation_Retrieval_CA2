SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) develops fire safety standards which are known collectively as the National Fire Codes. Federal agencies frequently use these standards as the basis for developing Federal regulations concerning fire safety. Often, the Office of the Federal Register approves the incorporation by reference of these standards under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Request for Proposals Interested persons may submit amendments, supported by written data, views, or arguments to Arthur E. Cote, P.E., Secretary, Standards Council, NFPA, 1 Batterymarch Park, P.O. Box 9101, Quincy, Massachusetts 02269&hyph;9101. Proposals should be submitted on forms available from the NFPA Standards Administration Office. Each person must include his or her name and address, identify the document and give reasons for the proposal. Proposals received before or by 5:00 PM local time on the closing date indicated will be acted on by the Committee. The NFPA will consider any proposal that it receives on or before the date listed with the standard. At a later date, each NFPA Technical Committee will issue a report which will include a copy of written proposals that have been received and an account of their disposition of each proposal by the NFPA Committee as the Report on Proposals. Each person who has submitted a written proposal will receive a copy of the report. Authority: 15 U.S.C. 272. Dated: July 5, 1994. Samuel Kramer, Associate Director.
