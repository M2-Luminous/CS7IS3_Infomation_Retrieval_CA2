He publicized the covert methods the Sudanese Government has resorted to to mislead the world about the locations and nature of training programs for terrorists inside Sudan. In an interview with AL-AHRAM, Aldu clarified that at the beginning of the coup in 1989, the al-Bashir government's dealings with the international terrorist organizations inside Sudan used to be public. However, Sudan started to come under regional and international pressure and decided to resort to secrecy. He highlighted the fact that all these activities take place under the control of al-Turabi's front, which is called the Islamic Front, that he will be talking from a position of authority, and that what he says are things he has seen for himself. Aldu said: Their method of secrecy made them set up locations on the outskirts of Khartoum, which are private farms where training takes place. In addition, training takes place in mosques, where people usually come to pray. The extremists also show up among the crowds in the mosque, but they stay on until the training and guidance courses start. These go on until 0400. Iranians and other people from Arab countries do the training. He added that the second method is to have public training centers for popular defense programs in numerous locations such as Jazirat Aba, Juba, and Danqilah. He said: For example, 26,000 mujahid fighters were publicly graduated from training camps for popular defense in Jazirat Aba on 11 December 1992. He noted that to mislead people, secret training operations for terrorists take place as part of this public training. Aldu said: Extremists from Iran, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], and other Islamic and Arab countries take part in these operations. Recently, some extremists from African countries were added to them, but their general guidance comes from Iran. The third method is to set up what is called the "international friendship council" which is chaired by al-Bashir himself and is based in Khartoum. Its public duty is to support the relations of friendship with other people. But the reality is that this council is a tool through which contacts with all terrorist groups in the Arab world and Africa are maintained. On the Sudanese people's stand on these operations, Aldu said that all job opportunities are doled out to those who undergo training that is under the control of the Islamic Front led by al- Turabi. He pointed out that the Front has organized a six-month training program in which each group of Sudanese is sent to Iran for training and returns after six months. After that, a second group is sent for another six months' training period. Aldu Aju added that after their return to Sudan these individuals are distributed among the army, police, economic establishments, and embassies abroad, noting that all Sudanese diplomats are trained in Iran. On the Sudanese people's attitude toward Egypt, Aju said: The Sudanese people want to resolve every dispute with Egypt, as relations between the two peoples are long-standing. Egypt must be interested in Sudanese events, Aju noted, saying that Egypt cannot just sit and look on. He said that Sudan is governed by one extremist party. He noted that the regime in Khartoum does not trust Sudanese national principles. It imports principles of violence and terrorism from abroad and acts to destabilize the entire region. Egypt, he said, is the largest force in the region and the Sudanese respect Egypt. Aju said: The international friendship council is responsible for foreign policy in Sudan and all the things that the Sudanese foreign minister says regarding the negotiations to solve differences with Egypt will not lead to an agreement. He further noted that foreign policy in Sudan is not run by the foreign minister. On the Khartoum government's foreign policy, Aju said that the Sudanese Government does not deal with governments but with extremists. It has no good ties with any neighboring Arab or African country but is trying to act in these countries against the governments and cited Ethiopia as an example. He said that this behavior affects Sudan's relations with the Arab world, Africa, and the whole world. Aju noted that those who attended the Arab Islamic peoples conference that was held in Khartoum recently are extremists who came from Arab, Islamic, African, Asian, and even American countries. It was noted that the statements made at the conference were not critical but extremist. He pointed out that if religion had really been behind this behavior, Sudan would better have maintained good ties with Egypt because Egypt is the home of al- Azhar Mosque, which will never be secular. He noted that the events in Sudan are not motivated by religion but politics. He said that the Sudanese people are opposed to this state of affairs, but what can they do when rifles are directed at them and they are surrounded by security, spying, and intellectual suppression agencies and faced with the Islamic Front's control of livelihood, finance, and trade? Summing up the situation in Sudan, he said: Sudan is a state that has collapsed after the al-Bashir government destroyed the economy and all the state's departments. War in the south is exacerbating the destruction and the collapse is worsening.
