The draft bill is designed to provide for the establishment of a court of appeal and demand that the paramount ruler and Malay rulers accept a government advice. As many as 133 of the 179 MP's voted for the draft bill. Three PAS [Pan Malaysian Islamic Party] members and four independents were among those voting for the draft bill. Fourteen DAP [Democratic Action Party] members abstained and not a single member of the Semangat 46 [Spirit of 46 Party] attended the session today. Speaking during the debates at the committee level, opposition leader Mr. Lim Kit Siang said that the party abstained because the proposed amendment to Article 66 did not get the consent of the Council of Rulers as provided for in Article 38 (4) of the Federal Constitution. Winding up the debates, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said a constitutional amendment is nothing new and thus does not need the consent of the Council of Rulers. He said the notice regarding debates over the draft constitutional amendment bill was considered sufficient because the matter is nothing new. In another development, Semangat 46 President Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said the government should postpone the amendment because Article 40 of the Federal Constitution pertains to a true interpretation of a government advice to the rulers and their subsequent consent. He said the amendment should be studied first before being presented to the Council of Rulers for their consent.
