Kleshchinov under the ``Cell Biology'' rubric; presented by Academician N.G. Khrushchov Sept 21 93; received Sept 22 93; UDC 591.089.84.612] [Abstract] The article objective is to study changes in external geniculate body (EGB) neurons after removal of field 17 of the visual cortex and immediate transplantation of embryonic nerve tissue (ENT) into the resulting cavity long time after the operation. Three)five months old Bright strain rats with removed cerebral cortex field 17 were used as recipients. The study of semifine sections of EGB tissue of recipient's brain 8, 11 and 20 days after removal of field 17 demonstrated acute retrograde changes in the neurons. Electron microscope studies confirmed all symptoms of retrograde changes described in the literature. Ninety days after removal of field 17 of the vision cortex the ultrastructure of EGB neurons corresponded to a substantial degree to chronic retrograde changes. In studying semifine sections of brain tissue of a recipient with a neurotransplant one was able to see that the transplant was filling up the artificial cavity. Even 10 and 18 months after the removal the majority of nerve cells had practically normal structure. The results of the studies presented in the article demonstrated that one removal of field 17 of the brain of adult rats results in retrograde changes and the death of some EGB neurons within several weeks, while embryonic transplant of telencephalon prevents destructive processes in EGB neurons even long after the transplant operation.
