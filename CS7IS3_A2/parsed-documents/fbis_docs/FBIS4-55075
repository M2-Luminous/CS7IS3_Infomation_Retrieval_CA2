Dr. Seselj, acting according to the "abracadabra" principle, is attempting yet another double political somersault aimed at achieving a change in the course of events on the Serbian political scene and baffling the public. However, he will not succeed. Actually, he cannot succeed, because the Serbian people have passed the test of political maturity. These people no longer accept the reheated lies and deceptions packaged in a national wrapping [sentence as published]. At a moment when the recent chetnik duke, who has never smelled gunpowder, is losing his reputation and trust among the Serbian people and the Serbian Radicals, it seems that he has also lost his patience. It seems that he wishes to forget that a great many of these patriots and volunteers were sent to the front without any military training, and that they were led by officers that he [Seselj] appointed, who did not have the necessary military knowledge or experience, which resulted in a great number of deaths and injuries. Due to fear of responsibility, the chetnik duke is erasing the chetniks from his political life. He probably thinks that by erasing files, he can also erase human memory. The duke has forgotten that he just recently appointed 20 chetnik dukes. With these appointments, considering some of the people from the ranks of the new dukes, Seselj has publicly made a laughing stock of the highest chivalrous and spiritual attainment that the Serbs have reserved for their historical dukes. If Mr. Seselj is not ashamed of his actions before the domestic and foreign public and the thousands of members of the chetnik movement, he should be ashamed before the dead Serbian patriots, disabled veterans, war orphans, and the Serbian mothers and sisters shrouded in black. The Serbian Radicals from Montenegro and the Serbian Radicals, even though they believe that political parties do not have the right to claim the chetnik movement, will never renounce this national and patriotic organization of the Serbian people, ends the statement of the two parties signed by Radovan Bukcevic and Zvezdan Babovic.
