Summary of Final Management Plan The FEIS/MP for the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary sets forth the Sanctuary's location and provides details on the most important resources and uses of the Sanctuary. The FEIS/MP describes the resources and uses of the Sanctuary. The FEIS/MP describes the resource protection, research, education and interpretive programs, and establishes goals and objectives to be accomplished by each program. The FEIS/MP includes a detailed discussion, by program area, of agency roles and responsibilities. The goals and objectives for the Sanctuary are: Resource Protection The highest priority management goal is to protect the marine environment, resources and qualities of the Sanctuary. The specific objectives of protection efforts are to: (1) Coordinate policies and procedures among agencies sharing responsibility for protection and management of resources; (2) Encourage participation by interested agencies and organizations in the development of procedures to address specific management concerns (e.g., monitoring and emergency-response programs); (3) Develop an effective and coordinated program for the enforcement of Sanctuary regulations; (4) Enforce Sanctuary regulations in addition to other regulations already in place; (5) Promote public awareness of, and voluntary compliance with, Sanctuary regulations and objectives, through an educational/interpretive program stressing resource sensitivity and wise use; (6) Ensure that the water quality of the coastal and ocean waters off the Olympic Peninsula is maintained at a level consonant with Sanctuary designation; (7) Establish mechanisms for coordination among all the agencies participating in Sanctuary management; (8) Ensure that the appropriate management agencies incorporate research results and scientific data into effective resource protection strategies; and (9) Reduce threats to Sanctuary resources and qualities. Research Program Effective management of the Sanctuary requires the implementation of a Sanctuary research program. The purpose of Sanctuary research activities is to improve understanding of the marine environment off the Olympic peninsula, its resources and qualities, and to resolve specific management problems, some of which may involve resources common to both the marine and upland freshwater environments. Research results will be used in interpretive programs for visitors, for those living on the Peninsula, and working adjacent to or in the Sanctuary, others interested in the Sanctuary, as well as for protection and management of resources and qualities. Specific objectives of the research program are to: (1) Establish a framework and procedures for administering research to ensure that research projects are responsive to management concerns and that results contribute to improve management of the Sanctuary; (2) Incorporate research results into the interpretive/education program in a format useful for the general public; (3) Focus and coordinate data collection efforts on the physical, chemical, geological and biological oceanography of the Sanctuary; (4) Encourage studies that integrate research from the variety of coastal habitats with nearshore and open ocean processes; (5) Initiate a monitoring program to assess environmental changes as they occur due to natural and human processes; (6) Identify the range of effects on the environment that would result from predicted changes in human activity or natural phenomena; and (7) Encourage information exchange among all the organizations and agencies undertaking management-related research in the Sanctuary to promote more informed management. Education Program The goal for the education program is to improve public awareness and understanding of the significance of the Sanctuary resources and qualities to foster a heightened sense of stewardship for Sanctuary resources and qualities. The management objectives designed to meet this goal are to: (1) Provide the public with information on the Sanctuary and its goals and objectives, with an emphasis on the need to use Sanctuary resources and qualities wisely to ensure their long-term viability; (2) Broaden support for the Sanctuary management by offering programs suited to visitors with a range of diverse interests; (3) Foster public involvement by encouraging feedback on the effectiveness of education programs, collaboration with Sanctuary management staff in extension and outreach programs, and participation in other volunteer programs; and (4) Collaborate with other organizations to provide educational services complementary to the Sanctuary program. Visitor Use The Sanctuary goal for visitor management is to facilitate, to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource protection, public and private uses of the resources of the Sanctuary not prohibited pursuant to other authorities. Specific management objectives are to: (1) Provide relevant information about Sanctuary regulations, use policies and standards; (2) Collaborate with public and private organizations in promoting compatible uses of the Sanctuary; (3) Encourage the public who use the Sanctuary to respect sensitive Sanctuary resources and qualities; and (4) Monitor and assess the levels of use to identify and control potential degradation of resources and qualities and minimize potential user conflicts. The Sanctuary headquarters will be located in Port Angeles, WA with an initial satellite office near Forks, WA.
