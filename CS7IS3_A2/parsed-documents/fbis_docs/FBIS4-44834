There is frenzy, explosion, turmoil -- but also there are microscopic phenomena, to which Christian Amatore has devoted his time. This "research maniac," director of the Molecular Activation Processes Laboratory (CNRS) [National Scientific Research Center] at the Ecole Normale Superieure, has developed ultra-microelectrodes, a kind of "microscope to watch molecules reacting." This tool is revolutionary, both for guiding the synthesis of new materials and for observing the exchange of neurotransmitters in the brain, and has won its inventor the CNRS silver medal. His work has opened up a new field of applications. Air Liquide and CGE [General Electricity Company] are both exploiting the process, the former to develop biomimetic systems for separating and concentrating oxygen in the air, the latter to design materials for optoelectronics. Biologists in particular, notably American Mark Wightman (University of South Carolina), are interested in this "ultra-fine activity scanner" enabling the molecules of neurotransmitters emitted at synapse level to be counted, or the effect of drugs on a rat's brain to be measured. Investigations are only just starting.
