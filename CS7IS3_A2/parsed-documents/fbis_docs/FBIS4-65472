Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, the Foreign Ministry secretary general, had a 90-minute meeting this morning with UN mediator Cyrus Vance. Afterward, Zakharakis simply said that views are being exchanged to find a way to promote the negotiating procedure. Answering a question, Zakharakis said there is no progress in the talks but added that there are hopes. Asked whether U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz will participate in the talks and if there is a UN proposal that includes the term New Macedonia, North Macedonia, or Nova Majedonia, the Foreign Ministry secretary general said Nimetz submitted no proposals; he is merely participating in a procedure to exchange views. Joe Sills, the UN secretary general's spokesman, today said there is no timetable for the talks on Macedonia. Vance will hold a new meeting with Skopjean Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski late tonight, and tomorrow he is expected to meet Zakharakis.
