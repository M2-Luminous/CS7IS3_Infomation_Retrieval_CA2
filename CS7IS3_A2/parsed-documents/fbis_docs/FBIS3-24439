In Mr. Boyko's opinion, the privatization of large and medium-scale state enterprises is proceeding with ever increasing success. As of today, 10,000 enterprises, at which 11 million workers are employed, have been privatized to the extent of 70-80 percent. If the present rate is maintained--and right now about 900 enterprises are being privatized monthly--by the middle of 1994 they will number 13,000-14,000. In Mr. Boyko's words, the number of shareholders in Russia comes to 40 percent of the populace--much greater than in the United States or England--and development of the securities market is exceeding all expectations. The holders of enterprise stock can be divided into three groups, the general director stated. The first group, the largest, comprises labor collectives themselves, which hold more than 50 percent of the shares, as a rule. The second largest group with respect to number of acquired shares consists of major commercial structures which purchase shares of enterprises at auctions. Finally we have the third group, consisting of ordinary citizens. In discussing the present state of privatized enterprises, Maksim Boyko cited data from a sociological survey conducted by the fund jointly with the World Bank. We see that 60 percent of enterprises have started changing the selection and composition of their production output, have replaced their suppliers of raw materials, and have set about reducing the number of persons employed in production. In Mr. Boyko's opinion, enterprises converted to joint-stock operation and partially privatized enterprises have been released from the guardianship of sector ministries, and now independently determine their future plans. It is likely that in the near future, some privatized enterprises will begin issuing new securities. They require financial and consultative assistance, however. The Russian Center for Privatization intends to assist them in this. In the words of Maksim Boyko, the center is developing programs that should provide enterprises all the information they need to exist under free market conditions and help find foreign partners and investors. Last year the "Big Seven" allocated $3 billion to establish the Fund To Assist Privatization. It is expected that a portion of these funds will go toward "technical assistance" programs. In addition, three regional funds are being established: the Mid-Russia, South-Russia, and St. Petersburg funds. According to Mr. Boyko, it is planned to create similar funds in other regions. Concerning the activity of check investment funds, Maksim Boyko surmised that the most solid funds would now start a search for their own character, reducing the selection of securities they have and gradually shifting over to narrow specialization.
