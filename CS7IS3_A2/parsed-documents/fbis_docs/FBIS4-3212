However, if we analyze the problem dialectically, it is not hard for us to discover that nothing is immutable. If we view a fact from another angle, we usually can come up with a new idea. The new changes faced by deficit-incurring enterprises in China during the course of implementing "Regulations on Transforming the Operational Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" are the best example of this truth. Changes Among Those Which Usually Did Not Change -- Drastic Decrease in the Losses Caused by Policies and Macro-Control State-owned enterprises operating with losses have been a longstanding, difficult problem for the whole country. Meetings have been held and measures taken to deal with the problem every year for the last 10 years. However, the problem remains; it even became worse at one time. For instance, according to statistics compiled under new rules after the implementation of "General Rules for Enterprise Finance" and "Rules for Enterprise Accounting" in July 1993, the enterprises covered by the state budget which operated with losses in 1993 totalled 11,453 in number, 2,488 more than in 1992. They accounted for 31.8 percent of the total, up 7.3 percentage points from the previous year; and the total amount of losses was 31.91 billion yuan, 7.2 percent or 2.13 billion yuan more than 1992. However, what has not changed is the fact that roughly one third of the enterprises incurred losses, and what has greatly changed is the cause of loss. While some enterprises have alleviated their deficit problem, other enterprises incur more serious losses. According to a 1991 survey conducted by Lu Dong, president of the China Industrial Economy Society, of 50 deficit-incurring enterprises in Beijing, Shenyang and Tianjin, 19.4 percent incurred losses due to policies, 47.8 percent were the result of macro-control, and 32.8 percent suffered losses due to poor enterprise management. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the technology and economy institute of the State Planning Commission and the former production management bureau of the State Economic and Trade Commission, of 2,586 deficit-incurring enterprises in Shanghai, Shandong, Jilin and five other provinces and municipalities, only about 9 percent operated with losses due to policy or macro-control reasons, while 81.7 percent were the result of poor enterprise management. Statistical figures by category show that China's central industries maintained a trend toward decreased losses in 1993, with a total annual decrease of 5.85 billion yuan in losses. The losses incurred by coal, petroleum and tobacco industries decreased by 17 percent, 54.4 percent, and 66.2 percent, respectively. While their losses were due to policy factors, the decrease in losses was mainly because the state readjusted prices in favor of them, reduced their tax burden, and let them retain more profits. The losses incurred by local industries showed a rising tendency in 1993. The local industrial enterprises which incurred losses in 1993 accounted for 31.5 percent of the total, up 7.4 percentage points. Their total loss was 19.03 billion yuan, up 72.2 percent or 7.98 billion yuan from 1992. The increase in losses was due to local industries -- mostly textile, light, chemical, and machine-building industries -- being in a period of structural readjustment and change, subject to more uncertain factors. [passage omitted] Geographically speaking, the ratio of deficit-incurring enterprises slightly decreased in Shandong and Tibet, while it increased to a varying degree in other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities during the 1985-1992 period. In 1993, however, of China's 35 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with provincial-level economic decision-making authority (excluding Tibet), the ratio of deficit-incurring enterprises decreased in Beijing, Dalian, Fujian, Xiamen, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Yunnan. Another good trend is worth mentioning. Over the last two years, state-owned enterprises have shown a tendency toward increased profits. The profits earned in 1992 by the enterprises covered in the state budget increased by 32.1 percent as compared with the previous year, and their profit from a 100-yuan sale increased by 14.1 percent, from 2.06 yuan to 2.35 yuan. In 1993, they maintained the tendency toward increased profits. This is inspiring. [passage omitted] During our coverage, the plant directors and managers of many large and medium state-owned enterprises told the reporters: The diversified, changeable market demand contains opportunities for the revival of deficit-incurring enterprises. Large and medium state-owned enterprises have several decades of development experience and enjoy the advantages of specialized personnel, technology, and skilled workers, which village and town enterprises do not enjoy. In order to seize the opportunity, it is necessary to apply the new concepts of the market economy and assume a new vision of development and change in treating the advantages and disadvantages of state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to make changes to deal with the changing situation and to develop new supports for enterprises.
