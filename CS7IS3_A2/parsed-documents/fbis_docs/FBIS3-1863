In recent years, various provinces and cities have set up their own foreign exchange swap centers. However, the scope of operation of all these swap centers has been confined to local transactions, thus resulting in a separation between different areas and hindering the rational redistribution of foreign exchange resources. This being the case, the central bank can hardly carry out macroscopic regulation and control of the separated foreign exchange markets with a view to stabilizing foreign exchange rates. One of the measures stemming from the reform of the foreign exchange management system that was initiated this year is to build an inter-bank foreign exchange transaction market. In the unified foreign exchange transaction market that is to be put into operation this March, those banks authorized as foreign exchange dealers will be qualified to conduct transactions. Offers from these banks will be entered into a computer, their bids will be processed in a centralized manner, and the transaction center will act as a go- between to accomplish transactions based on the principle of each transaction going to the one who has offered the highest price and who has come first. The People's Bank of China is to announce the reference exchange rate of renminbi to the U.S. dollar every business day according the previous day's closing transaction rate on the foreign exchange market. The renminbi's exchange rate for other major foreign currencies will be calculated based on this reference rate. All other authorized foreign exchange dealer banks are to conduct foreign exchange transactions on their own within a fixed floating foreign exchange rate range pegged to this reference rate. Foreign-funded enterprises can sell their foreign exchange balances through authorized foreign exchange dealer banks on the foreign exchange market. For the time being, only the above-mentioned five cities will be included in the unified transaction network. After the system has been initiated, another 20 cities will join it sooner or later and will gradually adopt the universally accepted price enquiry and quoting practice for foreign exchange transactions. The central bank will be ready to intervene in the market at any time to maintain a supply-demand balance and to stabilize foreign exchange rates on the market by buying or selling foreign exchange. The spot exchange rate for the dollar at present is approximately $1 to 8.7 yuan, and it is expected that the renminbi exchange rate will remain stable in the first half of the year.
