Party Secretary Rasim Ljajic spoke about the latest Croatian proposal for the settlement of the Muslim issue in Bosnia and the NATO declaration. Bisera Vukasinovic reports: [Vukasinovic] Tudjman's initiative for a confederation with the Muslim state in Bosnia is not a serious proposal. The initiative is hiding the desire to divert attention from the Croatian aggression in Bosnia and avoid talks on Muslim access to the sea, and at the same time to score new points with the international community, Rasim Ljajic said. The frivolousness of the proposal is illustrated by the fact that a similar proposal by the Muslim side on the creation of a joint republic was rejected three months ago, he said. Commenting on the NATO summit, Rasim Ljajic said that the session did not produce anything new, and that the threats with bombing are seen to be more of pressure on the Serbian side than a real possibility. Rasim Ljajic devoted most part of his news conference to the situation in this region. He accused members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of carrying out searches of villages in Pestera and taking in about 1,500 Muslims for informative talks. He described this as a planned and long-term strategy aimed at changing the demographic structure of the population. We asked to be received by the head of the Secretariat for Internal Affairs in Novi Pazar and [Interior] Minister Sokolovic to discuss the brutal conduct by the police, but our request fell on deaf ears, said Rasim Ljajic, secretary of the Party of Democratic Action of Sandzak, at the news conference in Novi Pazar.
