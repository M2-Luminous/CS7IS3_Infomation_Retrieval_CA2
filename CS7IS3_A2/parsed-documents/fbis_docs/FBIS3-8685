The answers given seem to show that the members of parliament chosen have not yet recovered from their surprise: Lucian Avramescu, vice president of the Socialist Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]: "It was expected, although it was not known who would be changed. If we are discussing the people in question, I cannot say what my opinion is. I do not know them. It was natural to change Paul Teodoru [former transportation minister], after all that had happened; it was an obligation. As for Niculae Spiroiu [former defense minister], they were too hasty. True, it seemed necessary to replace the leadership of the Ministries of the Interior and Defense with civilians. Returning to Spiroiu, taking into consideration the accusations brought against him by Vadim Tudor [Greater Romania Party leader], they should have waited and not given the latter such satisfaction. It is positive that the interior minister has been changed, because I had the impression that a Greater Romania swarm had formed in that ministry." Gheorghe Raducanu, deputy of minorities and quaestor of the Chamber of Deputies: "This was the second reshuffle, and I view it as opportune. In any case, Mr. Petre Ninosu [former justice minister] was not changed because of any professional incompetence. I do not know whether Mr. Spiroiu was necessarily changed because of the founded or unfounded accusations regarding the structure in the leadership of the Ministries of the Interior and Defense. The replacement of the minister of transportation may be due to failings in his work." Ion Ratiu, deputy, vice president of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party and of the Chamber of Deputies: "What reshuffle?! Things are standing still; there is no real or comprehensive change. I am convinced that Mr. Spiroiu's change is not based on the accusations brought against him. I am surprised that he has been changed. This could have been done later. The excuse is that NATO demands that a civilian control the Armed Forces in all democracies. It seems to me that this is merely a justification, an excuse. In my opinion, Mr. Spiroiu had an equidistant and democratic attitude; he made important changes to remove some personnel. It seems that this attitude of his was fatal. I think that the changes in the Ministries of Justice and the Interior confirm the desire of the current executive authority to maintain complete control in the hands of the majority party--the PDSR." Mihai Viziru, deputy of the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM]: "I learned about the government reshuffle last night on television and today from the press. I understood that it was a problem of the ruling party and that Mr. Nicolae Vacaroiu was completing his team with professional people. We do not have any merit in this change, except that we told the government to take a stand on the so-called Tigareta affair [cigarette smuggling affair in which the army was allegedly involved]. The minister of defense was--or seemed to be--involved in it; his change, however, is not the consequence of these accusations. Mr. Ninosu was replaced because of his parliamentary group. Mr. Novac is the minister of transportation because he has worked in this area and has been present during all the labor actions in this ministry." Varujan Vosganian, president of the parliamentary group of minorities: "This reshuffle once again demonstrates that the entire political game of late has not been based on any serious intention to change the political aspect of the government apparatus. It is a show of force, if not of defiance of the other parliamentary parties by the PDSR. What remains to be seen is whether the parties within the leftist coalition will put up with being defied. Insofar as the opposition, especially the Democratic Convention, is concerned, the same problem arises. Developments in parliamentary political activity show that, from an ideological point of view, a conciliation with the ruling party is ruled out. We are not talking of an ideological conflict of yesterday, today, or four years ago, but of a conflict dating back 50 years; it has been brought back into the political arena of today. The differences are too great between the partners in the `negotiations' to permit a viable coalition. While in the Elisabeta Palace, handshakes were exchanged or nonaggression pacts were concluded, the political struggle was being waged more fiercely than ever. Thus, any understanding between the two parliamentary camps becomes a naivete." Alexandru Nicolae, deputy of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD-FSN]: "This is a custom of the government. It is not the first time that it has reshuffled the cabinet. To me, however, it seems unconstitutional. This reshuffle is a tremendous gaffe made by those in power by replacing Minister Spiroiu at a time of conflict launched by Vadim Tudor, this mini-Zhirinovskiy of Romania, who has created so many problems not only for Spiroiu as a man, but especially for the Ministry of National Defense, both at home and abroad. This Vadim Tudor has succeeded in creating a harmful atmosphere in the arms industry. As for the other ministries, I am of the opinion that if something has to be changed, it has to be in the economics ministries in order to invigorate industry and to speed up the reform and transition process." Vasile Popovici, deputy for the Civic Alliance Party [PAC]: "It seems to me normal that three of the four ministers have been changed: Ninosu, Danescu [former interior minister], and Teodoru. What seems, however, intolerable is to change the general in the context of a dispute between a political crook and the Army general. Given that this dispute has not been clarified, the message to the population is that the army is being accused. In this situation, it is urgently necessary to unblock the `Vadim Tudor files,' which are to be discussed by the bodies of justice. It is a very serious thing that in the Vadim Tudor-Spiroiu dispute, the Army was defeated and subjugated to a Securitate man, while the current minister [Gheorghe Tinca] is a former collaborator of that Securitate viper's nest SAPTAMANA, a former version of the weekly ROMANIA MARE." Dan Cristian Popovici, deputy and president of the parliamentary group of the Greater Romania Party [PRM]: "This reshuffling is a constitutional right which the president of Romania has exercised. I personally think that the legal implications were clarified last time. We will probably witness other such government reshuffles brought about primarily by mental exhaustion caused by the very tiring activity of ministers. Normally, a man who has already become used to the vicissitudes in the life of a minister does not rapidly realize what solutions are needed to unblock the mechanism, while a new member who joins the team may do so." Ion Dobrescu, deputy of the Liberal Party '93 [PL '93]: "What reshuffle, my dear fellow?! This is not what I call a government reshuffle. Four notorious ministers have been replaced by another four ministers, who may be even more notorious, or not at all. In any case, the reshuffle was to be expected and this hoax may work with some people, but not with ourselves. The Defense Ministry has been infiltrated by Securitate people." Dumitru Buzatu, PDSR deputy: "I think that this reshuffle has surprised a large proportion of the members of parliament, because it took place unexpectedly. Essentially, it follows certain demands made some time ago, namely to have civilians at the helm of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of the Interior. I personally do not know the people who have been appointed, except for the Senate vice president, and so I cannot express my opinion about their competence." Nicolae Octavian Daramus, deputy of the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR]: "This government reshuffle has come at the right time. The government's work was somehow being blocked from both sides of the political arena. The ruling party wanted to unblock it; it is a temporary thing and in the not too distant future a new government formula will be tried." Gyula Vida, deputy, president of the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] parliamentary group: "I expressed my opinion in connection with this issue on 17 December 1993 when the discussion on the censure motion took place. I think that the current government is not capable of taking action; it does not have the necessary support and political performance; and it does not enjoy international credibility in managing socioeconomic policy, which is deteriorating with every passing day. I think that the essence of the problem will not be changed through this reshuffle. It is just a cosmetic operation, an attempt to calm down the public, but the government is actually the same. In connection with the replacement of Lieutenant General Spiroiu, I think it was not a measure that suited the current political situation in our country." Doru Viorel Ursu, PD(FSN) deputy: "Apparently, one can talk of a government reshuffle by interpreting--in a very broad sense--the constitutional dispositions, which, in turn, seem to speak about a parliamentary republic. What do I think about this simple replacement of people? From a political point of view, President Iliescu has increasingly been assuming the role of a single factor of power. Thus, we are not talking of a change in concept or in the attitude of a government that has not been functioning for a long time, but about painting one's image. This way no one will notice that there is no more interest in whether Bessarabia is slipping away toward the east and that there are strikes and other problems. Neither strikes nor reshuffles add anything new. We can also talk about the inappropriate time when it happened, and that it was somewhat hasty and covert. I do not want to hurt anyone, I have no argument with these people, but insofar as the Ministry of National Defense is concerned, the change does raise a question mark." "This change revealed the image of the defense minister the moment the press noted that the offensive to sort out the `affairs' in the ministry was under way. As far as Teodoru is concerned, things are much simpler. Obviously, both Mr. Iliescu and the ruling party did not take an absolutely necessary measure when it was imperative, namely when the Petromin-Forum Maritime contract [on the sale of Romanian fleet] was sanctioned. To avoid the discovery of this serious mistake, which would have entailed not only the dismissal of the minister of transportation, but also that of the entire government, they used this reshuffle." Dinu Patriciu, deputy of the Liberal Party '93 [PL '93]: "Instead of a parliamentary majority that supports a genuinely reformist government, a minimal solution was preferred, namely a change of ministers; again without respecting the Constitution, that is without passing them through parliament. This proves that the attitude of the PL '93 was justified and we hope that our partners in the opposition have also understood that the discussions with the PDSR are not serious, because all they try to do is to delay and drag things out without any serious results." Sergiu Cunescu, PDSR deputy: "I appreciate that the executive authority was convinced of the need to appoint civilians to the Ministries of the Interior and Defense. However, we regret that General Spiroiu, for whom we harbor feelings of respect, has been replaces as head of the Army." Corneliu Coposu, PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party] senator: "The recent government reshuffle means nothing more than a continuation of the crypto-communist policy of rotating cadres," said PNTCD President Mr. Corneliu Coposu at a weekly news conference held yesterday, 7 March. The replacement of General Spiroiu at the head of the Ministry of National Defense, under the pretext of observing the recommendations made by the Council of Europe, has been assessed as a "serious political mistake." Apart from the risk that the appointment of a civilian to this position may not be well received by the Army, the context within which it was made is regrettable. In Mr. Coposu's opinion, additional proof is the fact that "President Iliescu is under the influence of evil forces and is susceptible to blackmail," because General Spiroiu's replacement is tantamount to playing Corneliu Vadim Tudor's game. The reshuffle means nothing more, the PNTCD leader believes, than prolonging the government's agony for another two to three months with the final aim of preparing early elections. "We do not view this reshuffle as beneficial and we do not believe that it has contributed to Romania's stability or credibility abroad. Early elections cannot be avoided, but only delayed," Mr. Corneliu Coposu concluded. Ion Diaconescu, PNTCD deputy: "Nothing has changed in the balance of power; there is no obvious modification in the political arena. I was surprised by President Iliescu's words justifying the reshuffle through economic objectives, while all the ministers who were changed were responsible for sectors other than economic ones; thus I do not see how they could improve the political crisis. Minister Spiroiu's change is very interesting. This move can be interpreted as an achievement by Vadim Tudor, because no measures were taken against him, but against General Spiroiu. Justifying this measure with the demands of the Memorandum is not significant. The Council of Europe recommended a civilian minister of defense, but we were not obliged to take this measure. There is a tradition in Romania in this respect: In the past 150 years, all defense ministers were career military men." [9 Mar p 3] [Text] Petre Roman, deputy and president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)]: ``No one contests the right of a government to try to improve its work by reshuffling the cabinet; however, the answers to the questions why, how, and when in connection with the current government reshuffle are disappointing. First, because no reasons were given. It would have been normal, for instance, to learn why those who held the respective positions were dismissed and what is expected from those who have been appointed instead. As a result of the way in which this reshuffle occurred--by once again ignoring parliament--a third of the current government is made up of people who have not been confirmed by parliament. This government reshuffle seems inappropriate because undoubtedly it raises questions such as how this fits in with the open dialogue with all the opposition political forces in order to conclude a national political pact and what it means for the capital of trust with which we proceeded to achieve a consensus to come out of this blockage. The surprise was very great when on Friday, 4 March, that is 48 hours before announcing the reshuffle, the country's president affirmed that there was no intention to reshuffle the government. ``We believe that, whenever a government reshuffle entails changes in sensitive positions, which, to a great extent, regard general national interests, such as defense, justice, and the interior, consultations are needed to avoid useless tension and keep the option for national consensus open. Unfortunately, such consultations did not take place this time around either.'' Victor Babiuc, deputy and vice president of the PD(FSN): ``The current government reshuffle suffers from the same faults as the former one, faults which were not meant to be noticed. Thus, they were eschewed both by the government and the other authorities, which were supposed to make sure that the reshuffle was carried out by abiding by the Constitution. When I say this, I am referring to the fact that, in accordance with Romania's Constitution, the appointment of government members has to be ratified by parliament, contrary to what happens in Western countries where parliament approves solely the prime minister and the government's program. Our Constitution also stipulates that the cabinet has to be voted on. ``f there is no specific text available in this respect, a move like this can be modified by observing the initial procedure. I am talking of the so-called `principle of the asymmetry of legal actions.' And this is not all. We cannot have two kinds of ministers: some endorsed by parliament, others not. Nothing can justify the conclusion that this is something normal. In our Constitution, there is a very important text, which has been overlooked, namely the one regarding `interim' status. This part of the Constitution stipulates that a person who is already a minister may be appointed as an interim minister. This means that that person starts from the status of a mandate previously ratified by parliament. Within 45 days, the maximum duration of such an interim status, it is necessary to have the appointment approved by parliament. This holds all the more true when we talk about appointments for a longer period, probably until the end of the parliamentary term; the person in question has to be recognized by the parliament of the time. And this requires discussions within the permanent commissions and then within the plenary session of the two parliamentary chambers.'' Stefan Radoff, senator of the Civic Alliance Party [PAC]: "Much fuss is being made about political and social pacts. The first step that should have demonstrated an opening toward them would have been the proposal by our country's president that these ministers be heard and not appointed by presidential decree. Taking each of these figures separately, I think that there are two matters at stake: The recommendations made by the Council of Europe with regard to the appointment of civilians to replace the military at the helm of strategic institutions were not mandatory, specifically now with this Balkan conflict. Mr. Spiroiu's replacement by a man who has nothing to do with the Army or its policy, as I have nothing to do with things outside my profession, is not welcome. Mr. Taracila's appointment as Minister of the Interior--bearing in mind his performance in the Senate, his honesty, and the competence that he has proved, is beneficial. As for the transportation department, which is the most vulnerable because this minister is firmly suspected of being corrupt, Mr. Teodoru's replacement is welcome as is that of Mr. Ninosu, which was necessary from a political point of view because of the delays in restructuring the justice system." Valer Suian, PUNR senator: "This was a political event, which had been expected for a long time. It is a positive thing that it took place at this time, but it would have been even better had it taken place earlier. The various political games between the majority party and the opposition, including the PUNR, made this expected and necessary reshuffle a little late. I think that through the importance of the portfolios affected by this reshuffle, this change may have important consequences for the progress of the reform process, at least in certain respects, something that means decisive steps in the direction of institutional democratization in Romania, and it is also in keeping with the recommendations made by European bodies." Ion Aurel Stoica, PD(FSN) senator: "The time of the government reshuffle was uninspired considering the stage of discussions between the parliamentary opposition parties and the party holding a relative majority in parliament. You do not need to be an analyst to ask whether a reshuffle at this time does not jeopardize and question the honesty of this dialogue and its outcome. Second, I cannot help noting the short circuit in parliament; we are of the opinion that the ministers or the candidates for the position of minister have to be heard by the parliamentary commissions and approved by parliament before the reshuffle takes place."
