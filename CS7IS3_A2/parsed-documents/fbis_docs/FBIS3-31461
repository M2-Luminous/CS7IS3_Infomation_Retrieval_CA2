"Most convoys will return to base tomorrow evening and should be moving again on Tuesday," said UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokeswoman Sylvana Foa. The decision would be reviewed Saturday morning, then again Sunday in light of the latest developments on the NATO ultimatum, which threatens air strikes if the two warring factions have not demilitarized Sarajevo by midnight Sunday. She said it was taken both to avoid any needless risks over the NATO warning and because some of the UN units based along corridors used by UNHCR vehicles had been temporarily redeployed closer to Sarajevo. [passage omitted] On Friday, aid convoys headed to the cities of Mostar in the south and Zenica in central Bosnia. Another convoy also set out for Maglaj, northwest of Sarajevo, which has only seen one convoy since last October, she said. On Wednesday, a UNHCR convoy managed to get into the besieged Moslem enclave of Srebrenica, where a Canadian UN battalion is blocked as Bosnian Serbs forces have refused to allow its replacement by Dutch UN troops. Foa stressed that the situation in several cities remained desperate, such as in Mostar, Gorazde and Maglaj where the everyday life of residents was much more difficult than for those in Sarajevo. Most people in these locations "are living like rats in sewers." "People could be fed if there were enough movement on the ground," Foa said, saying the UNHCR would like to see commercial traffic being resumed.
