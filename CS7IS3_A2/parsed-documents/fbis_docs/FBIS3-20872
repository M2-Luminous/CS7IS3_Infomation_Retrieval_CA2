Although this sentence was uttered outside of the protocol and was not part of the minister's speech, it emphasized the principal thought V. Dlouhy intended to communicate to the world once more. That is to say that the Czech Republic, with this government at its helm, will, within the framework of its possibilities, be promoting the maximum liberalization of world trade, on both multilateral platforms and in bilateral forums. It will do so all the more vehemently because it "set out into the rain without an umbrella" on its own, the minister recalled. The relatively small economy of the Czech Republic that had successfully overcome the delicate period of the past years as a part of the Czechoslovak Federation, as well as weathering one year of independent existence, needs to grow today. V. Dlouhy considers a rise in exports, which the Czech Republic intends to achieve by utilizing its own comparative advantages, to be the most important factor involved in economic growth. The minister ranks the possibility of lower prices, resulting from lower Czech wages, among these comparative advantages. In this connection, the minister could not resist criticizing the countries of the European Union that frequently block deliveries of Czech goods by claiming that these shipments involve dumping tactics. Social and ecological dumping are misleading concepts, stated Dlouhy, and added that the economic problems and their social aspects with which the countries of the European Union are confronted today should not constitute a reason for the Union to hinder competition for its domestic products with other products, and thus also Czech goods. This is primarily true in categories that are designated as being "sensitive." In defiance of the important association agreement, trade in these "sensitive" products has a long way to go toward liberalization on the part of the European Union. The minister's speech mentions trade with Slovakia in only one sentence: In 1993, 20 percent of Czech exports went to Slovakia, and Slovakia shared in Czech imports to the extent of 18 percent, so Slovakia was the second-largest trading partner of the Czech Republic. Outside of the protocol, however, the minister, again evidently with the intention of letting the world know, stated that the customs union between both countries is a functioning instrument that has resulted in advantages for both sides. He underscored, with great emphasis, that "we cannot afford the idea of wrecking the customs union," despite problems that arise from time to time. He stated that, following a minor period of improvisation, even foodstuffs are once more passing across the Czech-Slovak border without problems.
