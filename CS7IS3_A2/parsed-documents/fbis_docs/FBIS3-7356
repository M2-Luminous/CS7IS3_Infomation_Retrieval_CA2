Korea Is To Blame for Breakup of Working Contact"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The whole course of eight rounds of working contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South of Korea was a touchstone distinguishing between the stand of national independence and that of dependence on outside forces, peace and war, reunification and division, patriotism and treachery, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. From the beginning, the South side turned down our side's reasonable proposals and measures without any reason, bringing forward unreasonable proposals, and thus created deliberate obstacles to the working contact, the article says, and goes on: Prior to the eighth round of the contact, the South side, making a surprise volte-face from understanding the reasonableness of our side's four-point demand including the suspension of large-scale nuclear war exercises against the dialogue partner, totally brushed it off and perpetrated such a perfidious act as getting on the nerve of the North and fostering confrontation. Such being the case, the North side, out of the desire to prevent the collapse of the working contact at any cost and promote it in conformity with its original nature, urged the South side again at the eighth round to refrain from such a perfidious act and stop getting on the nerve of the dialogue partner, inciting confrontation, increasing tension and thus bringing dialogue itself to a rupture. The South side, however, categorically opposed the fundamental, principled proposals put forward by the North side concerning the maintenance of the principle of national independence, the promotion of the great unity of the whole nation and other matters related to the mission of special envoys. It became all the clearer through the whole course of the working contact that "the improvement of North-South relations" and "dialogue" advocated by the Kim Yong-sam group were a ballyhoo and it was seeking to prolong its days as a group of colonial stooges by slaying fellow countrymen and putting them on the altar of a nuclear war in league with outside forces. With nothing can the South Korean rulers cover up their criminal acts in making the North-South relations worse than in the period of the former military dictatorship and creating a phase of confrontation and war by breaking up the working contact, or evade their responsibility. History shows that the days of the flunkeyist traitors kissing outside forces, estranged from fellow countrymen, are numbered.
