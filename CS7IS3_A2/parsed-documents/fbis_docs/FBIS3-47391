Mr Sataphon made the offer on the eve of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's visit to Cambodia this week. The 56 Thai businessmen who will accompany the Premier on the three-day visit will participate in a seminar on regulations and prospects for trade and investment in Cambodia. During the visit, the Foreign Ministry will sign an agreement to set up a joint commission on bilateral relations. Mr Sataphon said the seminar is being held by the Cambodian Government in cooperation with the Thai Embassy and the BOI to attract Thai investors to Cambodia. The Government was formed in November last year. It will give Thai investors "who have good intentions" an opportunity to learn more about new investment regulations in Cambodia. He said he hoped the Prime Minister's visit would strengthen relations between Thailand and Cambodia and result in more investment cooperation. He said the BOI is aware of Cambodia's concern about "Thai opportunists" who are taking advantage of Cambodians. He hoped that a new group of Thai investors will replace the bad ones. [passage omitted] According to the Thai Commercial Counsellor's Office in Phnom Penh Thais had invested in 617 projects in Cambodia as of October last year. Hotels accounted for most of the projects, 71, followed by 64 banking projects. In the first quarter of last year, there were 589 foreign projects, of which Thais had 21.4 percent, Cambodians 16.1 percent, Singaporeans 13 percent, Hong Kong people 11.9 percent, and joint ventures between foreigners and Khmer accounted for 1.4 percent. Mr Sataphon said the BOI has not yet signed agreements with the new National Investment Committee on investment cooperation because the Cambodian Government is improving its investment law and restructuring. He said that if the Cambodian Government wants the BOI to help screen Thai investors, it is willing to do so. Thai businessmen should explore partnerships with Cambodians and long-term investments to benefit both sides, he said. The BOI and Cambodia's investment agencies have closely cooperated on investment for a long time. Cambodia sent officials to study the management and investment law of the BOI last year, and Phnom Penh is planning to offer investment privileges through a similar agency to Thailand's BOI. The 56 businessmen who will accompany Mr Chuan include Ital-Thai Development Corp chairman Chaiyut Kanasut, C. Thong Phanit Ltd Part & Group chairman Dilok Mahadamrongkun, Samat Corporation Plc managing director Thawatchai Wilailak, Chinnawat International Co chairman Phaibun Limpaphayom, and executives of Bangkok Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Saha Phattana Phibun, PTT Exploration and Production Plc, 3M Thailand and Seagate Technology Thailand. The BOI said the businessmen are interested in construction, hotels and tourism, cold storage and fisheries, furniture and wood products, telecommunications, jewellery cosmetics, real estate, rubber, steel, trading companies, automobiles, finance, household goods and electronics.
