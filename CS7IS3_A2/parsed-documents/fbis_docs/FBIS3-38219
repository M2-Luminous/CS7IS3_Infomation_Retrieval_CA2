The prime ministers of Sweden and Belgium were sitting on the platform with a select group of businessmen as their audience; the theme was the future of the welfare state. [passage omitted] Prime Minister Dehaene, who claimed he was speaking from a Belgian and European point of view, emphasized that the share of social security in national income, has reached "the highest possible level." In his opinion, we must define the social adjustments we deem necessary, within a European context. The biggest challenge will be to preserve social security and to prevent a dual society from being formed, in which part of the population would become marginal. He believes that the problems on the labor market must be dealt with on three levels: A liberalization of the excessively stringent rules, which keep employers from hiring people, a substitution of unemployment pay by an active policy of training and by an obligation to accept jobs, and a reduction of wage costs, especially those of unskilled workers, by trying to find alternative financing for social security. Dehaene also believes that the labor unions and employers' organizations are still too much a reflection of the situation in the period of industrialization. This pursuit of uniform regulations for everyone, which was inherited from the past, thwarts the necessary flexibility.
