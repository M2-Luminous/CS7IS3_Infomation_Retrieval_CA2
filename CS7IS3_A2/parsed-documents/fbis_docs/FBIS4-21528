Opening the assembly in historic Palazzo Pitti, the government leader pointedly asked, "If the developing countries were to reach the same rate of consumption as our own in an uncontrolled way, how many more planets other than the earth would we need?" The Italian [environment] minister, Valdo Spini, reminded his colleagues that, "One of the G-7 priorities should be that of launching a vast program of technological partnership to facilitate access to appropriate standards of high technology for the protection of the global environment. "More in general, if we do not want developing nations to industrialize according to polluting models of the past, we cannot preach to them. We must, rather, help them introduce new clean technologies," said Spini. Discussing the search for new instruments for financing sustainable development, the minister said, "Our economies will benefit from a partial shift in the distribution of taxes away from economic assets, such as work and capital, and towards the so-called environmentally-harmful, such as wastes, emissions and non-renewal resources. "Eco-taxes can provide funds for the reduction of the public deficit and public-sector spending requirements at a cost lower than conventional rates," said the minister. Pursuing the same theme, Spini said, "Thanks to the fiscal lever, it will be possible to finance indispensable environment protection programs which involve job creation. The white paper approved by the European Union last December," he continued, "clarifies how an ambitious environment policy, as [European Commission President] Jacques Delors says, can create hundreds of thousands of jobs." Concluding his remarks, the minister noted that the links between new jobs and eco-taxes will come up for further discussion in Detroit where the G-7 labor ministers begin meeting Monday [14 March]. [passage omitted] Later in the day, Ciampi noted, "There are no simple solutions for complex problems. What is required is a systematic, open and innovative approach, with coordinated answers, more valid than the sum of the single answers." In his statement to the ministers, the premier focused on the problem of financial resources and the aggravation of this problem by the present recession. In this connection he cited the need for a further search for "original solutions, based not so much on greater budget allocations as on the careful management of what we have available, on suiting our conduct to new development requirements, on a commitment to appropriate fiscal and credit incentive instruments, on further recourse to measures for energy saving and the development of renewable resources." Thus, he added, it will be necessary to "rule technological progress and not be ruled by it." According to Ciampi, the "essence of sustainable development is, in fact, in a commitment to harmonize solid and lasting economic growth through the rational utilization of materials and economically-scarce energy resources, along with the need to avoid interventions by man which have negative impact on the local and global environment." After noting the growing role played by environmental issues in the work of the annual G-7 summits, the premier recalled that the Rio de Janeiro Earth Conference "highlighted in an unequivocal way the unavoidable link between safeguarding the environment, productive processes and technologies." This is a matter of, on the one hand, "preventing pollution, climatic changes, the alteration of great natural spaces and, on the other, work for governing and quickly directing complex phenomena linked to populations and their habits, such as those related to disorderly demographic growth."
