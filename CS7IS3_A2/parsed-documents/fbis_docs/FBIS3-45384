Luo Gan pointed out that judicial and administrative work constitutes an important part of the building of a legal system, which assumes a heavy task of legal guarantees and legal services in developing a socialist market economy. The more the reform is carried out in depth and the more the economy develops, the more we need an enduring and stable social environment and the environment of a sound legal system, and the more we need to greatly strengthen the work of legal guarantees and legal services. Luo Gan particularly stressed that since the implementation of the policy of reform and opening, the work of reform-through-labor and of education-through-labor has made new progress and achieved marked results although it has also met with some new conditions and new problems. To increase the quality of labor-through-reform and education-through-reform organs for reforming criminals and personnel undergoing education-through-labor, to prevent and reduce crime, and to ensure the enduring stability of the state, it is necessary to step up supervision over the reform work of reform- through-labor and to gradually establish modern and civilized prisons and a system for education-through-labor. Since last year, various levels of judicial and administrative organs have stepped up the pace of reforming the work of legal services and have voluntarily and actively provided services regarding economic work. Particularly worth noting is the new progress made in reforming the lawyer system. Last year the nation saw the establishment of 824 new law offices, of which 199 were law offices established without the state's financing. The total number of law offices in the nation has reached 4,900. With the increase of 20,000 new lawyers, the total number of lawyers has reached nearly 70,000. The number of cases in which lawyers were asked to serve as legal advisers for government organs, institutions, business units, social organizations, and citizens, and cases in which lawyers were asked to serve as the criminal defense lawyer and in civil and business suits has increased by more than 10 percent compared to the previous year. In his speech, Justice Minister Xiao Yang called on all levels of judicial and administrative organs to accelerate the pace of reform in the new year; to do a good job in building modern and civilized prisons and institutions of reform-through-labor; to continue deepening reform in the various aspects of judicial and administrative work; to do even better work in legal guarantees and legal services; and to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Xiao Yang pointed out that prison is not only an organ for punishing criminals but also an organ for reforming criminals. He added that prison is also a special school for educating criminals. The purpose of reform-through-labor and of education-through-reform is not only to reform criminals and personnel undergoing education- through-labor into independent laborers who work honestly and who abide by the law, but also to reform them into capable persons who are adapted to the development of a socialist market economy. To that end, it is necessary to gradually establish a socialist prison and reform-through-labor system with Chinese characteristics. He said that the goal of reform-through-labor and of education-through- labor for some time in the future is to build prisons and reform- through-labor institutions into modern and civilized prisons and reform-through-labor institutions in a steadfast and within-our- means manner. Xiao Yang also called for enhancing work to resettle, assist, and teach those personnel who have been released from prison after serving their sentences and those personnel who have been released from reform-through-labor institutions. He pointed out that doing a good job in this area will have the important effect of reducing recidivism, of maintaining social stability, and of safeguarding the development of a socialist market economy.
