According to sources close to the Vietnamese delegation, the questions of the United Nations' role in the world and Vietnam's debt to Russia, following its succession from the former USSR, still need to be agreed upon. According to Vietnamese sources, questions of the prospecting and joint extraction of oil and gas by the "Vetsovpetro" enterprise and problems of the Vietnamese community in Russia also remain unsolved. Nor has agreement been reached on the question of the base at Cam Ranh, as Vietnam has put forward a proposal to review the conditions of its lease.
