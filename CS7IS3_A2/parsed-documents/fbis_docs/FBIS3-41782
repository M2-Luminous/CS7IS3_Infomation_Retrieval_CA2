As of 1 April 1992, 311 cases of AIDS had been recorded in Ukraine; 120 Ukraine citizens and 191 foreigners were infected. From 1987 through 1992, the number of ill foreigners increased steadily, and the number of ill fellow countrymen increased. According to data from World Health Organization experts, last year there were already 14 million carriers of the AIDS virus and 1.5 million AIDS patient throughout the world. In Asia, the pandemic is now proceeding at the same swift pace as in Africa at the end of the 1970s: cases numbering in the single digits were known 6 years ago, whereas now there are already half a million. This is largely because of the naive certainty that people there have immunity to AIDS. Similar conversations have been heard regarding our people, whose genotype has, they say, been hardened by life's abrupt changes. Hoping this is naive to say the least. There is no Ukrainian immunity against AIDS -- it is a misfortune of all humankind. Quite to the contrary, the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and significant environmental pollution have made Ukrainians more vulnerable to diseases, including AIDS. The only reasonable way out is AIDS prevention. A national AIDS prevention program has been developed and is already being implemented in Ukraine. The Ministry of Health has created a network of diagnostic laboratories where 5-6 million persons come yearly for check-ups. Unfortunately, no test system is produced in Ukraine. In the near future, the national committee plans to create joint ventures for their production. There is Ukraine's president's decision to create an AIDS Institute. A special scientific program, i.e., a social order to Ukraine scientists to develop drugs to treat AIDS or at least alleviate its clinical course, must be developed. This means the creation of drugs based on domestic processes and raw materials. According to data from sociological studies, 6 percent of physicians surveyed consider it necessary to isolate infected persons, and 69 percent vindicate their families' refusal to accept them. Many patients have no place to go after the hospital. They cannot get a job. We asked the Ministry of Social Welfare to organize special residences in Odessa and Kiev. The problem must be solved by civilized methods. This was already discussed, moreover, at the Riga meeting. It is not the AIDS patient who should be fought but rather the disease, and without forgetting human rights. All of this creates a great deal of difficulty. It is bad enough that we still do not have our own test system or enough disposable syringes. There are no quality instruments for transfusing blood or performing other medical manipulations. We must purchase all this, including reagents, from abroad, and until recently, they even levied large taxes on anti-AIDS developments at the border, which is completely absurd. For this, we need 13.8 million karbovantsy [the Ukrainian name for rubles]; however, only 8.3 billion have yet to be allocated from the budget. The national committee's board has decided to continue priority financing of scientific developments, propaganda, means and methods for protection against infection, production and use of disposable instruments, and purchase of diagnostica. Of course, there is not enough money. Foreign exchange is especially needed. I appeal to businesspersons and those who understand the importance and severity of the problem and ask for sponsor contributions. Our future and the future of our children depends on this.
