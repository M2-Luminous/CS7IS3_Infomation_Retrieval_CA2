During the two-hour inauguration ceremony, Lien and his wife were seated as guests of honor next to other Central American leaders. Calderon was named president of El Salvador under the witness of Salvadoran congressional leaders. After his inauguration, he delivered a 45-minute speech calling on his countrymen to help rebuild El Salvador, ravaged by 12 years of civil war. After the ceremony, Lien met with Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro and Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford. Meanwhile, during a television broadcast of the ceremony, a private El Salvador television station mistakenly aired a photo of the Communist Chinese flag alongside the photos of the ROC delegation. The ROC Embassy in El Salvador immediately demanded an apology from the TV station. Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Victor Manuel Lagos later apologized to ROC Ambassador Andrew Shen on behalf of El Salvador for the mistake. Shen told CNA that the station also apologized for the mistake and agreed to make a correction during a news broadcast to be shown later in the evening. Lien and his 21-member entourage will travel to Guatemala June 2 and is scheduled to return to Taipei June 7.
