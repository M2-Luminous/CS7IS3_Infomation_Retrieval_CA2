FR940202-0-00039 FR940202-0-00006 In response to these comments, the definition of issue price has been modified. Under the final regulations, if a substantial amount of debt instruments in an issue is sold for money, the issue price of each instrument in the issue is the first price at which a substantial amount is sold for money. If an issue is not subject to this rule, but a substantial amount of the instruments in the issue is publicly traded, the issue price of each instrument in the issue is the fair market value of the instrument as of the issue date. If an issue is not subject to either of these rules, but a substantial amount of instruments in the issue is issued in exchange for publicly traded property, the issue price of each instrument in the issue is the fair market value of the property as of the issue date. Finally, if an issue of debt instruments is not described in any of the above rules, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is determined as if the instrument were a separate issue. The proposed regulations define publicly traded property generally to include exchange listed property, property traded on a board of trade or an interbank market, property appearing on a quotation medium, and debt instruments for which price quotations are readily available. In response to a comment, the final regulations clarify that, for purposes of determining whether an instrument is publicly traded, a quotation medium is limited to a medium that provides a reasonable basis to determine fair market value. One commentator suggested that the rule regarding readily available price quotations should be eliminated. The IRS and Treasury, however, believe that one principal way in which debt instruments are traded is through brokers and dealers from whom price quotations are readily available, that this market is liquid, and that instruments so traded are susceptible to ready valuation. In such a case, it is consistent with the purposes of the rules applicable to publicly traded property that the instruments be considered publicly traded. The final regulations clarify the determination of issue price for a debt instrument that is part of an investment unit. In general, the issue price of an investment unit is determined as if the investment unit were a debt instrument. The issue price of the investment unit is then allocated between the debt instrument and the property right that comprise the investment unit based on their relative fair market values. If, however, the issue price of the investment unit is not determined under the rules of paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of §1.1273&hyph;2 (e.g., because the investment unit is not issued for money or publicly traded property), the issue price of the debt instrument included in the investment unit is determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274, whichever is applicable. To coordinate the definition of issue date with the revised definition of issue price discussed above, the definition of issue date has been moved from §1.1275&hyph;1 of the proposed regulations to §1.1273&hyph;2 of the final regulations. Sections 1.1274&hyph;1 Through 1.1274&hyph;5␣Determination of Issue Price in the Case of Certain Debt Instruments Issued for Property The final regulations modify the rule to determine the test rate for purposes of sections 483 and 1274. Under the modified rule, the test rate is generally the lowest of the applicable Federal rates (based on the appropriate compounding period) in effect during either (i) the 3-month period ending with the first month in which there is a binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated, or (ii) the 3-month period ending with the month in which the sale or exchange occurs. The proposed regulations generally provide that the imputed principal amount of a contingent payment debt instrument is the sum of the present values of the noncontingent payments and the fair market value of the contingent payments. Several comments and questions were received on this rule, including the comment that the rule should be reserved pending the resolution of the contingent payment rules in regulations under section 1275. To allow further study of this issue and coordination with the contingent payment regulations under section 1275, the final regulations do not adopt the rule in the proposed regulations. Thus, for example, consistent with existing authorities, the value of contingent payments is not taken into account for purposes of determining the basis of property under section 1012. With the publication of the final regulations in the Federal Register , §1.1274&hyph;2(e) of the proposed regulations no longer remains as a proposed regulation. Pending resolution of the issue and publication of new proposed regulations, paragraphs (c) and (d) of §1.1275&hyph;4 of the proposed regulations, as proposed in 1986, remain authority under section 6662 of the Code for a nonpublicly traded debt instrument issued in exchange for nonpublicly traded property.
