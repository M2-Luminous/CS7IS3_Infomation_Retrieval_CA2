The accord was reached when Mondale paid a courtesy call on Hata, chief of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), at the latter's office for the first time since the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in late April. Neither Mondale nor Hata, however, made reference to specific issues of the framework talks, the official told reporters. Hata and Mondale agreed to have continued dialogue for an early breakthrough in the talks, the official said. The talks on a proposed new framework for bilateral trade broke down in February at the summit of then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
