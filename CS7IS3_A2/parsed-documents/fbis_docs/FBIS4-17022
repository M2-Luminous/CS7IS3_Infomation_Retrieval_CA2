There are 61 such deputies (out of 94). The meeting decided to create a deputies group. Deputy Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the Republican Party of Crimea, which is affiliated with the Russia bloc, proposed that this deputies group fully support the president of the Crimean Republic. "Because this group effectively has a constitutional majority in the future parliament, any decision can be made ignoring the Crimean Tatar deputies (whose number is the new parliament is 14)," Tsekov said. This was decisively opposed by Vladimir Klychnikov, coordinator of the Russia bloc; and deputies Boris Kizilov and Vadim Mordashov.
