Eyewitness reports say the two men are already well-known among German businessmen and German Embassy staff in Damascus, the news magazine DER SPIEGEL reports in its latest edition. Carlos and Weinrich are alleged, among other things, to have been responsible for the bomb attack on the French Cultural Center in Berlin in August 1983, in which one person died. The German Government requested the extradition of the two terrorists from the Syrian Government in October 1992. Recent questioning of returning German businessmen indicated that Weinrich was still openly moving around the Syrian capital in July 1993. The security authorities assume that Carlos and Weinrich are still in Damascus, SPIEGEL adds. However, this has been denied by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' to his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel last week, the magazine writes.
