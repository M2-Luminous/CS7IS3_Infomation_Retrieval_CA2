Gu Yongjiang, also Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, was speaking to some 170 delegations meeting in the Moroccan city to sign the Uruguay-round trade accords, which were reached last December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay round of talks "has not only made substantial achievements on market access, but also succeeded in strengthening and enlarging the multilateral principles guiding world trade," said Gu. He said that "the Chinese government supports the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO)," which will replace GATT on January 1, 1995, an event marking "the start of a new phase for the global multilateral trade system." "A large number of developing countries, by taking free trade measures for the expansion of global trade, have made an important contribution" to the success of the Uruguay round of talks, Gu said. However, their "interests have not been given appropriate consideration," he said. "We share the concerns of the developing countries on a number of important issues such as trade and environment as well as the social aspects of trade," he said. "The Chinese government hopes that developing countries will have more fair opportunities in the new trade system and that their interests, especially those of the least developed countries, will be embodied effectively in this system," he noted. China will also seek to "create necessary conditions to resume as soon as possible its status of a GATT contracting member and to become a founding member of the WTO," said Gu. He stressed that "China's complete integration into the world trade system will strengthen the universality of the WTO" and "will provide much more access for foreign products and services to the large market of China."
