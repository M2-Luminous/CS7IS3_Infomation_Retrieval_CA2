Pyongyang provided Cambodian Government forces with six armored personnel carriers and tons of weapons, including shells for howitzers, ammunition, mortars and small weapons as a grant. The vehicles and weaponry were flown to Cambodia from mid-February, the daily said, quoting a military source close to the forces. With North Korea's military assistance, the government forces started in mid-March to intensify attacks on the guerrilla group's biggest stronghold in western Cambodia near the Thai border and brought it under their control on March 21, the SANKEI said. Pyongyang also pledged to offer additional tons of ammunition by early April, it said. The source was quoted as saying that the government forces could not have subdued Pailin without the supply of ammunition and the forces will not be able to maintain their control without additional military help. Cambodia maintains friendly relations with North Korea, largely owing to North Korean leader Kim Il-song's long-standing support for King Norodom Sihanouk.
