Laying stress on the key points, doing a sound and solid job. Closely linking the buildup of the grassroots party orgnization in the farming and lifestock breeding areas with the overall development of the rural economy. Substantially strengthening leadership in the buildup of grassroots party organization in the farming and livestock breeding areas. On 9-11 January, the autonomous region held report-back meetings in Kashi and Kuitun on the buildup of the grassroots party organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas of the northern and southern sectors of Xinjiang. At the meetings, experiences were reviewed and exchanged with regard to the buildup of grassroots party organization, which had actually been carried out during the past two months in the various farming and livestock breeding areas. The meetings also analyzed existing problems and made plans and dispositions as to the next phase of work. Zhang Fusen, deputy secretary of the Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, and Zhou Guofu, member of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and director of the Organization Department, presided over the northern Xinjiang meeting and the southern Xinjiang meeting, respectively. Judging by the situation reported by the leadership of the various autonomous prefecture cities and key counties (cities), initial successes have been achieved in the work of building up the grassroots party organization, which had indeed been carried out since the early part of November of last year in the various farming and stockbreeding areas. In 15 key counties (cities), 184 key townships (towns), and in 1,453 less developed villages throughout Xinjiang, a comprehensive overhaul of party branches had been instituted. From various places, 7,580 cadres had been selected and despatched for work in the key counties, townships, and less developed villages, and 976 young and promising cadres from government agencies were despatched to these less developed villages to assume duties or register for work. By laying stress on the key points and adopting forceful measures, a healthy development was achieved in the buildup of the grassroots party organizations in the farming and stockbreeding areas. Leading cadres from various autonomous prefecture cities and key counties (cities) who attended the meetings analyzed existing problems and then expressed the opinion that, although the buildup of the grassroots party organization in the farming and lifestock breeding areas had been effective, the development, comprehensively speaking, has been very uneven. Leading cadres in some places showed insufficient understanding of the importance, necessity, and urgency of the buildup which has to take place at the grassroots in the farming and lifestock breeding areas; they had been slow in taking action and not forceful in their performance. In some places they had not accurately taken charge of the key points in their work; they had failed to study sufficiently thoroughly the difficulties in building up the grassroots party organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas and had adopted rather ineffective measures. In their concluding speeches at the report-back meetings in the northern and southern sectors of Xinjiang, Comrades Zhang Fusen and Zhou Guofu presented four demands relative to a more effective future buildup of the grassroots party organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas: One. Further deepening of understanding, unremitting and energetic development of the grassroots party organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas. The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the entire fighting power of the party. This is a point that all leading cadres in party and government must understand very clearly; there must be not the slightest ambiguity in this regard. Party committees at all levels must grasp this matter of strengthening the buildup of the grassroots organization in the farming and lifestock breeding areas as an important and urgent task within the party's overall work in the rural areas. Two. Guiding ideology must be clear and definite, work performance must be sound and solid. Guiding ideology must stress the basic things, lay the foundation, strive for stability, and spur on development. When engaged in strengthening the buildup of the party's grassroots organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas, it is necessary to primarily concentrate on the key points, focus all energy and strength on the effective education of party members and on the effective rectification of party branch committees in the key counties (cities), townships (towns), and less developed villages. It is not only necessary to make a good selection of the person of party branch secretary, but the entire set of the party branch committee must be well and effectively constituted, and there also has to be some down-to-earth work performed for them. Three. It is necessary to closely link the buildup of the grassroots party organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas with the overall development of the rural economy. Economic development is the central task of the party, as it is also the fundamental starting point and the point where the party will make its stand in its efforts to strengthen the grassroots organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas. Leading cadres of all ranks must firmly espouse the guiding ideology of "pay attention to party construction as a matter bound up with the economy, pay attention to party construction as a means to spur on the economy." The extent to which townships and villages will achieve a moderate degree of prosperity at an early date must be major criterion for whether the buildup of the grassroots organization has been effectively accomplished. Four. Party committees of all ranks must effectively strengthen their leadership in the work of building up the grassroots organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas. Main leadership problems require personal attention of the leading cadre, assigned leadership problems must be attended to with all the assignee's strength, other leadership problems must be made coordinated efforts. In this matter of strengthening the buildup of the grassroots party organization in the farming and lifestock breeding areas, it shall also be incumbent to institute the leadership responsibility system.
