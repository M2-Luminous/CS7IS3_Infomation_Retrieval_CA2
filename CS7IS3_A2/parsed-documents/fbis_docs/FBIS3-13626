Samia Azzi reports: [Azzi] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' visited Algeria for two days as a special envoy of President Hafiz al-Asad to meet President Liamine Zeroual. This morning, he was met on the second day of his visit by the head of state and handed over a message from Zeroual's Syrian counterpart, Hafiz al-Asad. At the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Mohamed Salah Dembri received his Syrian counterpart. The talks were extended to include delegations of both countries. Mr. Faruq al-Shar' did not conceal the Syrian Government's concern about what was happening in Algeria. The talks were not restricted to conditions in Algeria but included bilateral ties and their future. During the meeting, an agreement was reached to revive the activity of the bilateral Algerian-Syrian committee. It is to convene next June. What is happening in the Middle East, particularly after the massacre at al-Ibrahimi mosque, and the Arab position in general, were subjects discussed by the two sides. They unanimously agreed on the necessity to put the problems forward at the Arab League's ministerial council during its ordinary session. [Begin recording] [Al-Shar'] I am satisfied with the outcome of this visit. I am particularly satisfied with what I heard from President Zeroual concerning various issues -- whether those dealing with international or Arab spheres, including the importance of Arab solidarity and Arab unity to confront various challenges. We held in-depth discussions on the internal situation in sisterly Algeria and also on bilateral ties between the two sisterly countries and means of boosting them. [end recording]
