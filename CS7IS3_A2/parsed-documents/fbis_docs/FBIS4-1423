The judge phoned me yesterday, and he also sent me a letter promising that the ballots would be sent this morning, etc. And I think there's been a distortion, of course, in the media about my statement yesterday when I said that if the ballot hasn't got the sticker for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and people use it in spite of that, that would be an infringement of the agreement that we made on the 19th, which took place when we met with Mr. Mandela, and Mr. de Klerk in Pretoria, and that therefore if that is done in spite of, and also the insistence that people must write their names instead of insisting on the sticker, I said that I would place before the Central Committee and propose that we perhaps pull out of the elections. But I think there is a mistake now because it seems that some people in the media say that I threatened. By making a statement like that that I threatened to pull out, I have no intention of pulling out. But quite clearly I mean if these very glaring things continue then I have to call a meeting with the Central Committee, but I've not threatened to pull out as appears to be the case. I saw a headline in one of the papers today stating that I, you know, I've threatened that we are going to pull out. [Unidentified correspondent] About the holiday Mr. Chief Minister, some areas here are still open, do you think in fact people didn't know that it was a holiday today? [Buthelezi] No, in fact even the way that was handled, for instance, I was told that this was discussed with some of the leaders, our leaders, I don't know which ones, but I'm one of those that were not consulted. I have no objection to the holiday as such, but I think it was really handled in a very inapt fashion, because I think all of us should have known, and we should have announced to the people that it is in fact a holiday.
