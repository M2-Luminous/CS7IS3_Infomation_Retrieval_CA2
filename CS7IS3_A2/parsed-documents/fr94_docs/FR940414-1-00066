Omits facilities that are directly discharging PFPR wastewater. Percentages may sum to more than 100% due to rounding. Generally, refilling establishments have lower total revenues than other PFPR facilities. The estimated mean annual revenue for refilling establishments was less than $5 million, while other PFPR facilities have an estimated mean revenue of over $16 million. Further, refilling establishments derive only a small percentage of their revenue from pesticide repackaging. The estimated mean percentage of revenue from pesticide refilling activities is 15 percent, while other PFPR facilities have a mean percentage of revenue from PFPR activities of 28 percent. Also, the other activities conducted at refilling establishments do not depend on repackaging pesticides. Therefore, for this subcategory, no facility closures are expected in response to compliance costs imposed by this rulemaking and no further analysis of facility closure has been conducted. Refilling establishments have simple production lines, typically consisting of one or more bulk tanks purchased specifically to hold pesticides. The investment in the ``production line'' is minimal and alternative uses of the tank are limited and unlikely to provide significant profits. Therefore, most owners of refilling establishments are not expected to discontinue their refilling practices for the purpose of converting their tanks to an alternate use and no analysis of production line conversion has been conducted. The economic returns to refilling establishments may, however, be affected by compliance with the proposed regulation. The analysis evaluates the extent of potential impacts by comparing annualized compliance costs to facility revenue. Costs in excess of five percent of the facility's revenue are characterized as a possible significant economic impact. Table 2 summarizes the methodology for calculating impacts.
