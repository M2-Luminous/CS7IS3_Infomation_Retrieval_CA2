The Omsk Polet Production Association, participating in creating the rocket-space shield of the country, was off limits for the press. Upon the ending of the cold war, with the warming of the international climate, the entire world learned about the association. From the "K3" dossier. The enterprise was established in 1941 on the basis of aircraft plants evacuated from Moscow and the Moscow region. In a few months the workers had to master standard production of the Tu-2 dive bomber. Over the course of 2 1/2 years 3405 Tu-2, Yak-7 and Yak-9 military aircraft were constructed. During the postwar period the production of the Il-28 jet bomber was organized and 758 aircraft were produced. The association also has priority in producing the world's first jet passenger aircraft, the Tu-104, of which 58 were constructed. Beginning in the 1960's, under conditions of the strictest secrecy, Polet workers made "items" for use in space. It has to its credit more than forty international cooperation programs within the framework of the Intercosmos and COSPAS-SARSAT organizations. The two-stage Cosmos liquid-fuel booster, still constructed at the association, has put hundreds of Russian and international satellites into orbit. The Polet Association also has priority in constructing Energiya assemblies and engines. The twenty thousand workers of the NPO Polet, like the entire country, are now experiencing tough times. The enterprise has found itself in a very tight "vice" as a result of conversion, which was not fully thought through, the collapse of economic relationships among the former union republics and a shortage of financial resources. But here they not only do not complain of difficulties and problems, but also are searching for ways out of the crisis. The most important thing, in the opinion of the leadership of the association, headed by Valentin Zaytsev, its general director, is to preserve the scientific production potential of the Polet aerospace corporation and its unique production. The association is breaking its way through to the world aerospace market and is concluding contracts with many foreign organizations. In order to maintain a high production level, to conserve the skeleton of the design bureau and the entire work force, it was necessary, to be sure, also to engage in the organization of "incidental" production: automatic lines for the food and petroleum industry, machine building, medical equipment and instruments, washing machines and other household appliances. To be sure, not everything has withstood the hard times. Some of the people for different reasons have left the work force. But most of the people have remained. Over the course of 50 or more years of its existence entire generations have grown up and a definite structure of social arrangements and amenities has taken shape. In short, although it is now difficult for many, one must go on. After all, the hearts of these people are attached to the Polet Association; many have passed their entire life here. The people believe that the Polet Association has a future.
