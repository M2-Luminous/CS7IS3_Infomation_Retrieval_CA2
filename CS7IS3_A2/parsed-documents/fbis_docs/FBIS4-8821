In the framework of these bilateral meetings, Slovak President Kovac told Arpad Goncz that Bratislava wished to solve the problem of family names, among other things. Arpad Goncz expressed his opinions about the results and lessons of the Litomysl meeting in an interview to NEPSZABADSAG. [Farkas] Mr Goncz! Many international forums offer themselves to exchange of views today. What justifies the Litomysl-type meetings? [Goncz] I think that this type of meeting, like a typical discussion forum, has its own role to play. In our region and, the way I see it, all over Europe, the function of state president is beginning to shift into some kind of a moral role, and such a meeting capable of clarifying many issues is important precisely in this respect. I would say that the presidents carry and express the values and opinions of their people. For example, we experienced a surprising agreement on evaluating the role of regionalism, and I can say the same thing about the borders. There are people who talked about Maastricht-type borders and others preferred the creation of connecting borders. These two things practically mean the same thing, namely to stop the separating role of the borders. [Farkas] In addition to the presidents' moral role, has the spiritual weight described by President Havel also been asserted in the meeting? [Goncz] There are no two identical countries in Europe, but the regions can, nevertheless, be clearly discernible. Although it is more difficult to precisely delineate Hungary's Western borders, but it is easier to find its Eastern border: It lies somewhere along the line of the Orthodox religion. It is characteristic of Central Europe that the seeds of the system of Western institutions can be found in every country, and the characters of these societies also resemble the others. Our experiences, that are simultaneously related to the West and the East, are connecting us. We can say that, even if not in the actual sense of the word, spiritually we understand each other's language. [Farkas] If this is the case, for how longer do we have to convince the other half of Europe that we belong there? [Goncz] This does not depend entirely on us. The West puts forward a system of requirements that are partly political and partly economic. Regarding the latter, it is possible that, at a given moment, they may change this into a secondary requirement if their interests dictate this. Economic interests and interdependence can best be expressed by the principle of markets for markets. If we get a market there, in exchange we can offer them the Central European market that is still open and is in their immediate vicinity. When modernization starts here and we also find markets for these products, our import ability will also increase, and problems and tensions in this part of Europe can decrease along with the increase in the mobility of products. This requires long-term planning but, in times of recession, private economy is engaged in providing day-to-day answers for the time being. The way I see it, there is always full agreement at the top, but daily interests are increasingly emerging the more we get to the bottom. Therefore, it would be important for this way of thinking to seep through from the top and reach some kind of general level; in other words, everyone should accept the necessary and unavoidable steps. This can be achieved through slow and careful work, but also with a change in international circumstances that might make it necessary for the Central European countries to join the Western structures overnight. [Farkas] The German president, who celebrated his 74th birthday at the meeting and will soon step down from his position he filled for 10 years, received the most attention among the seven presidents present in Litomysl. How did you decide on your common present given to the German president, namely a map of Europe with borders that have been not valid for a long time? [Goncz] I only learned about the decision to give this present before my departure, and I found this idea very ingenious. The idea obviously originated from Vaclav Havel, who is known for the well-chosen symbolic means to give quite firm signals. Weizsacker was very moved to be celebrated by us, but no one questions the prestige gained in his long activity, a prestige with which he became a sort of "father figure" and a model figure as president in our region. [Farkas] Has some kind of "Litomysl spirit" emerged in the meeting that was clearly held in a good mood, a spirit that can be remembered and used in the future? [Goncz] We can call it that way if this covers the fact that seven presidents discuss things together and understand each other in friendship, but we better call this a Central European spirit. The whole meeting had some kind of signal value: The seven presidents here focused on regionalism. There were people among us who represented a member of the European Union, like Germany, and countries that have reached the threshold of the European Union, like Austria; several countries have associate membership in the European Union; Slovenia has not yet reached that point, but it definitely belongs there. The idea of broadening the circle of members also emerged, because this is not a closed format, just like Central Europe itself, something that everyone knows what it is but no one can really define. [Farkas] On the first day of the meeting, you announced that you invited your fellow presidents to a similar discussion in Hungary next year. Have a concrete place and time of the new meeting been already set? [Goncz] There is still no answer regarding the place; as for the time, I can only say that it will be held sometime between the end of May and the end of June. I hope that we will also be able to have a similar exchange of views there, just like in Litomysl now, a place where we sought understanding, not agreements, while we were talking about a lot of things. This was the essence of this whole meeting: Our subjects of discussions should not be limited, no protocol should be prepared about them, but we should clarify for ourselves and for each other what would be good for all of us and what we presidents can do to promote all this.
