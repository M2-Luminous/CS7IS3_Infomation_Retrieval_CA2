FR941017-1-00003 FR941017-1-00001 I. Background The present regulation regarding reactor site criteria (10 CFR part 100) was promulgated April 12, 1962 (27 FR 3509). NRC staff guidance on exclusion area and low population zone sizes as well as population density was issued in Regulatory Guide 4.7, ``General Site Suitability Criteria for Nuclear Power Stations,'' published for comment in September 1974. Revision 1 to this guide was issued in November 1975. On June 1, 1976, the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) filed a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;100&hyph;2) requesting that the NRC incorporate minimum exclusion area and low population zone distances and population density limits into the regulations. On April 28, 1977, Free Environment, Inc. et al., filed a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;50&hyph;20). The remaining issue of this petition requests that the central Iowa nuclear project and other reactors be sited at least 40 miles from major population centers. In August 1978, the Commission directed the NRC staff to develop a general policy statement on nuclear power reactor siting. The ``Report of the Siting Policy Task Force'' (NUREG&hyph;0625) was issued in August 1979 and provided recommendations regarding siting of future nuclear power reactors. In the 1980 Authorization Act for the NRC, the Congress directed the NRC to decouple siting from design and to specify demographic criteria for siting. On July 29, 1980 (45 FR 50350), the NRC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) regarding revision of the reactor site criteria, which discussed the recommendations of the Siting Policy Task Force and sought public comments. The proposed rulemaking was deferred by the Commission in December 1981 to await development of a Safety Goal and improved research on accident source terms. On August 4, 1986 (51 FR 23044), the NRC issued its Policy Statement on Safety Goals that stated quantitative health objectives with regard to both prompt and latent cancer fatality risks. On December 14, 1988 (53 FR 50232), the NRC denied PRM&hyph;100&hyph;2 on the basis that it would unnecessarily restrict NRC's regulatory siting policies and would not result in a substantial increase in the overall protection of the public health and safety. Because of possible renewed interest in power reactor siting, the NRC is proceeding with a rulemaking in this area. The Commission proposes to address the remaining issue in PRM&hyph;50&hyph;20 as part of this rulemaking action. Appendix A to 10 CFR part 100, ``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' was originally issued as a proposed regulation on November 25, 1971 (36 FR 22601), published as a final regulation on November 13, 1973 (38 FR 31279), and became effective on December 13, 1973. There have been two amendments to 10 CFR part 100, appendix A. The first amendment, issued November 27, 1973 (38 FR 32575), corrected the final regulation by adding the legend under the diagram. The second amendment resulted from a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;100&hyph;1) requesting that an opinion be issued that would interpret and clarify Appendix A with respect to the determination of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake. A notice of filing of the petition was published on May 14, 1975 (40 FR 20983). The substance of the petitioner's proposal was accepted and published as an immediately effective final regulation on January 10, 1977 (42 FR 2052). The first proposed revision to these regulations was published for public comment on October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47802). The availability of the five draft regulatory guides and the standard review plan section that were developed to provide guidance on meeting the proposed regulations was published on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55601). The comment period for the proposed regulations was extended two times. First, the NRC staff initiated an extension (58 FR 271) from February 17, 1993 to March 24, 1993, to be consistent with the comment period on the draft regulatory guides and standard review plan section. Second, in response to a request from the public, the comment period was extended to June 1, 1993 (58 FR 16377). The proposed regulations published on October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47802) and draft guidance documents cited in the availability notice published on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55601) are withdrawn because of the substantive nature of the changes to be made in response to public comments and are replaced with the second proposed revision of the regulations presented in this document. II. Objectives The objectives of this proposed regulatory action are to_ 1. State basic site criteria for future sites that, based upon experience and importance to risk, have been shown as key to protecting public health and safety; 2. Provide a stable regulatory basis for seismic and geologic siting and applicable earthquake engineering design of future nuclear power plants that will update and clarify regulatory requirements and provide a flexible structure to permit consideration of new technical understandings; and
