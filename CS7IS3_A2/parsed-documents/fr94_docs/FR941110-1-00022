FR941110-1-00022 FR941110-1-00006 New Jersey requires all parties in the gasoline distribution network who are located or do business within a control area, and whose product is eventually sold into the control area for ultimate use, to keep records concerning certain day-to-day activities. New Jersey's regulation requires any terminal or facility that is granted a variance to submit to the NJDEP, on a monthly basis during the applicable averaging period, a report that states the contemporaneous average of the oxygen content of the gasoline transferred to or from that terminal or facility during that month. With respect to the implementation of an averaging program, EPA guidelines also require that CARs commission an annual attest engagement (a report detailing relevant activities), performed by either an internal auditor or independent Certified Public Accountant. Since New Jersey does not provide for the use of oxygenate credits in their averaging program, there is no need for a requirement to conduct a review or audit for averaging purposes. Prohibited Activities EPA's credit program guidelines contain provisions designed to ensure that gasoline that fails to meet the minimum oxygen content requirement is not available for use within a control area. Generally, CARs or blender CARs may not transfer gasoline for use in a control area that contains less than the minimum percentage of oxygen by weight to parties who are not themselves registered as CARs or blender CARs. EPA's guidelines further recommend that records be maintained. New Jersey's program addresses these requirements. Transfer Documents EPA's credit program guidelines specify that transfer documents should include the following information: date of the transfer, name and address of the transferor, name and address of the transferee, the volume of gasoline which is being transferred, the proper identification of the gasoline as oxygenated or nonoxygenated, the location of the gasoline at the time of the transfer, the type of oxygenate, and the oxygen content of the gasoline (for transfers upstream of the control area terminal and for transfers between CARs, include the oxygenate volume of the gasoline). Records are to be kept in a location where they are available for state review. Subchapter 25 requires that facilities and terminals keep such records available, upon request, for review by the NJDEP. Subchapter 25 includes requirements related to transfer documentation in its regulation. These transfer document requirements will enhance the enforcement of the oxygenated gasoline regulation by providing a paper trail for each gasoline sample taken by State enforcement personnel. Enforcement and Penalty Schedules State oxygenated gasoline regulations must be enforceable by the state oversight agency. EPA recommends that states visit at least 20% of the regulated parties during a given control period. Inspections should consist of product sampling and record review. In addition, EPA guidelines recommend that each state should devise a comprehensive penalty schedule. Penalties should reflect the severity of a party's violation, the compliance history of the party, as well as the potential environmental harm associated with the violation. New Jersey's regulation contains a comprehensive penalty schedule in accordance with EPA guidance. New Jersey, in addition to having authority to assess a civil administrative penalty, reserves its authority to revoke a violator's operating certificate or variance.
