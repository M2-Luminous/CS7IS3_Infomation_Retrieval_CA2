My government has strived to comply to the letter with the 1977 treaties; this is why the creation of the Interoceanic Region Authority reflects our concern to design and establish an efficient system leading to the best use of the reverted and soon to be reverted areas. Moreover, we have begun to adopt the necessary steps to ensure that the administration of the canal, of which we will formally and completely assume control by the end of the century, will continue to operate with the same degree of reliability that it has had during its entire existence. Today's ceremony is nothing more than an irrefutable and palpable demonstration of the United States' willingness to also fully comply with the commitments acquired under the canal treaties. We have gathered here to witness a very important and historic event. After 32 years in Panamanian territory, the 193d Infantry Brigade will be leaving our homeland. It is the last combat infantry unit that will be leaving Panama. Memories of missions accomplished and friendships cultivated will remain. With the permission of the translator, I will briefly refer to one of the missions accomplished by one of the battalions of the brigade. In three days, on 6 June, we will be marking the 50th anniversary of the allied invasion of Normandy, which marked the beginning of the end of Nazi tyranny in Europe. This brigade's Paratroopers Battalion had the great honor--and we have the great honor of being here with it today--of participating as one of the first teams that entered territory occupied by the Nazis before the invasion per se. With great pride of being here with heroes to whom we owe freedom the world over, I give you a special salute on this day when you are leaving our homeland. There are new horizons in the future for those who will be leaving and for those of us who will remain. I am certain members of this brigade and members of the Armed Forces who will follow them through 1999 will find new challenges and new paths to serve their country. This is why our words of farewell contain a goodbye full of the best wishes for the men of arms who are leaving today. The citizens of this country, who will now gradually assume possession of high-value property, have a very serious challenge ahead. Our main goal is to ensure the entire canal area will become a center that will attract activities that will produce benefits for the rest of the country. In this manner, the wealth generated by this area will be spread throughout the Republic, especially to the benefit of the poorest and most needy segments of the population. I am pleased my government has established the bases to ensure the materialization of this distribution of justice in our country. Future generations of Panamanians will enjoy the benefits of so many meritorious plans we are implementing. They must recall that all of this is possible thanks to a clear and friendly policy of full compliance with the 1977 treaties between our two countries. Today's ceremony is evidence of this policy. To those who leave Panamanian soil today, I say: Goodbye, may God be with you. I hope you always remember with warmth the experience in our homeland. [applause]
