The SACP and the ANC are now locked together as a single entity for the full duration of the next term of parliament. ANC denials that the SACP is playing an important role in the ANC and will continue to do so, do not take this reality into account. According to National Party information, the following people amongst the first 50 on the candidates list, have been members of the SACP until recently: Joe Slovo; John Nkadimeng; Essop Pahad; Jay Naidoo; Raymond Suttner; Ahmed Kathrada; Tito Mboweni; Ronnie Kasrils; Thenjiwe Mthintso; Sydney Mufamadi; Blade Nzimande; Thozamile Botha; Aziz Pahad; Steve Tshwete; Penuell Maduna; Jeff Hadebe; Billy Nair; Dullah Omar; Philip Dexter; Moses Mayekiso; Alfed Nzo; Chris Dlamini; Alec Erin; Gertrude Shope; Gill Marcus; Mohammed Valli Moosa; Peter Mokaba Apart from these names there are six more possibilities. The SACP is now desparately attempting to conceal the facts. For example the statement that Mr Ahmed Kathrada's membership has expired years ago is simply not true. On 7 January - just over two weeks ago - Mr Essop Pahad SACP NEC [National Executive Committee] member stated openly (CITIZEN 7 January 1994) that Mr Kathrada is still a member of the SACP. It is quite clear that the ANC is now embarking on a strategy to conceal the full extent of their influence in the ANC and on the ANC's candidates list.
