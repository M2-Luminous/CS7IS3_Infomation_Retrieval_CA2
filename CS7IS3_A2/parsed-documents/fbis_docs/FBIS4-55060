The enthusiasm for peace created after the Washington and the Zagreb Agreements -- coordinated by the military and political regimes from Belgrade, Pale, and Knin -- were signed, has not only slowed down, but has almost come to a halt. Exactly those negative things have happened that were foreseen by the initiators of this peace process -- the U.S. and the Russian representatives. In spite of certain problems, the first stage of the Zagreb Agreement has materialized in Eastern Croatia since an agreement on the demarcation line in this sector was signed. On behalf of "the two sides" the agreement was signed by Major General Djuro Decak, the commander of the Osijek region, and Major General Dusan Loncar, the commander of the Slavonija-Baranja Corps of the Krajina army. On behalf of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] it was signed by Brigadier General van Dyck, the UN commander of Sector East. The demarcation line, around 410 km long and between several hundred and 2 km wide, was defined in detail by this agreement. This flexible width of the so-called buffer zone was reached after numerous specific requirements of both sides had been fulfilled. If both sides had insisted on the 2 km width, which was foreseen by the Zagreb Agreement on buffer zones, the demarcation zone would have included parts of many urban areas on both sides. In that case, the Krajinans would have lost parts of the occupied Baranja village of Bilje, parts of Tenja near Osijek, as well as of parts of Mirkovci near Vinkovci. The Croatian side would have lost certain suburban Osijek areas, parts of important roads and manufacturing facilities, and a part of the town of Osijek. In order to avoid such illogical situations, it was decided that the demarcation line be flexible. Unease About Gorazde The agreement concluding the first stage of the Zagreb Agreement was signed after a delay of several days since the events around Gorazde, especially the NATO bombardment of the Serbian positions there, upset the Krajina Serbs. Their reaction was -- at least in Sector East -- relatively tempestuous. A meeting of commissions at the UNPROFOR control point between Nemetin and Sarvas, which had already been agreed upon, was canceled, and, according to unofficial information, the Serbs blocked UN movements throughout the sector that day. Apart from that -- according to the first confirmed, but then denied statements by UN soldiers -- the Serbs took weapons already put away between Tenja, Mirkovci and Baranja. Since the local UNPROFOR denied the allegations of the Zagreb UNPROFOR, and since the Croatian Army representatives did not openly respond to the reported "exhibition" of Serbian weapons, nothing serious occurred. Even if something had happened, the weapons had already been returned to the warehouses. This does not mean that something more serious cannot happen. Since the "Krajinan state" is very narrow in eastern Croatia, the Serbs were enabled by the Zagreb Agreement to store heavy weapons in Beli Manastir, Dalj, and Vukovar (something similar was made possible for the Croatian Army in Starigrad, Zadar, and Sibenik). We must not forget that not so long ago similar experiences with storing of weapons behind double locks proved to be extremely negative in this area. UN soldiers are now having the same experience in Sarajevo. What does it mean for security if, for example, a tank at full combat readiness is under a simple lock in a warehouse guarded by several frightened UN soldiers? Nothing! Just as if you had left your suitcase at the railroad station left luggage office for when you needed it. The only difference between checking in a tank and a suitcase is that you have to pay to reclaim it at the railroad station. Bad Storage of Weapons The proper storage of heavy weapons under UN control would include a completely different procedure, which has, unfortunately, never been applied in the former Yugoslavia. Fuel and lubricants, for example, have to be drained out of a tank and put into storage. After that, the communications system should be removed and stored in some other place together with ammunition, if possible far from the central warehouse. When the owner of the tank stored in this way wants to take it by force, he needs at least two or three days to get it ready for combat. At the same time, the other side, which should be granted security by this kind of storage, has enough time to see what the enemy is up to. Such an example of heavy weapons storage is nothing new or unknown. On the contrary, this system has already been applied in some earlier UN peacekeeping operations in other crisis areas. A great many things, which in other crisis areas ended with peace, have not been successful in the former Yugoslavia. Therefore we should be pleased with the agreement reached in eastern Slavonia since even such a situation was inconceivable some time ago. Especially significant is the cooperativeness of the Serbian negotiators, who are ready to grant certain concessions to the Croatian side, although they always expect something in return. Generally speaking, life is easier in eastern Slavonia now. Commenting on the new situation, Milan Martic, the "president of the republic of Serbian Krajina," told journalists during his visit to Baranja that he wished the peace process to continue, especially those parts of it which concern economic issues. As usual, the Serbian side imposed new conditions. The first was that the negotiations should not be held at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. Martic's Blackmail "Negotiations on the establishment of economic relations with the Croatian side can be held at any Russian embassy in the world, except for those in Croatia and Germany," Martic said, and added another condition. "We can negotiate with Croats only as equal partners, as two equal states. In order to meet this condition, the UN Security Council has to lift the sanctions imposed on the "Krajinans" according to Resolution 820. If normal communications with Hungary and Slovenia are not made possible, we cannot negotiate on the second stage," Martic stated decisively. It does not matter whether the Krajina leadership is serious or whether they are only dragging out the peace process since the result is, at least for the near future, the same. The events in Bosnia-Herzegovina support them since they have "objective" reasons for stalling for time. The Key Is Bosanska Posavina Apart from all this, further negotiations between Croatia and the "Krajinans," especially in this part of Croatia, can be seriously affected by new activities by the Bosnian Serbs in Bosanska Posavina. The aim of the latest military movements of the Bosnian Serbs in this area is perfectly clear: the enlargement of the "life corridor" to a width which will guarantee them free passage between Banja Luka and Belgrade and beyond to Knin. The present corridor is too narrow for the Serbs. It can easily be closed by the coordinated action of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] from the northern part of the corridor (the unoccupied area around Orasje) and of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the southern part (from the direction of Gradacac or Tuzla). During his recent visit to the occupied Bosanski Samac and Brcko, where the Serbs celebrated the second anniversary of "liberation," General Manojlo Milovanovic openly threatened Croatia with attacks against targets in Croatian territory. Without any scruples he stated that he could bring 20,000 soldiers to Bosanska Posavina to widen the corridor. In other words he warned the Croats against attacking the northern corridor line as long as they are widening the corridor toward the south. As soon as the Gorazde action is completed, the Bosnian Serbs will have a large number of soldiers at their disposal who can be deployed in Bosanska Posavina. After the massacre in Gorazde it cannot be expected that the Serbs can be scared by international community threats, especially if they remain at the present level.
