FR941005-0-00022 FR941005-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management 43 CFR Public Land Order 7091 [NM&hyph;920&hyph;4210&hyph;06; NMNM 010206] Revocation of Public Land Order No. 964; New Mexico AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Public Land Order. SUMMARY: This order revokes a public land order insofar as it affects the remaining 1,442.14 acres of public lands withdrawn for use by the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Department of Energy). The lands are no longer needed for energy purposes. The revocation is needed to permit disposal of the land to the Navajo Nation through land exchange. The lands are within an overlapping withdrawal and thus remain closed to surface entry, mining, and mineral leasing, but remain open to exchange under the Act of March 3, 1921. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeanette Espinosa, BLM New Mexico State Office, P.O. Box 27115, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87502, 505&hyph;438&hyph;7597. By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988), it is ordered as follows: 1. Public Land Order No. 964, as amended, which withdrew public lands for use by the Atomic Energy Commission, is hereby revoked insofar as it affects the remaining lands described as follows: New Mexico Principal Meridian T. 13 N., R. 11 W., Sec. 3, lots 1 and 2, S1/2NE1/4, and S1/2; Sec. 11; Sec. 13, SE1/4 and S1/2N1/2. The areas described aggregate 1,442.14 acres in McKinley County. 2. The lands described in paragraph 1 are within an overlapping withdrawal, Public Land Order No. 2198, which withdrew lands to permit disposal of the lands to the Navajo Nation through land exchange, and thus remain withdrawn from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws, but remain open to exchange under the Act of March 3, 1921. Dated: September 26, 1994. Bob Armstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24669 Filed 10&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;FB&hyph;M
