Janis Platais, Finance Ministry Secretary for the Budget, announced in a press conference that the government will be unable to finance investment projects in the winter period which will be delayed to a later period. Similarly, steps are being taken to limit specific expenditures by government agencies. These include the acquisition of equipment and major repairs, if there is no extraordinary need at this time. The Budget Secretary also indicated that social welfare payments to families with children are also under review with the expectation that such payments will in the future be limited to deprived classes only. Financial Stability for Local Government J. Platais indicated that the Budget is very tight due to the social needs and necessary financing required of government organizations. The Budget authorizes receipts of 556.7 Ls and expenditures of 593.4 million Ls. Each month the Budget must receive 46.4 million Ls. The Government views that the work payment system will have to be reformed for the so-called force structures: police, army, militia and security forces. The Government is also reviewing, jointly with the trade unions, the potential to increase the minimum wage to 25 or perhaps 28 Ls per month. Also under review is the possibility of enabling savings made by government agencies against budget authorizations to be spent in the following year. Uldis Osis, Finance Minister, announced that the Ministry is actively working on legislative proposals in the following areas: the Budget, the management of government finances, regulation of State and Local government relations to ensure necessary financial stability and oversight several years in the future. Already starting with this year macroeconomic forecast and clearly defined budgetary objectives were taken into account to develop the overall contours of the budget for the next 3-4 years. Uldis Osis characterized this whole process as a "radical reform of the budgeting system." Last Year's Deficit -- 2 Million Ls According to the Finance Ministry information provided by J. Platais, the actual budget deficit of about 2 million Ls was less than the forecast budget deficit of 30.2 million Ls. It will be possible to tell the precise State budget deficit by the end of February based upon more precise figures for receipts and disbursements. According to the operating information government receipts last year were approximately 410,354 Ls and disbursements were approximately 412.5 million Ls. Social Welfare Taxes Were the Largest Category of Receipts The largest category of receipts in the previous year were from social welfare taxes -- about 144 million Lats, although less was received than earlier forecast. Income taxes also made a significant contribution to government receipts accounting for about 87 million Ls. The value-added tax was also a significant factor. Income tax receipts exceeded the forecast amount by 11%. Although the budget deficit was reduced from the forecast level of 30.2 million Ls to about 2 million Ls by reducing expenditures from the plan, but also by less internal government borrowing and by repayment of loans, and also by the formation of the Department of Revenue which has helped to increase tax and fee receipts.
