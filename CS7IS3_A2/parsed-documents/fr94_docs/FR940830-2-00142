FR940830-2-00142 FR940830-2-00058 Drug Enforcement Administration Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D.; Revocation of Registration On July 1, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., of Roslyn, New York, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration, AL0713417, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), (4), and (5), and deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Lehrman was no longer authorized by state law to handle controlled substances, that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, and that he had been excluded from participation in a program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a). The Order to Show Cause was sent by registered mail and delivered to Dr. Lehrman on July 9, 1994, at his registered location in Roslyn, New York. No response was received from Dr. Lehrman or anyone purporting to represent him. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Lehrman has waived his opportunity for a hearing. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter, and enters his final order under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.57. The Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Lehrman was convicted in the New York State Supreme Court in New York County of grand larceny in the second degree, conspiracy in the fourth degree, and offering a false instrument for filing on sixteen occasions. These convictions involved billing for services to the Medicaid program, which services also included improper prescribing of the Schedule IV controlled substance Valium. On October 20, 1992, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) excluded Dr. Lehrman from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs for a period of twenty five years. This exclusion was mandatory under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a) and was due to his conviction of a criminal offense related to the delivery of care under the Medicaid program. On April 9, 1993, the New York Department of Health, Board for Professional Medical Conduct, issued an order revoking Dr. Lehrman's medical license. The Administrator has consistently held that termination of a registrant's state authority to handle controlled substances requires that DEA revoke the registrant's DEA Certificate of Registration. See Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1987); Lawrence R. Alexander, M.D., 57 FR 22256 (1992). Dr. Lehrman is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances under the laws of the state in which he is registered with DEA. In light of this, the Deputy Administrator concludes that it is not necessary to address the other grounds, including whether Dr. Lehrman's continued registration is consistent with the public interest. Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Lehrman's registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AL0713417, previously issued to Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 30, 1994. Dated: August 24, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21353 Filed 8&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
