Qian said this at a meeting with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Qian said that China, the most populous country in the world, is a big developing country with a vigorous economy, while Russia is a country with a vast territory, rich industrial technology and natural resources. He said that it is important for China and Russia, neighbors and both permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations, to strengthen mutual friendship and cooperation. Kozyrev said that another Sino-Russian summit should take place this year so as to push bilateral relations to a new stage. Just as President Boris Yeltsin stressed during his China visit in December 1992, Kozyrev said, further development of Russian-Chinese ties enjoys priority in Russia's foreign policies and it would not be affected by domestic political changes in Russia. Qian said that China attaches importance to the dialogue and contacts between leaders of the two countries, which he believed were significant to promoting mutual understanding and trust and enhancing the good-neighborly relations between the two sides. Qian expressed his satisfaction over the recent development of the Sino-Russian ties. He noted that high-level contacts between the two sides also maintained momentum and the bilateral economic and trade relations have been further developed. The trade volume between China and Russia hit over seven billion U.S. dollars. Qian said that Yeltsin's China visit in 1992 gave a big push to the development of Sino-Russian ties. Briefing the guests on China's stand of banning nuclear tests and non-use of nuclear arms, Qian said that the provisions concerning the mutual non-use of nuclear weapons in the Sino-Russian joint communique is very important. Kozyrev told Qian about the new theories on national defense of Russia, saying that they are of totally defensive. The Russian foreign minister said that the Russian side is willing to participate in China's construction of large projects, such as the Three Gorges Project. Following the meeting, the two foreign ministers signed two documents: an agreement between the two governments on ports in border areas and a protocol on consultations between the foreign ministries of the two countries.
