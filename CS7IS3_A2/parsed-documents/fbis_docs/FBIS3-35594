Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report to the U.N. Security Council concerning the situation in the two safe havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "Specifically, it has been proposed to open Tuzla airport for humanitarian supplies and replace the Canadian battalion in Srebrenica with a Dutch one. We are currently studying the report very carefully. At first sight, some corrections may have to be made. "However, already now we can say definitely that Russia's position in favour of a balanced and calm resolution of all questions has been reflected in the report. It rules out hasty actions. The main accent has been made on reaching an agreement between the U.N. and the warring factions. "Such approach has already proven successful in Srebrenica. The report expresses the hope that by the end of February the replacement of the Canadian battalion will be successfully completed. As far as Tuzla is concerned, a representative of the U.N. secretary-general in former Yugoslavia will hold talks with the Serbian and Moslem sides next week. We call for constructiveness and believe that the necessary guarantees may be provided to prevent the use of Tuzla airport for delivering military supplies, which is a subject of concern of the Serbian side. "There is no question of delivering any `air strikes' in order to `punish' one of the warring sides in Bosnia," Churkin said.
