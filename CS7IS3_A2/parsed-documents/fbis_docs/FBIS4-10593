I believe that even with all the mistakes and imperfections, we are advancing and that all of us have to mature, but I will never implement a measure that will cause a backward step in this democratic process. I am following this very closely." The possibility of closing Congress was rejected by Wasmosy, who indicated that he would not accept any type of pressure, even if it existed, to close Congress. Asked what "everything in my power" meant, the chief of state indicated that he was referring to his absolute desire to make the democratic process work. "In other words, I am going to give this democratic process everything that I can to consolidate it, and I do not believe the democratic process will be consolidated by closing Congress. That is what I meant," he stressed. Asked whether that desire had limits, he said: "There are no limits." Army Commander Division General Lino Cesar Oviedo indicated that there are no signs in our country of the possibility of a self-coup through the closing of Congress, and he also rejected that he would support any type of attempt to violate the Constitution. "In principle I see no signs of a self-coup. This is all I can say," the military chief said. He added that the military chiefs will obey the decisions of Juan Carlos Wasmosy, commander in chief of the Armed Forces and president of the nation, as long as he rules his government on the basis of the Constitution. "I am going to cooperate with President Wasmosy on the basis of his oath to respect the Constitution and have it respected. In this way I will cooperate because I risked my life for democracy," he stressed when he insisted that he will not support any type of coup d'etat that violates the Constitution. Oviedo also indicated that the project to reduce and modernize the military structure remains firm. "Within the Army there are six fewer generals, and the Paraguayan Armed Forces' budget is located in third place of the lowest budgets in the world," he said. Oviedo stated that the operational costs of our country's Armed Forces are the lowest in the world in relation to the number of its inhabitants. He explained that the clearest indication that there has been a reduction in the Armed Forces is the fact that its budget was cut 27 percent compared with last year's budget.
