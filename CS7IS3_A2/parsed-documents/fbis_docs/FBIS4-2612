"The United States has determined that the Russian offensive biological warfare program inherited from the Soviet Union violated the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) through at least March of 1992," State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said. "We've been engaged in an effort to work with the Russian leadership to ensure complete termination of the illegal program," McCurry said. Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree in April, 1992, to prohibit biological weapons programs. Five months later, Russia, Britain and the U.S. confirmed in a joint statement full compliance with the BWC. McCurry said the status of the Russian biological weapons program, which included production, weaponization and stockpiling, "remains a little unclear" to the U.S. and Washington was engaged with Russia to find out answers to questions like that.
