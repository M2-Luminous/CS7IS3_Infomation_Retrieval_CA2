The Dialogue Committee had come a long way when it resumed its meetings in Aden last Sunday but representatives of the opposition parties felt that there was what they called "procrastination, dithering, and time-wasting" by the Yemeni Socialist Party and the General People's Congress at the meetings held the day before yesterday. The withdrawn parties include the opposition's National Bloc parties, Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, the Patriotic Forces Union, the Ba'th Party, representatives of the "Yemeni Revolution's Fighters," and the September Party representative Brigadier General Ahmad Qarhash. These parties decided to hold a meeting this evening to take a clear and decisive stance on the issues under discussion and on the dialogue itself. Some partisan sources have accused some members of the coalition, whom they declined to name, of using the time factor to foil the dialogue and carry out previous designs. The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the withdrawing parties and figures would announce a resolution to the effect that "there should either be a dialogue aimed at achieving good and tangible results or no dialogue at all, in which case the coalition parties obstructing the dialogue will be held fully responsible."
