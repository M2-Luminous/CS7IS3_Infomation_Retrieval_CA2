At the summit, which took place on the sidelines of President Houphouet-Boigny's funeral, the 13 African countries of the CFA zone deplored the consequences of the devaluation of their currency. No measure was announced after the mini-summit. Nevertheless, before his flight, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was eager to reiterate France's solidarity with the African member countries of the franc zone. Here is an extract of the statement of the French head of government at Yamoussoukro. [Begin Balladur recording] Twenty-six days after the decision of the African countries to devalue the CFA franc, the situation is better than one could foresee. Certainly, there are multiple difficulties here and there, relating for instance to the size of the debt. This is the first category of problems which we discussed. The second category related to the situation of enterprises, be it French enterprises in Africa or African enterprises. We discussed how to help them in their transitional period and it was observed that the development fund already had the necessary means to cope with the situation, at least in the coming months. The third problem discussed is the relations between international institutions and these countries. As you know, the director general of the IMF and the president of the World Bank were invited to come and see me on 6 January. I pointed out to them the major interest of the international institutions in helping the African states if the latter took the decision to devalue. I remember [IMF Director] Mr. Camdessus and [World Bank President] Mr. Preston then made a proposal to me. This undertaking was renewed with these countries when they met in Dakar. Everyone agrees that there are measures that need to be taken at the national level. At any rate, France has decided to spare no trouble or effort. [end recording]
