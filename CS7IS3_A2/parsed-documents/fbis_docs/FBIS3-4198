The Yunnan NPC deputies mainly discussed issues like grasping opportunities; deepening reform; and promoting faster economic growth in the border and ethnic minority areas. Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee and a Yunnan NPC deputy, was interviewed by this reporter in the Yunnan Delegation's Beijing residence yesterday. Pu Chaozhu said: I feel deeply that Premier Li Peng's work report has comprehensively embodied the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. At present we are undergoing a strategic transformation, from a planned economy structure into a socialist market economy structure. In this process, we should implement unswervingly and to the letter a series of reform measures promulgated by the central authorities and should actively carry out all sorts of work in light of Yunnan's actual conditions. Pu Chaozhu noted: Yunnan still implements a unitary ownership system, as well as a unitary industrial structure, which inevitably have impaired the development of the productive forces. In Yunnan's gross national product, the publicly owned economy accounts for 89 percent, and the private and individual economy, 11 percent. The facts have borne out that the more economically and culturally backward a region is, the more unitary is the region's system of ownership. Therefore, Yunnan should take the road of keeping the public ownership system in the dominant position, while at the same time vigorously developing divergent economic factors. In this process, we should make unreserved efforts to emancipate our minds and disentangle ourselves from ideological debates aimed at distinguishing socialism from capitalism. As long as we proceed in this orientation, we certainly will be able to develop the productive forces more expeditiously in a remote and ethnic-minority province like Yunnan. Speaking of industrial readjustment, Pu Chaozhu stressed: Since 1984, Yunnan has made unceasing efforts to push ahead with industrial structural readjustment. After eight to nine years of hard work, we finally have succeeded in building a batch of superior local industries -- including tobacco, sugar, tea, and other industries -- the development of which has helped to raise the province's financial revenue from 1.1 billion yuan in 1983 to 20 billion yuan in 1993. At present, we are undergoing another round of drastic industrial structural shakeup. In view of this situation -- in addition to successfully building infrastructure facilities and developing educational, scientific, and technological undertakings -- we should focus on building in some selected areas a batch of backbone industries capable of generating 10 billion yuan or 5 billion yuan in output each, thereby turning Yunnan's unitary industrial structure into a strong collective industrial structure. In view of the province's conditions and resources, as well as its domestic and overseas market demands, we should continue to develop Yunnan's superior tobacco industry, and to devote greater energy to the machinery and electronics, sugar, nonferrous and precious metal smelting and processing, chemical, iron and steel, building and building materials, forestry, and food and soft drinks industries, as well as tourism, in addition to the development of other industries. In conclusion, Pu Chaozhu stressed: In order to accelerate Yunnan's economic growth, we should press ahead energetically with the reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises; gradually implement and develop a joint-stock system; vigorously develop town and township enterprises; bring about a fundamental revolution in modes of production and operation; and strive to push Yunnan's economic growth onto a new stage over the next seven to 10 years.
