The public questioning by the Chamber of Deputies Constitution Committee of former President Paz Zamora maintained a very high audience during its six-hour broadcast, comparable only to the rating obtained by broadcasts of the soccer matches played by the Bolivian team to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. Paz Zamora left citizens uncertain when he emphatically denied any link by his family, party, or himself to drug trafficking, yet at the same time admitted his personal friendship with drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" Chavarria. The people's discouragement became worse when the high degree of dependency the country has on the United States was reflected in the statements to Congress by former President Paz Zamora. His words ratified similar statements by current President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. Last weekend Sanchez de Lozada revealed something the Bolivian people suspected but did not openly admit: "We have a terrible dependency on the IMF, the U.S. Embassy, and the World Bank, who tell us what to do." Paz Zamora warned that the U.S. cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking may turn into interference. He added that no one had informed him that his "good friend Chavarria" was an alleged drug trafficker and that he, as president, was informed about antinarcotics operations. "Everyone obeys who pays him," Paz Zamora said, adding that the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not only advised but paid as well by the U.S. DEA. The former president's statements seemed to be aimed at rekindling the traditional anti-U.S. feelings of the Bolivian people. He also roused a feeling of solidarity with his cause when he stated that he had "pinned the national banner on his chest" to implement "coca diplomacy," which hurt the feelings of the U.S. Government. Paz Zamora and George Bush in 1990 signed a drug enforcement agreement that is still in force that regulates financial and technical cooperation, the DEA's advising of FELCN, and the substitution of coca crops. Coca leaves, which are the raw material for cocaine, have become a point of friction between Bolivia and the United States. This Andean nation recognizes the need to eradicate cocaine but also faces a serious social and economic problem with the destruction of coca crops, which produce a living for about 300,000 peasants.
