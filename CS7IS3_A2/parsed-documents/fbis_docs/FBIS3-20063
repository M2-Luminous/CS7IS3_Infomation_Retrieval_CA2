Francois Mitterrand said: "It suits me." The white paper on defense, which Edouard Balladur made public on 23 February, seems actually to favor cohabitation rather than being visionary. Regarded as committing France's strategic options until 2010, it is careful not to resolve the issues troubling politicians and experts, especially in the nuclear and the military service sectors. As it stands, the choices to be made by the administration that will ensue from the 1995 presidential election have a good chance of being different, Pascal Boniface, the founder and director of the International and Strategic Relations Institute (IRIS), stresses. He teaches at the School of Political Science and heads the third cycle of strategic studies at the Paris-Nord University. He is the author of some 15 books, among them, The Army: A Survey of 300,000 Unappreciated Soldiers, Long Live the Bomb (Edition No. 1), and The International Relations Atlas (Dunod). He is responsible for the publication of The Strategic Year (Dunod). The world in the face of new threats and the defense policy are discussed in this interview. [Pasquier] We expected from the white paper on defense, the first since 1972, a redefinition of France's strategic options. But should we be surprised that the cohabitation has neutralized most of the debates? [Boniface] Such an era does not lend itself well to radical changes in the defense establishment. Already, at the time of the previous cohabitation, between 1986 and 1988, in matters such as the Strategic Defense Initiative or the role of tactical nuclear arms, the views of the president of the republic prevailed each time the government tried to change the system, which is normal since he is the head of the Armed Forces. Today as then, the prime minister--who, by nature, favors cohabitation and is eyeing the presidency--is in the worst position to undermine presidential supremacy. [Pasquier] In that case, was it crucial to wait? [Boniface] In fact, nothing, no political nor legal rule, required that the white paper express a consensus, since it is the product of the government itself. So we have an intellectually acceptable document, but one that will not be memorable until 2010, despite its expressed ambitions, for it's a safe bet that the administration that emerges from the next presidential election will face very different choices. For the time being, they remain hidden. [Pasquier] Do you that the analysis of post-cold war international landscape will remain relevant within the time frame covered by the white paper? [Boniface] On that subject, the white paper has succeeded in its mission, which was to take into consideration the disappearance of the former Soviet enemy and the diversity of the new threats. The appearance of regional conflicts, such as the one caused by the breakup of Yugoslavia, as well as terrorism, drug traffic, and financial flows; all these issues will remain topical beyond 1995. Undoubtedly what will take longer to become outdated will be an organized system of crisis scenarios or possible risks. Be that as it may, in the matter of defense, plans are made 20 or 25 years ahead, whereas it is difficult to foresee international developments beyond five or at the most 10 years. [Pasquier] What is the best suitable response to the new conflicts? [Boniface] Conventional means, undoubtedly, and the white paper recognizes this. As part of peacekeeping operations and in order to restore stability, there will actually be a greater need for this type of force, capable of being deployed rapidly and far. This means that the portion of the budget relating to conventional forces must increase. However, the nuclear sector remains the ultimate defense guarantee with regard to French territory and its vital interests. In my opinion, it is rightly so. France's objective interest is to be a nuclear country. [Pasquier] For what reason? [Boniface] It has a sanctuary to preserve, unlike the United States. It is the only superpower in the world now, and no state would risk attacking its territory. The conventional arsenal at its disposal protects it from any serious threat. As far as that goes, it believes that the nuclear sector could become a handicap instead of remaining a trump card. It would hinder, for example, its possible desire to intervene in Iraq or North Korea. Furthermore, it is not out of the question that, someday, the United States might demand total nuclear disarmament. As for France, it is much more vulnerable. It must own the means to discourage any adversary from attacking it. Deterrence is therefore extended without changes. [Pasquier] It may surprise us that the white paper does not settle the debate over the nuclear units. Should two of them be favored, the submarine and airborne forces, and the Albion plateau base shut down, as advocated by some? [Boniface] The parties facing one another at least agree on the submarine unit. Discreet, efficient, and indestructible, it is truly the "pinnacle of deterrence." The M-5 missile program, launched in 1992, will equip the nuclear submarines of the new generation around 2005. The problem is that the development of a land version intended for the Albion plateau base will then be considered, with the president of the republic very much in favor of the project. Opponents of the project call the M-5 an error in all aspects, including budgetary, and they are demanding the modernization of the airborne unit, that is to say the long range air-to-surface missile (ASLP) that France must now assume on its own since Great Britain withdrew. The goal of some of the supporters of this option is the development of weapons with either a miniature load or one with modular capability, allowing more precise fire and a greater flexibility. [Pasquier] Using what argument? [Boniface] They see an outdated deterrence by the weak of the strong remaining powerless in the face of eventual opponents having at their disposal unsophisticated and limited arsenals. The ASLP missile as such is not synonymous with a surgical strike. It all depends on the nuclear head with which it is fitted. Let us specify, moreover, that some day the plane-missile combination could be deployed in our allies' airports. It is therefore the foremost European weapon. But the danger, to be avoided at all costs, would be to give in to the temptation of opening a Pandora's box, that is to say, to use these nuclear weapons as conventional ones. It is true that the white paper expresses no opinion on the subject. It reasserts the two requirements of deterrence: On the one hand, a strategic strike which causes damages beyond repair; on the other, an "ultimate warning" strike to force the opponent to stop. It is obvious that both the president of the republic and the prime minister oppose this doctrinal shift which would lead to the lowering of the nuclear threshold and therefore to the risk of escalation. France undoubtedly needs arms of extreme precision, but conventional. [Pasquier] Is this "flexible" nuclear alternative a recent development? [Boniface] Are you kidding! It is as old as the atomic weapons themselves. At the beginning, the military imagined it as a device more powerful than the others, causing more decisive damage, at less cost, and requiring fewer air raids and smaller payloads. Two concepts have always existed in oppostion to one another: one political, the need to prevent war; the other, operational, the need to win it. Deterrence "by the strong of the insane" is only the last misleading version of an old scarecrow. [Pasquier] How are the two camps divided, between the Right and the Left? [Boniface] There are not, on the one side, Socialists who would put on the old boots of Gaullism and, on the other, Gaullists who would no longer have hang-ups with regard to the use of nuclear weapons. It is all the politicians, as well as the experts, who are divided. It would be dangerous to consent to such a drift, for it would surely prevent us from building a European deterrence--a prospect opened by the white paper. [Pasquier] Why? [Boniface] This nuclear doctrine is related to the Schlesinger doctrine of selective reprisals, adopted by the United States in 1979. As it is, our nonnuclear European partners have rejected it vigorously. They are not now going to adopt a French version offering the same type of reasoning, whereby they accept nuclear deterrence and would be ready, some day, to follow us on this path. [Pasquier] But first the members of the European Union should "define common interests..." [Boniface] Right. It is a way of saying that such is not yet the case. This preliminary view can therefore pass for an official negative acknowledgement or, at least, a waiting position. But the white paper stresses that, in the future, deterrence will have to be considered in a European context, which assumes negotiations. Only one organization lends itself to it, the West European Union (WEU), and not NATO, which includes non-European members. As it stands, there are currently bilateral talks on this subject between the two nuclear countries, France and Great Britain, as well as Franco-German consultations. But we are still far from a real multilateral discussion--which is a must, for a true European deterrence does not mean the extension of the French and British guarantee to the other European countries, but a joint nuclear program formulated by the partners as a whole. [Pasquier] Are we on the way to an indefinite ban on nuclear testing? [Boniface] Via the white paper, France is even considering the formulation of a treaty for an all-out test ban, on the condition that it be universal and verifiable. Duly noted. [Pasquier] You must admit that, straight away, the "universal" feature curtails ambition. [Boniface] To be sure, this softer stand provides an out. But some proliferating countries would undoubtedly accept to sign such a treaty, for they have little need for tests in order to develop an unsophisticated bomb. This would not hinder the pursuit of their nuclear program. Moreover, let us not forget that the nonproliferation treaty is to be renewed in 1995: If the nuclear countries were to give no guarantees, the countries without bombs would feel cheated. As it stands, they are very attached to the test ban. The link with nonproliferation is not technical, but indeed political. If France values its deterrence, giving up secondary features in order to protect essential ones is a better plan. [Pasquier] The moratorium had already unleashed bitter controversies on the Right. What then? [Boniface] I noticed that the president of the republic and the prime minister have a common position on the issue--different from that of Jacques Chirac. Roger Baleras, the director of military applications of the Atomic Energy Commission, believes that it would take another eight to 20 tests before France can dispense with them, figures picked up by the majority as a whole. The battle will be fought over this issue, perhaps before the presidential election. [Pasquier] Are the unavoidable budget restrictions already burdening strategic requirements? [Boniface] Everywhere, equipment orders are being revised downward, which does little to remedy the crisis in the arms industries. Let us be clear: If we want to have a European defense in the future, we must maintain proficiency at all costs. It is very difficult to gather highly skilled technological teams. When we let them go, there is no certainty that they can be regrouped at a future date. Military expenses on the other side of the Atlantic amounted to 7 percent of the GNP in 1985; they will soon go to 4.5 percent. However, the relative share of development expenses hardly dropped. In order to protect skills, there even are cases when a weapon will be developed in small quantities or not at all, a less expensive approach than persisting in manufacturing expensive and already obsolete weapons. [Pasquier] Are you referring to the Leclerc tank? [Boniface] You are the one mentioning it. When a country becomes dependent on foreign suppliers, everything goes well as long as relations are good. But when we are refused access to some technologies, or when the bill becomes too high, on that day, we find ourselves stripped of everything. [Pasquier] Does France still the means to produce its equipment? [Boniface] Obviously, the Leclerc and the Rafale are respectively the last French tank and combat plane. The conquest of foreign markets will, alone, make it possible to bear the financial cost of these programs. The successor of the Rafale will have to be a European plane, given the lack of alternatives. The manufacturers have understood the situation so well that they have forged ahead of the politicians by setting up a system of cooperation, already European, paper, it specifies that, at the European level, there must be no industrial stalement with regard to major programs. [Pasquier] Are we as concerned about Europe when it comes to the military service? [Boniface] In fact, without much risk of being wrong, we can predict that n fact, without much risk of being wrong, we can predict that the next French exception will be that of the draft. Our partners, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, are either canceling it or, like Spain and Italy, challenging it or, sometimes, even ignoring it, as is the case in Great Britain. If France remains the only one to maintain the principle, it could pose a problem in the context of an integrated defense policy. Supporters and opponents of military service can be found in in all the parties but the PCF [French Communist Party]. Be that as it may, the white paper, on a very specific point, has stopped defending tradition: It is concerned with finally giving the military its say. [Pasquier] But the French generals in Bosnia did not nor are they remaining silent. [Boniface] Because within the United Nations, it is possible to escape from one's national hierarchy. But in France, without exceptions, all of those who tried to speak were sanctioned. We still observe MacMahon's rule: "I remove from the promotion list any officer whose name I have read on the cover of a book." When it comes to the military, a kind of speaking deterrence is practiced. We often regret that soldiers are not sufficiently interested in strategic problems. But they do not even have the right to discuss them! The paradox is that, in this country anybody can express his opinion on defense issues, except the military. The time may have come for the political officials to remedy the democratic deficit prevailing in the barracks. Let them recognize the soldier's civil rights, and not only his right to vote. Let also stop the practice of transferring officers to a different town every three years. The British army, which is not, I believe, the worst in the world, has no need for this constant moving in order to function. [Pasquier] The conflict in Bosnia has brought France nearer to the Atlantic alliance. But does the future of European security pass by the United Nations or the WEU? [Boniface] France can no longer be suspected, as in the past, of wanting to destroy the alliance. On the contrary, it participates fully in the peace keeping missions, as can be noted in the former Yugoslavia. NATO, in its reasoning and its structures, has currently, and in the near future, a vital role in the European security. For all that, the future must not be abused--meaning the WEU which will assert its influence in the medium and long term. If France were to fully rejoin the Atlantic alliance--many are thinking about it, even if few are expressing it--it would bolster the desire of some Central European countries, for example, to join NATO rather than the WEU. As it stands, tomorrow, their security could be subjected to the good will of a reticent U.S. Administration. [Pasquier] Does Russia appears to you as a factor of instability in Europe? [Boniface] There is in fact a Russian problem, and the United States is largely responsible for it. It went from one extreme to the other. Shortly after the Gulf War, it viewed Russia as a blank spot on the map. It is now doing everything to support it. But if Russia no longer has the power to act, it still has the power to harm. For all that, not to the extent of seriously worrying Poland or Hungary, at least I do not think so, despite the clamors of a Zhirinovskiy. The same is not true of the so-called near abroad border countries. Over the past year, Moscow has interfered in Tajikistan, pressured Ukraine and Belarus, brought Georgia back into the Russian fold, and relied on the Armenians and the Azeris. The Westerners are disclaiming any responsibility about this and Russia, in the name of a backhand Monroe Doctrine of sort, is asserting its prerogatives in this area. It is in the process of rebuilding a strategic Soviet Union. Meanwhile, in some regions, above all in Crimea, where citizens of Russian origin are the majority, the possibility of seeing a Yugoslav scenario duplicated by Russia and Ukraine is not to be ruled out. [Pasquier] Does Western helplessness toward the conflict in the former Yugoslavia indicate a difficulty in grasping this type of threat? [Boniface] It is both simpler and more alarming: The politicians realized that utopia was out of place in domestic policy; and that there was no instant remedy to unemployment and the economic crisis. They then transferred utopia to the international theater. Miracle solutions flourished on the soil of foreign conflicts. An operation is launched in Somalia and we make believe that developing problems in Africa will be solved because of it. We demand air strikes against Serbian positions around Sarajevo and we make believe that the different communities of the former Yugoslavia will resume a harmonious cohabitation. Contrary to the analysis whereby leaders govern by overbanking on a televisual emotion, essentially short-lived, we are reduced to jumping out of the frying pan into the fire!
