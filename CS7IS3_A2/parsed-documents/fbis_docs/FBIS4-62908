The step was made in a bid to prepare ground for a revision of the already enacted procedures in places where the government says the reform has meant unrightful transferring of former collective farm property to new owners. The amendments bill now enters the parliament. "This bill is very much needed, as it would provide the government with the possibility to `rewind' the farm reform in some places so that corrections could be made where misprision has been committed during the reform," Laar told reporters. The prime minister said that although the farm reform had been carried out mostly in compliance with the law, in many cases the laws have failed to prevent malpractice. It is impossible to improve this under the current laws, he added. Laar said that the draft legislation approved by the Cabinet today had been corrected for several times after examination by the Justice Ministry. The Cabinet today also discussed a bill on the organization of the farm products market. "The government stated that, generally, such kind of a law is very much needed, but since it fails to properly comply with the rest of the currently valid legislation, it earned no positive assessment," Laar said. The draft was prepared by the parliament's rural affairs commission. The government now ordered the Ministry of Agriculture to draw up a new draft law on the same issues.
