The draft was submitted to the eighth session of the eighth npc standing committee for deliberation today. It provides for a new system under which arbitration and administrative organs shall function separately and arbitration be undertaken on a voluntary basis. The parties in a dispute may seek a settlement either from an arbitration office or a court, but shall not resort to both simultaneously. The ruling passed by the first round of arbitration shall be final. Chairman Gu Rangran of the NPC Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Committee explained that the draft law applies to contract and other economic disputes, not to civil disputes normally handled by administrative organs, such as marriage, inheritance or adoption disputes. Gu added that there will be legislation specially for settling labor disputes, which are different from other types of economic disputes. The existing system calls for submitting an arbitration decision to the higher arbitration authorities or a court for examination before it becomes final. After the draft becomes law, he said, this practice will be abolished. In its place will be a new system under which an arbitration decision is passed either by an arbitration office or by a court. The agreement reached between the parties through the first round of arbitration is final, and the court will reject any lawsuit from any party should disagreements arise on the agreement. The rule applies to arbitration rulings as well. Once such a ruling is passed, appeals for a re-examination by either an arbitration office or a court will be rejected. The principle of voluntary arbitration means that an arbitration agreement shall be reached out of the free will of the parties involved, and that the parties shall negotiate to decide where to have their dispute settled and by what arbitrator. Under the draft law, arbitration offices are independent legal bodies, not affiliated to any administrative organ. Arbitration offices throughout the country shall have the same status. That means there will be no "higher" or "lower" arbitration offices, nor will there be a division of labor between arbitration offices according to the division of administrative regions. Courts do not interfere with the work of the arbitration offices, but exercises a sort of supervision either by refusing to have an arbitration ruling executed or by cancelling the ruling. According to Gu, the drafting of the law began in August 1991.
