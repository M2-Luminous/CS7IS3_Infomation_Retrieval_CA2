FR940927-1-00012 FR940927-1-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;4] Proposed Realignment of G&hyph;8, G&hyph;10, G&hyph;12, R&hyph;99, B&hyph;27, B&hyph;37, V&hyph;308, and V&hyph;328; AK AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This action proposes to extend Colored Federal Airways G&hyph;10 and R&hyph;99 and realign Colored Federal Airway B&hyph;37 as a result of the decommissioning of the Cape Spencer Marine Nondirectional Beacon (NDB); revise the descriptions of G&hyph;8, G&hyph;12, and B&hyph;27 Colored Federal airways; and, as a result of the decommissioning of the Quinhagak, AK, very high frequency omnidirectional range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME), realign Federal Airway V&hyph;328 and remove a segment of V&hyph;308. These actions would enhance navigation and reduce both pilot and air traffic controller workloads. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, Air Traffic Division, AAL&hyph;500, Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;4, Federal Aviation Administration, 222 West 7th Avenue, # 14, Anchorage, AK 99533.

The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to extend Colored Federal Airways G&hyph;10, R&hyph;99, and realign Colored Federal Airway B&hyph;37 as a result of the decommissioning of the Cape Spencer Marine NDB. Colored Federal Airways G&hyph;10 and R&hyph;99 would be extended and would include an extension of G&hyph;10 from Woody Island to Kachemak. King Salmon, AK, NDB was inadvertently used in the descriptions of Colored Federal Airways G&hyph;8 and G&hyph;12, and as a result of this proposal, Saldo, AK, NDB would replace King Salmon, AK, NDB. King Salmon, AK, Locator Outer Marker in the description of B&hyph;27 would be replaced with Saldo, AK, NDB. Finally, as a result of the Quinhagak, AK, VOR/DME being decommissioned, this action would remove that segment of V&hyph;308 between Quinhagak, AK, and Bethel, AK, and would realign V&hyph;328 as a direct route between Dillingham, AK, and Kipnuk, AK. Colored Federal airways are published in paragraphs 6009(a), 6009(b), and 6009(d) respectively, and Alaskan VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(b), of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Colored Federal airways and the Alaskan VOR Federal airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
