Mr. Hoseyni, general manager for foreign nationals in the Interior Ministry, said in an interview with our correspondent that there is no deadline for the repatriation. Mr. Hoseyni said: [Begin recording] [Hoseyni] At the moment 1,800,000 Afghan refugees live in our country. Of those, 540,000 have been given a temporary six-month residential permit. They are refugees who have lived in Iran without any identification documents. The six-month permit has been given to them to enable them to leave the country. In fact, 22 June is the expiration date of the six-month period. This group of Afghan refugees will be leaving the country gradually under the supervision of the United Nation and a representative of the Islamic government of Afghanistan. This has resulted from the agreement reached in the Iran, Afghanistan, and the United Nations tripartite commission. The second group are those refugees who have been living legally in our country for many years. In cooperation with the United Nations, we have planned to repatriate 300,000 of this group this year. The repatriation is totally voluntary, and the refugee can either go back home or stay. We have made plans for 300,000 in the current year. Therefore, if the two plans are carried out in full, we can repatriate 840,000 Afghan refugees by the end of the current year. [Unidentified correspondent] Is there a deadline for the Afghan refugees, especially the first group? [Hoseyni] No deadline exists because the repatriation of 540,000 refugees after 22 June may be carried out over several months. Therefore the Islamic Republic of Iran has not set any deadlines for the repatriation of Afghan refugees. [end recording]
