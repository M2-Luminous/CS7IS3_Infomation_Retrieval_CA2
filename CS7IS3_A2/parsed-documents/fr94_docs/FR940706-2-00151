FR940706-2-00151 FR940706-2-00089 (3) Standard Form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (Attachment 4, if applicable); and (4) Certifications regarding Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (Attachment 5). (i) The HUD review criteria shall include an analysis of any evidence that challenges the validity of the civil rights certification. Such evidence includes: (A) A pending civil rights suit against the PHA, referred by the Department's General Counsel and instituted by the Department of Justice; (B) Outstanding HUD findings of PHA noncompliance with civil rights statutes, regulations and executive orders, as a result of formal administrative proceedings, unless the PHA is implementing a HUD-approved tenant selection and assignment plan and a voluntary compliance agreement designed to correct the areas of noncompliance; (C) A deferral of the processing of applications from the PHA imposed by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3) and the HUD Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1), or under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD implementing regulations (24 CFR 8.57); (D) A pending proceeding against the PHA based upon a Charge of Discrimination issued under the Fair Housing Act. A Charge of discrimination is a Charge under Section 810(g)(2) of the Fair Housing Act, issued by the Department's General Counsel or legally authorized designee. (E) There is an adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual; unless the PHA demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance. (ii) In the event that the validity of a civil rights certification is drawn into question the application is eligible to be funded, but the PHA may not draw down funds until it has satisfied any outstanding civil rights issues. IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications The HUD State or Area Office will screen all applications and notify applicants of technical deficiencies by letter. Since the funds available under this NOFA are not being awarded on a competitive basis, a technical deficiency would be a significant discrepancy in information supplied by the applicant and information available to HUD, or the omission or the incomplete submission of any of the items required to be submitted in the application. These are listed in section III. of this NOFA, Checklist of Application Submission Requirements, above. Applicants must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any technical deficiency. Information received after 3:00 p.m., local time, on the fourteenth calendar day of the correction period will not be accepted and the application will be rejected as being incomplete. V. Other Matters (a) Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with the Department's regulations at 24, CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. (b) Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the provisions of this NOFA do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The NOFA makes funds available for PHAs to employ or otherwise retain the services of up to one service coordinator for a period of up to five years in conjunction with the HOPE for Elderly Independence Program. As such, there are no direct implications on the relationship between the national government and the states or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. (c) Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the policies announced in this Notice would not have a significant impact on the formation, maintenance, and general well-being of families except indirectly to the extent of the social and other benefits expected from this program of assistance. (d) Documentation and Public Access Requirements: HUD Reform Act Public notice. HUD will include recipients that receive assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of recipients of all HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.16(b), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.)
