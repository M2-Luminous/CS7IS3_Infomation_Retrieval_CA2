The place and date are not given. Gaydar begins by reviewing the performance of the economy over the past year, noting that despite the various political problems a number of tasks in the first stage of reform were solved, albeit slowly, by the end of 1993. The volume of subsidies for agricultural production has been sharply reduced of late, and a single customs tariff will be enforced from 1 January. A new system of financing and boosting investments has been prepared, which will comprise the gradual redistribution of budget allocations to support enterprises and social programs as well as family benefits, pension reform, and gradual preparation for introducing benefits for the less well-off sections of the population. Small business will be encouraged. "In short, we are trying to put together a foundation that will ensure stable economic growth," Gaydar notes. He goes on to say that there should be "a gradual reduction in the rate of inflation in 1994 to about 5-7 percent by the end of the year." It will be a year of "a gradual fading away of the slump in production, which may be basically eliminated some time around the end of the fourth quarter, and the creation of preconditions for stable growth in 1995." But, Gaydar says, one must naturally be apprehensive after the political damage incurred in trying to solve anti-inflation tasks in the recent period, and this must be avoided in the coming year. Gaydar goes on to say that unemployment has not risen in the Baltic republics either because a similar set of employment-protection measures is in effect both there and in Russia. "I will, therefore, say that provided there is a sensible scenario of monetary policy, I do not envisage a sudden incredible rise in unemployment -- not in 1994 at least. It will rise gradually." Regarding inflation, Gaydar describes as soft and consistent a policy that aims at bringing inflation down from 12 percent this December to 5-7 percent in the last quarter of 1994, the goal of which is to gradually remove financial disproportions and create prerequisites for stopping price rises.
