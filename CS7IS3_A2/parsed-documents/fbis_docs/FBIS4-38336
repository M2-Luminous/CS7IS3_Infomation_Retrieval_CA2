In his opinion, conclusion of such agreements between the center and the republics "would facilitate strengthening of the truly federative principles of Russia's existence." Moscow and Ufa have signed a package of 10 agreements including those on economic interaction, on division of authorities in the sphere of international relations and foreign economic activity, on interaction in the sphere of education, development of defense branches, crime fighting, etc. Kopsov expressed hope that two agreements on which the parties failed to find mutual understanding, namely on budget relations and on relations between the Central Bank of Russia and National Bank of Bashkortostan, would be also initialled in the near term. In his words, the Bashkirian side insists on a one-channel system of the budget's formation and Russia -- on a tow-channel one. Kopsov also deems it necessary to put in place additional powers for the National Bank of Bashkortostan, in particular regarding fiscal and currency regulation. Kopsov declared that Bashkortostan would like to fix its right to use the gold reserve totalling 250 kilograms of gold which was left in Ufa for storage from the "pre-perestroika" times as collateral for currency credits received by Bashkortostan.
