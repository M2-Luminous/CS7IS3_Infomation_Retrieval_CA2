FBIS4-4680 "dreas065__a94009" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Food Agency Accused of Import Bid Improprieties Food Agency Accused of Import Bid Improprieties OW0304121094 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0304121094 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Regarding the government's procedure of buying imported rice and wheat from trading companies through bids, it has been revealed that the Food Agency director general, who represents the government, has sent written instructions to 28 trading companies every six months informing them before the bidding actually takes place what share each company will receive in the upcoming grain auction. This was discovered by ASAHI SHIMBUN. The actual amount of rice and wheat purchased by the government almost coincides with share noted in the Food Agency's written instructions, which are known as "voices from heaven." According to several sources, major trading companies rig their bidding prices. Because of this, this newspaper became suspicious of the practice in which the Food Agency conspired with certain trading companies over import rights and interests. ASAHI SHIMBUN obtained a letter dated 1 October 1993 which was sent to a trading company. The agency's director general sealed the letter by using his seal, and the letter specified the percentage share that the company was to receive at the wheat auction in the latter half of fiscal year 1993. Moreover, the letter states that "we are notifying you that we have decided on the following." "Voices from heaven" have been sent to trading companies' top executives, including their presidents, twice a year, on 1 April and on 1 October. The Import Department of the Food Agency explains that "the purchase process was not wholly dependent on bidding because the agency was entitled to make decisions on purchase contracts." However, a company which bid the lowest price won the contract. An official of a trading company said it was a "competitive bidding." Although it looked like a competitive bidding, the trading companies decided which company would bid the lowest price on the basis of the percentages determined by the Food Agency. In this regard, a senior Fair Trade Commission official said: "Even if the agency was entitled to make decisions on purchase contracts, it would be bid rigging by the trading companies if what was revealed is true. If the Food Agency director general is sending out such `voices from heaven,' these make competition between trading companies a mere facade." Although annual grain imports amounted to about 200 billion yen in fiscal year 1992, they will increase significantly starting in and after fiscal year 1993 because of emergency rice imports and the partial liberalization of Japan's rice market. Bidding is conducted every Wednesday at the agency for foreign grain expected to be imported in a one-week period two months after the bidding takes place. The agency works with 26 trading companies for wheat imports and 20 for rice imports, and it asks them to submit price quotations. These firms are called "listed importers." However, the agency chooses several companies who submit the lowest bids and places orders with them on a weekly basis. Six months of weekly orders equal the share that the agency ultimately granted each company through the "voices from heaven." It is the job of the 10 leading trading companies--including Mitsui and Co. and the Mitsubishi Corporation--who were given the largest import shares among the listed importers to coordinate weekly shares and tender prices. This practice of coordinating matters started several decades ago. It is said that the weekly bidding prices of low-ranking trading companies are also determined by the 10 leading companies. The Food Agency does not publicly release information on the shares of grain it purchases from each trading company, and previously no changes were made to the shares granted to each company. However, the shares of the top 10 companies have been changing slightly ever since a case in which beef importers rigged their bidding prices was uncovered in 1988. A trading company official explains, "This [changing of shares] is a maneuver designed to conceal the bid riggings."
