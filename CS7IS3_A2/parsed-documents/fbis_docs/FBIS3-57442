Ministry of the Economy Will Once Again Try To Elaborate Selective Structural Policy"] [Text] Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin stated in a news conference yesterday that his department intends to "sum up suggestions on correcting the reforms" that had been hammered out in particular by the working group under First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets; by academicians Abalkin and Petrakov; by Lvov, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences; by Academician Shatalin's "Reforma" fund, and so forth. Mr. Shokhin hopes to sum up these programs by early February, when the ministry's collegium session is planned. Besides, he is hoping that the "designers of formulas for Russia's salvation," for example, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, "will not hide their ideas until the moment they are asked to form their government." Russia's new economy minister, the fifth in two years, stated the need to "combine the line toward macroeconomic stabilization with measures in the field of microeconomy." Mr. Shokhin explained his perception of the premier's comments about the use alongside with "monetarist" measures of "nonmonetarist" measures in controlling the economy. "It is necessary to fill with concrete contents the selective structural policy," he declared. According to the economy minister, the effectiveness of granting preferential credits last year was extremely low, and it is now necessary to design a mechanism to issue them on a selective basis. Besides, the state should pay up the debts to the national industry and agriculture -- "even if to minimize the sum, we should pay in the first quarter at least 3 trillion rubles under our obligations of last year's fourth quarter. This is the most conservative estimate of what we cannot afford not to do," he said, adding that all this "does not contradict the financial policy guidelines." Aleksandr Shokhin rejected the explanation given by Yegor Gaydar for his resignation (Mr. Gaydar referred to the government decisions in January that ran counter to the policy of financial stabilization). "Inflation in January will be immeasurably greater than in December," but, like the growth of the budget deficit, this "is predetermined by the last months of the past year," Mr. Shokhin stated. He explained the desire of a number of politicians to "leave the government" by political expediency. As for the present composition of the cabinet, Mr. Shokhin thought that the composition of the government would not have undergone appreciable changes compared with that of the start of September had Boris Fedorov stayed in the position of finance minister. "Now is a rather hard time for carrying out reforms, but I did not cash in on the opportune moment to leave the government because all the horsepower in here is necessary now," he said. In the meantime, according to Mr. Shokhin, certain political forces are doing "all to discredit the prime minister, equating his actions with a creeping counterrevolution" so as "to try and organize in April-May an all-Russia strike and take power." Touching on the problem of Russia's relations with international financial organizations, Aleksandr Shokhin pointed out in particular that "he would not now speak about who precisely will conduct talks with G-7, the Paris and London creditor's clubs, as well as with the IMF and the World Bank." At the same time, the new economy minister stated that he would insist on jointly resolving all questions pertaining to relations with international financial organizations, and that he thought it necessary to preserve the commission for cooperation with international financial organizations. Answering journalists' questions about the chances of a second line of the system of credit from the IMF for Russia, and the granting of standby credit in 1994, the Russian IMF director doubted if "Russia would be able in the near future to meet the standard set of criteria brought by the Fund's board in deciding on granting it." The economy minister, however, believes it necessary to continue the talks with IMF representatives on these problems. "This is useful at least because thus we can see the situation in Russia's real economy," he stated. During yesterday's press conference, Mr. Shokhin was extremely cautious about chances for the merging of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, saying that such a decision should be preceded by finding a compromise on a closer union of the two countries' economic policies. Mr. Shokhin intimated that he would be in charge of Russia's relations with the CIS subject to approval by the premier.
