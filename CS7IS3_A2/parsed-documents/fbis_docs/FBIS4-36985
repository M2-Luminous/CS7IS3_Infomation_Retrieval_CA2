The prime minister spoke at a news conference in Haifa last night. Sylvia Leaf reports: [Begin recording] [Leaf] Yasir 'Arafat will be allowed to enter Gaza and Jericho whenever he wishes, Prime Minister Rabin told reporters, but he must also assume responsibility over the Palestinian authorities. [Rabin] At this stage, I am focusing to see how the PLO, through the Palestinian Authority, succeed to take over and to control, in accordance to their commitment to us on the DOP [Document of Principles] and the Cairo agreement, to fulfill their parts. Before that, I will not pass any judgment. [Leaf] Regarding a peace agreement with Syria, the prime minister said the Syrians believe that America can influence Israel against her will, and this attitude won't succeed. He stressed that solutions can be found only when agreed upon by both Israel and Syria. The prime minister said the recent closure of the territories to Arab workers has resulted in the employment of a further 25,000 Israelis in the building industry. Justifying his authorization of work permits for 25,000 Palestinians from the territories, Rabin pointed out that in the past year, no terrorist attacks have been carried out in Israel by Palestinians permitted to work here.
