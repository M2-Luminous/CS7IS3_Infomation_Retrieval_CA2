FR940804-0-00004 FR940804-0-00001 Some commenters sought clarification on whether both proposed exceptions were limited to cases where the tying product was offered by a bank, or also included cases where the tying product was offered by a bank holding company or its nonbanking subsidiary. The concern arose because the proposed exceptions were phrased only in terms of banks. The Board notes that the language of section 225.4(d)(1) of Regulation Y would automatically apply the proposed exceptions for banks to bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries, as was intended by the proposed rulemaking. However, the final rule has been amended to make this coverage explicit. Rather than referring to a ``bank'' offering a traditional bank product or a discount on brokerage services, the rule refers to a ``bank holding company or bank or nonbank subsidiary thereof.'' Reorganization of Regulation In a non-substantive change, the Board has restructured the regulation to make it more easily understandable. The regulation has been moved from the section on corporate practices, §225.4, and established as its own section, §225.7. The application of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries is contained in paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) contains exceptions to both section 106 and §225.7(a), and paragraph (c) contains limitations on each of those exceptions. Finally, a definition paragraph, §225.7(d), has been added. In addition, the exception for credit card services previously contained in §225.4(d)(2) has been removed from the regulation, as all transactions previously excepted under that provision are now excepted under the traditional bank product exception in §225.7(b)(1). Also, the phrase ``(but no other products)'' has been deleted in places where it was superfluous. These changes are not substantive. Paperwork Reduction Act No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) are contained in the proposed rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act It is hereby certified that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities that would be subject to the regulation.

A bank holding company and any nonbanking subsidiary conducting an activity authorized under §225.23 may not in any manner extend credit, lease or sell property of any kind, provide any service, or fix or vary the consideration for any of these transactions subject to any condition or requirement that, if imposed by a bank, would constitute an unlawful tie-in arrangement under section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1971, 1972(1)). (b) Exceptions. Subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section, the Board has adopted the following exceptions to the anti-tying restrictions of section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 and paragraph (a) of this section.

A bank holding company or any bank or nonbank subsidiary thereof may vary the consideration charged for a traditional bank product on the condition or requirement that a customer also obtain a traditional bank product from an affiliate. (2) Securities brokerage services. A bank holding company or any bank or nonbank subsidiary thereof may vary the consideration charged for securities brokerage services on the condition or requirement that a customer also obtain a traditional bank product from that bank holding company or bank or nonbank subsidiary, or from any affiliate of such company or subsidiary. (c) Limitations on exceptions. (1) The exceptions of this section shall apply only if all products involved in the tying arrangement are separately available for purchase. (2) Any exception granted pursuant to this section shall terminate upon a finding by the Board that the arrangement is resulting in anticompetitive practices. (d) Definitions.
