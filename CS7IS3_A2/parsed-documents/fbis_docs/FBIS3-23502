Suponko under the rubric "Advice for IAS Specialists": "They Have Their Own Concerns in Summer"] [Text] The servicing of aviation hardware in the summertime has a number of specific features, knowledge of which will help personnel to avert breakdowns in flight in a timely manner. One of the most typical causes of failures is the refueling of an aircraft or helicopter using substandard fuel that contains water. This is usually a consequence of the violation of regulations for its storage in fuel dumps, and a lack of airtight seals on service and holding tanks and airfield fuel lines. The development and testing of the IVT-1 instrument to monitor fuel for the presence of water has currently been completed, and a small lot of them has arrived in VTA [military-transport aviation] units. It would be expedient to employ potassium permanganate in places that do not yet have those instruments; it provides an easily noticeable reaction with water. Rain can bring quite a bit of unpleasantness. The pipes of the central aircraft refueling system were underwater at one airfield after a downpour. The water got into the pipeline through a bad seal and later, with inadequate monitoring of the fuel, into the tanks of aircraft, which led to the failure of several engines in flight. It should be noted that draining the residue from aircraft tanks does not always make it possible to detect substandard fuel in a timely manner; this is because there are areas in the lower portion of the fuel tanks of some types of aircraft that are not in communication with the drain points. They can be formed either by the folds of soft fuel tanks, or by longitudinal and transverse metallic partitions. The undrained fuel residue sometimes reaches several dozen liters. It is thus essential, when instances of the refueling of aircraft with substandard fuel have been ascertained, not only to drain it by the usual methods, but also to extract the residue from the undrained areas. The consequences of operating engines using fuel with water are the extinguishing of the flame in the combustion chamber, disruption of fuel feed owing to clogging of the fine filters with water, and corrosion damage to parts of the fuel-regulating apparatus, leading to its jamming or sticking. The decision on the procedure for the further servicing of an aircraft after refueling with substandard fuel is made after an engineering analysis of its technical condition, with a regard for the requirements of servicing documentation. The contamination of GSM [fuels and lubricants] in the summer is also possible when dust gets into them. The use of a closed refueling system under pressure is thus recommended, under conditions of enhanced dust, for those aircraft whose design provides for it, with measures to protect against dust penetration observed for open refueling. When systems are unsealed (for the replacement of fuel, oil and hydraulic filters, for example), steps that rule out the entry of mechanical impurities into them must also be envisaged. The state of the filter elements is objective evidence of the cleanliness of the operating fluids. The level of their dirtiness is determined by their flow duration using a PKF (filter element monitoring instrument)--the greater the duration, the dirtier the filter element. This check is performed during routine operations before the ultrasound cleaning of the filter elements, as well as after it. If they turn out to be very dirty, it is essential to determine the causes for that in order to endure the failure-free operation of the aircraft in flight. If a lack of airtightness is detected in the systems, the possible appearance of the physical phenomenon of obliteration should be taken into account. It essence is as follows--a leak through a slot of micron dimensions, starting quite intensively, decreases appreciably over a certain time, and in some cases even ceases. This occurs as a result of the mechanical contamination of the narrow channels with insoluble particles, as well as the formation of a special aggregate state of the liquid molecules on the walls of the channels that creates boundary layers with a certain strength. Obliteration accelerates with an increase in the consumption of the operating liquids through the slot and with increases in temperature, which is typical of summertime conditions. One must thus not be limited to wiping and the tightening of joints, even if there is no seepage detected after that for a certain period of time; it is essential to make sure that the obliteration of a crack has not been "hidden," and whose further development could have dangerous consequences. If it is detected, the damaged parts must simply be replaced and the conditions and reasons for the appearance of the crack established, in order to make sure that it is not the manifestation of some other flaw such as an increased level of vibrations. The most dangerous consequence of a lack of airtight seals in the fuel, oil and hydraulic systems is the outbreak of a fire. Operating fluids are ignited when they come into contact with hot sections of aircraft or engine systems, as well as damaged sections of electrical wiring. The most easily combustible ones, even in the absence of open flame, are the hydraulic liquids and lubricating oils. This danger increases during summer servicing periods, since the temperatures of structural elements of the aircraft increase through external heating. Turbojet engines [TRD] are easily started under conditions of increased temperatures of the surrounding air. The start-up of a TRD that has not had time to cool down after shutoff, however, has certain specific features. There is an engine speed holdup with the throwing of the gas temperature behind the turbine in start-up, owing to the fact that the air in the air-intake channel and in the engines is heated. Such failures used to be of a mass nature with start-ups of hot AL-21F-3 type engines. Recommendations were thus entered into the servicing manuals, after special research that determined that the RUD [engine controls] should be moved to "idle" 30--35 seconds after pushing the "start" button when starting up an engine that had not had time to cool down. The cranking of the turbine to remove the heated air from the air-gas duct and subsequent start-up were thereby combined into one cycle. Aircraft and helicopters should be positioned in such a way that their air intakes are pointed into the direction of the wind, especially when they are high in velocity, for the more reliable start-up of gas-turbine engines of all types. This improves the cooling of the engines, and reduces the required capacity of the electric-power sources by easing the cranking of the rotors. Attention should also be paid to the fact that the parameters for the start-up and idle mode also carry valuable diagnostic information on the technical condition of the engine. There have been many cases where the flight, engineering and technical personnel have been able to ascertain dangerous failures of the automatic fuel apparatus by increasing the duration of the start-up cycle according to the value of the maximum gas temperature behind the turbine. The idle mode is the first operating mode of the power plant that establishes an equilibrium, which is maintained by a minimal consumption of fuel. The engine is thus more sensitive to changes in the state of the elements in its flow portions. It is possible to ascertain in a timely fashion, by monitoring the rate to reach revolutions and temperatures in idle mode, such problems as damage and destruction of compressor and turbine blades, cracks in the combustion chamber, and the destruction of fuel feed lines to the nozzles of the main combustion chamber. The likelihood of deviations in the structural elements of the aircraft from increased discharges of static electricity increases appreciably in the summer, creating the danger of a discharge during fueling and a subsequent fire. The reliable grounding of both the aircraft and the refueling equipment is therefore essential, especially after the return of aircraft and helicopters from dense clouds and areas of thunderstorm activity. The specific features of servicing runway equipment during the summer include regular monitoring of the air in pneumatic tires. The point is that when the temperature of the surrounding air increases by 15ï¿½C, the pressure in the tires increases by 10--12 percent, leading to increased likelihood of their rupture in sharp braking. Summer also requires increased attention toward ensuring the protection of engines against the entry of dust and small foreign particles from the surfaces of the airfield. Erosive wear and damage to parts of the air-gas duct by foreign particles leads to a reduction in the reserves of gas-dynamic stability and the formation of nicks--concentrations of stresses that are often the centers for the formation of fatigue cracks. Constant monitoring should thus be performed--both when preparing for flights and when making them--of the cleanliness of the areas where the engines are started and tested, as well as the taxiways and runways. The likelihood of the entry of foreign objects into the air intakes is increased when the rules for aircraft taxiing are violated (high speed, high engine RPMs) and when the moving row of aircraft is blown by gas streams. The trajectory of the movement of particles in the operation of helicopter power plants has its own specific features. The dust raised by the inductive flow of the main rotor moves to the periphery of the area swept by the main rotor, is sucked up into the zone of rarefaction under it, and then is thrown back down by the inductive flow. A considerable portion of that dust is in the rarefaction zone created by the engines and is sucked into the air intakes. It must be noted that helicopters with gas-turbine engines, as opposed to aircraft, do not create vortex or turbulent flows that throw the dust right from the ground into the air intakes. Special dust-protection devices are employed as design features on helicopters. The cleanliness of the separators must be checked on aircraft fitted with them during flight preparations. Their fouling leads to a reduction in the effectiveness of the dust-protection devices, and to an increase in the non-productive expenditures of engine capacity.
