FBIS3-47185 "dreas006__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-006-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo Prepares Construction Market Action Plan OW0801044294 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 8 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0801044294 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 8 Jan 94 Morning Edition] [Text] The government has drafted an action program presenting plans on step-by-step opening of large public works projects to foreign companies beginning in April 1994 in order to reach a breakthrough in the Japan-U.S. construction talks, since the 20 January deadline for the U.S. Government making a decision on whether to take retaliatory measures against on Japan is soon approaching. According to the draft program, details of which were revealed on 7 January, open competitive biddings will apply to central government projects worth more than 4.5 million SDR [special drawing rights] (about 700 million yen), and foreign companies will be granted rights equal to those granted to domestic companies in the biddings. Projects conducted by the metropolis, major cities and prefectures [todofuken] and designated cities [seirei shitei toshi] will be opened to foreign companies as well. In addition, companies' qualifications to participate in bidding will be set on the basis of objective assessments, and at least 40 days will be allowed from the time biddings are announced to the time they are conducted, so that foreign companies will have enough time to prepare for them. The government wants to sound out the view of the United States on the action program in informal Japan-U.S. talks to open next week, and to have it approved by a cabinet meeting to be called on 18 January. The action program calls for the opening of projects now under direct jurisdiction of the central government, as well as projects conducted by 84 government-related organizations, such as Japan Highway Public Corporation, East Japan Railway Company (JR East Japan) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). The central government will also request that 47 governments -- including the metropolis, major cities and prefectures, and 14 designated cities -- open up their projects. As far as the projects to be subject to open competition are concerned, the program applies to central government projects worth more than 4.5 million SDR and projects for local government and government-related organizations worth more than 15 million SDR (about 2.5 billion yen). In the area of construction design, instead of the conventional bidding system, the program calls for adopting a system of publicly offered proposals, which would require bidding companies to propose technologies to be used. Design projects to be opened up are those worth more than 450,000 SDR (about 70 million yen) for government-related organizations and more than 1.5 million SDR (about 250 million yen) for local governments. Concerning local government projects, the United States demands that the applicable level of the projects' value be further lowered. Hence, the numbers are not yet definite. The central government and government-related organizations will start to implement the action program as of the beginning of 1994 [April in the fiscal year] and will complete the implementation by March 1995. The schedule for implementation at the local government level is not given. According to the new plan, construction companies that want to participate in the open competitive biddings need to achieve certain scores in the performance review process. This performance review will entail ratings in terms of six issues, such as net worth, years of operation, and number of engineers employed. Records of overseas performance will be taken into consideration so that foreign companies may not be disadvantaged. In the open competitive bidding system currently being used by the Construction Ministry, qualifications for participation are limited by a rating system based in part on subjective judgment. This will be completely replaced with a scoring system that is objective and internationally acceptable. A minimum of 40 days will be given from the day of the bidding announcement to the day of actual conduct of the bidding. In making the announcements, the names of projects and the deadline for submission of bidding applications will be given not only in Japanese, but also in English. This action program is intended to apply to 24 nations -- including Japan, the United States, and European nations -- which are parties to the GATT's treaty on government procurement. This action program has apparently taken many of the demands of the U.S. into account so far, but does not refer to the adoption of measuring indicators such as figures on the share of business won by foreign companies. Japan is cautious about adopting measuring indicators which could end up as numerical targets. However, it is possible that the matter will become an issue in the [Japan-U.S.] talks next week.
