Noteworthy examples are the talks between ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, the issue regarding the deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula, and the timing of the announcement on the suspension of Team Spirit exercise. The government on 8 February held a security affairs-related ministers meeting chaired by President Kim Yong-sam and discussed ways to relieve "the rumors on the crisis on the Korean peninsula" and the government's follow-up measures in case North Korea's nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council. The meeting was this year's first security affairs-related ministers meeting to be presided over by President Kim and was attended by Premier Yi Hoe-chang, Unification Minister Yi Yong-duk, the ministers of foreign affairs and national defense, the director of the Agency for National Security Planning, and the senior secretary of Chongwadae [presidential office]. Following the meeting, Foreign Minister Han on 9 February hurriedly departed for the United States seven days earlier than planned. On 11 February, he met U.S. Defense Secretary Perry in Washington and, during the meeting, made clear that a crisis is not looming on the Korean peninsula, as the U.S. media has been reporting. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, however, did not knew about the Han-Perry meeting in advance. The Ministry of National Defense [MDN], after learning about the meeting via foreign reports, expressed its regret over the Foreign Ministry's failure to inform the MDN of the meeting. A high-level MDN official conceded: "Although Foreign Minister Han sat right beside Minister Yi during the security affairs-related ministers meeting held at Chongwadae, he did not utter a word about his plan to meet Perry. This shows that there is a large loophole in the cooperative system among ministries." Even though the MDN can get access to information on the Han-Perry contacts through various channels as a Foreign Ministry official is stationed at the MDN and a military attache resides at the ROK Embassy in the United States, the MDN has not acquired any information on the contacts. Regarding the deployment of the Patriot missiles, even though the U.S. assistant to President Clinton for National Security Affairs had conferred over the phone with Chong Chong-ku, senior secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs, the Defense Ministry became aware of the fact when the Foreign Ministry later officially announced that "the deployment of the Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula is now under review." The MDN expressed concern about the team work of the security affairs-related ministries by saying that: "There has never been a case in which an important military issue has been pushed ahead without prior consultations with the MDN." On 16 February, even after North Korea's acceptance of inspections on its nuclear facilities was announced, a difference of opinion among the ministries was clearly revealed. The MDN, which restrained from commenting officially on the issue regarding the Team Spirit exercise, unofficially expressed a prudent stance on the afternoon of 16 February by saying that: "The announcement on calling off the Team Spirit exercise will be made around 10 March at the earliest and, furthermore, the time is not right to announce the issue officially." On the next day, however, a National Unification Board official announced: "With North Korea's acceptance of International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise will be announced next week." Even when the National Unification Board made such an announcement, the MDN adhered to its position that was revealed the day before and did not reveal if the National Unification Board's announcement had been discussed among the relevant ministries. Some military experts, commenting on such differences in opinion among the ministries, point out that the fundamental problem lies in the fact that the national security affairs ministries have been slightly neglected since the new government took office.
