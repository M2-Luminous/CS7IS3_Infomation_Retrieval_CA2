Beijing has in the past opposed Pyongyang's acquisition of nuclear arms. Quoting a U.S. military source, JIJI said the United States had on many occasions contacted China, a staunch ally of North Korea, to determine whether Pyongyang possessed nuclear weapons. The answer from China had always been negative on such a possibility, the report said. JIJI said the American source based his view on North Korea's arsenal on information obtained from China in the recent past. When a U.S. War College delegation called at the Chinese defense college during a visit to Beijing last January, Chinese officials said, "North Korea may already possess nuclear arms," JIJI quoted the source as saying. The report said the U.S. source believes that China now virtually recognizes that North Korea has nuclear weapons based on tips from Pyongyang officials during military exchanges between the two allies. The source added that there is no way to know how many nuclear bombs North Korea may now have, but the number could be one or two, according to the JIJI report.
