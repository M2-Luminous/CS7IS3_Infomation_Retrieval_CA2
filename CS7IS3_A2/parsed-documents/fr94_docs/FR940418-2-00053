Deadline Date: See paragraph D9. k. Status of Environmental Analysis: This application has been accepted for filing and is ready for environmental analysis at this time_see attached standard paragraph D9. l. Description of Project: The project structures consist of a dam and impoundment, a power canal, powerhouse, tailrace, and appurtenant facilities. Applicant proposes to operate the project at the same electric capacity (3.58 MW). The proposed average annual generating capacity is 15,740 MWH using the four existing active turbines and a hydraulic capacity of 1,420 cfs. In detail, the project components are described as follows: (1) A concrete gravity dam with an ogee type spillway and masonry abutments. The dam is 337 feet long with a maximum height of 30 feet. Permanent crest elevation is 332.79 feet msl with flash board elevation of 334.79 feet msl. The resulting impoundment is 3,200 feet long with approximately 21 acres of surface area at normal full pond. The impoundment has 190 acre-feet of gross storage and 37.2 acre-feet of usable storage. (2) A brick and concrete powerhouse equipped with four active turbines with (a) a rated capacity of 3.58 MW, (b) a hydraulic capacity of 1,420 cfs and a proposed average annual generation of 15,740 MWH, and (c) a gross head of 38.1 feet. (3) A 1300 foot power canal 31 feet wide and 15 feet deep. (4) A double circuit 13.8 kV transmission line which extends over the river at the tailrace. The transmission line connects the Gardners Falls project to the Montague substation. However, WMECO states that the line is not part of this project. m. Purpose of Project: The purpose of the project is to generate electric energy for sale to applicant's customers. n. This notice also consists of the following standard paragraphs: A4 and D9. o. Available Location of Application: A copy of the application, as amended and supplemented, is available for inspection and reproduction at the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, located at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., room 3104, Washington, DC 20426, or by calling (202) 208&hyph;1371.

Scoping Process: In gathering background information for preparation of the environmental document for the issuance of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to identify significant environmental issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given. q. Request for Scoping Comments: Federal, state, and local resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are requested to forward to the Commission, any information that they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested to provide information related to the following items: â€¢Information, data, maps or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical and temporal scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues.
