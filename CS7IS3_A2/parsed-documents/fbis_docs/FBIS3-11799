At noon, Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the National Executive Committee of the PRI, arrived at PRI headquarters after spending most of the morning at the Los Pinos Presidential Residence. Again, I want to stress that there is a great deal of activity at PRI headquarters. Let us go now to PRI headquarters, where we have Rosie Ahuactzin Vasquez standing by. Rosie, good afternoon. [Ahuactzin] Thank you, and good afternoon to you. Given the anxiety here at PRI headquarters, Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the PRI National Executive Committee, has issued a news release. This news release says: The PRI continues to remain loyal to the democratic and libertarian ideology endorsed by the party, as well as to remain loyal to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who serves as the guardian of the nation's faith, justice, and the de jure state. Fernando Ortiz Arana said the PRI National Executive Committee has disavowed -- and this should be stressed -- any expression of support in favor of any candidate until the PRI establishes the internal procedures for conducting this unprecedented process. For the PRI, as well as for all of Mexico, the president of the PRI National Executive Committee added that these days are a time of mourning and reflection, and, therefore, in due time an internal process based on the party's bylaws will be initiated to select the new candidate. Ortiz Arana also stressed that the party remains united behind the ideological and political program proposed by Luis Donaldo Colosio, because his colors were the same as those of the PRI. Fernando Ortiz Arana reiterated that on behalf of the PRI National Executive Committee, no member or official of the party is authorized to make statements on the election of possible presidential candidates. He expressed this process must conform to existing bylaws. This is what the news release issued by the PRI said. In short, it indicates that we will have to wait a little longer before a new presidential candidate is selected. I must repeat, however, there is a great deal of activity within the PRI offices. There are even three mobile television units here. There are also a large number of foreign reporters and, of course, domestic journalists. [Station announcer] Could you please repeat the basic points of this news release just issued by Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the PRI National Executive Committee, warning PRI forces and leaders not to publicly endorse any individual? The news release also said the PRI National Executive Committee, in keeping with the party's statutes, will in due time report the name of the candidate who will replace Luis Donaldo Colosio on the PRI ticket, correct? [Ahuactzin] Fernando Ortiz Arana's news release says we are in a time of mourning; at least nine days of mourning will be observed. He said the party disavows any expression of support in favor of any individual until the PRI, in accordance with its bylaws, establishes the procedure for conducting this internal process, which is unprecedented. He also spoke of the need to maintain loyalty toward the democratic and libertarian ideology of the party, as well as to remain loyal to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Not long ago here in the press room, a news conference was held by the so-called Democracy 2000 group, which reiterated its support for Luis Donaldo Colosio to be replaced by Fernando Ortiz Arana. The news release indicates Fernando Ortiz Arana is very upset with this news conference by Democracy 2000. He said this group's position has been renounced, adding that no endorsement should be made until the members of the Political Council meet to determine the process for selecting the new candidate. In addition, Mario Moya Palencia, who was appointed secretary of the PRI Ideology Commission by Luis Donaldo Colosio, has stated that the party is in no hurry to select a new presidential candidate. He explained that everything must be done in accordance with the party's statutes and within the framework of the law in an effort to avoid divisions within the party.
