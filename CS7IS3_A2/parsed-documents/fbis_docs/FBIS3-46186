Proceeding from the overall interest of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership over propaganda and ideological work to promote the prosperity and development of propaganda and cultural work. Comrade Li Peng's speech consists of four parts: 1) The international situation and the conduct of China's foreign affairs; 2) China's economic growth; 3) the reform of the country's economic structures; and 4) the hopes for propaganda and ideological work. In his speech Li Peng said: The important speech made by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the beginning of the meeting profoundly expounded the status and role of our propaganda and ideological work in the new period, and explicitly defined the fundamental policy and major tasks for this work. All departments on the propaganda and ideological front should conscientiously carry out the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech in order to do their work more efficiently. Concerning the international situation and the conduct of China's foreign affairs, Li Peng pointed out: The current international situation is complex and still undergoing a profound change. The trend toward multipolarization of the world pattern is developing at rapid pace. Economic invigoration has become the universal desire of the world's nations, and economic priorities are becoming a major factor affecting the development of international relations. In many regional hot spots conflicts have been resolved or reduced. This is the positive side of the development of the international situation. However, we should also be aware that hegemony and power politics still exist, that in some regions armed conflicts and turbulence are still continuing, unpredictable factors are increasing instead of decreasing, the economic gap between North and South is widening, and many developing countries are facing more difficulties. All this shows there is still no peace in the world. In short, the two major problems of peace and development have not been resolved. Li Peng said: Compared with other regions of the world, the Asian region, particularly the east Asian region, is relatively stable politically. In particular, there is sustained economic growth, a rapid development in trade and investment, and a strong momentum in regional cooperation in these regions. Li Peng pointed out: By pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, our country has made major progress in relations with other countries. The official meeting between President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton last November was not only conducive to the improvement and development of Sino-U.S. relations but has also had a positive impact on the situation in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole. We are in favor of striving to move, as soon as possible, Sino-U.S. relations onto the track of normal development in the spirit of "increasing trust, reducing trouble, strengthening cooperation, and refraining from confrontation." He said: On the whole, there has been an improvement and development in our country's relations with Western Europe. The visit to China by German Chancellor Kohl indicates that Sino-German relations have entered a new development stage. The upcoming visit to our country by French Prime Minister Balladur indicates the normalization of Sino-French relations. Because China pursues a policy of good- neighborliness and friendship, its surrounding environment has witnessed one of the best periods since its founding. Our friendly relations and cooperation with the developing countries have been further strengthened. Li Peng pointed out: This year there will be new changew and adjustments in international relations. The international situation as a whole will still be favorable to our country. In the new year, we should continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, refrain from drawing a line of demarcation on the basis of difference or sameness in social systems and ideology, and develop friendly relations and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, so as to create a favorable external environment for our country's modernization drive. On economic development, Li Peng said: Our country is in a period of development rarely seen in history. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "The key to seizing Opportunities to develop ourselves lies in developing the economy." Because the current international environment is quite favorable and domestic conditions are right, it is entirely possible for us to strive to achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy for a fairly long time to come. He pointed out: Reform and opening up have installed great vitality into economic development. Actively advancing reform aimed at establishing a socialist market economic structure in accordance with the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee will provide an institutional guarantee of economic development. Moreover, our country's political stability, national unity, and social progress have also created social and political conditions that are conducive to sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. Li Peng said: In arranging economic work, we should consider the overall situation, correctly analyze and follow the situation, recognize favorable conditions while paying attention to unfavorable factors, actively pursue development according to our abilities, and make every effort to maintain an active but safe development speed. He pointed out: Improving economic efficiency and achieving the unity of speed and efficiency are our country's important principle of economic development. To raise efficiency, we should work hard in various fields, such as optimizing the economic structure, promoting technological progress, and improving operations and management. In actively promoting the change of operating mechanisms in enterprises, all types of enterprises should conscientiously strengthen operations and management, tighten internal discipline, and view these two tasks as long-term, basic work and carry them out in real earnest. Li Peng pointed out: The principles for this year's economic work are: To fully implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, take an important step in reform toward establishing a socialist market economic structure, open wider to the outside world, tighten and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, vigorously readjust the economic structure, promote technological progress, improve economic efficiency, and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. We should stress work in three areas -- comprehensively developing the rural economy, efficiently running state-owned large and medium enterprises, and tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control. On reform of the economic structure, Li Peng said: The main aspects of this year's reform of the economic structure can be summarized in three areas: 1) We should make organizational efforts to introduce and implement various major reform measures to establish a sound macroeconomic regulatory and control system, placing emphasis on reform of the financial, taxation, and banking systems. 2) We should advance price reform actively but steadily. We should assume a very prudent attitude and fully consider the extent to which the state, enterprises, and people can afford, in order to maintain social stability. 3) Establishing a modern enterprise system suited to socialist market economic development is the direction in which reform of our country's state-owned enterprises should proceed. Enterprise reform should be conducive to enhancing the vitality of state-owned enterprises, preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets, and maintaining social stability. Li Peng said: This year's reform and development tasks are quite heavy. We should correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Economic development is the focus of all our work, reform is a powerful motive force behind social and economic development, and stability is an indispensable condition for reform and development. We should actively advance reform while adopting a prudent approach. We should seize Opportunities to achieve substantial progress in important areas, promote overall reform on that basis, and integrate all aspects of reform into a whole. Speaking of propaganda and ideological work, Li Peng said: Propaganda and ideological work is our party's political advantage. The progress of revolution and construction is inseparable from the support and guarantee of propaganda and ideological work. The propaganda and ideological front has played an important role in reform, opening up, and modernization over the past 15 years. The propaganda and ideological front has earnestly implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, publicized Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and done a great deal of work in encouraging the entire party and people across the country to study Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"; in carrying out education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; in publicizing and reporting on reform, opening up, and economic construction; in intensifying external propaganda work; and in enriching people's cultural lives. All in all, the guiding thought for propaganda and ideological work is clear, and public opinion is being properly guided. Li Peng expressed the hope that comrades on the propaganda and ideological front would continue to provide proper guidance over public opinion and better serve reform, opening up, and modernization. We should make every effort to ensure that our propaganda and reporting are complete, objective and accurate; we should guard against one-sidedness. In carrying out propaganda and ideological work, we must proceed from the fundamental interests of the party and state, and conscientiously remain at one with the party Central Committee politically. He said: All departments engaged in propaganda and ideological work should persistently emancipate their minds and seek truth from facts, earnestly sum up their experiences in light of their own characteristics, carry out work creatively, and actively explore new methods for carrying out propaganda and ideological work under socialist market economic conditions. We should assiduously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study the party and state's principles and policies, acquire socialist market economic know-how, and gain and master professional knowledge pertaining to our specialized fields. We should not only acquire book knowledge but should also learn in practice, from the masses, and from society. Li Peng pointed out: In recent years, our country's external propaganda departments have done a great deal of work and achieved some results. To open wider to the outside world, we should better carry out external propaganda work so that the rest of the world will understand China. Li Peng said: Government departments at all levels should attach importance and lend support to propaganda and ideological work, provide cadres engaged in such work with the necessary working conditions, and actively help them solve practical problems. We should be willing to spend some money in this respect and choose to economize in other areas, so that the conditions on the propaganda front will improve gradually and our propaganda work will become more fruitful. He emphasized: As propaganda and ideological work goes, we shoulder a glorious mission and heavy responsibilities for the socialist modernization drive. I believe that this conference will surely create a new situation in propaganda and ideological work. Leading comrades Zhu Rongji, Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Qian Qichen, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin attended the conference, which was chaired by Ding Guangen.
