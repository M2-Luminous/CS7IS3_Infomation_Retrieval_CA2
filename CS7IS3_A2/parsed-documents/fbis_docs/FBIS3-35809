He voiced his concern at a meeting with presidential regional representatives on Monday saying that "the balance of political forces in local polls can resemble the results of elections to the Federal Assembly (Parliament)". Filatov's deputy Sergey Krasavchenko added that there are two reasons for the fears. The first one is the difficult economic situation in regions "which sometimes makes voters support not well-drafted programmes, but those who promise to quickly solve all problems", he said referring to Zhirinovskiy. The second reason is the split of democratic forces, according to Krasavchenko who proposed to introduce the second round of elections in the regions to help democrats unite in case they face a failure after the first round. He also urged the representatives to control the fulfilment of the decisions of the president and the government so that people could see that reforms become more socially-oriented.
