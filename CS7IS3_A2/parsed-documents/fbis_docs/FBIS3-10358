The new decree provides for the levying of the Financial Operations Tax (IOF) on exchange operations, which will have to pay as high as 25 percent in IOF. A total of $12 billion were invested in the stock exchange last year. Gustavo Franco, international area director at the Central Bank [BC], yesterday asserted, however, that the government will not restrict the entrance of foreign capital into the country. He explained that the government is not interested in imposing more restrictions on the inflow of foreign capital, at least until the new currency, the real, is instituted. He stressed: It would be a contradiction to impose restrictions before the real becomes effective, as we are then going to need reserves. He also acknowledged that the unification of foreign exchange markets may be effected on the same day the real is instituted as the currency. According to Franco, the provisional measure only seeks to consolidate the legislation on the IOF and to put an end to lawsuits as far as exchange operations are concerned. He nonetheless conceded that the financial market was in turmoil after the news of the provisional measure was learned. Franco said that yesterday the BC had been deluged with requests for authorization to issue bonds abroad. He stated: People rushed to request authorizations so as to avoid paying the 25 percent tax. Franco explained that the rate of 25 percent had been established since 1980, and that the implementation of the 3 and 5 percent rates -- levied on incoming capital for fixed earnings operations and issuance of bonds abroad, which came into force last year -- gave rise to legal problems. He could not, however, explain the three-month delay in the filing of legal proceedings once the new rates were instituted in November 1993. On 2 March the BC suspended the five-day deadline for the automatic approval of authorization requests in case it is unable to meet the said deadline during in the coming days. According to Franco, it will be impossible for the BC to analyze all the requests that were submitted yesterday to the BC within five days. A source close to the BC guaranteed that the intention of the economic team is also to control the black market dollar, as it has now become the favorite target for irregular transactions because of its lagging behind the commercial rate -- or in other words, the black market dollar rate of exchange is lower than that of the commercial dollar. In order to check these irregular transactions, the BC determined on 2 March that all real cruzeiro remittances for the payment of debts abroad be made following the submission of the necessary documentation. This CB measure will be instrumental in thwarting a transaction often made by importers, which consisted of paying for their imports in real cruzeiros, i.e., by just remitting money, which enabled them to keep the bill of lading for their imports. The transaction was thus cheaper. As Franco explained, the idea behind this was to get returns when the black market dollar exchange rate becomes once again higher than that of the commercial dollar. In that case, the importer would have resort to the bill of lading to bring dollars from abroad at the commercial rate of exchange, just to subsequently sell them on the black market. In a move that sought to push the black market dollar up, the BC also decided yesterday that any dollar amount exceeding the limit allowed for banks may be deposited at the BC. Banks are thus expected to be more willing to receive dollar notes.
