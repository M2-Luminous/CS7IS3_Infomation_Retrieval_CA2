They held talks in Moscow today. Simultaneously, Kozyrev had a telephone conversation with Warren Christopher, suggesting to him that an American representative be sent to these quadrilateral consultations. The U.S. secretary of state has so far neither accepted nor rejected the proposal. The result of the consultations should be a concrete plan for a postwar structure of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will then be discussed at a quadrilateral summit and presented to the conflicting sides.
