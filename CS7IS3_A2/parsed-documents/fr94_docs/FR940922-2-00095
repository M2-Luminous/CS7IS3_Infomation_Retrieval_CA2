FR940922-2-00095 FR940922-2-00063 Drug Enforcement Administration Irving R. Majors, Sr., M.D.; Revocation of Registrations On March 2, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Irving R. Majors, Sr., M.D., at 7710 East King Highway # 56, Shreveport, Louisiana; c/o Medical Park Hospital, 2001 South Main, Hope, Arkansas; and 1905 NW Loop 281, c/o Centra Med, Longview, Texas. The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Majors' DEA Certificates of Registration, BM2917586, AM3141948, and AM3180635, and to deny any pending applications for renewal of such registrations as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The statutory predicate for the issuance of the Order to Show Cause was Dr. Majors' lack of authorization to handle controlled substances in the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). In addition, the Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. Majors' continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). The Order to Show Cause was sent to each of Dr. Majors' registered locations by registered mail and were returned to DEA unclaimed. The Order to Show Cause was personally served on Dr. Majors on March 14, 1994. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was received by Dr. Majors, and the Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response thereto. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Majors has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d) and 1301.54(e), enters this final order based on the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57. The Deputy Administrator finds that in January 1992, the Metro Narcotics Unit, Ouachita Parish, Louisiana received information from a pharmacist regarding a suspicious telephone prescription. The Metro Narcotics Unit subsequently initiated an undercover investigation. The investigation revealed that from January 10 to 20, 1992, Dr. Majors telephoned several pharmacies and authorized the dispensation of controlled substances to an undercover operative for no legitimate medical purpose. Dr. Majors charged the undercover operative one dollar per tablet. Arrangements for the sale of the controlled substances took place in Dr. Majors' car under the direct surveillance of the Metro Narcotics Unit. On January 20, 1992, Dr. Majors was arrested for illegal distribution of controlled substances. On July 6, 1993, Dr. Majors was indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance (hydrocodone), six counts of distribution of a controlled substance (hydrocodone), and eight counts of attempted distribution of a controlled substance (hydrocodone). As a result of the aforementioned activities, Dr. Majors' authority to handle controlled substances was terminated in three states. On March 26, 1992, the Arkansas State Medical Board issued an emergency order of suspension of Dr. Majors' medical license finding that he distributed and conspired to distribute a controlled substance. On April 28, 1993, the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners by Final Decision suspended Dr. Majors' license to practice medicine for three years and ordered that he be barred from prescribing, dispensing, or administering any controlled substances for the duration of his medical career. On January 14, 1994, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners by Final Order revoked Dr. Majors' license to practice medicine. The Board concluded that Dr. Majors' continued practice of medicine was an imminent peril to the public health, safety, and welfare. The Deputy Administrator concludes that, based upon the information contained in the investigative file, there are sufficient grounds for the revocation of Dr. Majors' DEA Certificates of Registration and for the denial of any pending applications for renewal. The fact that Dr. Majors is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances in the States of Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas is a sufficient ground, by itself, to order the revocation of his registrations. DEA has consistently held that it cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he practices. 21 U.S.C. 823(f); Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., 59 FR 44780 (1994); Franz A. Arakaky, M.D., 59 FR 42074 (1994); Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Myong S. Yi, M.D., 54 FR 20618 (1989); William D. Romers, D.D.S., 52 FR 12621 (1987); Ramon Pla, M.D., 51 FR 41168 (1986); Kenneth K. Birchard, M.D., 48 FR 33778 (1983); and cases cited therein. Since Dr. Majors is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances in the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, the Deputy Administrator cannot maintain his DEA Certificates of Registration in those states. In addition, the information regarding Dr. Majors' improper handling of controlled substances provides additional support for the revocation of his registrations and for the denial of any pending applications for renewal. The investigative file elucidates Dr. Majors absolute disregard for Federal and state controlled substance laws and regulations. The undercover investigation conducted by the Metro Narcotics Unit clearly and most convincingly showed that Dr. Majors abandoned his professional responsibility as a physician. He knowingly became a source of drugs to be used for non-medical purposes. Dr. Majors' continued registration would pose a serious threat to the public health and safety and would be wholly inconsistent with the public interest. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificates of Registration AM3141948, BM2917586 and AM3180635 previously issued to Irving R. Majors, Sr., M.D., be, and they hereby are, revoked. The Deputy Administrator further orders that all pending applications for the renewal of such registrations, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective October 24, 1994. Dated: September 15, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator.
