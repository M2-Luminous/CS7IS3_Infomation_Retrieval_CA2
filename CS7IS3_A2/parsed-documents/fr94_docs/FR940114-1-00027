FR940114-1-00027 FR940114-1-00008 Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 10_Traffic Records The current Traffic Records Guideline is directed toward improving the operational efficiency of record systems involving crash statistics, driver licensing, vehicle registration, vehicle inspection, traffic citations, roadway related data, EMS, and driver education. In the past, however, the operational condition of many of these record systems maintained by the States was insufficient to provide a reliable total information base. The growth of the files as well as increased processing costs caused administrators to seek methods of modernizing the files and improving compatibility of related systems. The proposed Guideline No. 10 recommends methods to establish comprehensive traffic records systems to enable states to use data to identify emerging traffic safety problems, develop appropriate countermeasures, and evaluate program performance. The guideline focuses attention on the need to link computer systems, establish uniform data elements including CMV crash data and integrate data elements where appropriate. In addition, the proposed guideline suggests innovative driver licensing techniques that will effectively identify problem drivers whose driver licenses have been suspended or revoked in other states. Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 11_Emergency Medical Services The current Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Guideline No. 11 is based upon the philosophy that by improving pre-hospital emergency medical services in general, the system will serve the highway-injured patient better. The focus of programs under this guideline has been upon those elements of emergency medical care which precede the patient's arrival in a hospital emergency department. This includes setting standards and requirements for qualified and trained personnel, the types and number of ambulances and other emergency response vehicles, communication systems and equipment, and coordination with other components of the medical care system. With the maturing of the nationwide EMS Program, the proposed EMS Guideline No. 11 reflects a new emphasis and expanded focus for emergency medical services. The proposed guideline recommends improvements to the entire emergency medical services system for highway-injured patients. The elements deemed most effective in improving trauma care for the highway-injured patient include a common phone number (e.g., 9&hyph;1&hyph;1) for quick public access, communication between ambulances and hospitals, trained first responders and pre-hospital personnel, adequate and appropriate transportation coverage, highly trained in-hospital personnel at specialized trauma care centers, pre-hospital and hospital coordination, and improved data on trauma patients. The proposed guideline also recommends improved public information, education and injury prevention efforts. Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 14_Pedestrian Safety The current Pedestrian Guideline No. 14 does not address Bicycle Safety Programs. The guideline was developed when Pedestrian Safety was not a National Priority Program Area and before many countermeasures were proven to be effective. The current guideline is narrowly focused on single issue countermeasure activities which involved primarily the inventory of the pedestrian problem; education, particularly aimed at young school children; and engineering. In a NHTSA/FHWA joint NPRM published in the Federal Register on May 3, 1991, the agencies stated that effective countermeasures have been developed to address both Pedestrian and Bicycle safety problems and specifically, concerns caused by an increase in the elderly population and the growth in popularity of walking, jogging and bicycling. On October 4, 1991, a Final Rule was issued making Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety a National Priority program area. The proposed Guideline No. 14 addresses both pedestrian and bicycle safety and describes countermeasures that are comprehensive in nature, involve a multi-disciplinary approach. These require the combined and coordinated support of law enforcement, education, public health, driver education and licensing, transportation engineering, and public communications. In addition, the guideline provides for legislative and regulatory solutions, outlines methods to enlist the support of individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community, features innovative school-based practices, and highlights traffic engineering components that promote pedestrian and bicycle safety while reducing traffic congestion.
