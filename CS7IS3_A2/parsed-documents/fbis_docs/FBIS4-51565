Medium to short grains, such as Chinese and California rice, were priced on average at 4,100 to 4,300 yen per 10 kilograms, about 2,000 yen less than the average 6,365 yen that top quality domestic rice fetched the previous month. Thai rice, at about 3,000 yen per 10 kilos, sold for less than half the February price for domestic rice, while prices for foreign rice blended with Japanese rice stood at 4,300 to 5,200 yen, 1,000 to 2,000 yen lower. Meanwhile, prices of domestically-grown rice being traded outside government-approved channels kept sliding as sufficient supplies of imported rice have eased consumer worries about the availability of the staple grain, market sources said. For instance, wholesale prices for the popular koshihikari brand of rice grown in the central areas of Niigata Prefecture have recently dropped below the 50,000 yen line per 60 kilogram sack for the first time in two years. The downfall in domestic rice prices has led some analysts to declare that the price run-up seen after last year's poor harvests and massive hoarding by consumers has finally come to an end. Rice Databank Inc., a research firm specializing in rice, said producers and wholesalers, believing that black market rice prices have peaked, are in a hurry to unleash their stocks onto the market. As an example, a Kansai-based dealer on the black market said he wants to sell his stocks by August, when early-harvested rice will start to appear on the market.
