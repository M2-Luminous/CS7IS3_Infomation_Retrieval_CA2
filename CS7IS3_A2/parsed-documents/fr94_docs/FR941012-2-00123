The Trustees of the Trust will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a class of shares will be used to support any distribution or servicing fee charged to shareholders of such class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 8. Each shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 9. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, and on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under the rule 12b&hyph;1 plans relating to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by such class and except that any Class Expense and shareholder servicing expenses will be borne exclusively by the applicable class of shares. 10. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to applicants (and such report has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the application) that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, any Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrator or associate and Assistant Administrator. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 11. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 10 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 10 above. Applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports. 12. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund. 13. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agrees to conform to these standards.
