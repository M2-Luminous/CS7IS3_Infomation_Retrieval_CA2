They said the main undertaking in the agreement was the introduction of a sales tax to replace a consumption tax before the end of next month and a reaffirmation of the Kingdom's moves to revamp the energy sector to make it cost-efficient. The sources said no price increase of any commodity or fuel was envisaged in the letter of intent Jordan submitted to the IMF on the basis of which the standby agreement was finalised. The sources could not say whether the agreement was actually signed by the finance minister. The accord now goes before the board of governors of the IMF and, immediately after approval, clears the way for Jordan to open fresh debt rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of creditor governments in February. An IMF certification that a debtor country is following an economic restructuring programme is essential before international creditors agree to hold debt rescheduling talks. The IMF green signal for Jordan will also clear the way for the Kingdom to seek external financing to service its debts, estimated to cost around $400 million. The financing is expected to be raised with help from the World Bank which convened a donors conference which produced $390 million in assistance to Jordan for the year 1993. According to the sources, apart from undertaking to introduce the sales tax, the government renewed its commitment to ensuring that the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) would be self-sufficient by the year 1995. To achieve this end by improving the performance of the semi-autonomous JEA and developing the energy sector in general, the World Bank has extended an $80 million loan supported by a matching loan from the Japanese Government. "No other major measures are envisaged in the standby agreement other than reaffirmation of Jordan's economic targets as set out in the restructuring programme," said a source familar with the negotiations that led to the finalisation of the document. The source noted that Jordan has already complied with the IMF requirements of raising fuel prices and reducing subsidies among other measures envisaged in the economic restructuring programme.
