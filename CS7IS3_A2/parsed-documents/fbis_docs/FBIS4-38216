Maleki, a deputy for research and training, said that not only the Tehran talks have been a success but they have also indicated Iran's key role in tackling regional problems. The West intends to play down any peace efforts being made in the absence of Western organizations, the deputy foreign minister reiterated. Although the West wants the crisis in Tajikistan to be settled by Western countries, the success of the Tehran talks was such that even the especial envoy of the U.N. secretary general, R. Piriz Ballon confirmed it, he added. According to Maleki, the bases for national reconciliation were laid in the second round of peace talks on Tajikistan held in Tehran from June 18-28. Maleki said that the two parties involved in the peace talks agreed upon the definition of the notion of the ceasefire, the terms for ceasefire, the release of political prisoners, freedom of the press, public amnesty and renewal of activities of political parties. Stressing the political dialogue as the only solution to the problems of Tajikistan, Maleki said that the Tajik Government was well aware that the development of that country was tied to achievement of a lasting peace.
