The officials said National Police Agency Deputy Director General Koji Kunimatsu will sound out possibilities of cooperation in dealing with such problems as Korean pickpocket gangs in Japan, some of them armed with knives. The two sides will also consider security arrangements in preparation for the South Korean leader's March 24-26 visit to Japan, they said. The visit will be the first to South Korea by such a high-ranking Japanese police official since Kunimatsu's predecessor went there in 1988 just after the Seoul Olympics.
