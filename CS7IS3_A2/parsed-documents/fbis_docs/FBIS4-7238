FBIS4-7238 "dreas082_l_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 Philippines Sison Says Breakaway Groups In Touch With U.S. Sison Says Breakaway Groups In Touch With U.S. BK2804095294 Quezon City MALAYA in English 24 Apr 94 pp 1, 2 BK2804095294 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [Text] Exiled communist leader Jose Ma. Sison yesterday accused former colleagues who have turned against him of being in the payroll of the Office of the National Security Adviser, Jose Almonte. They are also "directly in touch with U. S. Ambassador John Negroponte," he said. Sison did not offer proof of the supposed link between his enemies and Almonte or Negroponte. He merely said: "I have been informed by the NDF [National Democratic Front] about the character of those issuing the statements in the name of the so- called Democratic Bloc of the NDF and the so-called NDF-Europe." He said the participation of his enemies in the "psywar (operations) of the U. S.-Ramos regime" is shown by the fact that they have not been criticizing the government of the United States but are concentrating on attacking the NDF and the Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP]. In a separate press statement, the National Democratic Front said members of the breakaway faction in the underground movement are merely "a noisy group" who have long been repudiated by their mass organizations. It also said that the New People's Army remains under the control of the Communist Party of the Philippines. For these reasons, the NDF indicated it would be meaningless for the government to negotiate with the splinter faction. The verbal battle in the underground rebel movement has escalated with both sides accusing each other of plotting to kill leading personalities in their camps. Yesterday, in a statement marking NDF's 21st anniversary, Secretary General Frank Fernandez expressed the organization's belief in the need for peace but emphasized this would not come about unless meaningful changes take place. Expressing its determination to advance the armed struggle, the NDF deplored what it called the destructive deeds of a rival group which recently announced its readiness to hold separate peace talks with the government. Fernandez said members of the so-called Democratic Bloc merely want a "graceful exit" from the armed revolution, and that their moves are being supported by the Ramos Government to push the NDF into negotiations under terms dictated by the government. Utrecht-based leaders of the NDF have been holding out on the negotiations, demanding that the Ramos Government first withdraw "conditions" for the talks which violate the Hague Declaration signed by both parties two years ago. A member of the anti-Sison faction yesterday denied his involvement in an alleged plot to kill the founder of the CPP. Antonio Cabardo, former detainee and vice president of the Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng Sambayanan [Foundation of Freedom and Democracy of the People], said Sison's accusations show him to be "either sick of paranoia of the highest order or again up to some evil scheme." He also said statements coming from the Utrecht-based leaders seem to show they are preparing for a "graceful exit" of their own, but in this case, "a graceful exit from the peace process." He said Sison would use as an excuse the supposed plot to kill him as reason for pulling out from the peace efforts.
