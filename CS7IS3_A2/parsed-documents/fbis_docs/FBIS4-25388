But the promises we make have to be within what China's economy can tolerate. To safeguard China's social stability and sustained economic development is of overriding importance. We will not sacrifice our vital interests in order to "rejoin GATT" and if it is an either-or situation, we would rather not "rejoin GATT." This is a remark made by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, when interviewed by this reporter the other day. When commenting on the pros and cons of "rejoining GATT," Wu Yi said: The analysis of pros and cons should be objective. On the one hand, we must not entertain unrealistic illusions about the benefits that "rejoining GATT" might bring and think that we will reap a lot of economic benefits after "rejoining GATT." Yet on the other hand, we should not paint a very dark picture of the effects of "rejoining GATT" and believe that it will cause a rampant influx of foreign goods, in the face of which many of China's own industries will collapse. One should say that there are more pros than cons for us in "rejoining GATT." Today, when the world is moving toward multipolarization after the cold war, we can, by joining a multilateral trading system, maintain the markets we have opened up in a relatively stable fashion and will find it easier to open up new markets. After "rejoining GATT," we can, in accordance with the relevant provisions of GATT, gradually get rid of discriminatory trade behavior imposed on China by many countries and enjoy the fair trade treatment stipulated by GATT. Secondly, we can also take advantage of the multilateral rules of GATT to resist the unilateral trade retaliation exercised by some Western powers and put them under political and moral condemnation. In addition, "rejoining GATT" can help boost the confidence of foreign economic and trade circles in China's trade environment and investment environment. It is even more true of those major overseas companies and multinationals that are concerned with medium-term and long-term interests. What are the cons? To put it simply, we must further lower our tariffs and open up our domestic market, which may have an impact on some products. But we are following a policy of selective protection and gradual opening in order to minimize such an impact. On the hot topic of "when to rejoin GATT," Wu Yi said: It has been eight years since we filed an application for rejoining GATT, and the China GATT team has conducted 16 rounds of talks. Now the procedure has entered the important stage of negotiating on tariff reduction and deliberating the agreement on China's "rejoining GATT." We wish to "rejoin GATT" before the World Trade Organization is officially founded, so that China can become one of the founding nations of the World Trade Organization that is to replace GATT. The problem now is that some signatories from the West are too demanding in such areas as tariff reduction, market access, and service trade. In particular, one or two countries appear to be supporting China, but are actually creating all sorts of obstacles. The talks will still take some time because there is still a wide gap between the bargaining parties. Naturally, we will not try to "rejoin GATT" at all costs simply for the sake of "rejoining GATT." Despite the many problems at present, our attitude remains that of striving hard to succeed. Wu Yi spoke highly of the final document of the Uruguay-round talks that China recently signed. She said: China took part in the entire process of Uruguay-round talks and in the end signed the final document together with other participants. It marked China's return to the world's multilateral trade system, whereupon China solemnly undertook to observe the latest international trade rules. This is of profound and far-reaching significance to our establishing a socialist market economic and legal system. Our promise will also help boost confidence in China among world investors and businessmen. The direct economic implications for us of the results of the Uruguay-round talks should be analyzed case by case. Wu Yi said: Some of the many agreements contained in the final document may have more pros than cons for us. Take the agreement on textiles for example. Because the textile market will be fully opened up, our country, enjoying a relative advantage in the textile industry, may perform better in textile exports. But in the case of the agreement on agricultural products, because subsidies for agricultural exports will be phased out, China will have to pay a high price as it is a major importer of agricultural products. She believed that the Uruguay round's impact on different countries is not even. Whoever has faster economic development, more products that enjoy greater advantages, and a bigger export volume will benefit more from the results of the multilateral trade talks. Therefore, the foundation of the work on foreign economic relations and trade is at home and lies with domestic economic development and industrial structural adjustment.
