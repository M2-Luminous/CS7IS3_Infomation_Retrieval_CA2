[Correspondent] Mr. President, what is your view of the current political situation in Slovakia following the vote of no-confidence in Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar? [Kovac] According to the information I have so far received from the president of our police corps, no gatherings of citizens expressing disapproval of the parliament's decision, with the exception of a gathering here in front of the Primacialny Palace, have been reported. However, we are speaking in late morning, and I do not know what will develop later in the day. I think that the parliament's decision was free and democratic and that there was no pressure on the deputies. It was possible to say everything in defense of the critic [of Meciar, presumably speaking about himself], and the prime minister also had an opportunity to say what he considered necessary to say. Because we are in a democratic state, the decision made by the majority is the valid one. I have to take the view that the parliament consists of deputies representing our citizens and thus, that the decision was made by the representatives of our citizens. This is a democratic decision that certainly does not mean any black mark against our parliament in the eyes of our public or the world. I think that the parliament was facing a difficult decision also because, in substance, the matter was not just whether they express support for the government or no-confidence in the government because various speeches [in parliament] made it clear that the issue was also to decide in favor of a gradual implementation of an authoritarian system of power, or in favor of strengthening a parliamentarian system of power. I think that the parliament unequivocally decided to strengthen the parliamentary system of power, thus sending a very positive signal abroad where sometimes they have doubted whether we are really striving to strengthen democracy and the constitutional state of affairs in the Slovak Republic. I also think that suitable conditions were created for us to take gradual steps to implement the idea of political, civic, and national reconciliation. Conditions are being created for us to prepare ourselves for elections in a peaceful and matter-of-fact atmosphere, to make it possible for our citizens to decide our future in an election as far as the composition of the parliament is concerned. [Correspondent] Mr. President, can you say what steps you are undertaking or want to undertake to resolve the situation that has arisen? [Kovac] I have to proceed in accordance with the Constitution, which means, first of all, that I must recall the government and, at the same time, I want to ask the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] to try to form a coalition government headed by somebody else and not by Vladimir Meciar because a vote of no-confidence in him was passed. It may be possible to form only a government of a broader or a broad coalition. If the HZDS rejects this offer or does not succeed in forming such a coalition, I would turn to those political bodies that expressed in parliament no confidence in the present prime minister and ask them to nominate a person who could form a government. Of course, I will try to get the proposal for such a government as soon as possible. I personally think that it could all happen within 10 days, at the latest. Within this timetable, I will ask all of the ministers to continue exercising their present ministerial duties, and ask one of the deputy prime ministers to head the government temporarily until a new government is formed. [Correspondent] Mr. President, are you then convinced that the further political development in Slovakia will be peaceful and above all democratic? [Kovac] I am convinced about it and everybody, including representatives of the HZDS and the SNS [Slovak National Party], of the present opposition parties, and also the president and citizens, all of them want it. If we declare certain rules and steps leading to political, civic, and national reconciliation, it will then become apparent who does not want to play according to the rules, who says one thing and does another. We desperately need civic, political, and national reconciliation, and I am therefore, convinced that we will all contribute to making it all possible.
