They have expressed concern over allegations that their campus is masterminding the circulation. "The growing activities of Bandung college students have never degenerated and will never degenerate into racism and anarchy," a joint statement of the Bandung College Students Council said. The Bandung college students have in fact been hit by the allegations because the circulation of the illegal pamphlets coincided with student demonstrations in the city over the Bapindo case [Indonesian Development Bank credit scandal] which was one of the focuses of the illegal pamphlets. In the official statement, which was received by REPUBLIKA on Wednesday (8 June), they expressed concern over the circulation of the illegal pamphlets. The statement was signed by the general chairman of the Bandung Pedagogy College Students Council, head of the External Affairs Division of the Pasundan University Students Council, and president of the Bandung Islamic University Students Council. Students of the Pasundan University and the Bandung Islamic University have been the most frequent demonstrators over the Bapindo case. They said: "We are concerned over the situation and are trying to study the current phenomenon while playing a role in restoring racial harmony." For them, the Eddy Tansil mammoth corruption case, in which many senior state officials are implicated, has created a prolonged conflict. In addition, the case has also triggered racist moves and opinion. "Accordingly, we ask all interested parties to immediately and fairly settle the extremely destructive national case," concluded the statement. Bandung has apparently become the source of illegal pamphlets and anti-Chinese rumors in recent weeks. Rumors that ethnic Chinese-owned shops have been and will be destroyed have surfaced several times. Last Thursday, the chief of the West Java Provincial Police said he knew about the pamphlets and was studying the case. In the same week, copies of a letter warning the general public against being provoked by misleading issues emerged. The letter was handwritten and bore the unsealed name the Military District Command 0618/BS. The Bandung college students have in fact been determined to continue demonstrations over the Bapindo case until Sudomo [chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council chairman], Sumarlin [chairman of the State Auditing Board], and Nasruddin Sumintapura [member of the Supreme Advisory Council] are tried. The determination angered Major General Muzani Syukur, commander of the Siliwangi Third Military Region Command, who later issued a ban on street demonstrations. Anti-Chinese illegal pamphlets subsequently spread during the murky situation in which citizens were urged to take to the streets on Sunday (5 June). Armed Forces Commander General Feisal Tanjung said in Jakarta on Tuesday (7 June) that the pamphlets were made by persons who just wanted to kill time. In the meantime, the Bandung college students of 1966 and 1978 said in a separate statement that they reaffirmed support for the college student activism. In the statement to REPUBLIKA on Tuesday (7 June), they said that the college students have been cornered and considered a dangerous element in society. The former college students who called themselves "old demonstrators" hoped that the college students would remain constant in the current struggle. "Either morally or physically," concluded Thomas Sitepu and friends.
