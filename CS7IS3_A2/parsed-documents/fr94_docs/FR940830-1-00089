FR940830-1-00089 FR940830-1-00014 (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. , whenever an agency is developing regulations, it must prepare and make available for public comment the impact of the regulations on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). However, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Agency has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). This RIA shows that the estimated first year cost is approximately $1,609,000 for vessels, waste sources, and receiving facilities. Annual costs during the next 5 years are estimated at $249,000 for vessels, waste sources, and receiving facilities. The average first year costs per vessel of $253&hyph;$1,413 are not considered significant. The average first year costs for waste sources and receiving facilities are estimated at $126&hyph;$2,316. The largest share of compliance costs, measured as first year costs, will be for waste transport vessels, primarily supply boats transporting muds and packaged garbage from offshore rigs. Based on EPA's analysis of the effected regulated community, I certify that this proposed rule imposes no significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR # 1700.01) and a copy may be obtained from the Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., S.W. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202)260&hyph;2740. This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 4 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 25 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St. S.W. (mail code 2136), Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final Rule will respond to any public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal.
