FBIS3-12208 "drnes039_o_94006" FBIS-NES-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 SYRIA Unions Condemn Hebron Attack, `Double Standards' JN2702162994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1215 GMT 27 Feb 94 JN2702162994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] The popular organizations and trade unions in Syria have condemned the Israeli massacre perpetrated at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. They emphasized this massacre was the result of an organized, premeditated, and planned act. This is proven by the mass killings and acts of violence which continued after this terrible massacre at the hands of the Israeli occupation troops in several areas of the occupied territories. In a statement issued today, the popular organizations and trade unions said this abominable crime is not new to the aggressive nature of the Israeli settlers and soldiers. This crime was intended to terrorize Arab residents as a prelude to evacuating and annexing Arab land as part of the Israeli policy of expansion and hegemony. The statement noted Israel's racist rancor and terrorist record, which is replete with mass massacres, including the massacres of Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Kafr Qasim, Bahr al-Baqar, Da'il, and southern Lebanon. The statement added that the Hebron massacre confirms the dangers posed by continued Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the presence of settlements in them. Both the occupation and settlements violate all international laws, norms, and resolutions. The statement emphasized that this heinous massacre shows that Israel's intransigence and procrastination in the peace talks instigate acts of violence. This makes Israel responsible for extremism and terrorism in the region. The statement reiterated that the Syrian people, organizations, and trade unions support the Palestinian Arab people and our kinsfolk in the Golan and southern Lebanon in their struggle to liberate every inch of Arab territory and to regain the Palestinian people's legitimate rights. The statement added that the popular organizations and trade unions -- which were established under the sponsorship and care of leader struggler Hafiz al-Asad and which are experienced in adherence to rights as their policy and in sticking to consistent positions as their principle -- stress that the path of capitulation, sellout of rights, and chasing the mirage of partial and deceptive solutions cannot produce peace. The statement urged the international community, the Security Council, and the United Nations to end the policy of double standards and assume their humanitarian responsibility to confront the logic of Israeli hegemony. It urged these bodies to pressure Israel into complying with international legitimacy, which specifies the principles of a just and comprehensive peace and guarantees security in the region.
