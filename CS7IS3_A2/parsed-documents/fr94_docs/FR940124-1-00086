FR940124-1-00086 FR940124-1-00009 Section 494(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to impose the following sanctions on a State if the State does not enter into an agreement with the Secretary or fails to comply with the terms of the agreement_ (1) The Secretary may not designate as eligible for participation in a Title IV, HEA program any institution seeking initial participation in that program, any branch campus for which an institution seeks an initial designation of eligibility, or any institution that has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change in control, pursuant to section 481 of the HEA and subpart 3 of part H of the HEA; (2) The Secretary may grant only provisional certification to any institution in that State pursuant to subpart 3 of part H of the HEA; and, (3) The State is ineligible to receive any funds appropriated to carry out the SPRP, its allotment under the SSIG Program, and any funds appropriated to carry out the National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership Program (NEISP). The statutory sanctions described above are repeated in §667.3(e). The Secretary, also, proposes to impose the statutory sanctions on a State if the State ends its participation in the SPRP or fails to establish review standards within two years. First, in §667.3(d)(3), the Secretary proposes to impose the sanctions on a State that ends its participation in the SPRP by terminating its agreement with the Secretary. The only exception for not participating in the SPRP is provided in section 494A(c) of the HEA. That section specifies that ``no State shall be required to enter into an agreement with the Secretary under this subpart for performing review functions required by the agreement unless the Congress appropriates funds for this subpart''. (The Congress made $5.3 million of fiscal year 1993 funds available to initiate the SPRP and has appropriated $21.25 million for fiscal year 1994.) Secondly, in §667.3(d)(4), the Secretary proposes to impose the sanctions on a State that does not establish review standards under §667.21 that are not disapproved by the Secretary within two years from the time the State received Federal funds under this part. The Secretary believes that two years is a reasonable time for a State to establish review standards. Moreover, because a State must establish review standards before reviews of institutions can take place, the Secretary believes strongly that a State should not unreasonably delay the conduct of reviews and continue to receive Federal funds under this part. Finally, section 494(b) of the HEA provides that if a State declines to enter into an agreement with the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this part, the provisions of this part that refer to the State refer instead to the Secretary who may make appropriate arrangements with agencies or organizations of demonstrated competence in reviewing institutions to carry out the provisions of this part. The Secretary proposes to implement this section of the statute in §667.3(e)(2)(iii)(A) and (B). Thus, in paragraph (A) the Secretary may establish review standards for any State that declines to enter into an agreement with the Secretary, and in paragraph (B) the Secretary may carry out, or arrange to carry out, the State's other responsibilities under this part. Section 667.4␣State Postsecondary Review Entity Section 667.4 repeats the statutory provisions contained in section 494A(b)(1) of the HEA. These provisions have previously been discussed. Section 667.5␣Criteria the Secretary Uses To Refer Institutions to a SPRE for Review Section 494C(a) of the HEA requires the Secretary to review all institutions in a State that participate in a Title IV, HEA program to determine if those institutions meet one or more of the review criteria contained in section 494C(b) of the HEA. If an institution meets one or more of the review criteria, the Secretary must refer the institution to a SPRE for review. The review criteria set forth in section 494C(b) are as follows_ (1) A cohort default rate (as defined in section 435(m) of the HEA) equal to or greater than 25 percent; (2) A cohort default rate equal to or greater than 20 percent and either_ (A) More than two-thirds of the institution's total undergraduates who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis receive assistance under the Title IV, HEA programs, excluding assistance received under the SSIG, NEISP, and Federal PLUS programs; or
