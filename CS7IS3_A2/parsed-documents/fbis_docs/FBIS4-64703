The deputy prime minister promised that a new democracy package, formulated jointly by his Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) and its coalition partner True Path Party (DYP), would be disclosed in the first half of May. Then he promised the region's people, who are in the midst of an economic recession, that trade through the Habur border gate, a main point for Turco-Iraqi border trade, would be reactivated soon. "The reactivation of trade through the border gate is important for the revitalization of trade in the region," Karayalcin, who traveled in a private plane to Diyarbakir's Habur gate, told an accompanying group of journalists. "The purpose of this visit is to observe the situation existing at the Habur gate, which occupies an important position in regional trade," said the deputy prime minister. Trade through Habur gate, the main point for border trade between Turkey and Iraq, was restricted two years ago due to "security concerns." The move brought an angry response from the traders in the region: The Diyarbakir Chamber of Commerce threatened last month to violate the embargo if it was not compensated for its losses. Karayalcin was also informed of a number of local complaints. Habur customs official Ali Akinci and a group of Kiziltepe Chamber of Drivers administrators, who briefed Karayalcin on their difficulties, asked the deputy prime minister to reactivate economic activity in the region and rescue them from unemployment. The deputy prime minister responded by promising the speedy reactivation of the border gate. "Due to reasons of security and taxation and some other concerns which I do not want to elaborate on now, the gate has been inactive since 1992. We are aware of the difficulties. At this point, Turkey is approaching a new era in its fight against terrorism. The terrorist group is on the verge of collapse. Now the Habur gate can be reactivated, with a new understanding." He said his findings in the region would be assessed by the government and a final decision would be made. "Let me also tell you, I have another piece of good news: The coalition partners will disclose the democratization package to the people in the first half of May," he added, to shouts of "Prime Minister Karayalcin" from his audience. It had been announced earlier that the package would be finalized by May 5, but now it is claimed that it will be disclosed by next week at the earliest. Karayalcin's earlier statements to the press on the reopening of the Habur gate, however, indicated that the issue was still being assessed. The visit took place after Turkey's calls for the flushing out and storing of the oil in the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline appeared to have been given the cold shoulder. "We are continuing our talks with American officials. We want to give the Western world and the United States the message that the impact of the suspension of trade with Iraq has become unbearable," Karayalcin said. "Reactivating the Habur border gate will not conflict with U.N. resolutions and Turkey's international obligations," he insisted. He stressed that another aim of his visit was to make a new assessment at this particular stage in the matter of Turkey's security. "A new assessment between all related bodies, including the General Staff, will be made. My visit aims to speed up such an assessment," he said. Turkish ambassadors in key countries will also travel to the region later this week.
