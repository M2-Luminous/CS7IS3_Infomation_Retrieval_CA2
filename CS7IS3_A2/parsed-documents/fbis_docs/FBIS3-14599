They reviewed the status of the industrial sector in Jordan as a result of the sanctions imposed on Iraq and the measures being taken in the Red Sea, which delay the arrival of imports and increase their costs, thus increasing the cost of Jordanian products and reducing their competitiveness. Details are in the following report: Khaldun Abu-Hassan told the UN official that Jordan feels it is being targeted by these measures. He said that the cost of these measures increases the cost of shipping every tonne of goods by $15, which constitutes an additional cost to Jordan amounting to approximately $600 million per year. He noted that the measures have also resulted in damaging some of the goods that undergo inspection. He added that delays in the arrival of these goods has also forced exporters to pay fines to the parties who have ordered these good. He said that preventing the import of certain raw materials from Iraq resulted in increasing the cost of local production, which is the case with importing sulfur that led to an increase in the cost of producing fertilizers in Jordan. Abu-Hassan noted that Jordan was affected by the Gulf crisis on a larger scale by losing some of its traditional markets, not including Iraq, and the return of thousands of Jordanians working in the Gulf states. This, he added, has affected the Jordanian economy and increased poverty and unemployment. The head of the Chamber of Industry said that the UN Sanctions Committee's resolution is not based on firm standards, noting that if it sometimes allows the export of a certain commodity to Iraq, it does not mean that it will allow the continuous export of this commodity. For his part, Mr. (Jeng), secretary of the UN Sanctions Committee, reaffirmed that Jordan is not being targeted by the sanctions but is being affected by them. He noted that the Sanctions Committee is aware that Jordan is the second country after Iraq that is being harmed by the sanctions. He said that he would present a memorandum from the Chamber of Industry to the UN Sanctions Committee and will brief them on Jordan's situation. The two sides discussed a proposal by the chamber to send a delegation representing the various sectors harmed by the sanctions to express their viewpoint to the Sanctions Committee and hold contacts with the Jordanian Government to discuss and arrange this visit. (Jeng) expressed willingness to follow up this proposal. In another development, Muhammad 'Asfur, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, received a Canadian economic delegation, including a number of businessmen and representatives of Canadian companies. A number of Jordanian businessmen attended. 'Asfur reviewed Jordanian-Canadian economic relations, the economic situation in Jordan, the negative effects of the siege on the port of al-'Aqabah, the losses and the increase in the prices of commodities and products that have resulted from inspections and from other measures taken under the pretext of implementing UN resolutions. The guest delegation expressed its understanding of Jordan's stands and economic situation and its willingness to increase and reinforce trade and economic exchange between the two friendly countries. The delegation also expressed a desire to exert efforts to lift the siege on the ships bound for the port of al-'Aqabah.
