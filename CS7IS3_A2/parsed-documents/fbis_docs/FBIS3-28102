[Unidentified reporter] You said the [pump-priming] plan has been approved. Did the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] also indicate its approval? [Hosokawa] The SDPJ -- please ask the SDPJ directly for a more accurate account of its views -- said that it is impossible for the party to agree to the proposed tax reform that links a tax cut with a tax hike, with the date of implementation clearly stated. It said that while it could agree with certain points in creating a national welfare tax, this new tax has certain aspects that are identical to those of the consumption tax. It wanted the tax cut to be implemented through issuing short-term special government bonds, and it asked that a consultative body to discuss compensatory revenue sources be set up in order to build a consensus. All parties made very tough statements, but in the end, they agreed that because the plan was based on the judgment of the responsible official of the administration, they could not stop the government from proposing the plan, and they agreed that they would not stop the government from doing so. This was the general reaction of the parties. [Reporter] When did you start to think about this national welfare tax? That is my first question. The second question is: From my reading of this [prime minister's press release], I cannot see how this tax is different from the consumption tax. I think there will be criticisms from the people that only the name has changed. In your opinion, what is the difference between the consumption tax and this national welfare tax? [Hosokawa] With regard to the national welfare tax, please see item 1, the big 1, the 1 in brackets in this handout. It tells about the nature of the national welfare tax and says that the tax will be used as a source of revenue to build a vigorous and prosperous society even in the era of the aging society. That is indeed the purpose of the tax. While we do not have a clear definition of a special-purpose tax, the purpose of the national welfare tax is completely different from that of the current consumption tax. In a broad sense, we can say that it is a special-purpose tax. [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when the consumption tax was introduced, there was much talk about using it for welfare purposes. [Former] Prime Minister Uno clearly said during the upper house elections that the consumption tax will all be used for welfare purposes. At that time, Prime Minister Uno did not clarify what he meant. I think Prime Minister Uno did not mean that this will be used as a special-purpose tax; he meant that because welfare expenses were expanding every year, the creation of the consumption tax would mean that much additional revenue would be available for welfare. Is not the new tax just the same? [Hosokawa] This time, the purpose has been stated more clearly. As I just said, the purpose is evidently different from that of the existing consumption tax. This should be clear even from what is written in the statement distributed to you. There was a lot of discussion about whether we could make the new tax more clearly a special-purpose tax. However, the building of a welfare society is not a simple matter -- for instance, building ramps on the edges of sidewalks, or constructing housing units for the aged.... Some may suggest that the use of revenue from the tax be even more limited -- for instance, be limited to pensions or to basic pensions. However, welfare can be viewed from various standpoints. Therefore, I believe that the national welfare tax will be more in line with the welfare purpose if we think of it as a special-purpose tax in a broad sense. [Reporter] May I, Mr. Prime Minister? What is the basis for setting the national welfare tax rate at 7 percent come 1 April 1997, or three years from now? [Hosokawa] We have presented a vision for the 21st century. We are considering the sources of revenue and other factors. A pension reform will also begin -- we have to deal with it -- and we need to meet the various needs of the aging society. Under such circumstances, and judging from various viewpoints, we decided that a 7-percent tax rate would be appropriate. The finance minister will give you the details about this. He will speak about this here later. [Reporter] You have to make it clear here why it is going to be 7 percent three years from now. You have to clarify under your vision for welfare how much revenue would be required for the aging society, and therefore, how much of a tax burden will have to be imposed. Without clear-cut figures, there will be no clear numerical basis. Please be very clear about this. [Hosokawa] We have not computed the accurate data for the vision for welfare, and this is only a rough estimate. The vision for welfare will only be completed by March. While this is a rough estimate, we have a general idea of the minimum required revenue. Therefore, we came up with the 7-percent figure. [Reporter] If you are saying that this is a rough estimate, is there a possibility that the figure might change by 1 April 1997? [Hosokawa] When? [Reporter] I mean, if this is a rough estimate at this point, is it sufficiently possible that the figure might change by 1 April 1997? [Hosokawa] No, the percentage will remain unchanged. It will not change. Although I used the term rough estimate, we have made a general calculation. Maybe the expression rough estimate was not appropriate. On the whole, we have come up with definite figures. [Reporter] But Mr. Prime Minister, raising the existing 3-percent consumption tax to the 7-percent national welfare tax would mean an increase of 4 percent. Based on current revenue from the consumption tax, I think there will be a revenue increase of about 9 trillion yen. However, taking into consideration the planned 6 trillion yen in tax cuts and the amount required for the redemption of government bonds, I think that there will be a tax hike of 1 trillion to 2 trillion yen in April 1997. The idea of balancing income, consumption, and assets you mentioned a while ago is, I think, based on the so-called principle of balancing a tax cut and a tax increase. Could you spell out why the idea has led to a virtual tax increase? [Hosokawa] It is true that as you mentioned, there will be a tax hike after 1997. However, because the purpose is to establish a tax system which does not put a heavy burden on working generations and which is capable of steadily supporting Japan's aging society, you should not evaluate the tax hike simply from the point of the tax burden. [Reporter] I would like to confirm what you have said. I think what you have said is that the government will incorporate the national welfare tax revenue into the general accounts budget. Are you going to devise a way to allow the government to use the revenue from the new tax for welfare purpose? For example, a law stipulates what the oil tax should be used for. Will you formulate a way to make it possible for the government to use the revenue preferentially for welfare? [Hosokawa] As I have said, the national welfare tax will be used preferentially for welfare purposes. My statement here says that the government will legislate the new tax for this purpose. As I said earlier, the revenue will be used not only to pay old-age pensions but also to meet various other demands. [Reporter] So the tax revenue will not be used specifically for pensions. [Hosokawa] That is right. [Reporter] I understand the idea you demonstrated in your statement, but it seems that the revenue from the national welfare tax can be used for any purpose. I think that people would have the impression that the government changed the name of the consumption tax to the welfare tax only to reduce opposition to the consumption tax. Could you explain the differences between the two taxes? [Hosokawa] My statement here clearly indicates that the government will legislate the new tax whose revenue will be used to realize a vigorous society. I believe that the public will understand the purpose of the new tax if they read this statement. I greatly hope that the people will understand its purpose. [Reporter] Do you mean to say that despite the fact that it will not be enacted into a law, a commitment will be made that the administration in power at the time will use this tax revenue for this purpose? [Hosokawa] Well, it will be turned into a legal system. [Reporter] But the purpose for which the revenue will be used will not be specified. Is that right? [Hosokawa] That is correct. No purpose for its use will be specified. Yes, that is correct. [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, may I ask a question now? [Hosokawa] Yes. [Reporter] Well, it is desirable to make a proposal for such a reform program. Of course, it goes without saying that this program cannot be enacted until the Diet approves it. Well, then, seeing that someone has brought up the same issue just now, we understand that the SDPJ is opposed to the program. Therefore, I would like to ask you your opinion on whether the program will be passed by the Diet by winning over the SPDJ in your dealings with the Diet sessions from now on. For instance, if the SPDJ should insist on continuing its opposition, what will happen to the current coalition cabinet? Do you plan to seek the cooperation of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in settling this issue? What are your views on these basic questions? [Hosokawa] To say nothing of the SPDJ's opposition, there are also many people within my own party -- the Japan New Party -- who are strongly calling for this issue to be handled with great caution. Also, discussions were held today on this issue within all the parties. After very active deliberations within their own parties, party representatives have finally decided what action to take. Incidentally, the case of the SPDJ was mentioned just now. However, from the government's point of view, and in order to have this bill passed, we will do our utmost -- because we have been allowed to make such a decision at the 11th hour -- to obtain the understanding of all the parties concerned, let alone that of the SPDJ. [Reporter] Concerning this issue, I would like to ask you whether changes might be made to the general program that was announced today, while efforts are being made to promote intraparty cooperation, and also whether, Mr. Prime Minister, you gave a briefing on this program to LDP President Kono during your talks with him yesterday. [Hosokawa] No, I did not talk about this program yesterday because it was only today that this program was brought up for deliberation at the meetings of representatives, of the Council on Economic Affairs, and of the government and ruling parties. Thus, because there was a lapse in time, I did not mention this program. [Reporter] No sufficient deliberations have been carried out on this program within the ruling parties. And, Mr. Prime Minister, you have put this program before the people all of a sudden. Therefore, the people must have become, shall I say, greatly confused. If this program should be converted into a government proposal without sufficient deliberation being carried out, I am afraid that our people may gain the impression that the proposal was formulated very impetuously. What do you think of this? [Hosokawa] You have just mentioned deliberations within parties. Please be informed that each party was asked to set up a council on economic affairs last December. At the same time, various issues have been discussed at the meeting of representatives [of the coalition parties]. And if deliberations should be carried out at these forums, there certainly will be numerous issues that will have to be discussed. It is my belief that as far as the coalition parties are concerned, appropriate procedures have already been followed. [Reporter] It seems to me that no discussions have ever been carried out on the proposal concerning the national welfare tax. What do you say to this? [Hosokawa] On the basis of the national welfare tax.... [Reporter, interrupting] And it seems to me that no proposal for taxation in the form of the national welfare tax has been presented to the ruling parties for discussion so far. [Hosokawa] Well, shall I say that this proposal surfaced as we reached the final stage of consultations? Also, deliberations have been carried out on this argument from various points of view. As I have mentioned just now, the basic precondition for carrying out these deliberations lies in the vision on welfare issues that I had disclosed on New Year's Day. Thus, because we have asked for deliberations based on such a vision, I do not think that our proposal has been made impetuously. [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you promised that there would be multifaceted discussions at the Council on Economic Affairs. However, discussions had virtually ceased while the political reform bills were being deliberated in the upper house. Moreover, according to the briefing we received, a considerable portion of the council's deliberations were devoted to hearing briefings from the Finance Ministry. We have the impression that the Finance Ministry held sway in the council, or that the ministry's views were included uncritically in the plan. [Hosokawa] That is not at all true. Of course, the financial authorities are supposed to do their job as the keeper of government finances. The ruling coalition parties, and also the administration, spoke from their respective standpoints. For instance, regarding the term national welfare tax or regarding the period of implementation, the ruling coalition parties led the decisionmaking process. [Reporter] If you claim that the existing consumption tax is to be abolished and that the national welfare tax is to be created to be used for welfare purposes, I think it would be logically more consistent to designate this as a special-purpose tax for welfare. Why would you include this in the general revenues? [Hosokawa] I have reiterated this several times tonight. I hate to repeat myself, but it would not necessarily be desirable to limit the purpose to, say, pensions. Considering that welfare today involves various needs in different areas, to meet the welfare needs in preparation for the approaching aging society, we will be more capable of dealing with the needs of the aging society by designating this as general revenue. This was the basis for the decision. [Reporter] Because the plan does not have the approval of the SDPJ, did you make the decision being fully aware of the danger that this might pose to the administration? [Hosokawa] Not only the SDPJ. It is true that there are many people in all the ruling parties who have reservations about this issue. This.... [Reporter, interrupting] For instance, some SPDJ members hold the radical view that their party should withdraw its cabinet members from the administration. Do you think that this is unavoidable? [Hosokawa] It is natural that the cabinet should unite to deal with this issue, and I said to the SDPJ today that I need their cooperation. In this regard, SDPJ cabinet members said that while they are members of the cabinet, they are also party members. They would like to talk with their party. That was what they said, no more and no less. [Reporter] With regard to the issue of taxation, Mr. Prime Minister, you used to talk about a reexamination of the ratio of direct and indirect taxes, and such other issues. Also, one of your major points has been that the people's understanding is important. All press briefings in the past never indicated that the figure of 7 percent was ever discussed at the meeting of the ruling parties' representatives, or at the Council on Economic Affairs chaired by Mr. Hata. I think you cannot deny the fact that the people will have the impression that this figure came up suddenly today. Do you really think the people will approve of this figure? [Hosokawa] Deliberations in the Tax Commission are one way of integrating the people's opinions. The decision was made on the basis of prolonged discussions in the commission. Moreover, we have three years [before the welfare tax is implemented], and we are faced with the situation of a rapidly aging population at a rate not found elsewhere in the world. Considering that we have to improve welfare and to deal with the aging society, we can never handle these by irresponsibly issuing deficit-covering bonds. This is not something that a responsible government can do. I am sure we can win the people's understanding on this point. [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, may I? At the time of the political reform bills, you took the position that the government's proposal was the best but that you had to respect the Diet's deliberations. This time, it is expected that there will be a lot of opposition on the issue of the tax rate, or whether the tax should be a strictly special-purpose tax -- as has been discussed today -- within and outside the ruling parties. Will you still approach this problem by taking the position that the government's proposal is the best but that you have to respect the Diet's deliberations? [Hosokawa] It goes without saying that I have to respect the Diet's deliberations. [Reporter] Does this mean that there might be some amendments? [Hosokawa] Well, I can only say that this would be like the case of the political reform bills. [Reporter] Tell us why the national welfare tax is to be implemented on 1 April 1997. [Hosokawa] It has often been pointed out that if [the tax] comes too soon [after the income tax cut is implemented], it would not be effective, that it would not have any effect on the economy. The time lag should be extended as much as possible. From the point of view of stimulating the economy, I think that that is the most sensible decision. And, from the fiscal point of view, we have very limited choices. I made the final decision while giving as much consideration as possible to both factors. [Reporter] I have heard that most, not some, SDPJ members oppose the new tax. I am sure you plan to enact the bill to introduce the new tax during the current ordinary Diet session. Your answer may change depending on how the LDP will react to the tax, but are you confident in having the bill adopted? [Hosokawa] What I can say now is that I will do my utmost to win their understanding. [Reporter] Do you treat the bill the same way as the political reform bills? I mean politically.... [Hosokawa] I am not clear what you mean. But this new tax is one of basic pillars of economic reform. We asked ourselves whether the government should continue having a tight budgetary plan, whether it should implement income tax cuts to pull the nation out of the current recession, and how it should finance the cuts. The introduction of a new tax is the only choice left to the government, I believe. Like political reform bills, it will not be easy to get the bill adopted. It is true that each political party has members who take a cautious approach toward this issue. But I have to seek their understanding. For this, the government intends to make an all-out effort. [Reporter] If a tax hike is implemented in such a way, many people will have apprehensions that the 7-percent tax ratio will probably be raised to 11 percent in the future. What do you think of this? [Hosokawa] As I have repeatedly said in Diet interpellations, the government has the chief objective of keeping the national burden rate below 1 percent. I think it is very important to introduce the new tax in such a way that it does not put too much burden on working generations and the generations do not lose interest in working. Based on this idea, I made a decision. I am sure the people will understand if I explain my idea. [Dean of the press corps] We are running out of time. We would like to conclude this conference with a couple more questions. [Reporter] There are many points in your explanations that are hard to comprehend. It seems that your decision is based on a speculation that it will be necessary to introduce a new tax three years from now. When you speak to the public, can you tell them that your decision is based on a speculation? I think, unless you beg, the people will not accept your idea. [Hosokawa] I do not quite understand what you are trying to say. There are demands that to deal with the aging society, a health care, social infrastructure, medicare, and pension system should be improved. I said in a New Year speech that to meet these demands, the government has to ask the people to share a certain level of the burden. As I said earlier, the government has not yet calculated exact figures. But roughly speaking, this expression may not be appropriate as you pointed out, but roughly speaking, the government has decided on or calculated rough figures. I think you understand this. [Reporter] But earlier you said you cannot give figures. If you have calculated rough figures, you can tell what they are and explain how you obtained them, can't you? [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, the Health and Welfare Ministry will formulate a welfare vision and finish the work in March. While watching the progress in the ministry's work, the government will decide on the ratio of the national welfare tax and other figures. The government intends to calculate exact figures. My proposal to introduce a new tax is based on this plan.
