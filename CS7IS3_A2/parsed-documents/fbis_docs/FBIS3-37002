The Bosnian Crisis Has Thrown Moscow Into Confusion"] [Text] A serious conflict is brewing between Moscow and the West for the first time in 10 years. By rejecting the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs and demanding the urgent convening of the UN Security Council, Russia is running the risk of ending up in international isolation. Of the European states only Greece -- the Serbs' traditional ally -- has displayed full solidarity with Moscow's position. The distribution of forces in the Security Council is also extremely unfavorable: In the event of a vote 13 out of the 15 Security Council members will support the NATO line, China will abstain, and only Moscow will come out against. Although it does not look as if there will even be a vote. The United States and its allies disagree with Russia's opinion that a special Security Council resolution is necessary to carry out air operations in Bosnia. Washington, Paris, and London believe that there have been quite enough previous UN decisions, which Russia, incidentally, could have blocked but did not. Thus Moscow is losing the only real prospect of preventing the implementation of the NATO ultimatum. The further development of events no longer depends on the will of the Kremlin. Whatever bellicose calls are made from the Duma rostrum, Yeltsin cannot fail to realize that Moscow's potential is limited. Recently, it is true, certain politicians (and not just of a Zyuganov-Zhirinovskiy orientation -- Sergey Shakhray, for example) have discoursed in earnest on the possibility of World War III in the event of a strike against the Bosnian Serbs. You really have to possess a rich imagination to imagine that the Russian Government would agree to plunge its people into a nuclear conflict so that Radovan Karadzic's soldiers can calmly lay siege to Sarajevo, stationing their guns 5 km from the city center rather than 20 km away, as the NATO countries demand! In supporting the Serbs, the Russian authorities are guided chiefly by emotions and the logic of the internal political struggle: Moscow has no serious economic or political interests in Serbia. The possibility cannot be ruled out that Yeltsin and Kozyrev arrived at the conclusion that readiness to resort to a diplomatic conflict with the West would strengthen their positions inside the country. But here it is important not to cross the line where disagreements between allies (this is precisely what Yeltsin has recently been calling Western states) become an unbridgeable gulf. You get the impression that the Russian president is searching agonizingly for this line. It was no coincidence that Bill Clinton was unable to get through to him by telephone for two days. Moscow replied hardly plausibly that it was "impossible to communicate with Boris Nikolayevich for technical reasons." Most likely Yeltsin simply was not ready to talk with his U.S. colleague. By going quite far in its support for the Serbs, the Kremlin has now been forced to resolve a very complex task: How to prevent a rupture with the West and, at the same time, save face. Russian diplomacy is in disarray. Signs of a certain softening of the position have already appeared. Yuliy Vorontsov, permanent representative at the United Nations, unexpectedly declared that Moscow would not stand in the way of attempts by NATO aircraft to lift the siege of Sarajevo.
