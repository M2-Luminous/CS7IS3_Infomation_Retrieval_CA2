The deputy is first and foremost a person with higher education (94.4 percent), male (87.2 percent), and he is often a Muscovite (62.2 percent of the federationwide list). The Duma's oldest member is Georgiy Lukava (born 1925), head of department at the Moscow State Technical University for Civil Aviation, and the youngest is Aleksey Zuyev (born 1970), an adviser to the president of the "GMM" company (both are members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]). The average age of deputies in the Duma is a little over 40. It is noteworthy that although almost equal percentages of deputies have higher education [as published], the figure is lower in the LDPR where it is 89.9 percent (according to the federationwide list). Some 54 of the 444 deputies elected are functionaries of electoral associations and political organizations which did not participate in the elections for the federationwide district. Party leaders account for 5 percent of the Duma's total membership (22 deputies), and local party functionaries, advisers, and leaders of party apparatuses account for 7.2 percent (32 deputies). Contrary to expectations, representation of trade union activists proved to be low -- three deputies or 0.7 percent. Some 80 of the people's elected representatives are representatives of the executive or representative branches of power, including 25 members of the Russian Federation Government and leaders and workers of the central ministries and departments (5.6 percent) and 49 administration heads, representatives of the president, and other leaders of the executive branch of power in the provinces (11 percent). Workers in the intellectual sphere (the "educated class") are very well represented with 116 deputies, or 26.1 percent. Frankly, there are few doctors and school teachers and there are not many more higher education teachers among the deputies; however, the numbers of leaders and staff of the new kind of analytical organizations (specialists and the like) is significant. The new parliament will be scarcely more professional than the previous one: It contains only 29 lawyers (6.5 percent), and a significant number of them are concentrated in potentially government-oriented factions. There are 11 journalists in the State Duma (2.3 percent). The number of entrepreneurs and managers of commercial and state enterprises -- 47 (10.6 percent) -- is significant.
