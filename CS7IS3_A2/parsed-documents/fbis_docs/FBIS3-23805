Prior to this trip representatives of the German firm Ruhrgas, as well as gas workers from France and from Iran's national gas company, visited Yerevan. In the course of all these meetings the question of the laying of a gas pipeline from Iran to Europe was examined. It is quite obvious that this question, in addition to economic, is also of political significance. Today there are only two options for the laying of a new gas pipeline: through Armenia and Azerbaijan or through Turkey's territory to Europe. Both of these projects are approximately equal in cost. However, it is clear that today the chances of both Armenia and Azerbaijan for the laying of the gas pipeline on the territory of these states are much smaller than Turkey's chances, owing to the fact that an unstable political situation exists in the region and the confrontation in Nagorno-Karabakh continues. European countries, which are very interested in getting Iranian gas, will hardly agree to the laying of this fuel artery, which is vitally important to them, through a politically unstable region. Meanwhile, for Armenia and Azerbaijan the laying of the gas pipeline from Iran to Europe would be of extremely great importance both economically and politically and would enable these countries to seriously engage in the restoration of their economy, which suffers extremely from fuel shortage. Today the situation is as follows: During approximately one and a half years countries interested in the passage of the gas pipeline through their territory, that is, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, will prepare a special feasibility report on behalf of their countries. The Armenian side has already begun to work in this direction. In Yerevan there is also the hope that by the time the projects are submitted for an examination by experts the problem of Nagornyy Karabakh will be solved to one degree or another and the political aspect will cease to hamper the implementation of plans for the republic's economic restoration.
