Indeed, there is not a single stupid thing left which politically-minded journalists have not thought up by now. The most vivid example of this is a commentary, featured in the "Krok" [Step] television program on 12 February 1994, on a visit by Defense Minister Colonel General Kozlovskiy with a military unit stationed in Maryina Gorka. The meeting of the minister with the personnel was blatantly and deliberately distorted and pitched to the audience as some kind of "instruction" to the unit on "how to combat strikers." Meanwhile, the position of the Armed Forces at this difficult time remains constructive and clear: Stability and public accord are the precondition for successful reforms in our Republic and the bedrock for its well-being and prosperity. A systematic training process is under way in the Armed Forces now. Training events are to be conducted in subunits, units, and staffs in the immediate future, and thereafter. The Defense Ministry has no intention whatsoever of altering its combat training schedule to suit the current political situation. Let the politicians and journalists with too lively an imagination have their speculations on their own consciences. No one will manage to "bring the Army out of its barracks," out of the legal space prescribed to it by law which it occupies today. The Armed Forces have always been, and they will always be, the guarantor of public stability and security. The dangerous virus of civil strifes and political feuds has not yet spread onto Belarusian territory. It is a strong conviction of the Defense Ministry that no one today, too, will manage to embroil the Belarusian people and their Armed Forces in political adventures!"
