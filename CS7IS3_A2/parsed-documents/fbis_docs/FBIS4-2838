Tzou and Y.C. Tsai] [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan is determined to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) to play a positive and constructive role in the new world trade order, Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said here Tuesday [12 April]. Chiang told participants at a ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that "the Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" will do its part to help boost the healthy development of a multilateral trade system. Taiwan, which applied to join GATT as a separate customs territory in January 1990 and was accepted as an observer in September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year. All GATT signatories are set to become members of the WTO, which will be given tougher enforcement powers to supersede GATT and will start operations between January and July next year. About 1,000 delegates from some 150 countries are attending the four-day GATT ministerial meeting, which is set to endorse the agreement reached during Uruguay Round talks in mid-December. Chiang stressed that as the world's 14th largest trading nation, Taiwan is ready to devote itself to worldwide economic liberalization and market-oriented trading reforms. Chiang's seven-minute speech won resounding applause from the other GATT delegates. The speech also marked the first time that a ranking Taiwan official has spoken at a gathering of international organizations since Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations in 1971. The GATT meeting will continue through Friday before making a "Marrakech Declaration" and establishing a WTO preparatory committee.
