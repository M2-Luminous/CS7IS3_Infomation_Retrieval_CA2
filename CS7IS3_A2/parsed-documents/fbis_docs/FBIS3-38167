This also widened the gap between exports and imports, she said, adding that it would have been wrong to keep the foreign exchange rate low through artificially high interest rates. She stressed that it would not be valid to implement authoritarian measures in a free market economy and that keeping the economy under forcible control would mean running a dictated economy. [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] The rate of exchange may fluctuate. The important thing, however, is the revenue on the Turkish lira. I have always said this. Those who invested in the Turkish lira in 1991-93 profited more than those who invested in foreign exchange. For example, those who invested in Treasury bonds last year received 89 percent, while those who invested in the U.S. dollar received 71 percent. In other words, those who bought government bonds gained some 18 to 20 points more than the others. Our people seem to be calculating their profits on a daily basis. One cannot do that. The government bonds with the shortest term are three-month bonds. You must invest for three to six months, and you must compare the price after six months. You must not make daily calculations. The rate of exchange fluctuates; the stock market goes up and down. I have always said and will continue to say this: If you want a risk-free and high-yield investment under the present conditions, you must invest in state bonds. [end recording] [passage omitted] The prime minister pointed out that the adjustment of the rate of exchange will not have a great effect on the rate of inflation, because 25 percent of all goods are imported. Thus, she added, the devaluation will be reflected in the yearly rate of inflation as 3 to 4 percent. Therefore, nobody should think that a great wave of price hikes is coming, she stressed. [Begin Ciller recording] If the economy could be repaired in one or two days, we would have done it. If it were so easy, we would have done it. Was the situation not the same in June? A certain period of time is needed to repair the economy; 1994 will be a year of repairs; 1995 will be a better year; 1996 is the election year, and it will be much better. If this house has collapsed, then we will repair it. We need a certain period of time: 1994 will be that time, the year of repairs. [end recording] [passage omitted] Ciller said the regional countries were not informed about the time and date of the air operation into northern Iraq, but were repeatedly alerted to the fact that terrorists were being trained in the Zhalah camp and that it was providing the terrorists with logistic support. She stressed that the Zhalah camp is 110 km from the border and 550 km from the area where the planes took off. [Begin Ciller recording] While extending humanitarian aid to Kurdish leaders Barzani and Talabani, and while negotiating within the framework of our cooperation, we repeatedly alerted them. We said we are continuing with our aid, but that we have certain ideas. Talabani told me that the area in question is not under his control. The operation was prepared very well over months. When the state decided that it was time to carry it out, I made the political decision. Those who claim the operation was linked to the devaluation do not know the first thing about how the state mechanism works. [passage omitted] In addition to the peace process between Israel and 'Arafat, the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] issue has also been included in the U.S. Middle East policy. This is extremely important. The United States has also agreed in principle to follow this issue at the State Department level. In other words: 1. This is the first time the United States is including the PKK in its Middle East policy; 2. The United States has instructed the State Department to follow this issue. This is extremely important. [end recording] Replying to a question, Ciller said that she is going to Bosnia-Herzegovina because this is a humanitarian and not a Muslim-Christian issue. Asked to comment on reports that the United Nations will not do much to safeguard her security in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ciller said: [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] If I have a duty to perform, I will do it regardless. That is not our problem; it is a UN problem. [end recording]
