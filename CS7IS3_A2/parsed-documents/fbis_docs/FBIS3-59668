Verification research will be addressed in a three-year plan starting in 1994. About Â¥1 billion will be allocated from the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology for the first year. The information accumulated by each research organization will cross the fences between agencies and be freely used. The aim is to provide an infrastructure to foster academic and pioneering research activities and have it open to foreign research organizations. At the Comprehensive U.S.-Japan Economic Conference which begins next month, the American side is expected to raise the problems of scientific and technical information in Japan in the working group on technology access; the objective is to beat them to the punch. The target of the Ministry Research Information Network is a Japanese version of the High-Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program that is being promoted in the United States with the aim of strengthening international competitive strength in science and technology. In addition to being behind in providing local information bases, such as local area networks, Japanese research is far behind in communications speed in networks between research organizations. Therefore, from the perspective of information flow and shared use of computers, Japan is far behind the United States. Not only Japanese researchers, but foreign researchers have voiced dissatisfaction. Under these circumstances, representatives from the Science and Technology Agency, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Industry of Posts and Telecommunications visited the United States in June of this year to look at the HPCC structure and the state of progress of one of its links, the information highway concept. Based on this result, studies progressed on the realization of a research information network centered at the Science and Technology Agency. In this plan, not only the building of a computer network, but research on the software used like electronic mail, electronic conferencing, electronic bulletin boards, and for sharing computers will be closely examined. At the same time, database construction for researchers to load information onto the network is given technical support and is actively implemented. In addition to these four organizations, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Ministry of Construction have also expressed an interest in participating. The objective is to include all government laboratories and research divisions of corporations. Currently, communication lines leased from telecommunications companies are being tested. In the future, research organizations will be connected by optical fiber cables. By only plugging computer connectors into the cable terminal, information from various domestic and foreign research organizations can be obtained or information can be exchanged. According to the Science and Technology Agency, "In the United States, a communication network is being provided that will enable the full text of a speech by the President States to be extracted as a hard copy by a personal computer and read on the same day. Even in Japan, we would like to have personal computers extract important research announcements at academic conferences on the same day from the research information network.
