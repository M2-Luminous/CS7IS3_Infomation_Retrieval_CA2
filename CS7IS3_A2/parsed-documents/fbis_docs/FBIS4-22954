A. Samchenko, Shimkent City Leasing First Aid Hospital; UDC 368.06] [Text] Health insurance is presently evoking not only elevated interest but also serious debate among health care workers, separating them into distinct ``pro'' and ``con'' camps. To some executives of the public health system, it is first of all a source of additional financial resources needed to improve health protection and to raise the effectiveness of health care provided to the population. Others feel it to be the logical culmination of the sector's transition to the new economic mechanism. As I see it, both points of view have a right to life. Analysis of the numerous opinions, sometimes diametrically opposed, shows that it would not be acceptable to duplicate foreign health insurance experience in our republic. According to WHO data, different insured health care schemes are found in almost 30 countries, covering a total of over 800 million persons. In this case insured health care is not developing in any one of them as an antipode to national public health systems. Our public health system, which evolved over the course of many decades, doubtlessly has its positive sides. But at the same time it is obvious not only that the firmly established principle of residual financing, the extremely conservative economic relations and the obsolete administrative structure are totally inconsistent with the new laws of the marketplace, but also that these factors are an obstacle to implementing the new legislative acts adopted by the parliament. The law ``On Protection of the Health of the People of the Republic of Kazakhstan'' includes for the first time a section presenting the fundamental principles of forming and developing health insurance. However, the law ``On Health Insurance'' currently being examined at a session of the republic's Supreme Soviet requires serious reform of the entire system of social insurance, radical change of tax policy, and abandonment of the practice of financing public health on the basis of the residual principle; if these things are not done, it would be impossible to make it effective. Public health developed for a long time out of touch with economic realities. As a consequence it lost all understanding of the expense mechanism of its activity, of contemporary quality standards, and of the real demand for resources. The draft health insurance law foresees financing public health through a balanced combination of budget and nonbudget financing sources. The very idea of attracting the resources of enterprises, institutions and organizations, including to create insurance funds, is not new. However, its implementation is encountering certain difficulties today: There's the transition to market relations, the need for added investments into production, and the tendency for wages to rise. Mandatory contributions by enterprises, institutions and organizations to territorial health insurance funds will become a nonbudget source of public health financing. The new tax is to be computed as a percentage of the wage fund, which will naturally have the effect of raising product cost. The magnitude of this percentage that would satisfy all sides is a matter of heated debate today. I propose a simple formula for determining the mandatory insurance premium: P = SR(100+n)/F, where: P--the amount of the mandatory insurance premium (a percentage of the wage fund); S--mean annual cost of an optimum volume of health care services rendered to one employee; R--mean annual number of employees; n--percent of overhead that would ensure profitable operation of the health insurance system; F--annual wage fund. In this case the mean cost of the optimum volume of health care services rendered to a single employee over the course of a year may be differentiated depending on presence of occupational hazards and on the nature of the working conditions. The proposed method makes it possible to carry out the necessary computations both at the regional level and in application to individual enterprises, institutions and organizations, regardless of forms of ownership. Given legislative establishment of a fixed percent of contributions to the health insurance fund, the business entity could use the procedure I propose to determine the adequacy of the means at its disposal and the magnitude of the percent contributions to the indicated fund. Transition to a market economy and the accompanying inflationary processes prevent any discussion of the specific amounts that have to be appropriated today for the development insurance programs. According to my calculations the amount of the insurance premium for mandatory health insurance in South Kazakhstan Oblast would have to be 14 percent. Obviously when we implement the concepts of health insurance we will have to determine the amounts of the insurance premiums concretely on the basis of local conditions, and the mathematical model I propose here will be an aid in doing so.
