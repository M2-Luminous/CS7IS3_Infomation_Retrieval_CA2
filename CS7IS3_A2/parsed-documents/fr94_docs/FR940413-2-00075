FR940413-2-00075 FR940413-2-00040 Categories of records in the system: Information identifying participants (such as name, address, Social Security number), medical records (including psychosocial evaluations), progress reports, correspondence, epidemiological data, research findings, and records on biological specimens, (e.g., blood, urine, and genetic materials). Authority for maintenance of the system: 42 U.S.C. 287c, ``National Center for Human Genome Research,'' stating that the purpose of NCHGR is to characterize the structure and function of the human genome, including the mapping and sequencing of individual genes, as well as planning and coordinating the research goal of the Genome project; reviewing and funding research proposals; developing training programs; coordinating international genome research; communicating advances in genome research to the public; and reviewing and funding research to address the genome project's ethical and legal issues. Purpose(s): These records are used to support clinical research aimed at understanding the role of the structure and function of the human genome in human disease, diagnosis and treatment. Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such use: 1. Disclosure may be made to a congressional office from the record of an individual in response to an inquiry from the congressional office made at the request of that individual. 2. In the event of litigation where the defendant is (a) the Department, any component of the Department, or any employee of the Department in his or her official capacity; (b) the United States where the Department determines that the claim, if successful, is likely to affect directly the operations of the Department or any of its components; or (c) any Department employee in his or her individual capacity where the Department of Justice has agreed to represent such employee, for example, in defending a claim against the Public Health Service, based upon an individual's mental or physical condition and alleged to have arisen because of activities of the Public Health Service in connection with such individual, the Department may disclose such records as it deems desirable or necessary to the Department of Justice to enable that Department to present an effective defense, provided that such disclosure is compatible with the purpose for which the records were collected. 3. NIH may disclose records to Department contractors and subcontractors for the purpose of collecting, compiling, aggregating, analyzing, or refining records in the system. Contractors maintain, and are also required to ensure that subcontractors maintain, Privacy Act safeguards with respect to such records. 4. A record may be disclosed for a research purpose, when the Department: (A) Has determined that the use or disclosure does not violate legal or policy limitations under which the record was provided, collected, or obtained; (B) has determined that the research purpose (1) cannot be reasonably accomplished unless the record is provided in individually identifiable form, and (2) warrants the risk to the privacy of the individual that additional exposure of the record might bring; (C) has required the recipient to (1) establish reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the record, (2) remove or destroy the information that identifies the individual at the earliest time at which removal or destruction can be accomplished consistent with the purpose of the research project, unless the recipient has presented adequate justification of a research or health nature for retaining such information, and (3) make no further use or disclosure of the record except (a) in emergency circumstances affecting the health or safety of any individual, (b) for use in another research project, under these same conditions, and with written authorization of the Department, (c) for disclosure to a properly identified person for the purpose of an audit related to the research project, if information that would enable research subjects to be identified is removed or destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the purpose of the audit, or (d) when required by law; (D) has secured a written statement attesting to the recipient's understanding of, and willingness to abide by these provisions.
