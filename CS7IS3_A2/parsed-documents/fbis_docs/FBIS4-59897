This, in contrast to Rabin and his government who are proudly informing their people about the agreements reached with 'Arafat. This statement came in response to the meeting held last Wednesday in Cairo, the day of the signing of the agreement [4 May], between Muhammad Dahlan and Jibril al-Rujub with the head of Shin Bet. In its statement, Hamas criticized the reported cooperation between the two sides in the security sphere and the exchange of information about the activities of Islamic forces in Gaza. [passage omitted] The statement added: During the meeting, the Shin Bet head forced Dahlan and al-Rujub not to prosecute collaborators, and al-Rujub confirmed this to the news media. In its statement, Hamas denounced the fact that those at the meeting permitted themselves to aid in the liquidation of a large sector of their people for rejecting the occupation and its consequences. At the same time they committed themselves not to prosecute collaborators, who played an important role in the establishment of the special units and the protection of settlers. In its statement, Hamas stressed that it will continue the march regardless of the cost.
