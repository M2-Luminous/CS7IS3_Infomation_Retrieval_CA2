The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) dispatch said that an analyst for NODONG SINMUN, the Korean Workers' Party newspaper, accused Japan of zealously joining the United States in its efforts to force North Korea to agree to international inspections of its nuclear facilities. The analyst warned that if international sanctions were imposed on North Korea, Japan would dispatch SDF personnel to the Korean peninsula. "This indicates Japan's hostile policy (toward North Korea) is reaching the extreme," the analyst said. The KCNA report was monitored by the Korea News Service, a Tokyo-based agency watching developments on the peninsula.
