It is Vietnam's first six-lane, 14.56-km expressway. The expressway's construction cost was 16 billion dong per kilometer. "Attending the inauguration ceremony were Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong, Hanoi party committee Secretary Pham The Duyet, Communications and Transport Minister Bui Danh Luu, and many other leading cadres of ministries and sectors at the central level and in Hanoi." The expressway was built according to international standards and is of the highest-ever quality in Vietnam. At the ceremony, Comrade Le Ngoc Hoan, deputy communications and transport minister, delivered a speech in which he said: [Begin Le Ngoc Hoan recording] "The construction of the Thang Long-Noi Bai Expressway was completed thanks to the great efforts of all the concerned agencies. The success of this project was indeed possible due to the state's close guidance, effective coordination between construction units, and cooperation between the people of Hanoi and Vinh Phu Province. The expressway will bring about great economic benefits because it cuts almost 10 km from the trip to the center of Hanoi. It will also help to beautify the gateway to the capital city to welcome foreign visitors; facilitate the development of the industrial-tourism-business complex in northern Hanoi, being built to mark the 40th anniversary of Hanoi's liberation; and facilitate economic development in the northern region. Once again, I would like to express our gratitude to the party and state leaders, the agencies concerned, the local people, and the workers for their creativity and hard work in successfully building this new project for the socialist Vietnamese fatherland. It will contribute to fulfilling our esteemed and beloved Uncle Ho's aspiration of making Vietnam a more beautiful and prosperous nation." [end recording]
