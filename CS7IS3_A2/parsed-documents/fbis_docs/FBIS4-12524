Al-Surani regretted that the Palestinian negotiator did not ask what had become of the original Palestine that was divided by Resolution 181. In a statement to AL-HAYAH, he added that the Palestinian negotiator may get Gaza and the West Bank, a half or a quarter of it, and he may get nothing. This is because the United States and Israel have a special interpretation of Resolution 242. They consider that Jerusalem is not an occupied city, that the occupied territories are not Palestinian but disputed territories, and they view settlements as legitimate. He added: What is going on is not negotiations or peace because the crux of the Palestine question, which is the problem of refugees was excluded from the Madrid conference. On the Syrian criticism that the Palestinian leadership separated the Palestinian-Israeli track from other tracks, al-Surani said: Syria has the right to say this, but it has no right to separate itself from the Palestine question. When Syrian Foreign minister Faruq al-Shar' criticized the Palestinian leadership he did so out of pain and bitterness, and his objective is the restoration of coordination and not to say goodbye to the Palestinians. Al-Surani said: Regrettably, the Palestinian leadership is committing the mistake of acting unilaterally, and it should reconsider this situation.
