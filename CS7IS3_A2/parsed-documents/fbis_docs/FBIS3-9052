We still strive to create good-neighbourly links and help ethnic Hungarian minorities get the institutional frameworks they need to survive," Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said on Thursday. On his Sarajevo visit, Jeszenszky said peace talks would be more successful if held in Sarajevo, since the different sides would also be prompted emotionally towards reconciliation by the sight of suffering people and destroyed buildings. "People in Sarajevo would have already starved in tens of thousands had Europe not helped, but the same Europe cannot arrange a lasting settlement," said the foreign minister. Everyone has an interest in the Balkans not becoming a new Lebanon, he added. Jeszenszky restated Hungary"s principal position of not participating even as peacekeepers in conflicts affecting its neighbours. There are Hungarians in Serbia, and anything could be misunderstood. Requests from both Bosnian Croats and Muslims would have to be considered by Parliament, Jeszenszky said.
