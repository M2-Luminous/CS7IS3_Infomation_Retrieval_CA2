No. SR&hyph;OC&hyph;92&hyph;32] (notice of filing of proposed rule change). 3 Letter from James C. Yong, Deputy General Counsel, OCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Esq., Chief, Branch of Clearing Agency Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (July 13, 1994). I. Description Generally, the purpose of the proposed rule changes is to allow OCC to expand the categories of non-U.S. dollar denominated collateral it will accept as margin deposits. First, the proposed rule changes allow all OCC clearing members to deposit with OCC margin consisting of any foreign currency which is the trading currency 4 or the underlying currency 5 for an OCC-cleared foreign currency option or for an OCC-cleared cross-rate foreign currency option (``cross-rate''). 6 Currently, only cross-rate clearing members are permitted to deposit foreign currencies, specifically only trading currencies, as margin. 4 Trading currency is defined by OCC's rules as the foreign currency in which premium and exercise prices are denominated for a class of foreign currency options or cross-rate currency options. Currently, the trading currencies of approved OCC-cleared cross-rates are the Japanese yen and the German deutsche marks. 5 Underlying currency is defined by OCC's rules as the foreign currency which is required to be delivered upon the exercise of a class of foreign currency options or cross-rates. Currently, the foreign currencies which are the underlying currencies for OCC-cleared foreign currency options and cross-rates are those of Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 6 Cross-rates are options to buy or sell a foreign currency (``underlying currency'') where the premium and the exercise price are denominated in another foreign currency (``trading currency ''). For a detailed discussion of cross-rates, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29920, International Series Release No. 340 (November 7, 1991), 56 FR 58105 (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;91&hyph;04] (order approving OCC's clearance and settlement rules for cross-rates). To accommodate the acceptance of non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies as margin, OCC is making several changes to its By-Laws and Rules. Presently for each class of cross-rates in which a cross-rate clearing member maintains positions, OCC Rule 2108 requires the cross-rate clearing member to establish and to maintain a bank account with an approved OCC clearing bank in the country of origin of each trading and underlying currency and to authorize OCC to withdraw funds from such bank accounts in accordance with OCC's rules. OCC will impose those same requirements on all clearing members desiring to deposit trading and underlying currencies as margin. Accordingly, amended Rule 203 will require every clearing member that desires to deposit foreign currency as margin to establish and to maintain an account with an OCC-approved clearing bank in each country of origin and must authorize OCC to withdraw funds from such bank account in accordance with OCC's rules. The criteria used in approving banks to act as custodians for deposits of the trading and underlying currencies deposited as margin will be the same as the criteria currently used in approving banks to settle cross-rates. 7 7 The criteria used in approving banks to settle cross-rates are set forth in the letter from Jacqueline Luthringshausen, Staff Attorney, OCC, to Jeffrey T. Brown, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 20, 1992). OCC is amending Rule 604(a) to add trading currencies and underlying currencies to the forms of collateral that clearing members may deposit to satisfy margin requirements. 8 OCC also is adding and defining, as appropriate, the terms underlying currency and trading currency in various Articles of its By-Laws. 8 Also language is being added to Rule 604(a) to make clear that OCC will convert deposits of trading or underlying currencies into U.S. dollar equivalents for purposes of determining clearing members' compliance with OCC's margin requirements. In valuating foreign currency for conversion to U.S. dollar equivalents, OCC reduces the exchange rate by a margin interval to insure that daily currency fluctuations create little risk of loss to OCC. The margin intervals are chosen to cover three standard deviations or such greater amount as to actually cover 99.7% of the daily percentage price changes over the past ten years.
