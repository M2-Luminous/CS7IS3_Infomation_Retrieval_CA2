The advance party of the 900-strong battalion group based on the Duke of Wellington's Regiment left the Croatian port of Split at first light to move up-country into central Bosnia. They were replacing hard-pressed troops from the Coldstream Guards, who have been working 18-hour days striving to enforce the truce agreements with thinly-spread resources. They are being stationed at British bases at Duvno, Gornji Vakuf, Vitez and Zepce and will be used to man checkpoints, observation posts, weapon collection points and to help with aid operations. Once their Saxon armoured vehicles arrive, they will be able to patrol the 125-mile buffer zone between Croat and Muslim forces across central Bosnia. "They have been deployed immediately on the ground to all four locations and as more come in they will be moved up-country straight away," said a British military spokesman. "The speed of the operation is quite astonishing but we want to move them into position as quickly as possible." Troops from the 900-strong force will continue to arrive over the next week and ships carrying the armoured vehicles will dock between March 21 and 23. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary landing ships Sir Tristram left the Marchwood military port at Southampton today. Her sister ships Sir Galahad and Sir Bedivere will leave tomorrow and Sunday [13 March] respectively. Precise details of the deployment will be worked out at a meeting tomorrow of the Joint Commission set up with Croat and Muslim leaders and chaired by British Brigadier John Reith. Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Williams, commander of the Coldstream Guards, and Lt-Col David Santa-Olalla, CO of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, will both attend the meeting to work out areas of operations. "All of this will accelerate the return to normality in the region with a consequent reduction in these tasks," said a miliary source. The Government hopes the "creeping ceasefire" which is spreading across Bosnia will persuade other nations, notably the United States to take part in the UN operation. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said it was the right time to send extra troops to reinforce the ceasefires. "There is a good military principle about reinforcing success. In the last couple of weeks it has become clear, not that all danger is over, but that the war in Bosnia is beginning to die," he said. "Now it may come back again to being horrible and savage but there is an opportunity now, not as part of a general settlement so far, but place by place, Sarajevo first and now in central Bosnia where our troops are." Troops were needed to implement the ceasefires and create confidence so fighting did not break out again along the truce lines. The British force will be fundamentally reorganised following the Government's decision yesterday to reinforce. British Battalion One, which will have its headquarters at Vitez, will be based on the Coldstream Guards with responsibility for the area from Maglaj in the north to Vitez and west to Travnik. It will consist of companies with Warrior armoured fighting vehicles, two squadrons of Light Dragoons with Scimitar light tanks and one company with Saxons. British Battalion Two, based on the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, will have its headquarters in Bugojno with two Saxon-equipped companies. A Warrior company will be based at Gornji Vakuf. It will be responsible for the area south of Vitez including Gornji Vakuf, which has been a key flashpoint, Prozor and Duvno.
