They share a reputation for being intransigent. Falcao, the PT's new president, has distinguished himself in the party as a guardian of ideological purity. PSDB members in Minas Gerais say that centralized decisionmaking is a shortcoming on the part of Pimenta, who will take over as the PSDB's president next week. Pimenta da Veiga: Back After 1990 Defeat Belo Horizonte -- The PSDB's new president, attorney Joao Pimenta da Veiga, Jr., whose election is expected to be ratified at the party convention next Saturday, is a stubborn man. He has a strong personality, does not follow advice, and always has the last word. At 46 years of age, Pimenta da Veiga has collected electoral successes in his political career, but the ballot box has also brought him disappointment. After being defeated in the Minas Gerais gubernatorial race in 1990, he abandoned everything and went to Brasilia to practice law. Pimenta da Veiga began his political career in the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. He inherited the electoral prestige of his father, attorney Joao Pimenta da Veiga, who was a deputy. He served three terms in the Chamber of Deputies, being elected in 1978, 1982, and 1986. He was appointed leader of the PMDB by Tancredo Neves in the second of those elections and was retained in that post by former President Jose Sarney. In 1988, he left the PMDB to establish the PSDB and was elected mayor of Belo Horizonte. As mayor, Pimenta da Veiga achieved a level of popularity convincing him that he could reach greater heights. He left the city in the hands of Deputy Mayor Eduardo Azeredo and began campaigning as an unbeatable candidate. His intransigence led him to make fatal mistakes. The campaign's coordinators felt that Pimenta should pay more attention to TV programs. To do so, he would have to do less traveling. But the candidate felt that visits to the municipalities were more important. He almost came to blows with the then president of the Minas Gerais PSDB and candidate for the Senate, Carlos Mosconi, who felt mistreated. Concerned about the political exploitation of Pimenta's personal life, advisers counseled him to maintain the greatest discretion in his amorous relationship with young Ana Paola Frade (with whom he is now married and has two children), since his separation from his first wife was very recent. Pimenta da Veiga did not agree, and Ana, who was his girlfriend at the time, participated actively in his campaign. There was general surprise when Pimenta lost the election in the first round to Helio Garcia. Defeated, he turned his back on Minas Gerais politics. He went to Brasilia with Ana and began practicing law in the higher courts, keeping only the decorative post of vice president of the PSDB. Pimenta has said that he will assume the presidency of the party against his will. He would prefer to act behind the scenes on behalf of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy by "helping in the coordination." Pimenta has supported the PSDB's alliance with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] from the start. According to him, coalitions are essential if the next president is to be able to govern. "Without a political base, any president will be isolated," he said. Falcao: Disciplined and Inflexible Organizer Brasilia -- Ruy Falcao, the son of a Bahia family, was born in Minas Gerais and raised in Sao Paulo. He lacks the charisma of his predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, but exhibits a characteristic that is praised by "comrades" and opponents: he is disciplined and a hard worker. Considered one of the toughest members of the PT leadership, he assumed the presidency of the party last Sunday after helping Lula put together a more realistic and moderate government program than the extreme Left wanted. "I will be the president not of a faction but of the party," he said as he took office, thus sending a clear message to those PT members who, along with him, make up the Hour of Truth group. As a member of the leftist organization VAR [Revolutionary Armed Vanguard]-Palmares, Falcao was arrested by the dictatorship in 1970. He spent three years in a military prison on Pedras Blancas Island in the Guaiba River. He left jail in 1973 and resumed his career as a journalist. He contributed to the alternative newspapers MOVIMENTO and EM TEMPO and worked for the magazine NOVA and Tupi TV until 1977, when he went to work for the magazine EXAME. He left that job in 1988 to devote himself exclusively to the PT. Never since then has he entered an indoor soccer court. "Now I lead a sedentary life," he says. Falcao's sedentary life invariably begins at 0500. He sleeps only four hours or a maximum of five hours a night. In fact, he sleeps little, eats little, speaks little, and laughs little. He also spends little. Called a miser, he says he is a man who leads a simple life. His opponents view him as a negotiator who is tough and ordinarily intransigent and radical. He says no: "I'm not tough; I am a person with firm convictions," says Falcao, who even considers himself a moderate. He is skillful. "I know how to negotiate; I am a very reasonable coordinator." Falcao may be both. Journalists who knew him back when he was competing to head the Sao Paulo union say that he would not budge an inch from his positions while working fiercely to defeat his opponents. His enemies called him "the sinister dwarf." Falcao is slightly over 1.60 meters tall. Someone who worked with him at EXAME says he is a friendly colleague in everyday dealings. He was one of the chief opponents of the PT deputies who wanted to decide for themselves whether to participate in constitutional revision. Although accused of having "no play in his belt," Falcao showed at the convention that he can act according to circumstances--in this case, the presidential election. Falcao, who is a state deputy in Sao Paulo, is going to run for reelection: "As president-elect of the republic, Lula will be legally prevented from reassuming the presidency of the PT," he jokes, but he is serious.
