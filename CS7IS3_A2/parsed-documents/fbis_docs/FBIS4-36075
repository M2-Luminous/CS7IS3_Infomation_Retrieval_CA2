FBIS4-36075 "drnes109_n_94001" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Defense Minister on Israeli Raids, Resistance Defense Minister on Israeli Raids, Resistance NC0406074294 Cairo Voice of the Arabs in Arabic 0510 GMT 4 Jun 94 NC0406074294 Cairo Voice of the Arabs Arabic BFN [Telephone interview with Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul in al-Biqa' valley, by Ramadan Husayn in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] [Text] [Husayn] Mr. Minister, how is the security situation in light of the Israeli raids against southern Lebanon? [Dallul] Israel frequently perpetrates unjustified acts of aggression against Lebanon, its land, and its people--women, children, and the elderly. Lately, it has even burned crops to shake Lebanon, weaken its people, disturb its security and stability, and harm its sovereignty. We are looking to the world community and our Arab brothers. We urgently need their help and support. We are also waiting for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility, and we expect the world to condemn the Israeli aggressions. What sin have the children, women and old men committed that they should be shelled? Recently, Israel attacked our children with 500-kg and 1000-kg bombs. The soil, the crops, and the rocks have turned black. Israel burned the crops that are the only livelihood of the sons of Lebanon. [Husayn] Has Lebanon held contacts with the Security Council permanent members and other influential parties to stop the Israeli aggressions? [Dallul] We have filed a complaint with the UN Security Council, and we have held contacts with the permanent members. We also informed all influential countries of the Israeli acts of aggression against the people of Lebanon. We hope the world, especially the Security Council, will react favorably by condemning Israel and forcing it to stop these repeated acts of aggression against our people and land. [Husayn] Mr. Minister, what do you think are the objectives of the Israeli raids? [Dallul] Israel wants to cause cracks in Lebanese society. It wants to continue its occupation of Lebanese territory, and it wants to force us to confront the Resistance, which is performing its duty against the occupation. Resistance is a legitimate right of every people whose land is occupied. This has happened in Europe and the entire world. When territory comes under occupation, the people of this territory must confront the occupation. Resistance is a legitimate right of our people, and what we are doing is a cry in the face of the occupier, a cry that it leave our land and stop its aggression against our people. Israel also wants to stir up domestic sedition in Lebanese society. But the people of Lebanon are confronting the aggressions with a united position bordering on heroism.
