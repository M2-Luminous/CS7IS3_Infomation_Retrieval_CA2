A report by Ukraine's State Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power circulated today says that unless the situation improves, Ukraine will have to decommission 3.8 million kilowatts-worth of power-generating facilities, or one-third of its nuclear capacity, in 1994, and all of its nuclear power stations in 1995. In order to find a way out of this contingency, it is necessary to immediately pay Russia's enterprises over 48 billion rubles for new fuel.
