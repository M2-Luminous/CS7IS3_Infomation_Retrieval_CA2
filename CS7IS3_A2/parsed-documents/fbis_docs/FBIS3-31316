Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] opened today's regular news briefing with these words. Apart from the present internal arguments between the opposition and the government, journalists focused on tomorrow's 26th Session of the [Slovak] National Council and the proposed constitutional bill, submitted yesterday [14 Feb], to shorten the parliamentary term. At the end of the news conference, SDL chairman Peter Weiss answered some questions by correspondent Ivan Samel. [Samel] Chairman, it seems that the political crisis in Slovakia is nearing a climax. What solutions are going to be sought by the SDL as it enters this period? [Weiss] It must be said that this political crisis was provoked by the HZDS itself, through its inability to democratically manage the emerging different strands of opinion within the party and its leadership's subjective lack of readiness to cooperate with other political parties. I do not understand the hysterics that took hold of a section of the mass media when the possibility was mentioned of expressing no confidence in this government. I do not know why Slovakia should be in danger, as today's headlines in the REPUBLIKA note, just because one group of government officials would be replaced in the next elections. This would happen if a vote of no-confidence is passed in accordance with the Constitution. After all, Slovakia is not Meciar, and Meciar is not Slovakia. Our premise is that it is first of all necessary to call early elections. This is the basic factor that would settle the internal political situation. The second condition to ease the internal political situation is, in our opinion, the passing of the large-scale privatization bill, in the form in which it was agreed with opposition forces. [passage omitted] [Weiss] There are many considerations that favor the holding of the fall elections. First, it would not be good if the Slovak election campaign were to run in parallel with the election campaign in the Hungarian Republic, as the center of attention would shift only to ethnic matters and national passions could rise. Moreover, it is necessary to gain some time to correct the basic political mistakes and mistaken decisions of this government. If elections were to be called for June, there would be a permanent election campaign starting from February. It might lead to destabilization of the situation in society, meaning that all attention would be focused only on the election campaign and not on the resolution of the problems that must be tackled. Finally, citizens should be shown that there are other ways of governing and modes of cooperation between political parties-- besides the model of one against everyone--and of the promotion only of one's own political view and interest.
