With his usual directness and without concessions, the minister indicated that the responsibility for the salary increase does not lie with the executive branch and he criticized those who are pressuring Congress during an election year to obtain benefits. "The executive branch has had to say no to salary demands, not only from the university but other sectors too, basically due to two factors: Because it does not have the money and because the Constitution wisely prevents the granting of salary increases in an election year in order to avoid demagogic pressure and weaknesses," the minister said. He stressed that the interpretative law prevents this unconstitutionality and provides the resources. "Anyway, I believe there is nothing good in pressuring Congress during an election year in order to obtain salary increases," Posadas stressed. When he was asked if the law would be viable if it provides the resources, the minister said: "All of this undoubtedly means a greater sacrifice for the people." He did not wish to guarantee whether the executive branch would veto the "interpretative law" if it is approved today in the Chamber of Deputies and finally promulgated. "I am part of the executive branch, but I am not the executive branch; so let us see what is resolved," he said. Posadas added that the executive branch is not authorized to disperse funds to serve this type of demand. "In these matters arguments are always used that are not in keeping with reality. It is said: We defend the university, which is being attacked by the executive branch. The executive branch does not attack the university, and this (conflict) is definitely not being carried out to defend the university. These are people who are asking for higher salaries (and) this is not a bad thing, but it is the truth. To make a big uproar to defend the university is somewhat conspicuous," he said. "There is definitely not much heroism in this because who is going to pay? Those who are making the demands -- of course not; you (the taxpayers) are going to pay because now we complete the vicious circle: The executive branch has no money in its pockets, it has no money of its own. If they oblige it to pay more, well then the executive branch is going to take the money from you; there is no other way," he emphasized. When he was asked how conflicts such as the university conflict are resolved, he said: "The solution to conflicts must come from those who create them because here we have another very curious thing: A conflict is generated and then they go and ask the other party how to resolve it; (the conflict) was not my idea."
