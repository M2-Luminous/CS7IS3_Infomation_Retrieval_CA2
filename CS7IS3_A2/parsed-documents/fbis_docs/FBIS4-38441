The Army is chronically financed improperly and begins to lag behind rivals technically because it is too big for Russian resources. Gaydar spoke on Saturday at a Moscow conference of supporters of forming a party on the basis of Russia's Choice. Gaydar said Russia inherited from the Soviet Union an army that is meant for an absolutely different number of conscripts. "We are trying to adjust the number of conscripts to the number of our generals instead of doing it the other way round", Gaydar said. "We need a well-armed, well-paid, well-fed professional and respected army, but it should be notably reformed for the purpose", Gaydar said. According to him, if this problem is not resolved the problems of raising taxes and curtailing inflation will never be resolved and the country will continue printing worthless money. Meanwhile, Russia's Choice, Gaydar said, does not support the proposal to boost the defence budget to 55 billion rubles. During the coming budget debate in the Duma Gaydar intends to insist on the submission to parliament of a program of cuts in armed forces.
