This was stated by Gabor Kuncze, faction leader and prime minister candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], at a news conference on 10 March where he reported on the three-member party delegation's visit to Romania which had ended on 9 March. At the talks with the SZDSZ's delegation, general secretary of the Bucharest government Viorel Hrebenciuc, who is considered to be President Iliescu's most influential adviser, held out the possibility of reassessing the clemency applications of the condemned people. A promise was also made about opening two more border crossing points in 1994, and Senate chairman Oliviu Gherman admitted that it was advisable to expedite the ratification of the already signed bilateral agreements on investment protection and the avoidance of dual taxation. The SZDSZ delegation explained to its hosts that a general improvement in bilateral relations could be achieved together with settling the national minority issue. In reply to MAGYAR HIRLAP's question, Kuncze said that according to the original program, they should have met Prime Minister Vacaroiu but the Romanian side canceled the meeting due to the government reshuffle in Bucharest. During the talks with the leaders of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in Romanian] and the mayors of Harghita and Covasna counties, the Free Democrats said that, if their party becomes a governmental factor, they would continue to keep the issue of the Hungarians in Romania on the agenda in an institutionalized form and in terms of standards, but they would certainly not wish to influence the RMDSZ's political line. Kuncze also said that the mayor of Marcelhaza [Marcelova] had to cancel Kuncze's planned visit on 15 March because of the conflicts between the Hungarian organizations in Slovakia. Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, parliamentary deputy of the SZDSZ who was also part of the delegation, said to MAGYAR HIRLAP that all the RMDSZ leaders agree with the concept according to which the Free Democrats handle the system of relations with Romania. He added that the classical legal theory of liberalism was indeed solely based on individual rights. However, the modern liberal view has reached the point of recognizing that certain rights can only be guaranteed if they are linked to some community. Therefore, in the SZDSZ, the view now prevails that, in the issue of the minorities over the border, progress has to be made toward making collective rights recognized. Szent-Ivanyi admitted that his Bucharest negotiating partners touched upon the unresolved situation of the parliamentary representation of national minorities in Hungary. However, the SZDSZ delegation explained that further talks are being held in Hungary on this issue and, on the other hand, the legal provisions that have been enacted in Hungary -- mainly the law on national minorities -- are still to be achieved by the parliaments of the neighboring countries.
