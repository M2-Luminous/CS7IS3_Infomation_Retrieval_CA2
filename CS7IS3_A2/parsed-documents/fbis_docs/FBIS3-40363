Numerous problems must be solved for this, so that the enterprises which until now were oriented more toward the former East Block can learn, for example, to compete for industrial contracts from the European Space Agency, ESA. The first successes by the DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] and Zeiss company group in Jena with high-performance optoelectronic telescopes and satellite components are stimulating this difficult adjustment process. In order to accelerate this development, the German Space Agency (DARA) in Bonn recently arranged an industrial conference especially for those newly founded enterprises which also deal with satellite projects. What is involved is about 60 companies with 10,000 employees, some of which often have only a few dozen people working in this field, however. DARA itself has supported the reorganization of the socialist research structures from the beginning, of course, and fought for the preservation of the highly qualified technical and scientific space capabilities in the new laender. Accordingly, this year DARA has distributed about 16 percent of the national space flight budget of about 350 million German marks [DM] to enterprises in eastern Germany and thus almost achieved a percentage which corresponds to the population figure. Three years after unification this is regarded as a very good integration result in the national space flight sector. On the international level, this inclusion of the eastern German satellite industry has not been very successful, however. To begin with, it involves concrete aid, such as how the new laender should actually apply to ESA for project participation. A complicated formalism is required for this, which can only be mastered after some practice. It begins with the special English-American expressions and does not even begin to end with the knowledge of the ramifications of the European space flight industry. Concrete help is urgently needed, because in 1993 eastern German companies were only able to obtain ESA contracts worth DM 1 million for preparatory studies. That is only a tenth of a percent of the German contribution of more than DM 1 billion to the European space flight organization this year. In order to increase this share significantly, DARA, together with German Aerospace, recently invited ESA's director general Jean-Marie Luton to Jena-Optronik in Thuringia, and Luton expressed himself quite impressed by the technical capability and the involvement of the approximately 100 employees, who previously developed and built special cameras and other optoelectronic equipment for Russian space projects. The French research politician gave assurances that in the future the eastern German enterprises should have the same chance to obtain space flight contracts within the European framework as other ESA nations. The companies in Jena and other locations will get concrete opportunities for larger contracts as soon as the German and European space flight cooperation with Russia really gets under way, because that is where the eastern German experts, with their Russian knowledge and the experience they acquired at the time of the GDR with projects in the East Block, have clear advantages. Jena-Optik therefore calculates that it has good chances for getting several ESA contracts amounting to about DM 25 million next year. Above all, they involve the Omos-Ozone telescope for the Envisat satellite for atmospheric and earth reconnaissance, as well as a solar sensor for the Artemis communications satellite and components for the XMM X-ray telescope, which will be launched at the very end of the 1990s. Another important project for including eastern German capabilities in European space flight is being proposed by the Carl Zeiss company in Jena. This involves an astronomical telescope which is to be used for experiments in optical data transmission with the European Artemis communications satellite. This instrument is based on several other telescopes, which were previously built by VEB Carl Zeiss Jena for several observatories in the East. The telescope has received improved electronic controls and additional equipment for laser experiments. Despite the general economic problems, in the last few years a number of western German companies in the space flight industry have become involved in the new laender by taking over companies there with a similar production range or by founding new branch offices. This applies not only to large companies such as Deutsche Aerospace or Carl Zeiss, but also to medium-sized systems enterprises such as OHB-Bremen and Kayser-Thede, Munich, as well as to many small companies.
