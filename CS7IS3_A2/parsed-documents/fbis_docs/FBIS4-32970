"I do not share such a catastrophic outlook; not only will we be a competitive party but a winning party," the PRI presidential candidate said. The presidential hopeful also mentioned his visit to the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and said the arguments made by members of the University Student Council (CEU) -- that the university's autonomy had been violated -- "speak for themselves," because apparently some members of the CEU participated in violent acts, and "I suppose they must feel very embarrassed about their conduct in view of how they are being condemned by other parts of the university." Zedillo insisted he was at UNAM "under absolutely normal conditions" and said political arguments that try to make it seem otherwise do not jive with UNAM's tradition of culture, plurality, and tolerance. He noted: "I was respectful, knowing full well that other candidates had already been there -- Zedillo was the first PRI candidate in UNAM's history to campaign there -- and I believe, for the university students, this has been a break with an intolerant past, a past where a minority infringed on the rights of a majority." Zedillo explained that as a public official, he had visited the School of Economics once, the School of Chemistry three times, and research centers several times under exactly similar conditions. In a meeting with reporters who are covering his presidential campaign activities shortly before traveling to the pro-PAN [National Action Party] state of Chihuahua, Zedillo answered other questions, all of them linked to expectations about the results of August's federal elections. [EL FINANCIERO] Perhaps we are on the verge of entering a period in which the percentage of votes won by the winning presidential candidate will be less than 50 percent, which would break new historical ground. Are we ready for this? Will the PRI continue to be a strong party with this kind of percentage of the vote? [Zedillo] The PRI is competing with eight parties. The Constitution does not include any particular provision on voting percentages; the Constitution refers to a relative, not an absolute, majority. The Constitution and the law clearly establish who wins the elections and how they are won. I am very concerned about this obsession with percentages. The Constitution is very clear. We are just going to enforce the law. In a good mood, Zedillo answered reporters' questions and said his new invitation to opposition candidates that another debate be held is not a matter of seeing who extends the invitation first. He said: "The thing is to hold the debate, but I have no doubt in my mind that on 24 April I called for a debate and on 12 May reiterated my call. For a minute there, they had me as the loser." He said that he has still not received a formal response, adding that he hopes all candidates agree to a new debate. A difficult issue to face was the internal conflict within the PRI during the selection process for candidates to Congress. Zedillo termed these irregularities or incidents as "normal for a party with the PRI's democratic and decisive participation." Zedillo remarked that according to the PRI's past experiences and those of other parties now, the PRI "has had an exemplary process." He hopes these will be isolated events, although in the end the number of conflicts is minimal compared to the complexity of the very process. [EL FINANCIERO] Are there risks of breaks or a repeat of what happened in 1988? [Zedillo] No, in the process held three years ago [number as published] there were more incidents than there are now. Given circumstances in the country, it is an exemplary process; these incidents are normal. There is freedom in the party, and I am satisfied and do not foresee a risk. To the contrary, I see a united party, a party strengthened to wage the campaign we need to wage to give it our best shot. Zedillo emphasized that he does not agree with the catastrophic vision of the country. Mexico has made considerable progress and although it is facing serious problems, the population is recognizing its own effort, Zedillo added. And he concluded: "I think the basic conditions, those that count in an electoral process will allow us to move toward an orderly electoral process, in terms of legality, and, in the PRI's case, with a strong and united party."
