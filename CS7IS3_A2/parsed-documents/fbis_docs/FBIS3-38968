Shortly before the meeting of the NATO Council in Brussels today, senior officials hoped for the full implementation of UN Resolution 836, which asked NATO to establish protection zones. According to the officials, this also includes protection of convoys transporting humanitarian aid, which has not been guaranteed so far. Officials believe this would also mean clearing the path for the convoys by forcibly removing blockades. Combat helicopters might be used for this purpose ("close air support"). Unlike air strikes, these measures would be covered by the existing mandate and would not require a new Security Council resolution, which would be difficult to achieve at the moment in view of the negative attitude of Russia and other permanent members. According to the Chancellor's Office, the full utilization of the existing mandate would improve the credibility of the West, and a higher deterrence effect would be achieved. Public demands for large-scale air strikes, recently voiced on television by Bernd Schmidbauer, the minister in the Chancellor's Office, who is responsible for the intelligence services, have met with great reservations. Schmidbauer's view is not shared by others at the Chancellor's Office, it has become known.
