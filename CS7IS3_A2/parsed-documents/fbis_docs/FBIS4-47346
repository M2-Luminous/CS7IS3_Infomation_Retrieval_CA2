Mordasov, Tambov Chemical Engineering Institute; UDC 532.137:53.082.32] [Abstract] The urgency of pneumatic monitoring of the physical and chemical properties of liquid media in production systems, e.g., by using a rigid-wall chamber-type transducer (KPP), prompted the development of an immersible capillary automatic viscosimeter which realizes the pneumatic method of measuring the liquid outflow through the capillary. The design and operating principle of the new instrument are described in detail, and a schematic diagram is cited. A system of differential equations which describes the processes in the automatic viscosity-to-pneumatic signal transducer is derived, and the equation's coefficients are summarized in a table. The device has a measurement range of (0.5-2.5)[.sup].[/]10[.sup]-3[/] m[.sup]2[/]s[.sup]-1[/] at a temperature of 20ï¿½C, a response of 87[.sup].[/]10[.sup]-3[/] s/m[.sup]2[/]s[.sup]-1[/], and a basic adjusted error of 3.5%. The pneumatic rectangular output signal has a duration equal to the monitored liquid outflow doze duration; the primary signal is converted by a secondary transducer into viscosity readings in a digital form. The automatic capillary viscosimeter's operations can be analyzed theoretically. Figures 1; tables 2; references 6.
