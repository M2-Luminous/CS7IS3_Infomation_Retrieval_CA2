Poland's ambassador to France, Jerzy Lukaszewski, told a press conference with his Hungarian counterpart Janos Szavai that they wanted their countries' membership in the military alliance to be considered at a WEU ministerial meeting in May. The two countries are already members of the Partnership for Peace initiative, which gives former Warsaw Pact members closer cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, ultimately with a view to full NATO membership. Thursday's press conference was called ahead of the two countries' official applications to join the European Union, both due to be handed in in early April. They hope to become members by 2000. Lukaszewski said EU membership would provide "the best way...of ensuring a democratic future and security" for his country, as well as "something useful for the European Union."
