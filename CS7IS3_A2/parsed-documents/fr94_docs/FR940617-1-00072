FR940617-1-00072 FR940617-1-00012 Another comment from the manufacturer of triclosan submitted validation reports and raw data from a 2-year chronic oral toxicity study in rats, and carcinogenicity and reproduction studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys by Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories (IBT) (Refs. 4, 5, and 6) and asserted that its validation of the studies shows that triclosan is safe. Several comments objected to the agency's restriction at 43 FR 1229 that antimicrobial soaps containing triclosan can only be formulated in a bar soap to be used with water (Ref. 1). The comments argued that such a restriction was not applied to the other Category III uses of triclosan, i.e. , skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant, and that such a restriction was not recommended by the Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The comments suggested that the footnote under ``antimicrobial soaps'' limiting triclosan to bar soap was probably intended to apply to cloflucarban, which, like triclocarban, is known for its ``physical and/or chemical incompatibility.'' With regard to safety, the agency evaluated the validation reports to support long-term use of the ingredient (Refs. 4, 5, and 6) and advised the manufacturer of triclosan that the IBT studies were invalid because of numerous problems. The agency's detailed comments and evaluation on the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 7). The manufacturer subsequently stated its intent to no longer rely on the 2-year chronic oral toxicity IBT study (Ref. 8), and submitted a final report from a new 2-year chronic oral toxicity study in rats (Ref. 9). The agency has determined that the study data are unacceptable as the sole evidence of the safety of the long-term use of triclosan as a health-care personnel handwash or surgical handscrub based on the marginal survival of the animals in both the control and treated groups and uncertainties about the dose and study conduct. Therefore, data from another chronic exposure study are necessary to assess the safety of the long-term use of triclosan. The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 10). A subsequent submission from the same manufacturer contained the final report of a two-generation study of the reproductive toxicity of triclosan in rats (Ref. 11). These data are currently being reviewed by the agency and will be discussed in the final rule for these drug products. Triclosan remains classified as Category III for safety for long-term use. The agency concluded in the amended tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 at 33665) that triclosan (in concentrations up to 1.0 percent) is safe for short term use as a first aid antiseptic (formerly designated as skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). The data reviewed (Ref. 1) also support the safety of triclosan (up to 1.0 percent) for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. However, with regard to safety for use as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub, triclosan remains classified in Category III for safety for long-term use, as stated above. With regard to effectiveness, in the previous tentative final monograph the agency classified triclosan as Category II for use as a health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub because triclosan has limited activity against gram-negative bacteria. For example, triclosan is the subject of a patent (patent No. 3,616,256) for use in culture media for isolating Pseudomonas . Because human skin is regarded as a superb ``culture medium,'' the possibility was raised (43 FR 1210 at 1232) that triclosan might selectively promote overgrowth of Pseudomonas on the hands of health-care personnel. Based upon data reviewed, the agency advised that in vitro data demonstrate that triclosan's antibacterial spectrum can be broadened, to be effective against Pseudomonas when triclosan is properly formulated with anionic surfactants to form a ``synergistic mixture.'' Therefore, FDA reclassified triclosan (up to 1.0 percent, with the lower limit to be determined) from Category II to Category III for effectiveness. The agency further advised that additional studies are needed before triclosan can be generally recognized as effective for specific uses, i.e. , surgical hand scrub, health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and first aid uses (formerly designated as skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 12).
