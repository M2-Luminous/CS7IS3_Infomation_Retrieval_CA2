'Oded Ben-'Ami, the prime minister's spokesman, said that 'Arafat's speech in Johannesburg casts doubts on his sincerity with regard to the peace agreement. Ben-'Ami noted that Israel will put off the negotiations on the second stage of the agreement with the Palestinians until the PLO consolidates its rule in Gaza and Jericho. In response, PLO member Jamil al-Tarifi said that any delay in the implementation of the next stage of the autonomy will constitute a deviation from the agreement.
