"I do not think there will be an extension of the Diet term," Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of New Party Sakigake [Shinto Sakigake], told a luncheon at the Japan National Press Club. Although the government must have wanted to submit an as-yet-unformulated bill that redraws the electoral map for the lower house and to extend the 150-day Diet session, it runs short of time, he said. "Therefore, there will be no need to extend the Diet term for debate on key issues," said Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary in the last government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The 15-member Sakigake left the governing coalition in April due to differences over major policies and political approach with other coalition partners. The administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Japan's first minority government since 1955, once appeared ready to extend the current Diet session and act upon the redistricting legislation in a move to avoid a possible no-confidence motion from the opposition camp. The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party has made it clear it plans to bring down the Hata government in a no-confidence vote. The Social Democratic Party, the second-largest opposition force, has also threatened to submit the motion by itself.
