According to Chitty La Roche, acting in contradiction to what is prescribed by the present Constitution would be the same as carrying out a coup d'etat. For that reason, he disagrees with Medina's statements. In the opinion of the Social Christian parliamentarian, Congress should concern itself with "legislating for the people"; he argues that "the National Constitution is an esoteric concept for people who live in slums." Despite that statement, Chitty La Roche does not oppose reforming the present Constitution, although he advocates doing so in a more gradual way than what Deputy Medina has proposed. Chitty La Roche also reiterated the need to legislate for the people's interests, mentioning in this regard the need to amend the Mortgage Debtor Law, among others. Finally, the Social Christian deputy said: "The procedures for constitutional revision, amendment, and reform are set forth in the Constitution, and we can offer our support only for those procedures, unless we are to begin the French revolutionary process and call for the abolition of all institutions, with liberty to begin by prohibiting everything. And especially by prohibiting prohibitions."
