The newspaper GRANMA published the document on its front page today which notes that the objective of the meeting will be to analyze the country's internal financial situation. The holding of the important Cuban parliament meeting was suggested by President Fidel Castro, on delivering the closing speech at the plenum of the national committee of the Cuban Workers Federation, which began early this week. The workers plenum -- known here as the workers parliament -- reviewed a vast analysis process in work centers on the island, the purpose of which was to have the participants propose possible solutions to the current primary national economic problems. The suggestions of over 3 million workers participating in the meetings, as the Cuban president has said, will be considered in the upcoming sessions of deputies, who will adopt a series of economic measures aimed at improving the country's internal financial situation and boosting its economic efficiency.
