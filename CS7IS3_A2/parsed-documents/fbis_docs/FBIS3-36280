The spaceship "touched" the station because "methods for maneuvers had not been optimised on the ground". "Nothing would have happened if methods suggested by us were used", he said. A special commission inquired into the incident. It has become known from reliable sources that a draft decision has already been prepared and will be signed in the coming days. Serebrov believes that the blame for the incident is expected to be laid on the cosmonauts, whereas only one member of the commission met him to get first-hand information. In the opinion of a number of experts, the psychological aspect should be also taken into account because Tsibliyev and Serebrov were due to return to the earth way back in November but had their space mission extended by almost two months (in all, they stayed in orbit for 197 days) owing to difficulties in the timely supply of booster rockets. It was literally at the last moment that the cosmonauts got an assignment to fly over the station and photograph it. "The value the orbital complex has grown very much of late. Besides, it will be actively used to implement a Mir-Shuttle international programme. Therefore it is necessary to be very careful to rule out such incidents in the future," Viktor Legostayev, deputy chief designer of the Energia scientific and production amalgamation, told ITAR-TASS, emphasising that the station, which has been in orbit since 1986, is very reliable and withstood not only the contact but also a recent meteoric shower. Nevertheless, Tsibliyev's and Serebrov's work in orbit was cited by space sector chiefs who attended a ceremonial meeting marking the cosmonauts' return to earth. The chiefs thanked the crew of the 14th main expeditlion for the succesful accomplishment of all research and experiements and congratulated them on being decorated with high state awards. Tsibliyev will be 40 and Serebrov will be 50 later this month.
