FBIS4-7343 "dreas083_c_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 North Korea Chongnyon Offices in Osaka Raided by Police Chongnyon Offices in Osaka Raided by Police Police Search Denounced SK2704044494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0427 GMT 27 Apr 94 SK2704044494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (KNS-KCNA) -- Chief vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), Ho Chong-man, called an emergency press conference in Tokyo on April 25 regarding the forcible search of the Osaka Prefectural headquarters and branches of Chongnyon by the Japanese police, at which he read out a statement in the name of the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee. The statment said: At about 07:20 on April 25, the Osaka Prefectural police brought 56 mobile cars with more than 1,300 policemen to the prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and made a forcible search of the headquarters' hall after creating an atmosphere of terror around the headquarters. On the other hand, the Osaka Prefectural police forced the same search at branches of the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon. The massive crackdown on the headquarters and branches of Chongnyon were the first of their kind in 39 years after the formation of Chongnyon. This shows how openly the Japanese authorities are suppressing Chongnyon. Drawing attention to the fact that the Japanese reactionary authorities got more frantic in suppressing Chongnyon when nuclear row against the DPRK was being intensified, the statement said: The Japanese Government must renounce at once its hostile policy towards the DPRK and repressive policy against the Korean residents in Japan. We demand that the Japanese Government and police stop immediately their unjustifiable suppression of Chongnyon and apologize for it. We regard the illegal crackdown this time as a grave provocation against the Korean people. On the same day, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of Chongnyon and chairman of its Osaka Prefectural headquarters, called a press conference and denounced the crackdown by the Japanese police.
