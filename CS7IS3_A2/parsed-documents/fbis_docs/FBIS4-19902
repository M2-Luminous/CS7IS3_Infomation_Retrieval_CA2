In an interview to be aired Saturday [23 April] on TRT-2, Cindoruk said that today's problems in Turkey were similar to a solar eclipse. The Parliament's public relations office said today that during the interview, Cindoruk said Turkey's future will `certainly be bright.' `I share the opinion of citizens that there is an excess of political parties and this prevents democracy from being genuine,' he said. `Mergers among right and left wing parties would prevent a political extravagance.' There are 25 political parties registered in Turkey. Of these, 11 have seats in parliament.
