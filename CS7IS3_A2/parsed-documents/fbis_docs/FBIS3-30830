The location of the remaining five bases should be confirmed by the government in March. Caslav and Namest nad Oslavou (supersonic aircraft), Prerov (helicopters), Pardubice (training base), and Kbely (transportation base) will obviously be involved. According to Defense Ministry officials who attended a meeting with local mayors, the airfields' fate was determined by strategic-economic considerations and by the willingness of towns and communities to live in their proximity. Caslav is still putting up resistance, but, despite this, has not rid itself of the aircraft. "We will probably have to come to terms with this," adds Mayor P. Prochazka. "The soldiers are appealing for our understanding, and, of course, they have presented us with a fait accompli. How are we then supposed to convince citizens that the base is in the defense interests of the state?" Operations at military airfields that do not meet health standards should be legalized at the end of the year by a law incorporating health-care programs for citizens affected by air operations. It is envisaged that noise-protection zones, the frequency and periodicity of measuring noise levels around airfields, construction-free zones, and financial compensation to alleviate the consequences of air operations will also be determined.
