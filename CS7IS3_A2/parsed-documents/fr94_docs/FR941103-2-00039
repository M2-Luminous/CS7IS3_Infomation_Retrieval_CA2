Take notice that on October 20, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;28&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205, 157.216 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216, 157.212) for authorization to abandon certain facilities and to construct and operate upgraded replacement facilities, under TGPL's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;426&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. TGPL proposed to expand its existing Gordonsville, Louisa County, Virginia Delivery Point (Gordonsville) by removing and retiring the existing meter station and constructing a new meter station and two twelve-inch taps at milepost 1523.38 on its ``B'' and ``C'' main lines. TGPL states that it currently delivers up to 2,000 Mcf of gas per day, on a firm basis, to Commonwealth Gas Services, Inc. (Commonwealth) at Gordonsville. TGPL asserts that the new facilities would enable it to deliver an additional 67,000 Mcf of gas per day, on an interruptible basis, to Commonwealth. TGPL mentions that Commonwealth would deliver up to 66,500 Mcf/day of this gas to a new cogeneration plant to be owned by Gordonsville Energy Limited Partnership and up to 500 Mcf/day to the City of Gordonsville. TGPL avers that it has sufficient system delivery flexibility to accomplish these additional deliveries at Gordonsville without detriment to its other customers and that it is not proposing to alter the total volumes of gas authorized for delivery to Commonwealth. TGPL states that the estimated cost of the proposed facilities is $1,333,537 and the Commonwealth would reimburse TGPL for all costs associated with these facilities. TGPL also asserts that it would obtain all required environmental clearances prior to the commencement of any abandonment or construction work in the vicinity of Gordonsville. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
