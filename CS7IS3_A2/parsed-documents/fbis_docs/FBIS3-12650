A responsible Palestinian source has said he has received a written approval of this stand by these four PLO Executive Committee members from both al-Hut and al-Hasan. In a separate development, nine Palestinian popular unions, namely, the Palestinian Workers Union, the Palestinian Teachers Union, the Palestinian Students Union, the Palestinian Women's Union, the Palestinian Writers and Journalists Union, the Palestinian Plastic Arts Union, the Palestinian Peasants Union, the Palestinian Artists Union, and the Palestinian Physicians and Pharmacists Union, concluded their joint meeting in Tunis on 1 March. These unions issued a statement, a copy of which was obtained by AL-RA'Y. The unions held Israel responsible for the massacre at holy Ibrahimi Mosque. The statement urged the Arab nation to shoulder its pan-Arab and historical responsibility toward the Palestinian people to enable them to maintain their steadfastness until the achievement of their inalienable rights to self-determination, repatriation, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The statement urged the United States, in its capacity as a cosponsor of the peace conference, and U.S. President Clinton to end their unlimited support of the Israeli Government. The statement also called on the UN Security Council to take immediate and practical measures to dispatch a protection force to the occupied territories to protect our people from the crimes of Israeli aggressors.
