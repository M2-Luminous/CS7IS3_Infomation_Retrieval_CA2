The head of the Maronite Catholic community, Monsignor Nasrallah Sfayr, was to lead their funeral service at the devastated Our Lady of Deliverance Church in Zuq Mikha'il, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Beirut. Shops, schools and banks kept their doors shut in the capital and other towns following Sunday's attack, which came three months before a visit by the pope and was the first of its kind on a church in Lebanon. State-run and private radio and television stations cancelled their regular programmes to broadcast classical music to honour the dead in the attack just two days after the Hebron massacre. Church bells rang in the southern port city of Tyre, while Palestinians in the 'Ayn al-Hulwah refugee camp near Sidon, Lebanon's largest, joined in the day of mourning. Businesses and schools closed in Israel's "security zone" along the border and the pro-Israeli Voice of the South also played classical music. "We have to close down out of respect for the dead. It's the least we can do," said the manager of a take-away pizza restaurant in Beirut. "God help us. What's going to happen to us next?" said an interior designer who still bears the scars of a leg injury suffered during Lebanon's civil war of 1975 to 1990. A four-year-old girl was among those killed when a five-kilogram (11-pound) bomb attached to two mortar shells and a timing device exploded during a Lent mass in Zuq Mikha'il. The church was packed with worshippers. Father Antoine Sfayr who was leading the service was among 55 people wounded in the explosion, which rocked the church as he began reading from the scriptures. US President Bill Clinton, Jordan's King Husayn and Pope John Paul II joined in condemnation of the attack. There was no claim of responsibility but an unidentified suspect was arrested, prosecutor Tarabayh Rahmah announced late Sunday after an emergency meeting of security officials which included Syrian officers. The authorities were aware of "a plan to commit attacks in places of worship in Lebanon," Rahmah said, noting that the suspect was arrested a few days before the blast. Lebanese newspapers, echoing officials here and in Syria, pointed an accusing finger at Israel and linked the attack to the massacre Friday of 52 Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron on the occupied West Bank. "Israel observed the Sabbath on Saturday and pursued on Sunday what it had begun on Friday: blood flowed at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron and in Our Lady of Deliverance Church," said the pro-Syrian daily AL-SAFIR. The newspaper charged that the attack was aimed at sowing the discord between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon. "If no one conquers Israel on its own territory, we must conquer Israeli logic, its agents and its plans on our own territory," the pro-government AL-NAHAR said in an editorial. Another pro-government daily, AL-LIWA', said the aim of the attacks in Hebron and Zuq Mikha'il were to "torpedo the peace process," which came to a halt on Sunday as Arab delegates cut short negotiations with Israel in Washington. President Hafiz al-Asad of Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon, pledged in a telephone call late Sunday to his Lebanese counterpart Ilyas al-Hirawi to help track down the bombers. "Harm done to Lebanon is like harm done to Syria," Asad told al-Hirawi.
