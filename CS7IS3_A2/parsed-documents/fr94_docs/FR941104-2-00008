Five dry hydrants will be installed to increase the fire fighting capabilities by decreasing the distance travelled and time needed to access water during a fire. The Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency. The basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Mr. Paul H. Calverley. The FONSI has been sent to various Federal, State and local agencies, and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the address stated on the previous page. No administrative action on the proposal will be initiated until 30 days after the date of this publication in the Federal Register .
