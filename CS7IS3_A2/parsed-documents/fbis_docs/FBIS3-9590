In addition to the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, and presidency members, the session was attended by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, government members, Reis-ul-Ulema Mustafa Efendija Ceric, our ambassadors in foreign countries, commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army corps, and other eminent guests and members of the SDA's main committee. Alija Izetbegovic announced at the session that he was returning to lead the Party of Democratic Action. [passage omitted] At the extended session of the SDA's main committee, which is some kind of convention, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic spoke about another important topic: Bosnia-Herzegovina today and tomorrow and Bosniak Muslims in it. [Begin Silajdzic recording] I would like to stress that the [Washington] agreement is not the result only of the negotiations held in the past two months in Frankfurt, Vienna, and Washington, but primarily of the readiness of our people to persist on the path which demands great sacrifices -- that is it is a result of the sacrifices of our people -- of the army's readiness to respond to the aggression successfully, and, of course, of the principled policy implemented by the state leaders throughout that period, including intensive diplomatic activity, which was, for understandable reasons, not always publicly announced. I would like to stress that the agreement does not suspend, and does not even bring into the question, the existing international and legal status of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders. The adoption of the constitution of the federation, which was drafted as part of the (?conclusive) agreements, will have no impact on this. The Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina remains -- as an internationally recognized state -- the only legal and legitimate entity in the peace process on this area. Of course, if the so-called Serb side joins the agreement, the federation will be established throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its international status will be indisputable because this is an internal transformation of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If the Serb side does not accept the agreement, the process of searching for a peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue, and in that process the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its bodies retain the status which they have had so far. Consequently, the establishment of the federation in the areas inhabited by a majority Bosniak and Croat population does not automatically mean that the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina ceases to exist. I am stressing this because many people wondered whether the establishment of the federation abolishes the international status of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording] At the end of the lengthy explanation of the Washington agreement, Silajdzic talked about a number of important goals to which this document will open the way for the Bosniak people. [Begin Silajdzic recording] First, the agreement means the defeat of the strategy of Serb aggressors who counted on a split between Bosniaks and Croats, and who benefited most from the conflict. The agreement also means the defeat of the exponents of extreme Croat nationalism, i.e., the victory of those political forces among the Croatian people who realized that the conflict was detrimental to the interests of both Croats and Bosniaks. Third, by overcoming the conflict and reaching an agreement, we have struck a very important strategic balance which considerably restricts the activities of aggressive Serb nationalism, turning it into a [word indistinct] political project without a future. Fourth, the agreement is an important step toward removing the consequences of ethnic cleansing. It creates legal and political prerequisites for the return of all refugees in the territory of the federation and the implementation of this agreement will create realistic conditions for this to be achieved. Fifth, the agreement is also important from the point of view of prospects for the fastest possible return of refugees and this is exceptionally important for Bosniaks. Sixth, the constitutional principles contained in the agreement and decisions in principle regarding the political and territorial organization of the federation do not allow for the fragmentation of natural and economic entities which is of far-reaching economic and political importance. Eighth [as heard], the agreement contains solutions which allow for the effective and economically purposeful exploitation of major natural resources, not restricting them within a narrow regional framework. Ninth, the access to the sea is being resolved in a way which is acceptable to both sides, which is of vital importance for us. Tenth, the agreement considerably strengthens our position in a future peace process, i.e., it strengthens our ability to later resolve the issue of the occupied territories, as well as the issue of the Bosniaks living outside the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Eleventh, the agreement above all means the reaffirmation of a positive attitude toward the Bosniaks and it means accepting the Bosniaks as a nation which belongs to the European community of nations and which has its place in global relations. Twelfth, taken as a whole, the agreement opens up realistic prospects for the survival and development of the Bosniak people, instead of the destruction and extermination which had been intended for us.
