I thank you for the warm welcome you have extended to me and the Azerbaijan delegation. I am glad that I have the opportunity to be among you today, and I consider it an important event for the Republic of Azerbaijan. Thank you very much for the warm words of welcome and good wishes you have expressed toward the Republic of Azerbaijan. The people of Azerbaijan, having traveled a long historic road of development through numerous difficulties and obstacles, achieved national independence in 1991. An independent state of Azerbaijan was formed, which now is a member of the United Nations, the CSCE, and many international organizations. I feel very proud today that the Azerbaijani delegation is present today in the headquarters of the North Atlantic alliance. The Republic of Azerbaijan is following the road of strengthening its independence. In domestic policy it is pursuing the development of a democratic, law-based state, creating the conditions for individual freedom and the protection of human rights and for a multiparty system and political pluralism, guided by democratic values developed by humanity. In the economic sphere the republic is firmly on the road of implementing economic reforms and establishing a market economy, free entrepreneurship, and freedom of initiative. We believe that all this creates good preconditions for Azerbaijan's close integration in the world community. In foreign policy the Republic of Azerbaijan acts on the premise of interconnection and interdependence in the world, conducts a peaceful policy, and strives to maintain good relations with all countries on the basis of the principles of respect for sovereignty and noninterference in each other's internal affairs, territorial integrity, and inviolability of borders. The Republic of Azerbaijan is currently experiencing a serious economic crisis. It was caused, on one hand, by the disintegration of the Soviet Union, of which Azerbaijan was part for 70 years, and the disruption of close integrated ties with all other republics of the Soviet Union, a transition from one economic system to another. On the other hand, this economic crisis is being deepened and exacerbated by the fact that Azerbaijan is in a state of war with the neighboring Republic of Armenia and is a target of military aggression. We believe, however, that all these difficulties can be overcome, keeping in mind that Azerbaijan has firmly taken the road of independent development. Azerbaijan's state independence is an irreversible factor, and we are convinced that the way we are going about state organizational development, economic transformation, and implementation of economic reforms will allow us to overcome these difficulties and make Azerbaijan, with its abundant resources and rich economic and intellectual potential, a part of the world economy and the world community. As I have already mentioned, the difficulty of Azerbaijan's situation stems to a considerable extent from the fact that for six years already the republic has been the target of military aggression on the part of neighboring Armenia. This aggression, unleashed by nationalist circles in Armenia, has brought uncountable misfortunes to both the Azerbaijani and Armenian people, and represents a very difficult problem for us today. You know very well that as a result of military aggression on the part of Armenia, which is pursuing the goal of annexing part of Azerbaijan's territory, of making Nagorno-Karabakh a part of Armenia, Armenian armed formations have occupied a considerable part of Azerbaijani territory. The six-year war has already resulted in the death of more than 20,000 people; about 4,000 persons have been taken prisoner of war or hostage; thousands upon thousands of homes, hospitals, schools, social facilities, and industrial and agricultural enterprises on the territory of Azerbaijan have been destroyed. The estimated damage is in the billions of dollars. The worst part, however, is that almost 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory occupied by Armenian armed formations, and the inhabitants of these regions--which is more than 1 million people--have lost their place of habitation, are in a most difficult socioeconomic situation, and are refugees in their own country. All persons of Azeri origin have been driven from the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh; as I said, Nagorno-Karabakh and seven regions of Azerbaijan adjacent to it are occupied by Armenian armed formations. We have always taken, and continue to support, the position that the conflict should be resolved peacefully. We strive to actively use the facilities of international organizations: the United Nations, the CSCE and its Minsk Group. In 1993 the UN Security Council passed four resolutions that categorically demand the withdrawal of Armenian occupation troops from the territory of Azerbaijan, but none of these resolutions have been carried out by Armenia. The efforts of the CSCE Minsk Group also so far have not led to positive results. Military operations continue today; Armenian armed formations, having occupied, as I already said, a considerable part of Azerbaijani territory, are conducting an offensive on the Republic of Azerbaijan's defense positions. Blood is being spilled every day; people are dying. This can no longer be tolerated. Therefore today I want to make use of my presence here, in the NATO headquarters, and state once again Azerbaijan's position. We are for a peaceful resolution of this issue, for an immediate cease-fire and suspension of all military operations, for negotiations that must result in the immediate withdrawal of occupation troops from the territory of Azerbaijan and at the same time ensure its territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders. On these terms we are willing to consider the issue of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh's autonomy. Speaking on 12 April on Azerbaijani television and radio, I appealed to the Armenian people, Nagorno-Karabakh residents of Armenian origin--citizens of Azerbaijan--to stop this bloodshed. Fate has decided that the Azerbaijani and Armenian people will live next to one another, and they have lived next to one another for centuries. We believe that trying to resolve this problem by military means will lead us to a dead end; this war is hopeless, and we need to end the bloodshed as soon as possible and establish peace in our region. Today we again express our confidence that international organizations, first and foremost the CSCE and the CSCE Minsk Group, will take additional steps to implement our peace initiatives. Today, in this NATO headquarters, I would like to express my deep respect for the North Atlantic alliance, which over the period of its existence has made a tremendous contribution to establishing stability in Europe and the entire world, to strengthening peace and cooperation. We have great respect for NATO and attach great importance to its activities at the current stage. The creation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council has become an important phase in NATO activities, which makes it possible to bring other states into the NATO orbit. We have welcomed NATO's decision, announcing on 10 January of this year the adoption of the document Partnership for Peace, and consider it, too, an important step in NATO's activities in furthering the development of cooperation between countries. We attach great importance to the fact that NATO's 10 January decision expressed particular concern regarding the situation in our region, in the South Caucasus, and a conviction that the conflict in our region, particularly in Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia, must be brought to an end. All this is very desirable and interesting for us. Based on this, we welcome with great satisfaction the invitation extended by NATO to countries of East Europe and the new independent states, formerly parts of the Soviet Union, to sign the Partnership for Peace document. We have made a decision to sign it, and we pin great hopes on cooperation with NATO. For us it is also very important from the standpoint of Azerbaijan joining Western democracy and also because it will give us the ability, in cooperation with NATO, to look for additional ways to stabilize the situation in the region, stop the war, and establish peace and good-neighbor relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia. These are the thoughts and hopes we brought here to you, and we are ready today to sign the Partnership for Peace program. I want to once again express a hope that this step on the part of the Republic of Azerbaijan will be properly appreciated by NATO, will bring mutual benefits, and most importantly, will contribute to stabilization of the situation in our region. I wish your organization further success. I thank you for your attention and am ready to sign the framework Partnership for Peace document.
