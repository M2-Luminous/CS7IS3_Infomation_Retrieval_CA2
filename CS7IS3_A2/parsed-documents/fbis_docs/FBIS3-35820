The deficit for the first three months is yet unknown, but the sum of Rbs 24,600 cited by some sources is too high, Interfax was told Monday by another source in the Central Bank. The Finance Ministry has said that the figure does not correspond to the real state of affairs. The source says that it is necessary to wait for the government's budget message which will specify figures. Earlier Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was expected to make a report to the Federation Council on the country's budget for 1994. However, speaker Vladimir Shumeyko told deputies that the report had been postponed. On February 18 President Yeltsin is expected to speak before parliament on the social and economic development of Russia. In view of this, Chernomyrdin is likely to specify some provisions of his report with account of the presidential address. Before the end of 1993 the Central Bank bought at the Finance Ministry precious metals and stones to the sum of Rbs 6800 Bn rubles which have been spent to cover the budget deficit, Interfax was told by a spokesman for the Central Bank. The meeting of the government commission on credit policies that took place early last week decided to pay to grain producers. The meeting attended also by the former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, chairman of the State Property Management Committee Anatoliy Chubays, the Central Bank's Deputy Chairman Tatyana Paramonova decided to set aside for the purpose some Rbs 3000 Bn.
