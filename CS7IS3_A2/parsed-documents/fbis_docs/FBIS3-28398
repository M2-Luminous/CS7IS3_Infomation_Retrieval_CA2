The meeting will be attended by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae. The ministers are likely to work out measures to deal with the latest developments in the nuclear issue and security concerns on the peninsula, his aides said. At this year's first national security meeting, President Kim and his ministers are expected to analyze the negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic energy agency on IAEA inspections. They will then discuss possible international action on the matter, sources said. Specifically, the issues include referral to the United Nations Security Council of the North Korean question and the North's military activities in relation to security in the South. They will also study a third round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang on improving relations and the content of North Korean President Kim Il-song's personal message to U.S. President Bill Clinton. The meeting, coming only one day before the three-day Lunar New Year's holiday, reflects the sense of urgency among South Korean Government leaders as the deadline for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue fast approaches, the sources said. The Seoul Government wants to establish firm measures on the nuclear problem and dispel anxiety among South Korean citizens, they said. It has been widely reported that the United States will refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council unless Pyongyang and the IAEA reach some kind of agreement on inspections before Feb. 21, when the IAEA convenes a three-day Board of Governors' meeting. Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik, however, tried to diminish the rising sense of crisis when he told reporters that the meeting is not being held because of any urgent developments in the North Korean nuclear problem. "The nuclear problem has surfaced as an important question (for the government) and a pending issue throughout the world," Chu said, explaining the meeting's background. Those attending the meeting include Kim Tok, director of the Agency for National Security Planning, Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security.
