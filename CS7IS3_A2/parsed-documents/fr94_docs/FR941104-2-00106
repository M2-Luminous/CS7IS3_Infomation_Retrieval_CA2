II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On March 7, 1994, the Commission approved an Exchange proposal to establish new rules for the listing and trading of municipal securities on the Exchange. 1 The Commission approved the pilot for an interim period of 120 days through July 5, 1994. 2 On July 5, 1994, the Commission granted an additional 120 day extension of the pilot through November 2, 1994. 3 The Exchange has not yet begun to trade any municipal securities. The Exchange is now requesting a one year extension of the pilot in order to allow for proper evaluation of the program in the event that it lists any municipal securities during that period. 1 See Exchange Act Release No. 33721 (March 7, 1994), 59 FR 11636 (March 11, 1994) (granting temporary accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;05). 2 Id. at 59 FR 11638. 3 Exchange Act Release No. 34317, 59 FR 35546 (July 12, 1994). The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it will promote just and equitable principles of trade, foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling and processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and, in general will contribute to the protection of investors and the public interest.
