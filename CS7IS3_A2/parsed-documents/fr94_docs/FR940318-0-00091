FR940318-0-00091 FR940318-0-00015 (B) Election to revoke section 382(l)(5)(H) election. A loss corporation may elect to revoke a prior election made under section 382(l)(5)(H) with respect to an ownership change occurring before March 17, 1994 by including the following statement with its election to apply §1.382&hyph;9(d) retroactively: ``This is an Election to Revoke a Prior Election Made Under Section 382(l)(5)(H) With Respect to the Ownership Change on [Insert Date of Ownership Change] That Occurred in Connection With the Title 11 or Similar Case Filed on [Insert Date of Filing].'' (C) Amended returns. If the retroactive application of this paragraph (d) affects the amount of taxable income or loss for a prior taxable year, then, except as precluded by the applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation (or the common parent of any consolidated group of which the loss corporation was a member for the year) must file an amended return for the year that reflects the effects of the retroactive application of the rules of this paragraph (d). If the statute of limitations precludes the filing of an amended return for one or more such prior taxable years, the loss corporation (or the common parent) must make appropriate adjustments under the principles of section 382(l)(2)(A) in subsequent taxable years to reflect the difference between the losses and credits actually used in such prior taxable years and the amount that would have been used in those years applying the rules of this paragraph (d).
