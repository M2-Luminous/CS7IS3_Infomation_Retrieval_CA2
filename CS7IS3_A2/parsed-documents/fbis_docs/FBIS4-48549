The leadership of the UNITA negotiating team will leave for Huambo tomorrow to consult with Jonas Savimbi and the UNITA Political Commission. The consultations will center on UNITA's participation in the government at various levels, the future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan] in the present news media structure, and the extension of the state administration, within the framework of national reconciliation. UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim said despite the existence of different views on the future of Vorgan in UNITA, consensus has been reached and an agreeement will be concluded. He said it is not a matter for concern, because the government has not requested Vorgan's closure as it is an instrument that all political parties can use. The major problem now lies in UNITA's participation in the government at the central level. UNITA says that for the past two months it has waited for a government reply on government posts to be given to UNITA within the framework of national reconciliation. UNITA is worried. Speaking to the news media today, Jorge Valentim said there is only way for these talks to go: Either the government should say now what posts it will give UNITA and an agreement is signed, or it should stay in Luanda and UNITA in Huambo. In view of of this stand by UNITA this morning, the special representative of U.S. President Bill Clinton to the talks left Lusaka this afternoon and is already in Luanda to contact the State Department from his embassy, and if necessary, the Luanda government. The talks will remain interrupted until 24 May.
