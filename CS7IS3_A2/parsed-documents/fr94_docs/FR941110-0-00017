FR941110-0-00017 FR941110-0-00009 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;22] Amendment to Using Agency for Restricted Areas R&hyph;3403A, B, and C; Jefferson Proving Ground, IN AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action changes the using agency for Restricted Areas R&hyph;3403A, B, and C, from ``Commanding Officer, Jefferson Proving Ground, Madison, IN'' to ``Adjutant General, Indiana National Guard.'' This is an administrative change initiated by the U.S. Army due to decisions of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. There are no changes to the boundaries, designated altitudes, times of designation, or activities conducted within the affected restricted areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, February 2, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Kadechka, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;7683. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations changes the using agency for Restricted Areas R&hyph;3403A, B, and C, Jefferson Proving Ground, IN, from ``Commanding Officer, Jefferson Proving Ground, Madison, IN'' to ``Adjutant General, Indiana National Guard.'' This is an administrative change initiated by the U.S. Army due to decisions of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. There are no changes to the boundaries, designated altitudes, times of designation, or activities conducted within the affected restricted areas. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Section 73.34 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review This action changes the using agency of the restricted areas. There are no changes to the boundaries, designated altitudes, times of designation, or activities conducted within the affected restricted areas. Accordingly, this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts.''
