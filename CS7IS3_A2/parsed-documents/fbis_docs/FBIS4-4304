FBIS4-4304 "dreas062_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 North Korea Hanminjon Issues Paper on ROK Nuclear Program Hanminjon Issues Paper on ROK Nuclear Program SK3103153594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1525 GMT 31 Mar 94 SK3103153594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front [Hanminjon] published a white paper headlined "Heavy Water Reactor and Multipurpose Research Reactor Are for Nuclear Arms Development" on March 30, which says that the atomic reactors used for the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula are not the experimental reactor of North Korea but the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea. The white paper notes: The Wolsong heavy water reactor is a plutonium-producing reactor introduced for nuke development. It is not a reactor for commercial use but one for the development of nuclear weapons in view of its structure. The multipurpose research reactor now in operation in Taedok nuclear complex is advertized not to be related with nuke development, but it is one of the key reactors exclusively for nuclear development in South Korea. Nevertheless, the International Atomic Energy Agency, making a noisy fuss about the experimental reactor of North Korea, has overlooked the heavy water reactor and multipurpose reactor of South Korea which are for military purpose and whose capacities are scores of times and several times that of North Korea. IAEA has not disclosed as yet the result of inspection of these nuclear facilities of South Korea. The South Korean authorities must, first of all, give up the nuclear development policy and destroy the heavy water reactor and the multipurpose reactor that are used for the production of nuclear weapons.
