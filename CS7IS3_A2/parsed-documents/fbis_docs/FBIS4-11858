[passage omitted] There is no doubt that any progress on the path of building a unified Maghreb is liable to add strength and competence to the economies of our countries for integration and positive interaction with the international economic community and achieve more equilibrium in the exchange relations with the large economic groups and particularly those with which we have traditional relations in our immediate neighborhood.

We are convinced that his undertaking these supreme tasks will give our unionist march, thanks to the wisdom and conviction in the Maghreb unity that characterize him, more impetus and progress to the course of building our Arab Maghreb towards achieving the common aspirations of our peoples. May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. [applause]
