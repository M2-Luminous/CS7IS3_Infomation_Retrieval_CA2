FR940406-0-00120 FR940406-0-00011 IX. Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). The requirements for ORVR systems in this regulation apply to motor vehicle manufacturers. Small LDV manufacturers have been granted a delayed phase-in of the ORVR requirement and LDT manufacturers have a longer leadtime than originally proposed. Therefore, I certify that this rule will not have a significant adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities. X.
