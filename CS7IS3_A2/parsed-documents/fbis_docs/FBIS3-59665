Within the austere fiscal climate, since the early doubling of the government's research and development budget in the outline of science and technology policy set forth last year, the importance placed on the science and technology budget related to basic research and lifestyle is a distinguishing feature. The particulars of the requests from each ministry or agency are summarized. Science and Technology Agency The requested amount for the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology is ¥16.3 billion, a 22.6% increase over this fiscal year's original budget. A substantial increase is eyed for two consecutive years. Science and technology useful in improving the quality of the lives of the citizenry are stressed. The construction of heavy particle beam cancer treatment facilities at comprehensive medical research radiation laboratories, disaster prevention, and safety measures like earthquake prediction were given priority. A total of ¥1.1 billion is requested for the establishment of the Ministry Network Promotion Program to disseminate research information by linking the national laboratories of each ministry and agency via high-speed circuits. In addition, ¥12.7 billion, an additional ¥3.7 billion more than this fiscal year, is requested for the construction of a large-scale radiation facility. As for space ¥4.99 billion is requested for a target test flight around 1999 of an unmanned winged shuttle on which research and development have begun. Ministry of International Trade and Industry The total amount requested in the budget outline related to technological development increased 7.5% over last year to ¥301,707 million. The amount requested for the New Sunshine Project which is approaching the second year of revamping the research and development system is ¥561,768 million, an 8.6% increase. Although not new programs, existing projects, such as the wide area energy use network and the international clean energy system technology which use hydrogen, are being completed. In industrial science and technological research and development (¥25,853 million, a 6.2% increase), the synergy ceramics (high-order structure control fused inorganic materials) project is being promoted as pioneering research. In addition, five themes including next generation metal manufacturing technology have been newly added. Of the other projects, the fourth generation computer development (¥5,718 million, a 57% increase) and the joint international IMS (Intelligent Manufacturing System) program (¥1,614 million, a 48% increase) stand out. Ministry of Education A science research expense assistance fund of ¥83.9 billion, a substantial 14.0% increase, is requested. Also, the facilities expense for the aging national universities is 14.8% more than this fiscal year at ¥125,019 million. In addition, a new request was made for funds to hasten renovation at national universities. The total amount requested by the Ministry of Education was ¥5,613,719 million, a 3.5% increase. This indicates the desire to improve the research environment at national universities and exceed the previous administration's support of research. The total amount requested for promoting costs for basic research in specific fields, much of which is targeted to research costs of big science like space science, accelerators, and nuclear fusion, is ¥62.58 billion, a 2.9% increase. Ministry of Health and Welfare The request of ¥3.2 billion in the first fiscal year budget for what is tentatively called the 10-Year Project To Conquer Cancer is the star. This is the successor to the 10-Year Comprehensive Strategy Against Cancer that ends this fiscal year. Previously, the emphasis was on basic research on explaining cancer. In the future, clinical research connected to practical treatments and prevention will be advanced. The Comprehensive Cancer Treatment Support System will be provided so medical treatment facilities nationwide can use the pioneering medical treatment information of the National Cancer Center. The amount requested for health science research expenses is ¥11.4 billion (a 20.9% increase). The overall rate of increase was a sizable 5.5%. The costs of preventive research on the side effects caused by combining many drugs as well as research on medical treatment problems such as the recent outbreak of hospital infections and side effects to preventive vaccinations have been added as new expenses. In addition to having few patients, the hesitation by corporations to perform research, the increased research subsidy costs of medicines for rare illnesses, and the cost of sponsoring the international AIDS conference to be held next August in Japan are included. Environment Agency In the request outlined for fiscal year 1994, the amount requested for the science and technology promotion fund budgeted for research and development is ¥13,647 million, a 8.5% increase compared to the fiscal year 1993 budget. Of this amount, ¥2,500 million are the promotion costs of comprehensive earth environment research. This is a 19% increase, ¥400 million more than the current fiscal year. The promotion cost is a budget for survey research targeted at preserving the earth's environment. Support is provided for joint projects advanced through the cooperation of experts from a wide range of research organizations which include not only the Environment Agency, but national universities and national research organizations under the umbrella of ministries and agencies, such as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry of Construction. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries> med> With the objective of basic and pioneering research, domestic animal genome analysis where the genes of domestic animals like cows and pigs are analyzed is a seven year project to begin next year. ¥130 million is requested for the coming fiscal year. The DNA Bank which systematically accumulates and presents data obtained from rice plant genome analysis research will begin operation. As for environmental problems, investigations on agriculture, forestry, and fishery industrial environment restoration technologies will begin. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Requests for FY1994 Budget Outline of Principal Agencies | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Units: ¥100 million, rate of inc-| | |rease over this fiscal year indicated | | |in parenthesis in %) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Science and Technology Agency |6,169 (6.1) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Special Coordination Funds Portion |163 (22.6) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of International Trade and I-|9,174 (4.1) | |ndustry | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Education |56,137 (3.5) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Scientific research portion |839 (14.0) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Environment Agency |678 (6.6) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Health and Welfare |139,058 (5.5) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Health science research fund portion |114 (20.9) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, an-|34,298 (1.8) | |d Fisheries | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agriculture, forestry, and fishery in-|746 (2.7) | |dustry research and development budget| | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Budget by field of related ministries | | |and agencies | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nuclear power |4,587 (1.7) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Space development |2,198 (9.0) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Marine science technology |598 (6.3) | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
