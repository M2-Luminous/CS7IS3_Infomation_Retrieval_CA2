FR941110-2-00127 FR941110-2-00077 Proposed Minimum Financial Standards The term ``net capital'' as used in GSCC's rules and the Commission's uniform net capital rule is the approximate accounting equivalent of the term ``adjusted net capital'' as that term is used in the CFTC financial requirement rule. 5 In addition, the term ``net worth'' as used in GSCC's rules is comparable to the concept of ``net capital'' in the CFTC's financial requirement rule. 6 5 Under GSCC's rules, the term ``net capital'' is defined as the amount equal to the net capital of a broker or dealer as defined in Commission Rule 15c3&hyph;1(c)(2) or any successor rule or regulation thereto. GSCC Rule 1, ``Definitions.'' 6 Under GSCC's rules, for purposes of Category 1 and Category 2 FCMs, the term ``net worth'' is defined as the amount equal to the excess of the assets of the FCM over the liabilities of the FCM computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including liabilities that are subordinated to the claims of creditors pursuant to a satisfactory subordination agreement as defined in 17 CFR 1.17(h) for an FCM that is not a registered broker-dealer. GSCC Rule 1, ``Definitions.'' Given these similarities, GSCC established categories of FCM netting membership with minimum financial standards and margin requirements that are equivalent to those for Category 1 and Category 2 dealer netting members. Specifically, if an applicant is applying to become a Category 1 FCM, it must have, as of the end of the calendar month prior to the effective date of its membership, $50 million in net worth and $10 million in excess adjusted net capital 7 and must meet the same clearing fund requirements as a Category 1 dealer netting member. If an applicant is applying to become a Category 2 FCM, it must have, as of the end of the calendar month prior to the effective date of its membership, $25 million in net worth and $10 million in excess adjusted net capital and must meet the same clearing fund requirements as a Category 2 dealer netting member. 8 The minimum financial admission criteria are continuing membership standards, and a member must promptly inform GSCC any time it is not in compliance with any of the financial standards. 7 Under GSCC's rules, for purposes of Category 1 and Category 2 FCMs, the term ``excess adjusted net capital'' is defined as the amount equal to the difference between the adjusted net capital of an FCM and the minimum adjusted net capital that such FCM must have to comply with the requirements of 17 CFR 1.17 (a)(1) or (a)(2) or any successor regulations. GSCC Rule 1, ``Definitions.'' 8 If an applicant satisfies the minimum financial standards required to become a Category 1 FCM, they will be subject to lower margin requirements than those imposed on a Category 2 FCM. GSCC's rules require dealers to submit to GSCC certain financial reports that the dealers are required to file with their regulatory authorities. Because the CFTC requires all FCMs as of the close of business each month only to make and to keep a record of their computation of adjusted net capital and does not require FCMs to file such computations with their regulatory authorities, GSCC specifically will require every FCM netting member to submit to GSCC each month a copy of the computation of adjusted net capital required by the CFTC. GSCC also will require FCMs to submit to GSCC a copy of the CFTC's regulatory financial report at the time that the form is filed with the CFTC each quarter. II. Discussion The Commission believes that GSCC's proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act 9 and in particular with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. 10 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds within its possession or control or for which it is responsible and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that GSCC's proposal to establish new categories of netting system membership for FCMs is consistent with these obligations. 9 15 U.S.C. ยง78q&hyph;1 (1988). 10 15 U.S.C. ยง78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). In their trading of futures on government securities, FCMs may be required to deliver or to accept delivery of Treasury securities but under certain circumstances may not be required to register as broker-dealers. 11 By permitting FCMs to become GSCC members, the proposed rule change allows GSCC to extend the services and benefits it offers as a registered clearing agency to a greater number of market participants and thereby should promote the establishment of a national system for the prompt clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 11 In connection with the proposed rule change, GSCC will require each FCM who is not registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer or government securities broker-dealer and who applies to become a Category 1 or Category 2 FCM netting system member to send a representation to the Commission that the FCM is in compliance with Commission Rules 3a43&hyph;1 and 3a44&hyph;1 (17 CFR 240.3a43&hyph;1 and 240.3a44&hyph;1 [1994]) and will remain in compliance with Commission Rules 3a43&hyph;1 and 3a44&hyph;1. Telephone conversation between Jeff Ingber, General Counsel, GSCC, and Jerry Carpenter, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, and Ari Burstein, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 2, 1994). The minimum financial requirements implemented by GSCC for Category 1 and Category 2 FCMs mirror those for Category 1 and Category 2 dealer netting members. The Commission believes that given the similarities between the concepts of net capital and net worth in GSCC, CFTC, and Commission rules, there is a basis for establishing categories of FCM netting membership with net capital, net worth, clearing fund, and margin requirements that are equivalent to those for Category 1 and Category 2 dealer netting members. The Commission therefore believes that the financial and reporting requirements established by GSCC for Category 1 and Category 2 FCMs along with GSCC's regular risk management procedures should allow GSCC to provide membership to FCMs consistent with GSCC's safeguarding obligations. III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, particularly with Section 17A of the Act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 12 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;94&hyph;04) be, and hereby is, approved. 12 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 13 13 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
