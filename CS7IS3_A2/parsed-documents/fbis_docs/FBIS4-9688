Hermoza said the price of washed cocaine base has fallen the past few weeks from $1,500 to $150 per kilo. He presented 23 traffickers to the media, who were captured in the jungle department of Madre de Dios while shipping 1,051 kg of cocaine to Colombia. Hermoza also showed assets seized from the traffickers, including electric generators, precursors to manufacture cocaine base, communications equipment, and vehicles. The traffickers were captured in several operations last week in the province of Inapari, Madre de Dios Department, on the Brazilian borde, where a drug collection center operated. Hermoza indicated that the cocaine paste, which was to have been processed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombia, had arrived from the Huallaga valleys and from the Ucayali River area. The military commander said: "These traffickers' capture and their equipment is proof that land and air actions in the Huallaga and Ucayali areas have caused the trafficking axis to be moved from there to Madre de Dios Department." Security forces seized 3,653 kg of basic paste and captured 13 traffickers on 24 February in Boca Manu, also in Madre de Dios Department, in the largest drug seizure ever in this Andean country. Peru produces some 2,000 tons of basic paste per annum, which is exported mainly to Colombia where the Cali and Medellin "cartels" process it into the pure cocaine that is sold in the United States and Europe. Two-thirds of all cocaine consumed in the world is processed from the basic paste that comes from Peru.
