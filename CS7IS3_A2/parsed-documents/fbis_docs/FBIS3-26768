Adviser to the ROC's Ministry of Economic Affairs Liu Tai-ying, who is accompanying the President on his trip along with 30 other government officials, also verified that there will a big businessmen tour group who will be investigating into the possibility of investing in the Indonesian industries in March. Meanwhile, international news agency REUTER reported the President's trip to Indonesia as one that is shrouded in secrecy. President Li, making his second overseas trip since assuming office in 1988, arrived on the resort island of Bali on Wednesday [9 February] for a five-day visit after a brief stopover in the Philippines. Beijing on Thursday protested Li's trip to the Philippines and his meeting with Filipino President Fidel Ramos and other Philippine officials. Indonesia was President Li's second stop on the three-country tour which prompted Mainland China to warn the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand that their relations with Beijing would be harmed if the visits went ahead. An official in Bali said Li, who is likely to have dinner with President Suharto on Friday, flew to Bantam on Thursday with his host Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Habibie. At the state-run IPTN aircraft factories in Bantam, southeast of Jakarta, visitors were denied entry, and security appeared to have been stepped up, REUTER reported. Taipei said last month it was studying possible aviation tie-up with Indonesia and Mainland China [as received] after failing to form joint ventures with Western aerospace companies. The Indonesian aircraft factory IPTN's centerpiece is its 70-seat N-250 medium-haul turboprop communter plane due to enter service in 1996. The Indonesian aircraft company also produces under license French-designed Puma and U.S. Bell helicopters as well as parts for U.S.-designed F-16 fighters and British-developed Rapier missiles. Indonesia has formal diplomatic ties with Beijing and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has said a private visit by Li will not change Jakarta's one-China policy. Indonesian officials have stressed that senior officials meeting President Li would do so in their private capacity.
