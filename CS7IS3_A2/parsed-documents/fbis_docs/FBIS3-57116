One of the proposals is joining Balladur's plan, or the European stability pact, the draft of which was worked out by the French premier. This plan envisages joint discussion and tackling of various conflicts and problems between neighboring countries. It is planned in the draft to pay particular attention to problems which occur in relations between small countries and neighboring great powers. France will also assist Latvia in joining the European Union. An agreement is currently being worked out between the European Union and Latvia, and France wishes that the agreement will also have a political significance and make it possible for Latvia to become a member state of the European Union in the future. In addition, Lamassoure said that France supports the concept of Latvia joining the West European Union as an associate member. The Partnership for Peace cooperation program offered by NATO would also help to tackle the issues of Latvian security. As Lamassoure said, an agreement is currently being prepared between Latvia and France on cooperation in defense issues. The agreement provides for training of Latvian military experts in France. Both countries have already coordinated all the political aspects of the agreement and it could be signed in the near future.
