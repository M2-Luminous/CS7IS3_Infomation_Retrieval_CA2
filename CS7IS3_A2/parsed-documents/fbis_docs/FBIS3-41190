Confirming press reports of the theft, the official, who asked not to be named, said Justice Minister Olu Onagoruwa was "very angry with the development and has promised to investigate it because of the serious implications it has for the image of the country abroad." The heroin was part of a load of 248.3 kg (546 pounds) of high-grade heroin, valued at 976.5 million dollars, seized by narcotics agents in December in what was thought to be Africa's largest ever drugs haul. Suspected drugs baron, Joe Brown Akubueze, is currently standing trial in a special court on charges of importing the heroin which he allegedly bought from Thailand. The heroin was neatly wrapped in 649 bags and concealed in water coolers. Officials from the special court visited the NDLEA premises Tuesday, to find that eight of the packets were already missing. The NDLEA was established in 1990 to fight drug trafficking in all its ramifications.
