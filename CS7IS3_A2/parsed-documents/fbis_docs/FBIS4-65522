The spokesman for the Greens and former environment minister, Vittorio Ripa de Meana, branded the appointment of Matteoli, a member of the righist National Alliance, as a "provocation" against mainstream environmental thinking. Premier Silvio Berlusconi, he claimed "has decided to carry out a vulgar attack against this nation's environmental policy tapping as head of the ministry a person who is totally inept on environmental questions, who since yesterday has only babbled dangerous absurdities: a return to nuclear power, expanding highways, no limits to high-speed trains, trimming legislation which protects the environment." World Wildlife Foundation [WWF] president Grazia Francescato issued a statement saying "I have the impression that he (Matteoli) has not understood that he is environment minister. Someone should explain to him that his job is to protect the environment, not work to destroy it". Nevertheless, the WWF said it hoped it was wrong and offered to give the new minister all information he needed to help him perform his duties. Green Gianni Mattioli said the new minister "has always been an opponent of environmentalism, against parks and in favor of laying cement for profit," while Roberto Musacchio of Communist Refoundation stressed how a popular referendum was passed against nuclear energy and how many of the projects of the past which destroyed the environment were rooted in corruption. Adelaide Aglietta, the Green whip in the European Parliament, said "the environment minister's declarations sound like a true declaration of war on the environment."
