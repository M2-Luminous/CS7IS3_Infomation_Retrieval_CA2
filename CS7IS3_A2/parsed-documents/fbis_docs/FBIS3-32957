That is fair and appropriate for an objective analysis of the facts, since without an effective application of the model--so different from what we had before--Colombia could not have overcome the economic challenges that have emerged because of a transformation imposed not only by official government policies, but also by market dynamics. Events in the last decade have created a 360-degree change in the course of the entire world, forcing old powers to accede to a new international reality. Even so, the nation, not just the government, failed to anticipate many factors that should have been considered earlier. Apart from the hasty implementation of an "apertura" that should have been gradual (as the former minister of development and now presidential candidate Ernesto Samper proposed), other factors creating maladjustments have come into play, sometimes as a consequence of the government's action, and at other times as a corollary of the business strategy designed to suffer as little as possible from the traumas of the change in economic model. So the "apertura" has produced different reactions in each economic sector, even in the same sector, depending on the subsectors' level of development. If our memory is correct, on various occasions we strongly suggested that greater administrative efficiency was needed in government agencies handling imports, exports, and foreign trade in general. Without that efficiency--let there be no mistake about this--the goals pursued would be weakened by failures and omissions that would impair both competitiveness and the economic policy itself. We knew, of course, that the ideal of an efficient Colombia is a remote aspiration, but even so, the obvious successes of a transition to which almost all the countries of the world have committed themselves show that improvements are possible in a process that entails a period of experiments and learning. To take one example, the situation in the import sector at the start of a year that was expected to be active is hard to comprehend. The possibility that the arrival and acceptance of imported goods might be impeded because there are no forms for the required procedures did not occur to anyone. The standards for the new valuation code were approved three months ago, sufficient time to prepare such an essential instrument. All of us, both those involved in this sector and those who are simply onlookers, were surprised by the government's failure to take a basic but valuable step to protect both importers and the state. No less damaging for the "apertura" and the current privatizations policy is the situation concerning the transfer of ports to the private companies that will manage and operate them, especially as it has arisen just a few hours before the disappearance of Colpuertos [Colombian Port Enterprise] from the national administrative map. These are two strikes against the external sector that will definitely hurt both its structure and the pace of its normal operations. A few more requirements placed upon the public officials responsible for satisfying such urgent needs, even severe penalties if warranted, would be no bad thing if we truly want to become internationalized along with our partners and competitors in a complex market. We are offering the preceding comments because a government nearing the end of its term in office is obliged to preserve the prestige of the policy it has adopted, and to exercise the controls required so that procedural matters will not dissipate the vigor of that policy. Furthermore, we believe the presidential candidates should pay attention to what is happening, so that whoever wins the election will be well aware of the problems he may face in an area that is crucial for the economy and for the stability of the nation in general. We hope these maladjustments will be reviewed and suitable correctives applied.
