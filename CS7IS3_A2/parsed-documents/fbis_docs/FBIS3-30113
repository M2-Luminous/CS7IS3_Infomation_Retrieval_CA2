Europe expects demand to remain flat this year in the 12-nation union, while Japan expects a "slight increase," both sides said after two days of preliminary talks in Tokyo. Neither side would specify their differences over Japan's export quota for this year. While minimizing the discrepancy over overall market forecasts, chief European auto negotiator Guy Clauser said the two sides "certainly" differed over how many vehicles Japan should be allowed to export for the year. "The question of a gap is a matter of perception," he said. "I shall refrain from giving you my perception." Clauser and an official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry told separate press briefings that both sides agreed to meet again soon. Clauser said they would try to meet by mid-March to respond to each other's projections. The talks are part of an annual monitoring of Japan's exports to Europe through 1999, when export limits will be phased out. They do not cover "transplant" cars made in Europe by Japanese manufacturers, which Clauser said are free and "welcomed." European passenger car and light commercial truck sales fell 15.9 percent to 11.74 million vehicles last year, while Japan cut its exports by 18.5 percent to 980,000 vehicles. Clauser said those figures, showing a bigger proportional cut in Japanese exports than the total market decline, did not necessarily mean that Europe is seeking further cuts for this year. The 1993 results matched a September revision of an April plan to cut Japanese exports 9.4 percent for a market originally expected to decline by just 6.4 percent. The different views of the European auto market for this year stem from divergent views of the region's economic conditions, the Japanese official said. For example, Europe insists that even if its economy should pick up, unemployment will not fall easily, he said. The trade official also said Japan called for quick unification of Europe's various auto certification standards. Clauser said the 12 nations have agreed to unified certification by 1996 but that not all the countries have enacted laws to that effect.
