Galoyan, Biochemistry Institute at Armenian Republic's Academy of Sciences, Yerevan; UDC 575.1] [Abstract] The genus specificity of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone (AKTG)--a peptide consisting of 39 amino acids which is produced and secreted in the hypophysis and which stimulates biosynthesis of secretion of corticosteroids in the adrenal cortex--and the desire to avoid unnecessary immune reactions as well as the expense and tediousness of chemical synthesis of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone prompted a study of the expression of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone in the form of a hybrid with S. aureus protein A. This hybrid protein can be easily isolated from Escherichia coli proteins. This system was used to obtain the insulin-like growth factor IFH-I and to produce the bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone. The plasmids containing most of the S. aureus protein A gene as well as the plasmids containing the bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone pUC 19/�1, pUC 19/�7, and pUC 19/Pro were used to construct recombinant plasmids. The experiment procedure is outlined. The hybrid gene sequence constructed as a result contains the sequences which encode protein A of S. aureus and human adrenocorticotropic hormone located in the same reading frame. Synthetic adapter sequences whose specific cleaving will eventually make it possible to isolate the end product from the fused protein are built in between these sequences. The fused protein synthesis detection procedure is described and the possibility of protein A secretion by E. coli cell derivatives is established. The conclusion is drawn that the constructed plasmids direct the human adrenocorticotropic hormone-containing fused protein synthesis in E. coli. The authors are grateful to A.A. Shulga for help with mutagenesis. Figures 1; references 9: 4 Russian, 5 Western.
