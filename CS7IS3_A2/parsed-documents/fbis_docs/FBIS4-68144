Ambassador al-Tikriti said: "The project of creating a Kurdish state incorporating Iraq and Turkey is Britain's. The United States supports this project." He gave assurances to Turkey, saying: "If the Hammer Force leaves, we will not allow even a single PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] militant to take shelter in northern Iraq." [passage omitted] Noting that prior to the Gulf crisis no such tension and disorder existed in the region, al-Tikriti said that at the time Iraq gave importance to Turkey's security. Asking "where was the PKK before the Gulf crisis?" al-Tikriti said: "The PKK will vanish if the Hammer Force leaves and the oil pipeline is opened. At present, the PKK is being protected and sheltered by the Kurds in northern Iraq. Ask the Hammer Force to leave. Once the Hammer Force leaves, our government will restore authority in the region. Not even one single PKK militant will remain in northern Iraq. PKK is a terror organization. Besides, Turkey's security is important to us." Asked what Iraq's position towards the Kurds will be once the Hammer Force leaves, al-Tikriti replied: "We gave official guarantees to Ozal in the past, and later to Demirel. We told them that we would not oppress the Kurds."
