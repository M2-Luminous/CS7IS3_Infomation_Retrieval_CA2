"This is a provocation and a form of pressure by the Muslims and their overlords and is out of the question," Krajisnik said in a statement for Radio Jagodina. "Whatever is over 50 percent of the territory--regardless of quality--is out of the question," he specified. "Percentages--how much territory everyone will get--depend on numerous elements in this struggle and these divisions," Krajisnik stressed. "Without maps, everything is an auction and pressure." "I cannot see where the Muslims and Croats got the idea that they are entitled to so much territory, they simply cannot lay claim to it--they are neither military nor moral victors--unless some of their mentors want this in order to monitor the Serbs more easily," Krajisnik underlined. Commenting on tomorrow's Geneva meeting, Krajisnik said: "There might be some results because this high-level gathering will also include those who want peace in these regions." "Some other forces want war in the case of Brcko, and they are instigating the Muslims and Croats; if it were not for Brcko they would have passed a resolution that we would oppose and would thus have rekindled the war," Krajisnik said. "Posavina is of vital importance for the national interest of the Serbian people and there is no such force that could occupy it." "We were embittered at our assembly in Brcko because of Muslim shelling--we had let them pass through our territories so many times, we had forgiven and yielded so much, they could have displayed at least a semblance of respect during the assembly, at least toward civilians and the innocent," Krajisnik underlined.
