The Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) and the Committee for Economic Development (CED) also agreed on their opposition to the setting of specific targets for Japan's imports from the U.S. However, they said such targets would be effective if used in unbinding ways to gauge the openness of the Japanese market. In a statement that described the Japan-U.S. relationship as the most important partnership in the world, the groups called on Japan to open its market and reduce its external imbalance. The statement said the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to its GDP should be brought down to around 2 percent in fiscal 1997 and less than that thereafter. Japan's current account surplus accounted for more than 3 percent of the GDP in fiscal 1993 ended March 31. The statement also requested more than 100 trillion yen be added to Japan's 430 trillion yen public works program for this decade.
