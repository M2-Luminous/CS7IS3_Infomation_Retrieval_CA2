FBIS4-28468 "dreas112__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-112-A Daily Report 31 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Further Reports on U.S.-Japan Economic, Trade Issues Further Reports on U.S.-Japan Economic, Trade Issues `Reverse Engineering' Project Postponed OW0406001794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 31 May 94 Morning Edition p 11 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0406001794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The research participants council [RPC] (chaired by Kyoto University Professor Zentaro Kitagawa) of the Agency for Cultural Affairs [ACA] has been studying whether "reverse engineering (RE)" -- which means companies analyzing and extracting ideas from software developed by other companies to utilize such data for the development of their own software -- should be included as one of the rights protected by the Copyright Act. In its report published on 30 May, the RPC explained that "we have not come up with concrete proposals on the revision of the act so far." Although the RPC has been studying the possibility of conditional approval of RE, it shelved the decision to revise the law because the U.S. Government showed "grave concern." Domestic manufacturers, such as Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation, are opposed to postponement of the decision because they have been urging for the approval of RE because "RE is indispensable for the development of compatible products." The RPC, a private advisory body to the ACA director general, has been studying the propriety of the use of RE in computer software development since last July. RE generally means analyzing the structure of software developed by other companies and extracting technical or design ideas to utilize them for development of one's own software. To produce duplicates of other companies' products through RE is against the law. However, there is no regulation about extraction of ideas in the Copyright Act. Fujitsu and other domestic manufacturers say "RE is indispensable in developing products marketable worldwide." The RPC has been collecting various views mainly in favor of permitting RE because this is already quite commonly used as a measure to develop products. However, IBM, Microsoft, and Apple Computer Inc. voiced opposition at a hearing for U.S. companies concerned late last year. Likewise, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the Department of Commerce showed "grave concern." Thus, there has been a delay in the RPC's work schedule. Four basic views, ranging from all-out support to all-out opposition, as well as their reasons, are all included in the RPC report. The council decided to postpone revision of the law, explaining: "Further discussion on the Copyright Act is required. It will be appropriate to wait for court rulings on legal interpretation for the time being, and resume the discussion in line with the development of the situation." Thus, the council has winded up its discussion. The RPC also discussed the following: 1) The legal status of the duplication of computer programs for private use in the Copyright Act, and 2) what actions should be taken against the production and sales of devices for bypassing the copy-protection function, which enable easy duplication of programs. With regard to duplication for private use, the RPC affirmed the need for regulations, and decided to start preparations to impose rules. However, since this is an issue common to other digital products, such as multimedia software, the council has merely decided to "hear the opinions of the parties concerned, and urgently discuss this issue on another occasion." Concerning the production and sales of copy-protection bypass devices, most council members said legal regulation is necessary. However, the council did not reach a clear-cut conclusion, saying "hearings should be held for parties concerned."
