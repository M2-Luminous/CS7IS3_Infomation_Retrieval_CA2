Reinart said Estonia is currently working on new wordings for the texts of the draft treaties, which he said now "hopefully are also acceptable to the Russian side." He expressed hope that progress will be made at the next round of the talks, due to start on Apr. 5, also over the troop withdrawal agreement. "This agreement was ready already once, but because of the proposed amendments from the Russian side some disputed wordings have come up," the head of the Estonian delegation said. Commenting on Russia's demands that the troop withdrawal agreement must be signed together with an agreement on social guarantees for the retired Russian military in Estonia, Reinart said differences in opinions of the two parties still remained over the latter. "The greatest difference is that the Russian side would like to set forth in the agreement the circle of the retired military who are entitled to apply for a residence permit in Estonia. Estonia's position, however, is that the agreement is not meant to determine the circle of the retired military, but will establish regulations on how the retired military would get their pensions from Russia and how they will pay for medical services," Reinart said. The second major difference is over granting the retired military the right to privatize their flats for vouchers. Reinart said Russia wants that Estonia delivered to the retired military its privatization vouchers for the time of their service in the armed forces. "Since Estonia doesn't give the vouchers even to Estonian citizens for the years of service in the Russian army, this means that the Russian side wants to have for the retired Russian military a little more rights than the Estonian citizens are having," Reinart explained. The head of the Russian delegation for the talks, Vasiliy Svirin, has said Russia will continue discussing the issue of social guarantees for its retired military at the talks with Estonia. The 18th round of the talks will be held on Apr. 5-6 near Moscow. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar has said Estonia plans no changes in its delegation and will continue with its present team.
