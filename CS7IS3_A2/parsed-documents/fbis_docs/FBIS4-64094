This is how this ministry was assessed at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers Presidium, chaired by Belarusian Prime Minister Mikail Myasnikovich, during a report on the implementation of the Belarusian state budget for 1993. Among others, it was stressed that the Finance Ministry poorly handles credits given as part of bilateral relations. Those credits are misapplied, preventing the deficit of the payment balance from being eliminated. State securities have not been issued yet. Debts of other countries have also become a serious problem, exceeding the amount of 200 billion rubles. Only the debt of Uzbekistan to Belarus has been properly handled. Insufficient interaction between the Finance Ministry, the National Bank, and the National Committee for Statistics and Analysis weakens the "hare." Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Ivan Bambiza sharply criticized the ministry for its tax policies. It was said at the meeting that the economy and the budget exist in isolation from each other. This is why a decision was made to reexamine activities of the Finance Ministry on the above issues. The government's Presidium approved a temporary statute on use of economic sanctions for economic entities. It also decided to open new diplomatic representative offices abroad and transform plenipotentiary representative offices of the Cabinet of Ministers into embassies of the Belarusian Republic.
