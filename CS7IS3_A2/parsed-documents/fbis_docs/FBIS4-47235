Neyburg: "Joint Ventures in Economy of Southern Part of Republic"] [Text] As the Republic of Uzbekistan enters the broad international arena, foreign entrepreneurs have begun showing great interest in the economy of the southern part of the republic. Almost 50 joint ventures are now operating in Surkhandarya Oblast. One of them is at the Namuna Kolkhoz, which is not far from the oblast capital. The local confectionery factory that an Afghan firm is helping establish and operate produces products of excellent quality. A chain of stores selling food products to the public has been opened through the joint efforts of an Iranian export-import firm under the Buned Foundation and the Surkhandarya firm Turon. This same route has been taken in Altynsaye, renowned for its vineyards. Uzbek and American businessmen have set up a winery there that will produce and bottle 1 million decaliters annually. A tannery is being built in Denau in conjunction with Finnish entrepreneurs. A medicine plant at the Surkhan factory is also under construction. The latter project is being carried out in conjunction with an Indian firm. Joint enterprises are now producing a very broad mix of goods for the consumer market: knitwear, shoes, furniture, and much more. Even more goods will be produced in the future, as joint ventures are currently being established with firms from China, Spain, France, and other countries. Special attention is being devoted to restoring business ties with the Commonwealth countries. One confirmation of this is the construction in Termez, in conjunction with Russia's Radiozavod Production Association in the city of Aleksandrovsk, of an enterprise that will produce black-and-white and color Rekord televisions.
