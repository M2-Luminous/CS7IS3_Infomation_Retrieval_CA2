The statement branded the nuclear waste dumping by the Kim Yong-sam clique as the heaviest anti-national crime of turning Korea into a barren land polluted with nuclear substances and cutting off the lifeline of the nation and as a wanton violation of international law and convention. The statement further said: The traitorous Kim Yong-sam group which, while developing nuclear weapons under the "nuclear umbrella" of the United States, had cried for "an international cooperation system" and "a military countermeasure" and now, even at the working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the two parts of Korea, is reversing the black and white, raising a row over the "nuclear issue". This is outrageous, indeed. To make the matter worse, the traitor Kim Yong-sam plans to visit Japan a few days later and have a confab for a more vicious smear campaign against the DPRK and Chongnyon. This will be a criminal mendicant trip designed to balk the projected third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost in conspiracy with outside forces and continue to do harm to the DPRK. The Kim Yong-sam clique has been hell bent on flunkeyist treachery, fascism, confrontation with the North and splittist moves and, as if it were not enough, is now unhesitatingly dumping radioactive waste. This is a criminal act which can be committed only by them who are clean indifferent to the nation and international law. The South Korean rulers must stop the criminal nuclear waste dumping at once, disclose its truth and apologize to the whole nation. We strongly demand that the Kim Yong-sam regime immediately give up the anti-reunification and anti-national moves to kill fellow countrymen in reliance upon outside forces, scrap the "National Security Law" and unconditionally stop the fascist suppression of the South Korean people.
