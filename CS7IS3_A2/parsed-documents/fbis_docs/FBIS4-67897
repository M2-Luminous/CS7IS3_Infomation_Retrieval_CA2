Khan represents the national pride of Pakistan. The story of his achievement is the story of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, the story of how faith and determination on the part of a nation can convert a dream into a reality. Dr. Khan was not an ordinary person, but his own country took time in recognising his talent. A highly qualified engineer in physical metallurgy, and a specialist in uranium enrichment, when he applied for a job in the Pakistan Steel Mills in Karachi in 1967, he was rejected. He returned to Holland to pursue further research in his field. After India's nuclear explosion of May 1974, Dr. Khan wrote to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto offering to return to Pakistan. Mr. Bhutto examined the background and experience of Dr. Khan and encouraged him to return. When finally, in January 1976, Dr. Khan accepted the offer and declared his intention to return, Mr. Bhutto got excited, thumped his fist on the table, and said, ``I will see the Hindu bastards now.'' The project was launched straightaway. An important element in its implementation was the selection of an appropriate site for establishment of the uranium enrichment plant. Dr. Khan and his colleagues inspected a number of sites, viz. Haripur, Tarbela, Hassan Abdal, Cambelpur, Fateh-Jang, Bannu, Kohat, Sargodha and others. Finally, Kahuta, a few miles south-east of Islamabad, was chosen because of being close to the capital, located in the middle of the mountains, and somewhat isolated. The accomplishment of uranium enrichment up to the desired level has rightly been described as the story of a miracle by Mr. Zahid Malik, a close friend of Dr. A.Q. Khan, and the author of the book ``Dr. A.Q. Khan and the Islamic Bomb.'' The story began in August 1975 when the Pakistan Embassy at Brussels enquired about high frequency inverters from a company in Holland. These highly sensitive electronic instruments control the spinning of the centrifuge and Pakistan procured them from at least four countries. Western authors who have been trying to chase Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme admit that tracking these Pakistani purchase was difficult detective work. The purchasers' expert handling of secret purchases and their daring and expert actions always placed then one step ahead of the foreign detective and secret agencies deployed to stop the supply of nuclear materials to Pakistan. In the business of nuclear equipment which has billion of dollars worth of black market, nobody in 1978 knew what Pakistan was up to. Regular purchases had started in 1976. In March 1979, the CIA informed the U.S. government that Pakistan was commissioning the centrifuge plant for the production of weapon-grade uranium and that the already installed inverters were sufficient for ten thousand centrifuges enough to produce one hundred and fifty kilograms of enriched uranium per year. This was sufficient for six to seven nuclear bombs. America immediately took up this matter through its Ambassador. The economic aid that was to be given to Pakistan in April 1979 was gradually reduced and finally stopped completely. Pakistan's dream of having a nuclear bomb goes back to the days of the 1965 war, when it felt disillusioned by America's suspension of military aid. About a year and a half to two years after the war, a request was made by Pakistan for a plutonium reprocessing plant to a French firm, SGN [expansion unknown]. Within a few weeks of becoming the President and Chief Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, on 20 January 1972 convened a meeting of selected Pakistani scientists from home and abroad at Multan. At this meeting, Mr. Bhutto stressed upon the scientists his wish for Pakistan to be a nuclear power as soon as possible. His chief scientific advisors, Dr. Abdus Salam and Dr.I.H. Usmani declared it to be impossible because Pakistan did not have the basic infrastructure. Mr. Bhutto would not take ``No'' for an answer. According to Mr. Bhutto's Press Secretary Khalid Hassan, Mr. Bhutto decided to remove Dr. I.H. Usmani and appointed Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan as the new Chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. According to Zahid Malik, Dr. Abdul Salam and Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan further convinced Mr. Bhutto that a reprocessing plant was necessary for the Pakistani bomb. Therefore in 1972, Pakistan entered into negotiations and made a formal request to France for the procurement of a reprocessing plant. In March 1973, Pakistan entered into an agreement and signed a contract with the SGN for the preliminary design of the plant. On 8 August 1976, U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, came to Pakistan and offered to supply 100 A-7 Corsair jet fighters if it agreed to cancel the reprocessing plant deal. At the same time, stoppage of all military and civil aid under Symington amendment was threatened if it did not. In April 1977, Bhutto, while addressing the National Assembly, attributed the political agitation against him to ``a certain power against Pakistan.'' Later in 1977, when Mr. Agha Shahi was in Paris to work out the modalities of executing the contract, the French Foreign Minister offered to supply a ``Coprocessing Plant'' in place of the Reprocessing Plant.'' In January 1978, President Carter again visited Paris and held discussions with Mr. Giscard d' Estaing. Prior to his departure for Paris, Mr. Carter had already granted landing rights for the French ``Concorde'' at Kennedy airport. The prospect of the sale of Concordes to the U.S. seemed more lucrative to France than the sale of a reprocessing plant to Pakistan. France began to yield to American pressure. On 5 June 1978, France finally decided not to execute the contract. But Pakistan's efforts to acquire nuclear weapon capability through the uranium route continued unabated. Pakistan acquired this capability by the end of 1986 and found a way of announcing it to the world in early 1987. Zahid Malik has taken great pains to establish the point that Indian journalist Kuldip Nayar's interview with Dr. A. Q. Khan on the basis of which Nayar had written that Pakistan had already acquired the atomic bomb was ``concocted.'' The interview which took place in Islamabad on 29 January 1987 was published by the London OBSERVER on 29 February. Mushahid Hussain who took Nayar to A.Q. Khan's house has also been castigated. One wonders, however, how a massive intrusion of this sort into a most highly guarded secret domain of Pakistan could have taken place without some official design behind it. More so, when the context was the ongoing military exercise by India called the 'Brasstacks'. In any case, General Ziaul Huq did not lag behind in announcing to the world through a series of interviews particularly the one with the TIME magazine in March 1987, that Pakistan had acquired the nuclear capability.
