Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said the Japanese administration is usually free from political interference. "Hosokawa's successor is not likely to change Japan's established policy of supporting Taiwan's GATT bid," Huang said. He pointed out Taiwan's entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body is in Japan's interest under the current GATT framework. "Japan enjoys a huge trade surplus with Taiwan," Huang said. "Japan would benefit further from Taiwan's market opening following its GATT entry," he noted. Huang is scheduled to visit Tokyo late this month. While there, Huang will hold informal GATT-related tariff concession talks with Japanese officials and discuss other bilateral trade issues. Japan has not yet proposed a list of items it wants to negotiate with Taiwan for tariff reductions. Huang said he hopes Japan's new cabinet will take more positive steps to redress its huge trade surplus with Taiwan, which reached a record US$14.2 billion in 1993 and is likely to hit US$16 billion this year. "If the growing trade imbalance remains unresolved, it will become a political issue," he warned. Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations, Taiwan has maintained close economic relations with Japan because of historical and geographical reasons. Li Shang-chia, chief executive of a Taiwan-Japan trade promotion task force under the semi-official China External Trade Development Council, said he believes Hosokawa's quitting would not affect economic relations between the two countries. C. F. Ku, chairman of the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, echoed Li's view. Still, Ku said he worries that the political fallout of Hosokawa's resignation may slow transfer of Japanese technology to Taiwan. Ku, also chairman of the Taiwan-Japan trade promotion fund, said Hosokawa's departure may delay Japan's political reforms and market opening, and even cut into Japan's foreign aid and investment. "As Japan's gross national product accounts for about 20 percent of the world's total production of goods and services, its policy changes would certainly have an impact on the global economic development," Ku noted. "The government should keep close watch on Japan's political and economic development following Hosokawa's resignation, particularly who will be the next minister of international trade and industry," he added.
