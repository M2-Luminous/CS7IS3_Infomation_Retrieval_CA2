The official Croatian news agency HINA said the shelling broke out late Saturday and continued into Sunday morning. The UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) confirmed the fighting but not the casualty report. Shelling in the Gospic area of southern Croatia increased Sunday with UN troops counting 87 Croatian Army shells to 80 fired by Serb forces. One shell landed 20 metres (yards) from a positions held by Czech UN troops, while two mortar shells fell between 100 and 200 metres (yards) from another Czech post, UNPROFOR said. The Czechs had reported sporadic shelling in the area late Saturday. The fighting comes a week after both sides extended to March 31 a Christmas ceasefire. Until now the truce had been respected in three of four zones controlled by secessionist Serbs and monitored by UN troops. The truce has been violated on numerous occasions, mainly around the strategic Maslenica bridge, the only route linking Zagreb with the heavily populated Dalmatian coastline in southern Croatia. Croatian Serbs seized the Krajina region in the civil war that broke out in 1991 when Zagreb declared independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
