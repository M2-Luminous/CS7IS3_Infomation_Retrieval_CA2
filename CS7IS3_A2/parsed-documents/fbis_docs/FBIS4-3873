Differences on the human rights issue between China and the United States are very great, and it is not realistic to expect that a consensus could be reached through just one high-level visit. Differences on the concept of human rights between China and the United States are mainly expressed in four aspects. The first is that the idea of human rights in China is different from that in the United States. China holds that human rights is a comprehensive idea and is not a purely political concept. In accordance with the basic principle that "everybody enjoys freedom of speech and belief and is free from fear and want" stated in the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights," China holds that the contents of human rights should include four aspects, that is, the right to subsistence, the right to development, political rights, and social and cultural rights. These rights complement each other, and no one of them should be emphasized at the expense of another. In a certain sense, the right to subsistence and the right to development are the basis of political rights and social and cultural rights. If a person's safety, clothing, and food is not guaranteed, that person can in no way enjoy his political rights or social rights. However, the United States regards human rights in a narrow sense as civil rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of belief, which do not include the right to subsistence, including safety and the basic conditions for subsistence. According to the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights," civil rights are only a part of human rights and human rights is a more extensive concept than civil rights. However, the United States equates the idea of human rights with that of civil rights. The second is that China's understanding of the scope of human rights is different from that of the United States. China has a dialectical view of the scope of human rights and holds that human rights is the unity of the human rights of individuals with those of the collective in society. The idea of human rights has developed from the 18th century to its third generation at present. The first generation of the human rights concept stresses civil rights. In the second generation of the idea, economic rights, social rights, and cultural rights were added. The third generation, which emerged 20 years ago, includes the right to protect the environment and the right to death. China holds that the development of the idea of human rights from that of the human rights of the individual alone to stressing the human rights of the collective is human progress, because damage to the human rights of the collective is an infringement upon the human rights of most individuals. For example, an encroachment upon a country's sovereignty is an infringement of the right to independence of each citizen of that country. Although some U.S. scholars have criticized the outdated U.S. idea of human rights, the influence of the old idea remains very strong, and the idea of only stressing the human rights of the individual still occupies a dominant position in the United States. Since individualism is one of the mainstays of U.S. ideology, the idea of the human rights of the collective cannot be easily accepted by the government. The third is that China's understanding of human rights standards is different from that of the United States. China holds that the standard for human rights has international and national characteristics. As a human right, each natural human being should of course enjoy some identical rights, and this part of human rights should be based on international standards, for example, the right to safeguard peace, the right to oppose armed aggression, the right of racial equality, the right to oppose terror and threats, the right to protect the natural environment, and so on. However, because people live in different countries and the political system, economic level, history, culture, customs, and habits of different countries vary greatly, some human rights can only be determined according to the standards of the respective nations and countries and cannot be unified. For example, a murderer still has the right to subsistence in countries where the death penalty has been abolished, but does not have such a right in countries where the death penalty still exists. Since the death penalty has been abolished in only some U.S. states, the criminals' right to subsistence varies even within the country. However, the United States holds that human rights have only one standard, which is the international standard of the West. In fact, the human rights standards of various western countries are not the same. For example, Canada has accepted the "International Convention on Eliminating All Forms of Racial Discrimination," but the United States has not. The fourth is that China and the United States hold different views on the relationship between the rights and obligations of human beings. China holds that the rights and obligations of human beings are equal. While enjoying legitimate rights, each individual or nation must undertake the obligation of not preventing another individual or nation from enjoying legitimate rights. If this principle is not followed, it is impossible to guarantee that people can enjoy human rights fairly. When U.S. Armed Forces sent Panamanian President Noriega under armed escort to the United States for trial on 3 January 1990 under the pretext that drugs threatened U.S. security, the right of the United States to defend its security was based on depriving the Panamanians' right to defend the political security of their country. Therefore, China holds that when the human rights standard of one country differs from another, no country should impose its standard on another, otherwise this means depriving the people of that country of their right to make a decision on their standard for human rights. Such an act itself would be an infringement of human rights. Nevertheless, the United States does not think that the rights and obligations of human beings are necessarily intrinsically connected. The United States holds that human rights are endowed by nature and that God has not endowed each individual with equal rights and obligations. For example, the United States only stresses that parents have the right to give birth to children and to divorce, but does not talk about parental obligations to raise and educate children. As a result, the number of single parents has rapidly increased, and many children have lost their right to enjoy normal family life and to receive tertiary education. [as published] Causes of differences on human rights between China and the United States can be classified under two categories: objective causes and subjective causes. Objectively speaking, China's culture is different from that of the United States. China's culture praises the collective spirit highly, while U.S. culture praises individualism highly. Economically speaking, China is a developing country and still has many difficulties in solving the problem of clothing and feeding its 1.2 billion people. However, the United States, as a developed country, has the material conditions for solving the problem of clothing and feeding its people. Politically speaking, China is a socialist country and the equal sharing of social wealth is one important political goal of the country. However, the United States is a capitalist country, and protecting the rapid growth of private capital is one of the political tasks of that country. Differences on the concept of human rights between China and the United States are to a certain extent influenced by objective factors. However, the cause of such sharp differences between China and the United States is a subjective one, that is, the United States has adopted an attitude not conducive to settling differences. First of all, the United States has tried to compel China to accept the U.S. standard for human rights while disregarding international human rights standards. The United States does not accept the unified standard for human rights of international society and uses its own standard to assess the human rights situation of other countries. Since the United Nations adopted the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" in 1948, it has formulated a series of international conventions on human rights. The United States has not signed the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights," and, moreover, it has not joined many of the international conventions on human rights, such as "The International Convention on Eliminating All Forms of Racial Discrimination," "The International Convention on Civil and Political Rights," "The Convention on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights," "The International Convention on Banning and Punishing Crimes of Apartheid " "The Convention on Eliminating All Forms of Discrimination Against Women," "The Convention on Banning Atrocities and Other Cruel, Inhumane, and Humiliating Treatment or Punishment," and so on. The main reason why the United States does not recognize international conventions on human rights is that the United States holds that international law should not override domestic law. Therefore, the United States does not recognize any international convention which is not in keeping with domestic U.S. law. The United States holds that domestic law is the highest law, that these laws are applicable to all international affairs related to the United States, and that the countries concerned should also follow U.S. law to solve issues. In solving differences on human rights between China and the United States, the United States has explicitly demanded that China carry out the administrative orders of the U.S. President and improve human rights according to U.S. standards. Therefore, China cannot accept these hegemonic acts of the United States. Secondly, the United States has adopted double standards on the human rights issue. It has all along adopted double standards in its foreign policy by relying on its strength as a superpower. It has adopted different moral standards in accordance with the peculiarities of specific issues. For example, in order to develop markets in Japan as a deficit exists in its trade with Japan, the United States has put forward the necessity of protecting free trade and has opposed linking Japanese-U.S. political relations with economic issues. However, to reduce imports of products made in China as imbalances occur in Sino-U.S. trade, the United States has put forward restrictions on China's export and regards the human rights issue as a prerequisite for extending China's most-favored-nation status. In settling differences on human rights between China and the United States, the United States has also adopted double standards. For example, the United States has said that China letting reform-through-labor prisoners engage in production of export goods violates human rights, but the United States itself is enthusiastically engaged in exporting goods made in prisons. According to a report by the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, Higgs [xi ge 1585 2706], the marketing manager of Oregon State's prison industries, said that the state would export $3 million of prison products this year and would export jeans, shirts, and shorts made by prisoners to Japan, Italy, and other countries. California would also export on a trial basis similar goods to Japan and Malaysia. China, of course, cannot agree to the U.S. practice of adopting double standards on human rights. Third, much of the human rights criticism in the United States is based on groundless rumors. In criticizing China's human rights situation, the United States has seldom taken facts into consideration, but has often used hearsay as a basis. For example, the United States said the Beijing No. 1 Prison Qinghe Socks Plant exported socks made by reform-through-labor prisoners to the United States, but the results of an investigation showed no such thing. The U.S. government publication FEDERAL REGISTER announced the conclusion of an investigation in December 1993, which confirmed that socks made by prisoners at that plant were not, and could not have been, exported to the United States. The United States says that under communist rule, Tibetans have lost their human rights, however, in fact, Tibetan serfs escaped their status as serfs and were put on an equal footing politically with other people only after liberation. China has done nothing which infringes upon human rights and naturally cannot accept groundless U.S. accusations. Fourth, the United States has disagreed with China's rational views on human rights to cover up its poor human rights situation at home. For example, China has put forward that human rights should include the right to subsistence and the right to development. This view tallies with the fundamental principle of the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" and has won universal support and the recognition of the international community. The "Bangkok Declaration," the "Tunis Declaration," and the "Pact of San Jose" have accepted this view from China. However, the United States disagrees that the right to subsistence and the right to development are part of human rights. The main reason why the United States has disagreed with China's view is that the United States, being a country with the best material conditions, has not been able to ensure the basic right to subsistence of its people. According to a report carried in issue No. 9 of the U.S. weekly TIME, published on 28 February this year, several million people are homeless in the United States, and the number once reached 7 million in the 1980's. This is equivalent to the total population of Tianjin, the third biggest city in China at that time. In winter, hundreds of people die from exposure. If calculated according to the official standards for poverty, the number of people living in poverty in 1994 reached 33.7 million. One-third of people in the United States are not covered by medical insurance and do not have normal medical care. Because of serious crimes of violence, the personal security of Americans is not safeguarded. According to official U.S. statistics, 23,200 people were murdered in 1990, and if those who were robbed and raped were included, a total of 2 million people were victims of violent crime. In order to enable the people of all the countries in the world to enjoy legitimate rights to subsistence, China cannot but insist on its own correct stand. In the final analysis, differences on the human rights issue between China and the United States are not differences of cultural ideas or traditions. Nor are they merely an expression of a hegemonic mentality. It is an attempt by the United States to use the human rights issue as a point to break through to threaten China's existing system so that China will be in a state of chaos or weakness.
