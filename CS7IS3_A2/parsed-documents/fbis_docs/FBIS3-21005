The official startup of Euro-ISDN in December will give the digital network an additional boost. In the past years a number of countries have introduced ISDN. But there were no extensive ISDN standards, so that various performance characteristics and features were being used for connections in the individual countries. Above all, local ISDN terminal equipment and applications were confined to use in each country, so that each country developed its own terminal equipment. The result of this greatly limited the marketing opportunities, which also led to low production numbers and relatively high unit prices. In order to counteract these problems, 26 network operators from 20 European countries have committed themselves to introduce an ISDN based on a uniform European standard by the end of 1993. Telekom has also signed this agreement. It was determined that every network operator should offer both basic and primary multiplex connections. In addition, a minimum of services and performance features must be supported. Beyond that, however, every network operator is free to offer additional performance features, but he must use the international standards. The minimum range includes: - 64 kbit/s transmission service (transparent transmission of 64 kbit/s without limitation), - 3.1 kHz audio transmission service, - transmission of the calling number to the subscriber called, - suppression of transmission of the calling number - digital information display through to the extension in telecommunications facilities, - multiple number dialing - interchanging at the passive bus of the multiple equipment connection. With Euro-ISDN the user thus has the advantage in the future of being able to use a large, high-capacity, and inexpensive international range of terminal equipment. It has already been established that this is not just a future vision. Thus, as of January 1994 Telekom will offer a modern Euro-ISDN telephone at the cost of not quite 300 German marks [DM], which can be used with all current Euro-ISDN performance features. Small ISDN telecommunications facilities at a cost of DM 1,000 will be available approximately in mid-1994, and many experts anticipate that the price of passive ISDN PC adapter cards will shortly drop to about DM 200. Another important advantage with Euro-ISDN lies in the users being able to employ their ISDN applications and communications solutions without change in various countries, which greatly simplifies international communication. Introduction of Euro-ISDN in Germany Telekom began to implement Euro-ISDN in its network in August 1993. The only thing needed to make Euro-ISDN available is to change the software at the switching center. Hardware changes at the switching centers or the subscriber's network end is not necessary. The introduction of Euro-ISDN is so simple because international compatibility involves only signalling on the access line, the D-channel protocol. For technical reasons the introduction of the new software can only take place in stages, however, so that Euro-ISDN will not be available nationwide until April 1994. In regions where the work has been completed, customers can already be connected before that. The startup of regular operation took place on 1 December 1993. With the introduction of Euro-ISDN, Telekom will offer both the national (1TR6) and the European D-channel protocols (DSS-1) in its network. Each user can then decide whether he wants to use an ISDN connection with the national or the European standard. This applies to both existing connections and to new installations. The conversion takes place individually for each connection at the switching center. No changes are necessary at the network port. For connections between ports with various protocols, the conversion is carried out by the network. How long national ISDN will remain part of the features offered will be determined mainly by market requirements. Telekom plans to offer the choice between ISDN connections with national or European protocols until the year 2000. `Bilingual' ISDN Base Terminal Due to the different D-channel protocols, a 1TR6 terminal unit cannot be operated with a Euro-ISDN port. Conversely, it is also not possible to operate a Euro-ISDN terminal unit with a 1TR6 connection. Since Telekom will offer both D-channel protocols simultaneously in its network, and the customer himself can decide which standard he wants to use, this limitation is not significant with only one end unit. This applies in particular to ISDN connections of telecommunications facilities and computer centers. With Euro-ISDN Telekom will also offer a bilingual basic connection for multiequipment configuration (basic connection with passive bus), in which both standards are available simultaneously. For this a modified network port must be installed at the subscriber's which uses the European D-channel protocol toward the ISDN switching center and at the subscriber network interface (S[.sup]0[/] interface), in addition to the European D-channel protocol, also the 1TR6 protocol. This makes it possible to operate terminals with the national and European standard at the same time with one and the same basic connection. Bilingual primary multiplex connections are not possible for technical reasons and are therefore also not planned. If a telecommunications facility is connected through several ISDN ports, however, some of the ports could use the European D-channel protocol and the other ports the 1TR6 protocol. Services and Service Features with Euro-ISDN With the introduction of Euro-ISDN, Telekom offers a spectrum of services and service features which are clearly above the minimum range required. There will be many performance features which are not in the national ISDN and which make new applications possible. Some performance characteristics will also have new properties which permit even more comfortable communication. An example of this is "multiple dialing." This feature replaces the previously well-known "terminal selector character." With the terminal selector character it was possible to select each equipment specifically in the event several terminals are connected to an ISDN port. While in 1TR6-ISDN exactly 10 numbers are available in ascending order at a multiequipment port with the addition of another position to the ISDN call number, in Euro-ISDN up to 10 numbers can be defined as multiple call numbers. These can be any free numbers from the volume of call numbers at the switching center. This means that when changing over to Euro-ISDN the customer can keep his previous call number if he is already connected to a digital switching center. Basically, one can say that the service features of the national ISDN are connection-related, while in Euro-ISDN they are call number-related. For the user this has the advantage that he can use the service features for each multiple call number separately. Example: In rerouting a call, the entire connection is no longer transferred; instead, various rerouting destinations can be entered for each multiple number dialled. Additional features will be added over the next few years. In addition to three-party conferencing, special mention may be made of "partial rerouting" which will be available after 1994/95. With this feature rerouting calls from telecommunications installations will be possible for each individual extension. The "reserved permanent connection" feature (old name: semipermanent fixed connection), for which there is still no European standard at this time, will not be offered so far. "Three-party conferencing" will not be possible to use until the end of 1994. Euro-ISDN Rates Regarding ISDN rates it is necessary to distinguish between connection rates for basic and primary multiplex connections and for traffic rates. The traffic rates correspond to the normal analog telephone connection. For that it does not matter whether you call or send text, images, and data. There will be no service-based rates. Telekom thereby differs from some other countries, in which non-voice communication carries different and in part higher charges than voice transmission. However, the Euro-ISDN connection involves a new product with new features. That is the reason why Euro-ISDN rates are different from the rates for national ISDN. Basically, there will be separate tariff items for a Euro-ISDN connection without features, as well as for all features which can be switched on separately. Telekom is obligated to do this based on directives from the Federal Ministry for Posts and Telecommunication and the EC Commission. For reasons of handling and clarity, two cost packages are planned in which ISDN connection and features are bundled. The two packages offered are called ISDN Standard Connection and ISDN Comfort Connection and are offered in the basic connection variant at DM 64 and 69. At these rates the basic Euro-ISDN connection is DM 10 cheaper than the national connection variant. Access to X.25 Networks Euro-ISDN will not only offer new performance features but also the foundation for flexible and inexpensive communication. An example of this is access to X.25 networks over the B and D channel of the ISDN connection, for which Telekom will create the preconditions based on Euro-ISDN. Access through the D channel of the basic connection is particularly attractive for many applications. The D channel is basically reserved for the signalling of the connection. Information transmission in this channel is packet-oriented and takes place with a transmission speed of 16 kbit/s. Only a part of this transmission capacity is needed for signalling, so that the rest is available for transmission of "useful information." An ISDN customer can thus operate his basic connection independent of the use of the B channels as a X.25 connection. The access through the D channel is suitable for transmission speeds of up to 9600 bit/s. For higher speeds a B channel must be used. If a user would also like to utilize his ISDN connection as a packet network connection, he must pay for the use of this feature in addition to the monthly base rate for the ISDN connection. Connection charges in ISDN are not included in the present concept, but the rates for each X.25 network are added. Access through the D channel of the basic connection will presumably be very inexpensive. As of right now, operation is likely to begin in the second quarter of 1994. The intended technical solution primarily offers advantages for applications in which only small data quantities must be transmitted per connection and which also have other communications needs. Among them may be mentioned the electronic cash systems in retail sales or booking systems in travel agencies. The advantage is that the users do not have to acquire several different telecommunication ports for language communication and data transmission, which leads to more flexibility and, above all, savings.
