Up to 25 December 1993, 12 generators larger than 200MW (and with a total installed capacity of 3.0225 million kilowatts) had gone into service. This exceeded the State Plan, which called for 11 units with a combined capacity of 2.77 million kilowatts. Added to this are local small and medium hydroelectric generators, which put China in second place in the world (behind Brazil) for newly installed hydro capacity, exceeding that of the United States, the former Soviet Union, and Canada.
