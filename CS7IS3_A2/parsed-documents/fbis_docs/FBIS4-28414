The Guinean Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification in a statement on May 24 said that old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who were taken prisoners during the Korean war, should have been sent back to the Northern half of Korea in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement, but they suffered pains in South Korean prison for 30 years and are now living a lonely life without the support of their families and relatives after their release. The South Korean authorities must immediately send them back to the Northern half of the country where their families and relatives are waiting for them, stressed the statement. The Portuguese Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea in an appeal on May 23 demanded that old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan be repatriated to the Northern half of Korea at once and unconverted long-term prisoner An Hak-sop be set free. The South Korean authorities claim that the fascist dictatorial regime has been replaced by a "civilian government", but the people are not ensured even elementary freedom, the appeal noted, and strongly demanded that the "National Security Law," a fascist law, be scrapped without delay. The Mongolia-Korea Friendship Association in a letter to the International Committee of the Red Cross on May 21 called for helping old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan go back soon to their hometowns to enjoy human rights.
