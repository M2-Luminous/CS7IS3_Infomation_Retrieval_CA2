The exchange of protocols followed a meeting between Robaina and Indonesian Trade Minister Satrio Budihardjo Joedono. Robaina arrived in Jakarta last night on the first leg of a three-week visit to the Asian region that will take him to Laos, Myanmar (former Burma), Cambodia, India, Vietnam, and Malaysia. During a news conference following the signing of the agreements, the Cuban official affirmed that his visit to the region seeks to explain the situation his country experiencing. Robaina indicated that Asia needs to know what Cuba is and that we need to know about this continent. That is the reason we are making a big effort to bring an end to the unjust U.S. blockade against our country, he added.
