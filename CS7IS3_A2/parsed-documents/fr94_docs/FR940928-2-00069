All visitors will be required to walk through a metal detector, have all belongings screened by an x-ray system, show valid picture identification, and sign the visitor's log. Guards will telephone the visitors HUD contact to announce their arrival and receive verification to permit the visitor into the building prior to allowing entry. These procedures will require extra time. Offerors must therefore ensure that any commercial delivery service or company employee has appropriate identification, and should allow extra time for any hand carried deliveries. Delays experienced at the guard desk or refusal of admission DO NOT constitute excusable delays. Any applications that arrive at Suite 6151 after the date and time specified will be rejected and will be returned to the applicant.
