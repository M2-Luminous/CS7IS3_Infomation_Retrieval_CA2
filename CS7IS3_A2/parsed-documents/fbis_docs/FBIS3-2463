Chinese sources said the issue was expected to be a major subject of debate among 3,000 deputies to the second plenary session of the 8th National People's Congress (NPC), to open on Thursday. The sources in the economic sector said yesterday the disagreement focused on whether the ongoing tax reforms would spark a new round of price spirals and whether anti-inflation measures or tax reforms should be given priority in policy. Central planners, headed by Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier and former planning minister Zou Jiahua, have gained the upper hand in the in-fighting by taking advantage of disputes in the reformist camp and widespread discontent in the regions over the new taxation package initiated by reformist officials led by economic czar Zhu Rongji. Executive Vice-Premier Zhu argued that it was good timing to push ahead with the tax restructuring which, if proven successful in implementation, could build an effective mechanism for micro- control. And the mechanism in turn would help government efforts to combat inflation. Mr Zhu, also governor of China's central bank, said he preferred tightening monetary controls in order to ease inflationary pressures rather than using administrative means to reimpose price capping across the board or slap ping bans on investment. But central planners believe that the ongoing package would inevitably spur a new round of price hikes and that the policy should be implemented cautiously and step by step. They said market stability and price control should be the priority in implementing reform policies. Beijing sources said that with wider support both in the central and regional authorities central planners had launched a series of measures to block the current reform package. Their latest and toughest move was a central circular that for the first time stated clearly that any tax reform measures should take second place to guaranteeing stable market prices. On Friday, the State Planning Commission, the State Price Administration and the State Taxation Administration said in the circular to the regions that local governments must ensure stable market prices before they could implement the taxation package. The document, worked out by central planners led by Mr Zou, also gives local governments and regional planning and price departments extensive power to reimpose price capping on various commodities and services, many of which had been dropped in recent years following swift reforms to liberalise the economy. It also says that the central government would consider some regions' applications to suspend or stretch the time table for implementing tax reforms if inflation had got out of hand in their regions following too-rapid restructuring. The State Planning Com mission is also set to call a national telephone conference on price inspection to day to be attended by senior regional economics and price administration officials. The meeting is to review the market situation two months after the implement tation of the first tax reform package in more than four decades. Chinese economists said moves in the past few weeks had apparently set back the reform packages worked out by liberal officials led by Mr Zhu. They said the debate between the factions would escalate at the NPC meeting.
