Herve de Guelinck reports: [Guelinck] The HCR-PT has accepted the candidature of seven candidates for the post of prime minister. Etienne Tshisekedi, the opposition leader and the prime minister elected in August 1992 by the sovereign national conference, is no longer in the race: He still sees himself as the elected prime minister and not as a candidate. Among the seven candidates which have been accepted are three former prime ministers, including Kengo Wa Dondo, who has a reputation for being a good manager and who would be likely to restore the trust of international monetary institutions. According to our information, the introduction of the candidates started this afternoon although there is not yet a quorum of two-thirds of councillors; some 40 are reported to be missing. It must be pointed that Etienne Tshisekedi's friends consider this election process illegal and are keeping away from the session. If there is a quorum of two-thirds this afternoon, a vote will be held. Otherwise, it will be necessary to wait until tomorrow because the presence of two-thirds will no longer be necessary tomorrow in accordance with the internal regulations. It must be pointed out that neither the chairman of the HCR-PT, Mgr Monsengwo, nor the deputy chairman representing the opposition, Social-Christian Joseph Ileo, are present in Kinshasa. This is why the HCR-PT office is currently dominated by President Mobutu's allies, which may account for the fact that, in spite of a lot of criticism, the HCR-PT is intent on going forward, even if this means forcing through the election of the prime minister.
