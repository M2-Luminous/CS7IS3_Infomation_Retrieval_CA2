An Orthodox believer, he was baptized in 1968, when to profess Christianity openly was a challenge to the Soviet regime. In the spring of 1991, Saburov was one of the chief ideologists and authors of the economic program which served as a basis for Boris Yeltsin's election program, when the latter ran as a candidate for the Russian presidency. He then became a Russian deputy prime minister and economy minister. Following his victory in the Crimean presidential election, Yuriy Meshkov offered him the premiership, which, to many people's surprise, Saburov accepted. According to him, Crimea's love of Russia and rejection of Ukraine has more economic than political reasons. The economic situation in Crimea "is catastrophic," Saburov asserts, and Ukraine's current "communist leaders" are to blame. However, he denies that Crimea wishes to become independent and that it is demanding a revision of borders. "That entails the danger of bloodshed," he says. "What we do want is economic autonomy." Despite the tensions existing between Kiev and Simferopol, Saburov does not believe that the political situation could deteriorate to the extent of exploding into an armed conflict, as has happened elsewhere in the former USSR. "The possibility of armed confrontations is slight, although it cannot be guaranteed that they will not occur, since, as recent history shows, man has something irrational in his behavior. But Crimea is not the Caucasus. The Crimeans have their eyes set on Europe, and they wish only to have a good living standard," he explains. More than tomorrow's elections to the local parliament and referendum, the important thing is the elections to the Ukrainian parliament -- also tomorrow -- believes Saburov, who also hopes that "the population will vote against the Communists." Agreement Impossible "The current Ukrainian Government is acting very nervously, does not know what it wants, and tensions arise for ridiculous reasons," he complains. "It is completely impossible to reach an agreement with Kiev, because it does not then carry out what was agreed," said Saburov, who complains that Ukraine refuses to see "the hand which Meshkov has extended to it." The Crimeans are extremely dissatisfied with Kiev's policy, since they see it as the cause of their problems. "The Crimean population's living standard is very low, but the peninsula's potential is very great. We must therefore conclude that somebody is to blame for the current situation. The problem is that Crimea's economy is bound to Russia. This is an objective fact: The sales market for Crimea's output -- goods and services -- is Russia," Saburov asserts. In the meantime, Kiev, through tariff barriers and a shortsighted taxation policy, has cut Crimea off from this market where it used to sell its grain, its vegetables, its wine.... The consumers of tourist services were also the Russians. "The whole of northern Russia used to spend its summer vacation in Crimea." "Therefore, Crimea's orientation toward Russia is not a political but an economic matter," he states. Another accusation leveled by the Crimeans against the Ukrainian leaders is that they "are still Communists and in fact are carrying out no reform," "Now it is usually said that wherever the democrats have come to power, the living standard is falling. But Ukraine's example shows that the fall in the living standard is not a result of the democrats' actions: The Ukrainian Government is not democratic and has carried out no reforms, but the fall in the living standard has been incomparably greater than in Russia," he declares.
