The opposition candidate to Guinea-Bissau's presidential elections has just been cleared of charges at Guinea-Bissau's Supreme Military Court. After the verdict was pronounced the first thing Joao da Costa did was to talk to us: [Da Costa] "There were 14 defendants on trial at the Supreme Military Court and only three of them were cleared of charges: Joao da Costa, Tarmo (Anawai), and Gil (Sanha)." [Announcer] That was a relieved Joao da Costa. [Da Costa] "Thank God. I have just witnessed one of the greatest injustices ever." [Announcer] That was Joao da Costa talking to Luis Ferreira. The leader of Guinea-Bissau's PRD [Democratic Renewal Party] has no doubt that had there not been international pressure his conviction would have been certain: [Da Costa] "That is the regime. Had it been anyone else but Joao da Costa, I am sure they would have also been convicted. It is all because I am Joao da Costa, one of the opposition leaders, and international pressure helped me in being cleared."
