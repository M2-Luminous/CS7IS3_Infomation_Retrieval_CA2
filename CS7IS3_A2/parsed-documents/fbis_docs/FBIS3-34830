The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad will visit Tehran this month. Meanwhile, it has been reported that al-Asad will meet with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak this month as well. The political circles said that there is a link between the next Syrian move at this level and the escalation in Hizballah's activities against Israel via southern Lebanon. The sources said that al-Asad will offer new proposals which could bring views closer between Cairo and Tehran in a renewal of the Syrian endeavor -- which was suspended before the end of last year -- to correct positions and ease recent factors of tension between them. The sources also said that the Syrian president will submit to Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani a report on the development of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, the results of his talks in Geneva last month with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and the future of peace in the light of the new factors and changes. The sources said that the Syrian move requires regional coordination and support in the framework of strategic interests.
