Gore's tour, which included Bolivia and continued in Brazil, is a preparatory visit for the Summit of the Americas that President Bill Clinton called for December in Miami, and to which Argentina wants to arrive in the best possible condition. However, Gore's cascade of public praise for Argentina's economic boost, privatization policy, signing of nonproliferation treaties, and commitment to peacekeeping missions did not lighten the warnings and deadlines -- which are closer every day -- that he emphasized for complying with bilateral agenda topics. -- First of all, Gore exerted full pressure for approval of a patents law. Like Foreign Trade Secretary Mickey Kantor made a week ago, Gore made it clear that if the law is not approved there will be commercial sanctions, and the swift pace toward NAFTA -- the free-trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada -- will be lost. Argentina, Chile, and Colombia are candidates to join NAFTA. -- Menem and his cabinet resorted to all sorts of gestures and phrases to prove the government's political will to promote the bill requested by the United States. But they had to admit that it will be impossible for them to have the bill approved before 30 April (the deadline the United States set to begin considering sanctions), but they promised to have it approved in a few days by the Senate committee studying the bill. -- When commenting on the bill's details, Argentine officials hinted that beyond the law that will be approved by Congress, it will be the law's regulations -- to be issued by the executive branch -- that will set the tone for effectively enforcing the intellectual property law. -- In return, Menem once again, and rather unsuccessfully, demanded that the United States give up its agricultural subsidy policy, which has seriously harmed Argentine interests. He once again listened to Gore make an old excuse: The issue of subsidies is very broad, involves all GATT talks, and the United States will not do it unilaterally while Europeans do not give up their own policy. -- As for Menem's initiative to create a White Helmet unit within the United Nations to fight starvation, a decision was made to create a bilateral commission, which might meet next month in Washington and new York.
