He also said that the GATT conference opened new doors to Morocco to extend the scope of its cooperation with various developed countries. Here is the text of the interview. [Correspondent] Mr. Abdellatif Filali, minister of state for foreign affairs and cooperation: The GATT conference ended here in Marrakech yesterday. You signed the agreement marking the birth of the international trade organization on behalf of the Moroccan delegation. First of all, what is your assessment of the results of the conference? [Filali] As stated by his majesty in his speech yesterday, I believe that this was a very important international event. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mentioning the European Union [EU], how do you envision future relations between Morocco and the EU in the trade and, particularly, the agricultural spheres? [Filali] On this particular point I would like to remind the Moroccan public, particularly those who have a specific profession in this field or direct trade with European markets, that within the scope of GATT there is an essential point, namely Point 24 in the GATT agreement which stresses that the regional agreements that hitherto exist will remain intact. By that I mean that Morocco's privileges with the European Community will not change. Therefore, let all Moroccans who have close and well-established relations with Europe be rest assured that there will be no change in that sphere. [passage omitted]. [Correspondent] We shall set aside the GATT conference and Moroccan-European relations and move to another question concerning our national issue. What is the government's view regarding the recent resolution passed by the UN Security Council, Resolution 907? [Filali] I believe that it is necessary to discuss Resolution 809 before dealing with Resolution 907. In Resolution 809, the Security Council gave the UN secretary general a new prerogative in an attempt to bring about an agreement between the two sides with regards to the criteria and implementation. The negotiations were very tough, but finally we reached a positive result with the secretary general and accepted his proposals regarding the criteria and implementation. The Moroccan agreement took place this year. Since then, the secretary general personally, or his special envoy in the region, have been repeatedly trying to convince the other side of the need to get their endorsement of his proposal, namely compromise solutions regarding the criteria and their implementation. However, as stated in the secretary general's report, so far Morocco has provided every facility in its dealings with the secretary general and the general secretariat regarding the proposal, but there are pending problems. By that I mean the other side has so far not given a clear reply concerning the secretary general's proposal. Therefore, it is farcical when we hear many mercenaries abroad saying that Morocco is responsible for the status quo; and it is necessary that the Moroccan and also international public opinion should be aware that the true culprit, who is mentioned in Resolution 907, is the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro]. In fact, this resolution does not concern us greatly because we have given our approval to the secretary general's reconciliation proposal this year. Therefore, when the Security Council says in this resolution that the voter identification commission is now committed to register all the people in the referendum lists, it means that from now until 30 June the Polisario has to give its final reply. [passage omitted] I believe that our stance is correct and enjoys official and sensible international support. [passage omitted] Responsibility for what is taking place in the region lies with Polisario's stance and those who support its stance. This is what can be said now. I believe that our public opinion in Morocco is not confused about that because Morocco's position is getting stronger daily. Everyone believes that what is taking place in the international field is indicative that Polisario's stances and statements have lost credibility. It is empty talk. [passage omitted]
