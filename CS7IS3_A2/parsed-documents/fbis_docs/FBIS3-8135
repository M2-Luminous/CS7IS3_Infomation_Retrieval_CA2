In order to guarantee its security, Slovakia relies especially on NATO, the West European Union, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations, says the document which must be approved by the parliament. Active participation in the North Atlantic Council for Cooperation and in the Partnership for Peace project is an important starting point for NATO membership. Internal security could be jeopardised by escalated nationalism and irredentism by a part of the population with possible tendencies to violate the integrity of the state territory, appearance and anti-constitutional activities of extremist political organisations, criminal activity committed in connection with privatisation and corruption in state bodies, the document says.
