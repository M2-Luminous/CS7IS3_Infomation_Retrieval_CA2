President Clinton, the leadership of the U.S. Congress, and I came to complete mutual understanding regarding various aspects of politics on the agenda of our talks," Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state, stated on Wednesday evening. In an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent he noted that, during the meetings with the U.S. leadership, "an atmosphere of solidarity with Georgia and support for its territorial integrity and democratic development prevailed." E. Shevardnadze pointed out that he had spent a few hours at the U.S. Congress, persuading the legislators of the need to render urgent and effective economic assistance to Georgia. "In my opinion, during discussion of the aid package the legislators will remember my arguments and agree that the volume of assistance promised by the administration should be increased," he said. "At the present time a critical situation has taken shape in Georgia; the country is on the brink of famine. We need Western assistance, both financial and technical, as never before." As regards a settlement of the Abkhazian-Georgian conflict, the Georgian leader noted that he had completely devoted the last day of his visit to meetings at the United Nations. "I submitted several variants for a peace settlement to the Security Council," he said. "My speech was received with understanding and approval. At the present time the detailed drafts submitted by us for ways of achieving peace are being examined by the UN secretary general, who should make a final decision in the immediate future. This was a very important day for us. Owing to the fact that numerous talks were scheduled at the headquarters of the international community, we had to make adjustments to the program of the visit and postpone meetings with business circles, although they are also important for us." The head of the Georgian state spoke out in favor of "global de-Bosnia-ization [debosniizatsii] of all the regional conflicts in the 20th century." He called upon the United States and other developed states in the world to promote this process. "In many cases not only national hatred, separatism, extremism, but also blatant elements of fascism manifest themselves," he pointed out. "We cannot allow the shoots of fascism to grow and allow extremism to triumph." Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the temporary committee of Georgia for emergency situations, reported in a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent that "the president and the entire delegation were really satisfied with the results of the visit to Washington, but the talks that took place at the United Nations showed that not everyone in the international community is on the side of Georgia." "Some people think that we are extremists," he pointed out. "I think that the U.S. Administration and the UN leadership will come to share the view that there is an acute need to send peacekeeping forces to the region. I think, however, that this contingent will be negligible. It will probably consist of servicemen mainly from the European countries and naturally from Russia, although the U.S. side will try to see that the Russian `blue berets' are involved as little as possible. The Americans themselves are refusing to send their lads to us." As the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from informed sources, on the last day of his stay in Washington E. Shevardnadze held a meeting with CIA Director James Woolsey, at the latter's request, "with just a few people present." According to Petr Chkheidze, during the talks ways were discussed of effecting joint activity in the field of combating the illegal transportation of narcotics to the United States. Both the sides, he noted, had agreed on joint efforts to put an end to this criminal activity.
