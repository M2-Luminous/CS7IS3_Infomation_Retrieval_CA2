Mr. Sakho, who was answering questions put to him by Radio Senegal reporters, said the emergency plan adopted by Senegal in August last year to remove the major imbalances in public finances will be maintained with some modifications. With this plan, salaries were reduced by 15 percent in the public sector thus lowering civil service salaries from 2.6 billion French francs to less than Fr1.8 billion . The emergency plan is "unavoidable" and will "support the external adjustment" necessitated by the CFA franc devaluation, the minister said. He also announced the establishment of a future plan to limit inflation on essential commodities like rice, sugar, and flour. According to Mr. Sakho, the inflation rate envisaged for the first year after the devaluation is 40 percent. The ultimate objective is to reduce this inflation rate to 10 percent in the second year.
