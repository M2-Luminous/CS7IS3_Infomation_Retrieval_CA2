Mr Tillett, an IFP spokesman, said: "We've just received information from intelligence sources that the ANC planted snipers in the crowd. There are deliberate plans to discredit Zulus in the Transvaal. The ANC will claim this is an IFP march and this will probably be an attempt to discredit the IFP as well." He stressed it was not an IFP march but rather one organised by "indunas" [chiefs].
