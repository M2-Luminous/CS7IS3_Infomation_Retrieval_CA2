A few days ago, Shanghai Shentong [3947 6639] International S&T Company--formed from the Shanghai Municipal Land Management Bureau and Shanghai Jiaotong University's Overseas Company--reached agreement with Hong Kong's Huaxu [5478 2485] Ltd. to build on this plot a US$70 million trans-century smart tower. Groundbreaking for this smart tower, to be called Shentong Square, took place yesterday. The joint venture, called Shanghai Shentong Real Estate Development Ltd., hoisted its signpost yesterday as it geared up for this development project. The 28-floor Shentong Square, occupying 60,000 square meters of land, is to be completed in 1996, in honor of the centennial of the university. The tower offices will be partially sold and partially leased.
