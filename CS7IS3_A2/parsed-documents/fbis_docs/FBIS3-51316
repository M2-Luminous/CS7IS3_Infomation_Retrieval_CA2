The decision was made when Banco Latino's debit balance could not be paid on 12 January at the Chamber of Compensation's close of business due to a shortage of funds in its BCV account. As a result, the procedures established in Article 12 of the Chamber of Compensation's regulations had to be enforced. Consequently, Banco Latino will cease to participate in the Chamber of Compensation System. The BCV has notified the Superintendency of Banks, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund], the finance minister, and the president of the National Banking Council of its decision so each of them can do their duty in accordance with the law. This case will be handled by the competent institutions, which will apply the new banking legislation, so the normal functioning of the financial system should not be affected. The BCV hopes this situation will be resolved in the most constructive manner by the appropriate bodies to guarantee the enforcement of the savings, payments, and financial intervention systems.
