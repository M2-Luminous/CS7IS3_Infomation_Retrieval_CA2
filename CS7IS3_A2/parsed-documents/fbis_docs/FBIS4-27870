Security Council sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms program would be substantial and phased, a senior South Korean Government official said Sunday. The official, accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his state visit to Uzbekistan, said the Security Council would begin discussing sanctions Monday. "Sanctions the U.N. Security Council will apparently impose would be so substantial as to cause pain to Pyongyang and would be enforced on a phased basis," he said. The official said he saw no problems stopping the Security Council from imposing sanctions since Russian President Boris Yeltsin promised to support sanctions and China, too, is deeply concerned about North Korea's arbitrary replacement of fuel rods. As to the reason for phased sanctions, he said it is because the North Koreans still have a chance to ensure the transparency of their past nuclear activities. "Though nuclear fuel rods have been replaced, North Korea is still able to ensure its nuclear transparency through special IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspections or in other ways dictated by the IAEA," the official said. North Korea, he added, has yet to reprocess the spent fuel rods taken from the country's 5-megawatt atomic reactor. Meanwhile, the official said no particular military movements by North Korea have been detected although Pyongyang is repeating its existing policy in a barrage of statements in connection with the international move toward sanctions.
