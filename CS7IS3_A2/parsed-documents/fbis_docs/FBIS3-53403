These attempts against Lebanon's unity, he added, will keep happening but security forces are prepared to foil them. Dean of editors' Milhim Karam, who visited the president with a delegation from the Editors Union, reported that the president said that President Hafiz al-Asad is going to Geneva to defend not only issues concerning Syria and the Golan but also Lebanese issues. This summit has been well prepared and will therefore achieve positive results, he noted. On municipal elections, the president hoped that elections will be held for the posts of village heads and mayors because municipalities have not had adequate representation. The president emphasized that the Constitution is not a bible or divine and that it can be amended because it is man-made, negotiable, and subject to change. He noted that this Constitution did great injustice to the presidency because it weakened Article 58, which deals with urgent decrees; made the dissolution of the cabinet impossible; and annulled presidential authority on the cabinet. The president reiterated his pledge to respect freedoms. He said that the media have a role in educating the public and saving them from perversion, which requires correspondents to tell the people all the facts. On the cabinet debates, the president said: I agree with you that the cabinet sessions, resolutions, and agenda are not secret, but it is not wise to publicize every issue discussed by the cabinet.
