[Zieleniec] We feel that we are an integral part of the European continent, so it is natural and logical for us to communicate as if we were neighbors. Portugal belongs to the European Union [EU] and the Atlantic alliance. For us it is natural that the logic of our course tends toward those institutions. It is necessary to talk, as well as to exchange experiences and views on those realities, with a view to a mutual understanding. In addition, bilateral contacts are very important. The two countries are of a similar size, trade must not be overlooked, and it is natural for it to become necessary to create conditions essential for trade. I will also be signing an agreement preventing double taxation -- one of the essential conditions for the sound development of economic relations. I would also like to recall that President Soares visited the country immediately after our revolution, in a very complex situation, and we regard this as proof of deep friendship and trust. [De Sousa] Moreover, President Soares will be coming here again this year.... [Zieleniec] Yes, this is planned, and he will have the opportunity to see how this country has altered, how Prague has changed its appearance. He will be able to see everything that has been done by us. So we are very glad to have the opportunity and the chance to welcome the Portuguese president again. [De Sousa] On this visit to Lisbon, you will also have the opportunity to raise the Czech intention to join the EU and to explain that plan to the Portuguese.... [Zieleniec] In our opinion, it is very natural that we should some day belong to the EU, because it includes the countries which are our family, with which we have had dealings throughout our history. So I believe that it will not be necessary to explain this aim. If the Czech Republic did not wish to join, then it would be necessary to give explanations.... [De Sousa] In any event, one of the matters which will be raised by the member states such as Portugal during the membership negotiations when they are held will be the competition of countries such as the Czech Republic for Community funds, which at that time will have to be shared out by more European regions. Will this aspect also be broached in Lisbon? [Zieleniec] I believe that it is possible to discuss every kind of issue linked to the membership process, but it is necessary to observe the changes in our country over the past four or five years and the dynamism of our economic development. I believe that our republic will soon be in a position to be able contribute to the Community more than it receives. [De Sousa] Do you believe so? [Zieleniec] I do not think it is necessary to discuss the matter at this time, but if we are going to broach this problem in greater detail, what matters most is agriculture. We have problems with agriculture different from those occurring today in the EU. Our system of organization of agriculture is relatively liberal, and we would like to liberalize it to a level similar to that of industry -- that is, eliminate all kinds of subsidies and grants -- and we hope that with our joining the EU we will not have to change this. We hope that agriculture, as it currently exists in the EU, will tend more toward a market system. [De Sousa] At what date do you hope formally to apply for EU membership? [Zieleniec] We deem it important to send no wrong signals. What matters is that, above all, our country's citizens should know that the most important thing is not the date of the membership application but knowing how and how quickly we will be able to transform this country. [De Sousa] And when do you hope for actual membership? There is talk of 2010.... [Zieleniec] I believe this is all linked to a whole general view for central and eastern Europe. Those who visit our country soon acknowledge that it will in no way be a further burden for the EU. [De Sousa] It has been stated that the reason for joining has to do with the desire to move closer to a Europe with which this country has historical ties, but is there not also a security concern, in order to provide against any form of instability in Russia? [Zieleniec] I believe that if there is democracy and a market economy system in Russia, we will have nothing to fear. If there is none of that, you, too, will have to be be afraid. [De Sousa] But in the event of a problem, the Czech Republic will be geographically closer to Russia. The perception abroad is that the countries of this region are seeking to move closer to the West in order to feel more secure.... [Zieleniec] I do not believe that there is a particularly acute danger right now. Of course, in the medium and long-term perspective, it is important to know how this part of the continent will be organized. That is natural, but it is not good to analyze these matters from the viewpoint of the past. Europe was divided by conventional weapons during World War II, with the involvement of infantry and tanks -- not through nuclear missiles. All the developments today have other technical conditions. I do not believe that it is possible now to introduce the simple geometry of the forties into this problem. I can guarantee that an unstable and aggressive Russia represents a danger both for us and for the rest of the continent. That is why we are rooting so much for the Russian democrats and hoping that they will succeed in achieving what they want. [De Sousa] Is there a Zhirinovskiy factor? Do you believe he is a danger? [Zieleniec] Zhirinovskiy as a man, no, but the 26 percent of the votes which he won, yes. Where there is no political stability, where there are economic problems, political forces tend to adopt extreme stances. Hence the importance of political and economic stability in Russia. [De Sousa] In light of that observation, do you believe that the Czech Republic will be more secure if it moves closer to the West? [Zieleniec] Yes, of course, but we are already very close. [De Sousa] How do you interpret the Partnership for Peace which you have now signed with NATO? Do you believe it is sufficient for your aspirations? [Zieleniec] I do not know what you mean by "sufficient." It is natural that we would like to belong to the Atlantic alliance, because we feel that it contains countries with the same values that we uphold. The Partnership for Peace is not the alliance, but it is an area created in order to cooperate together. Of course we welcome this opportunity, and we will very actively take advantage of all the possibilities that it offers. [De Sousa] But the final aim is to join NATO.... [Zieleniec] That is clear. [De Sousa] Let us talk a little now about the Czech Republic's evolution following the separation from Slovakia. What has economic and political life in this country been like in this new situation? [Zieleniec] I do not think it is possible to make a comparison in those terms. Some problems, such as the constant arguments with Slovakia over the form of organization of the state, have disappeared. We have succeeded in establishing a stable parliament and government, and we have a well directed economic reform which is accepted by the overwhelming majority of our population. Political and economic stability is also extremely important from the viewpoint of cooperation with other countries. We note considerable interest on the part of foreign investors, who can find considerable potential here. We have a large foreign trade surplus, and in the balance of payments we have sufficient currency reserves. Our unemployment rate is just 3 percent. Our currency's exchange rate is stable, having hardly fluctuated in the past four years. And these are all signs of an economic boom and also a good basis for the favorable development of the whole of society. [De Sousa] What is the current relationship between the Czech Republic and Slovakia? Are they friendly relations? [Zieleniec] This whole process has been very painful for us, because from the psychological viewpoint it is very difficult for us to accustom ourselves to the idea that a state is dividing. We therefore adopted a pragmatic attitude and did what was necessary at the time. We sat down at the same table and discussed dozens and dozens of agreements. We can now say that there are reciprocal agreements between the two countries governing all aspects of our lives. There are no problems for the population. They can travel freely. They can live in either country; the problems of hiring, insurance, and social welfare have been resolved. A customs union has been set up. I am convinced that resolving all these problems created the basis for the whole process' success. When I look back, I can say that it was almost a miracle to have succeeded in maintaining the friendly relations which exist between us, despite this very confused and painful situation. Of course there are still some problems, which I hope will be resolved, but I am convinced that we will resolve them as we have resolved all the others. Relations, both between the two states and between the two nations, remain friendly, and we are very pleased that this has been achieved.
