Rural Centrist Ivar Raig, Social Democrat Ardo Ojasalu and faction member Heiki Nestor claimed that President Lennart Meri is provided with false information. They explained their claim with the president's opposition to the replacement of former Economy Minister Toomas Sildmae. Raig claimed that the actual situation was exactly opposite to what Meri had said, stressing that the ministry had not submitted a single original draft law to the Riigikogu. He also rejected the president's accusations that the prime minister was building an administrative state. The presidential chancellery has placed the president in an unpleasant situation, he said. Heiki Nestor claimed that economic circles are exerting pressure on the president, while Ardo Ojasalu regretted the descent "on the level of everyday politics". Raig added that Toomas Sildmae was the only winner in the conflict. The Moderates also commented on the possibility of a breakup of their faction, claiming that an agreement had been achieved, according to which no breakup will take place in the nearest three months. This was done as a favour to the independent faction members who would have had to make their choice in a short time otherwise.
