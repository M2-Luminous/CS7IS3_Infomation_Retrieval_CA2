He urged all departments in all areas to take appropriate measures to expedite the textile industry's embarking on a road of healthy development as soon as possible. The textile industry had made tremendous contributions to the motherland and her people. In his speech, Li Lanqing fully affirmed these contributions. He said: The textile industry is the mainstay of China's industries now and will remain so in the future. This is because it not only meets the Chinese people's increasing need for clothes but it also holds first place among all of China's industries in generating foreign exchange from exports. It is also impossible that the industry's superior export performance will disappear in the future. Therefore, China's textile industry has bright prospects. The textile industry, however, faces unprecedented challenges and tests in the course of shifting our track from a planned economy to a market economy. Li Lanqing said: The following new problems have cropped up in the textile industry since early this year. Cotton is in short supply; cotton prices have gotten out of control; only about 42 percent of the tasks for the allocation and transfer of cotton have been fulfilled; there has been too sharp an increase in the prices of cotton yarn and cotton cloth; an increasing number of enterprises have been forced to stop production; the contradiction of a drop in the industry's economic efficiency is very conspicuous; and the state of the industry's exports is grim. The supply of and demand for cotton has a direct bearing on the normal production order of the textile industry. Because of this, Li Lanqing pointed out: State-owned enterprises must take control of cotton purchased by the state. It should be allocated according to the state plan and the prices for different grades of cotton. First of all, reselling at high prices by state-owned enterprises to seek exorbitant profits should be strictly prohibited. The State Planning Commission and departments in charge of prices should work with the relevant departments to draw up a list of prices for different grades of cotton and have it published in newspapers. The industrial and commercial administrative departments and other law-enforcement departments should strengthen the management of the markets for cotton and crack down on lawbreakers or speculators trying to resell cotton for exorbitant profits. To maintain the normal order in purchasing cotton, Li Lanqing stressed: Because cotton and hemp companies have been entrusted by the state to purchase cotton and allocate it to various departments, it must be allocated according to the plan. Governments at all levels should be responsible for checking on compliance; they should check whether provinces, cities, and districts have fulfilled their allocation tasks. Provincial authorities should also check compliance in the counties. Counties which have not fulfilled their allocation tasks should be made accountable for the missing cotton. Units or individuals who seek profits by reselling state-distributed cotton, or who divert it for private use must be severely punished. Li Lanqing said: At present, it is necessary to see to it that key export enterprises are supplied with cotton. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent low-quality, low-technology, and low-efficiency small cotton-weaving enterprises from using state-allocated cotton, and also to prevent speculation by cotton dealers. An effective measure to ensure this is to extend loans to support key enterprises while suspending loans to low-quality small cotton- weaving plants and to cotton speculators. It is necessary to get to the root of the problem by giving play to the macroeconomic regulatory role of the money policy. Banks should quickly make arrangements to implement the money policy. Turning to the reform of the system for the circulation of cotton, Li Lanqing said: Cotton is a special commodity having a bearing on the national economy and people's lives. In the future, neither should we follow the past method of unified state purchasing and marketing, nor should we adopt a laissez-faire attitude toward this matter. We should explore a new path. We can try setting up state-owned spot wholesale markets combining internal and foreign trade and combining purchasing, stockpiling, and marketing. Such markets will become the main channels for cotton purchasing, marketing, and wholesale business, which will play the role of controlling markets, reducing intermediate links, and ensuring supplies. In the area of prices, we should introduce a reasonable price-protection system in accordance with the principle of relative interests so as to encourage cotton growers to grow cotton and thus to ensure a balance between supply and demand. On how to help the textile industry extricate itself from its difficult position, Li Lanqing expressed the following views: The first step is to "give emergency treatment and stabilize the illness," the second step is to "treat the illness," and the third step is to "convalesce and get better and better." He said: The three steps are not completely separated from one another, and they are designed to "deal with both the root cause and the symptoms." Analyzing the existing deep-seated problems of the textile industry, Li Lanqing explained: During the shift from the planned economy to the socialist market economy, the problems of the old system will be clearly demonstrated because we can no longer rely on a state-controlled low-price supply of raw materials from the place of origin, because production tasks are no longer assigned by higher-level departments, and because the marketing of products is no longer guaranteed by the commercial department. The existing difficulties and problems of the textile industry are part of those problems. The textile industry is ill in terms of its "structure," "operational mechanisms," and "technology." For this reason, while we are adopting measures to help the textile industry overcome difficulties, we should also pay great attention to the structural readjustment, enterprise reorganization, and technological transformation of the textile industry. Li Lanqing said: On the one hand, the current problems mean difficulties. On the other hand, they also are an opportunity for us to readjust the structure. First, we must vigorously carry out a spindle-reduction transformation. In particular, we should pay attention to the technological transformation of post printing-and-dyeing processing to ensure a large quantity, good quality, and high efficiency in the production of yarn and cotton fabrics. The post printing-and-dyeing processing should yield more patterns and designs and high added value. During the course of the structural readjustment, some cotton-fabric plants should be gradually relocated to cotton-producing regions through corporations, the shareholding system, or joint operations. In other words, we should carry out a structural readjustment of industrial zones. This is also a measure to narrow the gap between coastal regions and interior regions. After explaining the concrete concept and measures for the readjustment and reform of the textile industry, Li Lanqing discussed enterprise reorganization. He said: We should learn from the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation in comprehensive and coordinated reform; should readjust industrial structures, reorganize enterprises, improve their operational mechanisms, resettle surplus personnel, and arouse enthusiasm among enterprise workers and staff members. If conditions permit, we should form joint-stock technology-industry-trade enterprise groups, with either industry or foreign trade as their main business, so as to take advantage of the strength of joint operations to enhance market competitive power. On the export of textile goods, Li Lanqing said: We should further the reform to improve the quality and increase the economic returns of export goods. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the China Textile Council should jointly formulate procedures for inviting public bids for textile export quotas in accordance with the principle of efficiency, fairness, and openness. The import-export chamber of commerce should play a coordinating and guiding role. He said that enterprises with export quotas and export permits may engage in the production of the "two kinds of yarn and cotton fabrics" [not further specified] by processing materials supplied by overseas clients. Li Lanqing especially emphasized in his speech: We should step up the making of policies for the textile industry. They should include the consumption policy, technology policy, industrial organization policy, import-export policy, marketing policy, foreign capital utilization policy, and geographic distribution policy, as well as measures to guarantee the implementation of these policies. It is reported that the State Council attaches great importance to the operations of the textile industry. Since it was briefed by the China Textile Council in December 1993, the State Council has issued a document based on a thorough investigation and study. At present, all localities are actively carrying out the 21 measures listed in the document. The State Planning Commission, in cooperation with other commissions and ministries, is stepping up the formulation of the industrial policies for the textile industry. This forum, which began a few days ago, was held in Beijing by the China Textile Council. Present at the meeting were representatives of some provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional textile management departments, directors of some enterprises, and responsible persons of some ministries and commissions concerned. They discussed the best policies for the development of the textile industry.
