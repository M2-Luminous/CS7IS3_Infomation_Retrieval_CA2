Russia has completely given up the idea to use the newest block of the radar station, according to the statement. The newest part of the compound will be transferred to the Latvian authority as soon as the withdrawal agreement is signed. The United States has pledged Latvia 10 million USD needed to start the radar's dismantling. Russia, in its turn, promised to supply the equipment necessary to dismantle the newest block of the station. Currently, the Skrunda early-warning antimissile radar occupies 1,008 hectares. After the agreement is signed, Latvia starts to control more than 80 percent of the territory. Russia continues its actitivities on 164 hectares of the total area for four years. The draft agreement also forsees that Russia substitutes part of the radar's military personnel with civilians. The civil staff may be Latvian citizens and permanent residents. Under the agreement, Russia should not change the functions or the equipment of the radar station. The "old" radar, built in late 1960's, is "morally and physically outdated," Soviet specialists said already in 1990. Russia may even decide to suspend the operation of the costly and ineffective installation in view of its complicated domestic situation, the Latvian Government said in the statement. Moreover, Russia may start to use the Baranovici radar, which is still under construction, before the temporary operation term expires.
