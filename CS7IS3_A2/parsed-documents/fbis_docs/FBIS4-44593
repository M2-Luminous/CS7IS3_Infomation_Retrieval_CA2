An official in the China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation said the situation was "better than expected" and that this was mainly due to the oil fields of eastern China achieving stable production and to substantial increases in crude oil output in western China. Evidently, the strategy for achieving stability in the oil fields of eastern China is based on focusing on increasing output as quickly as possible, overcoming difficulties, and maintaining a steady output from the end of 1993. Crude oil output in western China was up by 13.2 percent compared to the same period in 1993. Total natural gas output during the first quarter was more than 3.9 billion cubic meters, equal to 25.4 percent of the annual plan and 104.5 percent of the same period in 1993. During 1994 China expects to produce onshore 140 million tons of crude oil and 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Analysis by officials in the China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation indicates that these goals can be attained if we sustain the production momentum of the first quarter.
