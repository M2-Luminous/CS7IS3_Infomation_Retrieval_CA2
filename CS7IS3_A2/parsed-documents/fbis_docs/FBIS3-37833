UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said the aim of the two to three day session was to achieve an overall settlement. Topping the agenda are the return of 200,000 to 300,000 refugees who fled Abkhazia in last year's fighting, and a discussion of Abkhazia's political status. Under the old Soviet constitution, Abkhazia was an autonomous republic within Georgia. The speaker of its parliament in Sukhumi, Vladislav Ardzinba, told the press here that Abkhazia could choose between independence or coexistence in equality with Georgia. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has insisted a solution must respect Georgia's territorial integrity. The previous round of talks ended in mid-January with agreement in principle on the withdrawal of troops and a demilitarisation zone between the belligerents.
