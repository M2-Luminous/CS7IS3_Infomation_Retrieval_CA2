At the same time, Athens warns that it will impose stricter measures if Skopje does not stop its intransigence. Athens is also preparing to counter the charges from the European partners and Washington at the political and diplomatic level. At the same time, the Greek immigrant community in Canada has expressed its enthusiasm for the actions and has sent congratulatory letters to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. The overwhelming majority of voters in Greece agree with the measures imposed. According to an opinion poll conducted by private research companies in Attiki following the prime minister's announcement, 67 percent of those asked agreed with the measures.
