Security Council consultations held at the initiative of Russia on Sunday evening. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright said that the United States has just received good news from Sarajevo. Everything looks well for the time being. The U.S. will continue to watch very attentively to get convinced in the next few days that the NATO ultimatum is being fulfilled. The United States is also very satisfied, Albright continued, that Russian troops intend to participate in the U.N. Protection Force and believes that a role to be played by Russians will be very useful. Russian permanent representative to the U.N. Yuliy Vorontsov said: "The Russian Federation called for this Security Council meeting because it was worried during the day that snow would prevent UNPROFOR from taking weapons left by Serbs under its control. "It looked at some moment that UNPROFOR cannot find these weapons in snow. That was a technical problem which disturbed us very much. Then, we received a report from Akashi that he intends to take these weapons under UNPROFOR's control, and there is no need for air strikes at this stage. This was good news."
