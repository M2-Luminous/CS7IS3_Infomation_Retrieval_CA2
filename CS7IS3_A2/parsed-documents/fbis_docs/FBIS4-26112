The U.S. Administration will discuss the DPRK's position with U.S. former President Jimmy Carter who just ended his private visit to the DPRK today, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a statement. It was reported that the DPRK told Carter it will agree to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to stay in the DPRK and to replace its present nuclear program with a new light water reactor technology. President Bill Clinton said Thursday [16 Jun] if this development means that the DPRK "is genuinely and verifiably prepared to freeze its nuclear program while talks go on", then the U.S. will be willing to resume high-level talks with the DPRK. Myers said that preliminary reports on Carter's visit "present the possibility that the North Koreans may be prepared to make commitments and take actions" that would pave the way for a new round of talks. The U.S. would also seek confirmation through "diplomatic channels" on the DPRK's position, she added. "If this meaning of the message is clearly confirmed through those channels, and we hope it will be, we would be prepared to enter a third round of talks to resolve the outstanding issues between North Korea and the international community," Myers said. But she also said that "we are continuing to consult on a sanctions resolution at the U.N. Security Council."
