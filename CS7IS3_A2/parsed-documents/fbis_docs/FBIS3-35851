Holovatyy, a coauthor of the Law on Ukraine's International Agreements, by Kateryna Kindras; place and date not given: "Things are Not That Simple"] [Text] People are currently arguing in the lobby of the Ukrainian parliament and not only there on whether the tripartite agreement on the destruction of nuclear weapons may be regarded as an international agreement. Our correspondent met with people's deputy S. Holovatyy, one of the coauthors of the Law on Ukraine's International Agreements. Here is his opinion: [Holovatyy] The presidential team has been trying, through the mass media, to convince everybody that the tripartite statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia is a document that further develops the Supreme Council decree on the ratification of START-1. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko said that the statement does not need to be ratified because it is not an agreement. By doing this consciously or unconsciously, they mislead the people. The thing is that the Law on Ukraine's International Agreements that was adopted last December reads that any document signed by authorized state figures is an international agreement. I reiterate: Any document, irrespective of its type -- accord, agreement, protocol, note, statement, declaration, and so forth. A statement signed by heads of three states is undoubtedly an international agreement. However, its content is not new and applies to those nuclear weapons whose problem has been settled by START I, which has been ratified by the Supreme Council with a supplement of 13 reservations. This statement refers to START I and should, therefore, be regarded as a document relevant to the fulfillment of the Supreme Council decree on the ratification of START I. However, the parliament has every right to raise the question on whether the signing of this statement by the Ukrainian president is in full conformity with the requirements specified by the Supreme Council during the ratification of START I. If it turns out that there is no such conformity, the parliament may conclude that Ukraine is not obliged to fulfill this statement. Our state is only obliged to fulfill START I in that form that was validated by the exchange of ratification documents.
