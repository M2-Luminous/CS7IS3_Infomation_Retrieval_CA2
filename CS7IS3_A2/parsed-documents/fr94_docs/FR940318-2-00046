FR940318-2-00046 FR940318-2-00037 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;279&hyph;000] Minerals, Inc., Petition for Declaratory Order and Alternative Request for Extension and Waiver March 14, 1994. Take notice that on March 8, 1994, Minerals, Inc. (Minerals), 600 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Irving, Texas 75062, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;279&hyph;000 a petition for an order declaring that the facilities acquired by Minerals are gathering facilities pursuant to section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act and therefore exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. It is stated that Minerals has recently purchased the gathering facilities of Llano, an intrastate pipeline with facilities located in the State of New Mexico. Minerals states that since the date of acquisition, it has utilized the acquired gathering facilities in conjunction with its processing, compression, treating and gas marketing services, and is providing stand-alone gas gathering services for a number of producers. Minerals states that the acquired facilities range in size from four inches to a maximum of twelve inches in diameter, and have a combined total length of approximately 544 miles. It is stated that the facilities are connected to both low- and high-pressure wells with flowing pressures ranging from 20 psig to a maximum of 600 psig. It is stated that most of the gas is delivered unprocessed to the inlets of three processing plants connected to the acquired facilities: the Hobbs Plant, the Antelope Ridge Plant and a processing plant owned and operated by American Pipeline Corporation, an unrelated third party. It is further stated that the residue gas is delivered at the outlet of the plants to Llano's intrastate pipeline facilities or to various interstate pipelines. In addition, it is stated that an average of 5,000 MMBtu per day and 3,500 MMBtu per day of unprocessed gas is delivered directly into the interstate pipeline facilities of El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso) and Transwestern Pipeline Company, respectively, at the Rattlesnake Delivery Point located on the southern end of the system, which deliveries will be terminated as soon as a pending interconnection between El Paso and Llano is constructed and placed into operation. Minerals seeks an order declaring and affirming that these facilities are gathering facilities, however, alternatively, requests that it be granted an extension of time to file a petition for rate approval, in the event that the Commission determines the facilities to be transmission facilities. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before April 4, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6338 Filed 3&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
