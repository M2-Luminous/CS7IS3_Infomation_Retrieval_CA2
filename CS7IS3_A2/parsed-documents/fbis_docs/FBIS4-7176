In the light of the resolutions of the Seventh Party Congress, the Mid-Term National Party Conference of the Seventh Central Committee, and the fifth Ho Chi Minh City party organization congress, our conference seriously evaluated the development of the renovation process in the city and straightforwardly pointed out achievements and progress as well as shortcomings and weaknesses. The conference also derived practical leadership and implementation experiences and most importantly, set forth the orientations and revolutionary action program for the city party organization to follow during the remaining part of its term. At this conference, we unanimously elected an additional number of comrades to the city party organization standing committee. The election proceeded according to set regulations and aimed at enhancing the strength of the key agency of the city party organization so that it can meet the urgent requirements of the renovation process in the city. Our conference had the honor to welcome Comrade Nguyen Van Linh, adviser to the Central Committee, and Comrade Phan Van Khai, member of the Political Bureau. The presence of the two comrades and their views at this conference have given our entire city more wisdom and strength to continue a journey which is rife with difficulties and challenges but is also full of great prospects. Over the past several months, in preparation for this conference, the city party organization at all levels, including many veteran comrade revolutionaries affected by old age and poor health, enthusiastically contributed many valuable contributions to the documents to be presented to the conference. Over the past few days, 263 comrades contributed their suggestions at group discussions and 23 other comrades expressed their views in the conference hall. Those views had one thing in common, namely shedding more light on the issues under discussion. Many of these views were very straightforward and accurate. They demonstrated a very high sense of responsibility and a positive attitude. As a result, they clarified many important issues and enhanced the quality of the political report of the conference. It is very clear that this conference marks a major democratic activity in the party and shows the concentrated efforts of the city party organization to study and creatively apply the Mid-Term National Party Conference Resolution to the real situation in the city, which is a center having a serious responsibility toward the area and the country in many respects. The final result of this conference still depends on the stringent test of real life situations when the resolutions of the conference truly penetrate society and make their presence felt. Nonetheless, the traditions of solidarity, singlemindedness, strong will, and great determination make us look toward the future with confidence and hope that with the mind and hands of grassroots party organizations, the personal efforts of our compatriots of all walks of life, the close leadership of the Central Committee, and the harmonious coordination and wholehearted assistance of other localities throughout the country, our city will score even greater achievements. From the rostrum of this conference, on behalf of the Ho Chi Minh City party organization, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Central Committee for its leadership. Our thanks also go to the comrade veteran revolutionaries, party organization delegates, and compatriots of all walks of life in the city for their concern and high sense of responsibility. All those factors have given us more strength to make this conference a success, thereby opening new prospects for the city to move along a path full of both challenges and promises. Dear comrades, we face both opportunities and challenges. Let us be determined to eliminate dangers, overcome challenges, and grasp all opportunities to lead the renovation undertaking forward in a vigorous and steady manner. That is the complete scenario of the entire country and the city for us to see and correctly define our tasks for the days ahead. The undertaking to build "a wealthy people, a strong country, and an equitable and civilized society" is a long-term strategic objective that must be implemented step by step. Each step must be progress compared with the previous one, or in other words, the economy must develop every year, the standards of material and cultural life next year must be higher than those of this year, and especially, the political and social conditions must be more stable and steadfast every year. These factors are closely related, therefore they require a high level of uniformity in coordination. Our economic policies are closely related to social, cultural, and other policies, so our party needs a comprehensive, dialectical, objective, and scientific viewpoint while directing the implementation of these policies. In order to overcome hunger and poverty, to stand firm on our feet, and to reduce the danger of lagging further behind neighboring countries economically, our party should, above all, consolidate our combative determination, our political acumen, and heighten our knowledge and ability to the level required by our duties in the modern age, an age when science and technology advance at lightning speed. To fulfill the leadership role, our party should be equipped not only with experiences and knowledge from working life, but also with experiences and achievements of the world. The slogan "Learn, learn more, learn forever" by Lenin should encourage us to never stop learning. Our party is the core leader, the center for solidarity, and the vanguard of the class and people. To be able to fulfill these responsibilities, our party must be in a constant process of renovation and rectification, ensure uniformity in politics and ideology, endeavor to enhance morality and revolutionary characteristics, provide for a clean and healthy life, and to combat degradation, deviations, negativity, and illegal activities resolutely. Above all, we must not lose our sense of political vigilance because the hostile forces are hiding around us and are looking for every way to get into our organizations. We must not forget that among all kinds of disorientation, the political one is the most dangerous. We are opening our doors and expanding our relations and cooperation with other countries to develop our economy. But we must abide by the unchangeable principles of national sovereignty and independence, of our historic traditions, the morality and characteristics of our culture. To let ourselves become alienated from our origin, or dependent on other countries in any area or by any reason, is unacceptable. We should not let short-term and partial benefits lead us to sway ourselves away from the route that Uncle [Ho] has chosen, the route achieved only by countless sacrifices of blood and bone by generations of our people, because that will be a virulent error that can be disastrous to our country. The administration is the people's servant, and at the same time, the tool for the people's authority. The development of our country in the current situation is fast-changing, diversified, and complicated. The situation requires the state mechanism to be capable and assiduous. We must not allow any sabotage activities to effect the peaceful life of our people. We must be able to control every nook and cranny of our society. We must heighten our abilities and acumen, attach urgency to training and re-training tasks, and we should exclude from the administrative mechanism those who have inadequate ability and character. As far as the current national construction cause is concerned, as in the sacred wars of resistance for national salvation in the past, the people constitute an endless source of strength and a decisive factor of victory. To further develop the potential, strength, and wisdom of the masses, party organizations, administrative organs, departments, sectors, agencies, and mass societies affiliated to the Vietnam Fatherland Front must renovate their operating procedures a step further, attach primary importance to efforts to improve the people's living conditions, and regard the motivation campaign for political awareness as a long-term goal. Our party comes from the people and works untiringly to bring about happiness for them. Therefore, party members and cadres must love, believe, remain attached to, and direct the people as well as look after their well-being, regarding these as the proof of their vitality. Dear comrades, the resolution of this midterm party conference of the city party organization was formulated in the light of the recent Mid-Term National Party Conference and the fifth city party organization congress. It was a combination of the wisdom, will, and aspirations of the entire party organization and compatriots of all walks of life in the city. Furthermore, it was adopted at a time when the city has entered a period full of great challenges and also of bright prospects. Because this resolution serves as an important action program for the entire city party organization and compatriots of all walks of life in the days ahead, practical measures must be worked out to promptly disseminate and concretize it so that it can be applied to life and make its presence felt. Following this conference, efforts must be made to improve our party leadership and organizational skills a step further. It is necessary for all party members to strongly develop their vanguard role, militancy, determination, will, professionalism, and wisdom. Only by so doing can we meet the growing demands of the revolutionary undertaking in the city. During his lifetime, Uncle Ho once said: "There must be 10 measures to carry out a single policy." Speaking at the fifth city party organization congress, Comrade Nguyen Van Linh said: "It is necessary to attach great importance to implementation organization." For us, these instructions remain valuable. The reason is that no matter how correct and clearsighted the party's ideological concepts, lines, and resolutions may be, they are totally meaningless and unable to generate strength if they are not applied to real life situations. Then, in the final analysis, our words are not matched with our deeds and as such, we cannot prove whether our policies and resolutions are correct. Therefore, it is very important for us to pay due attention to practical activities and regard our willingness to engage in practical activities as the peak of our creativeness. Many theoreticians have said that the truth can be discovered through realities and that only through realities that one can prove and foster the truth. The party-initiated renovation undertaking has been carried out for many years now. Yet, when it first took off, it was based on the actual situations in our city and country. We are party members and residents of the city named after Uncle Ho. Our city is well-known for its time-honored traditions of glorious and unsubmissive struggle and for its wisdom, dynamism, and work creativeness. It is certain that our entire party organization and compatriots of all walks of life in the city will achieve singlemindedness, take firm steps to overcome difficulties and challenges, and make every effort to score the best results in carrying out the tasks set forth by the Seventh Party Congress and the fifth city party organization congress, thereby making adequate preparations for marking the 20th anniversary of national unification and of the liberation of the city and the south. Prompted by that firm belief, I would like to declare the midterm party conference of the fifth Ho Chi Minh City party organization closed. May I avail myself of this opportunity to wish our comrade veteran revolutionaries and comrade delegates good health and many victories.
