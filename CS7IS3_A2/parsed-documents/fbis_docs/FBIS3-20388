We welcome the U.S. efforts to find a solution or a way out of the deadlock. Our talks could be described as positive. This is our first meeting and I am sure there will be more. Nimetz will continue his talks with the prime minister. I believe this is what I could tell you now as the initial result of a first meeting that is over traditional frameworks and frameworks of simple meetings. Thank you. [Nimetz] I am greatly honored that President Clinton has asked me to take on this significant mission. This dispute threatens the security and stability in a region that is very important to the United States. We had discussions this morning in Skopje and we had discussions here. And we will continue the discussions. Our goal is to assist in achieving a solution under the auspices of UN mediator Cyrus Vance. I do not think I will say anything more. We will persevere in this effort and I hope the outcome will be positive.
