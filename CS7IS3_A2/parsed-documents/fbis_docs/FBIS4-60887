Ponomarev told a RIA correspondent by telephone that the two other co-chairmen of the movement -- Ilya Zaslavskiy and Grigoriy Tomchin -- joined Yegor Gaydar's newly created party Russia's Choice, while the position of the fifth co-chairwoman -- Galina Starovoitova -- remains unknown because she is abroad. The split, says a statement issued by Ponomarev and Yakunin today, was caused by the fact that Democratic Russia does not want to become an organisation arranging mass actions for the Russia's Choice party, as the Soviet trade unions did for the CPSU. In Ponomarev's view, "in three to four months it will be possible to think of registering the party, but before that a lot of work has to be done in the regions". "The Democratic Russia party will be a rival to Gaydar's Russia's Choice, but we do not expect ideological differences between the two related parties," noted Ponomarev.
