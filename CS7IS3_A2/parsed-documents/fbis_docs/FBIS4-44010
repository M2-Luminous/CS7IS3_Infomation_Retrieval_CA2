But there is no doubt that both within NATO and in Moscow it has finally been recognized that there can be no lasting guarantees for European security unless all the parties responsible cooperate closely in implementing it. Against this background, it does not matter what kinds of words and sentences have been used to set this partnership down on paper. What counts is a common desire, and this desire cannot be blotted out by political vanity on both sides. To this extent, the Partnership for Peace and the additional dialogue agreed upon with Moscow, which also calls for a mutual exchange of information on planned security-political decisions, must naturally be orchestrated as a whole. Now it is necessary to explain this to certain East European countries which, for obvious reasons, have been skeptical and to some extent are still skeptical about having Moscow as a partner. Under no circumstances must these countries receive the impression that their membership in NATO is less important than Russia's. It is necessary in this regard to resolve all the present misunderstandings, for which NATO itself is not quite free of blame. At a early stage in the development of the Partnership for Peace concept, NATO should have explained more clearly to the East European countries that neither the North Atlantic Cooperation Council nor the Partnership for Peace can be viewed as a signpost pointing to the east. The point is not to create various different security zones in Europe, but a single one. The fact that the specific interests of a major power must be considered in these agreements is a question of political reality. As a superpower, the United States has always played a special part in NATO, and NATO was able to live with that for better or for worse. Therefore, a similar part has to be offered to Russia, which is still by far the largest country in Europe. The fact that all Europeans can live with that was confirmed by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev at the signing of the agreement in Brussels. The Russian foreign and security policies will now have to measure themselves against this gauge. It may sound naive to say this, but it is the great powers that have the final say on decisive matters. One can only undertake activity with them, not against them. The fact that the U.S. chief of diplomacy was the only NATO foreign minister to watch Kozyrev sign the agreement is a fact that speaks for itself. This special role of the great powers also in the Partnership for Peace program will receive a positive confirmation if one looks beyond the narrow confines of Europe and is willing to assume extra responsibility. A political and military consensus regarding peaceforming or peacekeeping missions, or on the subject of such hot topics as North Korea, would be very helpful for the whole of society. The Partnership for Peace offers an opportunity for this.
