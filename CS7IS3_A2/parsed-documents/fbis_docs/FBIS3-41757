Nadezhdin: ``Criminal Business''] [Text] It is a well-known fact that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Alas, this simple truth is often forgotten -- especially when misfortune enters our life and we are sparing no resources trying to help ourselves or our loved ones.

Street dealers very boldly selling both albumin and plasma have appeared in Moscow in great numbers. Beware of buying similar preparations from so-called ``unestablished individuals.'' Laboratory studies of the blood substitutes demonstrate that they have been isolated from the blood of animals, and transfusion of these substitutes into a human may cause death. If necessary, use the following opportunity. Come to the Blood Transfusion Center and donate your own blood. In exchange, you will receive the very same quantity of the necessary blood group.
