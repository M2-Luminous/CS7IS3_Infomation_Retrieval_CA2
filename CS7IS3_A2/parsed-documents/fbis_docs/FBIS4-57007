Thus, Fujimori answered several "recommendations" to study the country's legal situation by a New York Bar Association mission at the end of an eight-day visit to Peru. The visiting lawyers recommended that Peru's counterterrorist laws be amended and made more flexible. "We will make them more flexible as we acquire more experience," Fujimori said. He added that any changes should not "jeopardize" the peace process. Commenting on the U.S. lawyers' "recommendations," Fujimori asked "why should we accept their cooperation now, when they left us alone for 12 years during which time 25,000 people died." The president added: "The responsibility is ours alone; should there be any mistakes, we will correct them." Fujimori emphasized that delegations of lawyers "can keep coming" to Peru, but it is up to the Peruvian Government to decide what suits the country best. The New York lawyers' "recommendations" include not trying cases of aggravated terrorism or high treason in military courts, not keeping terrorist prisoners incommunicado, and giving lawyers free access and the right to meet in private with alleged terrorists while in prison. The New York lawyers also recommended that all innocent people arrested on terrorism-related charges in Peru should be pardoned, and that the anonymity which protects judges and witnesses in high-treason trials should be lifted.
