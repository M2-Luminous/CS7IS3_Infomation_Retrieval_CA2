"Within four to six years, the number of officers will be considerably decreased (currently we have 43,500 officers, which is 49 percent of the cadres). We will again have the summit of the hierarchical pyramid, which will be different, more noble," declares the general. According to the plans of the General Staff, at the end of this century half of the Polish Army should consist of professional soldiers. The most numerous group--over 40 percent--among the "professionals" will be noncommissioned officers, who, as it is in the U.S. Army, for instance, will carry the main burden for the direct training of soldiers. The officers (30 percent) will deal primarily with the martial arts: They will carry the burden of commanding; they will be on the staffs; they will leave the offices of military administration, doctor's offices, and entire large sections that are full of colonels today. Backup services in the Army will be headed at some time by civilian managerial cadres. "I do not envision a sudden reduction of officers," stresses General Harmoza. "Every year the computer will tell me who has already done his stint in the Army and should leave. A few years ago, an officer who desperately wanted to leave the Army had to do almost impossible, often half-legal things in order to be able to go. Today it is enough if he simply puts in a written request." In recent years, one has seen a growing longing for the prewar ethos based on the aura of "defender of the homeland," the feeling of one's own value, being different from other professional groups, sometimes contemptuously referred to as "civil bands," as well as observing the "gentleman's" code. The supporters of a fast restitution of this special tradition of the Second Republic cannot easily cope with the difficult reality. Very persistent is the 40-year-old hunchback, caused by the conscious creation of a plebeian army and the constant advertisement of the model of "an officer--a man from among the people." The deeply rooted opinions about the Army, which is servile toward the political elites, which is associated not only with the security of the state but also with that of the governing party, have resulted in an alienation of the officers. The depreciation of the once-knightly profession increased even further as a result of the imposition of martial law. Incidentally, quite interesting is the disproportion between social trust for the Army as an establishment (76 percent, according to the Center for Research on Public Opinion) and a mere 35-percent approval for the profession of the officer (data are from the end of last year). The general says: "Now we intend to restore the balance, which was twisted in the past, in the sphere of customs. In the past, the removal of the borders between hierarchies served the purpose of compensating for meager salaries. The `new policy' in the Army will therefore mean, among other things, that, because of the respect for rank, noncommissioned officers will not be admitted to commissioned officers' messes and vice versa. The custom of meetings in small groups is reviving most visibly in small garrisons. "The situation would be better if not for the prices, which are still rather high for officers. However, it is good that the price of music has not gone up that high," Gen. Harmoza left this comforting news for the end.
