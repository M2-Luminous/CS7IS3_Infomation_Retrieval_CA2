FR941006-2-00104 FR941006-2-00081 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34763; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;35] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Amendments to Rule 179 Regarding Automatic Cancellation of Open Orders in Expiring Equity Securities September 30, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on September 6, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Amex is proposing to amend Rule 179 to expand the categories of expiring equity securities as to which open orders are automatically cancelled prior to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose Amex Rule 179 provides time frames during which orders in expiring rights and warrants must be for ``next day'' delivery or for ``cash'' settlement, rather than for ``regular way'' five-day delivery. The rule was amended last year to provide for the automatic cancellation of open ``regular way'' and ``next day'' orders in expiring rights and warrants prior to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading in those securities. 1 The normal ticker notice provided by the Exchange with respect to expiring rights and warrants provides ample notice to members and member organizations regarding such cancellations, thereby given them the opportunity to replace their cancelled orders if they wish to do so. Substituted ``next day'' and ``cash'' orders are treated as new orders and are not entitled to retain the priority on the specialist's book of the cancelled ``regular way'' order. This amendment has resulted in a significant reduction in ``DKs''ยง 2 and has facilitated accurate clearance and settlement in these securities. 1 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32320 (May 17, 1993), 58 FR 30078 (May 25, 1993) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;92&hyph;31). 2 A ``DK'' is an uncompared securities transaction. For further discussion of Amex procedures regarding resolution of DKs, see Amex Rule 731. The Exchange is now proposing that Rule 179 be further amended to expand the categories of expiring securities as to which open orders are automatically cancelled prior to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading to include any expiring equity security. 3 The amendment would be applicable, for example, to preferred stock, 4 Contingent Value Rights, Stock Index Return Securities, Equity Linked Securities (``ELKS''), Yield Enhanced Equity Linked Debt Securities (``YEELDS'') and other similar securities. These securities would generally change to ``next day'' delivery and ``cash'' in accordance with the time frames applicable to rights. Thus, during the five business days preceding the final day for trading in such security, every order therein entered on a specialist's book must be for ``next day'' delivery, and, on final day for trading in such security, every order therein entered on the specialist's book must be for ``cash.'' However, when appropriate, the Exchange may establish different time frames for particular types of expiring equity securities. 3 The Amex has clarified that the proposed rule change would apply to expiring securities that are not options and that are subject to the trading rules for equity securities, as opposed to debt securities. Telephone conversation between Stuart Diamond, Director, Rulings Department, Amex, and Linda Tarr, Special Counsel, Amex, and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on September 27, 1994. 4 The Amex proposal would provide for automatic cancellation of open orders in redeemable preferred stock. Telephone conversation between Stuart Diamond, Director, Rulings Department, Amex, and Linda Tarr, Special Counsel, Amex, and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on September 27, 1994. The extension of the automatic cancellation provisions of the rule to these securities can be expected to provide comparable benefits, i.e., a reduction in ``DKs'' and clearance and settlement errors.
