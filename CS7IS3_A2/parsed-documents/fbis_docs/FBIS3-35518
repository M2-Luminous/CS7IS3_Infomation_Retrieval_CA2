['Arafat] Good morning, brother. [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what is your comment on the massacre? ['Arafat] I regret that this massacre has taken place. First of all, I do not absolve the Israeli Army of this responsibility, because everyone knows that the Israeli Army protects the entrances of the Ibrahimi Mosque and the area surrounding it. How, then, has it allowed armed settlers to enter the mosque while worshipers were performing dawn prayers? Therefore, there is some form of collusion. This has serious implications and meanings. Everyone must know that our people's blood is not spilt without a price, and that our people's blood is precious. To open fire on worshipers while they are performing dawn prayers at the Ibrahimi Mosque is an incident over which I cannot but call on the world at large, the cosponsors of the conference, the UN Security Council permament members and the other UN Security Council members, the EC, the Nonaligned countries, and the Arab and Islamic countries to shoulder their responsibility. I specifically call on the cosponsors of the conference which signed the peace agreement with us. What peace are they speaking about while crimes against our people continue and while fire is opened on our worshipers, children, and women? What peace are they speaking about? [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what steps does the PLO intend to take in the occupied territories in wake of the massacre. What do you have to say to the Palestinians in the occupied territories? ['Arafat] All morning, I have been contacting officials in many friendly countries to apprise them of the situation. Even in America, I contacted them, through some brothers, to inform them so they may assume their responsibilities, including the cosponsors of the conference. At the same time, we asked our representative at the United Nations to call for an urgent UN Security Council session so it can take appropriate measures to protect our people, children, women, worshipers, mosques, and holy places which are being violated day and night. [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what impact will this have on the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations? ['Arafat] It will have very serious dimensions not only on the negotiations, but on all levels and in all directions. [Reporter] One last question, President 'Arafat. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced at the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that the United States has to continue its confrontation of the enemies of the peace process. Christopher said that you, that President Yasir 'Arafat is not an enemy of peace, and that he is cooperating with Israel to end violence, as he said. What do you have to say to the U.S. secretary of state's statement? ['Arafat] Well, I would like now to see what stand he will adopt on these armed settlers. From where have they received weapons, and how are they permitted to carry arms while our people are not permitted to do the same? How can he allow the collusion that took place between the settlers and the Israeli Army? I would like to ask him too about the U.S. stand, given that the United States is one of the sponsors of the conference, and a signatory of the peace agreement, an agreement we signed at the White House under the auspices of President Clinton? [Reporter] President 'Arafat, a thousand thanks. ['Arafat] What about the stand of the entire world, not only the cosponsors of the conference? What is the stand of the European countries, the Nonaligned countries, the Islamic countries, and the Arab countries? This is a crime which cannot be treated lightly. [Reporter] President 'Arafat, thank you. We will contact you later during our next newscasts. Many thanks. ['Arafat] Thank you.
