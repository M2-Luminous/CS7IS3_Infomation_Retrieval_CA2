FR940902-2-00090 FR940902-2-00042 [Finance Docket No. 32534] RailAmerica, Inc._Continuance in Control Exemption_Delaware Valley Railway Company, Inc. RailAmerica, Inc. (RAI), a noncarrier holding company, has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Delaware Valley Railway Company, Inc. (Delaware), a noncarrier, upon the latter becoming a class III rail carrier. In related proceedings, Delaware has concurrently filed: (1) A modified rail certificate to operate two rail lines 1 totalling approximately 53.82 miles, see Delaware Valley Railway Company, Inc._Modified Rail Certificate, Finance Docket No. 32535; and (2) a designated operator certificate to operate a 9.8-mile rail line extending between milepost 2.9 at Elsmere Jct., DE, and milepost 12.7 at the Delaware/Pennsylvania line, 2 see Certificate of Designated Operator, Delaware Valley Railway Company, D-OP 59 (USRA Line No. 907/939). The notice became effective on June 24, 1994. 3 1 The line segment extending between milepost 12.7 at the Delaware/Pennsylvania line and milepost 30.02 at Modena, PA, is owned by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation; the other line segment extending between milepost 18.0 at Wawa, PA, and milepost 54.50 at Sylmar, MD, is owned by the South Eastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. 2 The line is owned by the Reading Company, successor to the bankrupt Reading Railroad. 3 Under 49 CFR 1180.2(d), notices of exemption become effective 7 days after being filed. Service of this decision has been delayed because additional information was needed to process the related proceedings. RAI owns and controls the following class III rail carriers: Huron and Eastern Railway Company, Inc. (operating in Michigan); Saginaw Valley Railway Company (operating in Michigan); and South Central Tennessee Railroad Corporation (operating in Tennessee). RAI states that: (1) The lines to be operated by Delaware do not connect with any of the other lines controlled by it; (2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect Delaware with any railroad in the corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist. , 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Robert A. Wimbish, Rea, Cross & Auchincloss, Suite 420, 1920 N Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20036. Decided: August 26, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21763 Filed 9&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
