One would like to hope it would also promote technical and economic cooperation", Vladimir Shcherbakov, president of the International Foundation for Assisting Privatisation and Foreign Investment, told ITAR-TASS. "It is wrong when potential of the two countries is used to one tenth of a per cent". Shcherbakov expressed perplexity that COCOM restrictions on the granting of new technologies to Russia have not yet been lifted. "It is not easy for Russia to receive technologically perfect products from the United States. Russia needs such products for economic development, for market development. U.S. companies do not use sufficiently vast opportunities for investment in Russia that brings mutual advantage". Shcherbakov said that his foundation and the Lemont Brothers firm secured a tender for a feasibility study for the development of the Moscow aviation junction. Considerable advantage is promised by a private telecommunications network in Russia that is being created by joint effort of the foundation and the U.S. Andrew company. Shcherbakov said there are plans for joint utilisation of missile silos jointly with several U.S. companies. Large amount of equipment, valuable metals and materials remain during the elimination of strategic missiles in silos. All this will be extracted and used. U.S. firms are offered to participate in the implementation of the Russian programme for the utilisation of radioactive waste from submarines that completed their service. "This problem is encountered by Russia and the United States and form the point of view of ecology by the whole world", he said. "Russian scientists are far advanced in the working out of the technology for the utilisation of radioactive waste. It is now for the Russian and U.S. Governments to finance the works", he said.
