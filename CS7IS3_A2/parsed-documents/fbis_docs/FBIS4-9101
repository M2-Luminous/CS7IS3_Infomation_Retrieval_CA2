The basis of this program is a stable dinar, stable prices, and the reanimation of production. We expected the passing of the budget as it was carried out today and I can say that, naturally, I am satisfied with this result in the Serbian Assembly today. I would only like to emphasize that individual opposition leaders objecting to the adoption of this budget actually means a demagogic and defeatist approach and proves once again that they were not right when they declined to take part in the government and were left on the margin of all events in the struggle for better life of this nation.
