Today it was learned that during statements made to French television, the director of a private organization headquartered in Paris and which specializes in investigating drug trafficking, linked Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle to one of the drug cartels. The allegations prompted a strong reaction from Vice President-elect De la Calle. Ever since the so-called narcotapes appeared, Colombia's image overseas continues to be tarnished. This time the reports came from France. (Alain Labreuse), director of the nongovernment organization Geopolitical Narcotics Observer alleged that Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle has links to the Cali Cartel. De la Calle, who just yesterday received a message from French President Francois Mitterrand reiterating his support for the new Colombian Government, vehemently denied the allegations: [Begin De la Calle recording] I have no information about this gentleman. This is simply international gossip -- which is all we need. Now we are seeing all sorts of international garbage being thrown at Colombia. I strongly protest this sort of information. All of you know me very well. It is nothing more than a delusion to try to link Humberto De la Calle with the Cali Cartel. [end recording] De la Calle labeled the campaign against the country as despicable, and he reiterated President-elect Ernesto Samper's determination to fight the drug cartels.
