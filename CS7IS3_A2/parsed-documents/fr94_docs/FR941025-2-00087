FR941025-2-00087 FR941025-2-00056 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB&hyph;52 (Sub-No. 79X)] The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co._ Abandonment Exemption_in Atchison County, KS The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon a 4.6-mile segment of its Atchison Subdivision between milepost 2.00 at or near Parnell and milepost 6.60 at or near Atchison, in Atchison County, KS. Santa Fe has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies), 49 CFR 1105.8 (service of historic report on State Historic Preservation Officer), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (service of verified notice on governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on November 24, 1994, 1 unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 2 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 3 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed by November 4, 1994. 4 Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by November 14, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 While applicant filed its verified notice on September 30, 1994 and therefore seeks to consummate this abandonment on November 19, 1994, newspaper publication did not occur until October 5, 1994. Accordingly, consummation cannot occur until November 24, 1994, at the earliest. 2 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C. 2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 3 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C. 2d 164 (1987). 4 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Dennis W. Wilson, The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, 1700 East Golf Road, Schaumburg, IL 60173.
