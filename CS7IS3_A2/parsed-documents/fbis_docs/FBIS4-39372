During the meeting, the ambassador presented to Geydar Aliyev a number of photographs that reminded the president of his contacts in London. In reminding him that the birthday of Queen Elizabeth II has coincided with such a pleasant occasion, the Azerbaijani president conveyed his sincere wishes to the UK people. [Aliyev] Today is the birthday of your queen. I have sent a letter of congratulations to the queen of Great Britain. Our meeting fell on this day. You had requested a meeting some days ago. Unfortunately, I had no opportunity, and maybe it was good that the meeting took place on the queen's birthday. I congratulate you; please convey my congratulations to the esteemed queen, and wish happiness and peace to your country and people. [Young, in English with interpreter providing Azeri translation] I have received your letter of congratulations. We have sent it to the queen. I know that she will be most grateful for your good wishes. It is an indication of, I think, of the closeness between Azerbaijan and the UK that your own national day, the 28th of May, is separated by a small period of 10 days from our own national day. I think we should work in future to bring the dates even closer together. If I may say, Mr. President, I was most grateful for the welcome and hospitality you gave to [UK Minister of Energy] Mr. Tim Eggar when he was here two weeks ago. He was very grateful to be accommodated in your best house and to be entertained by you personally for dinner. He benefited particularly from his discussions with you on Nagorno- Karabakh and on the oil question. The oil and gas exhibition showed that there are many areas where the UK and Azerbaijan can cooperate. [passage omitted] You asked Mr. Eggar about discussions between Mr. [Douglas] Hurd and Mr. Kozyrev in Russia. They met in both Murmansk and in Moscow two weeks ago. Mr. Hurd urged Mr. Kozyrev to integrate the Russian peace plan into that of the CSCE. He said that the UK Government did not want a separate Russian force outside CSCE control. He asked Mr. Kozyrev to make the Russians work with [Minsk Group chairman] Eliasson, with Mr. Eliasson, and to stop the confusion. The UK Government will continue to press for CSCE leadership of the peace effort. I am sure that other CSCE members, as well as ourselves, are keeping up pressure for CSCE political leadership of this effort. On the practical side, Britain is committed to provide a signals unit for the CSCE force. And we shall provide other army and diplomatic representatives in support of Mr. Eliasson. To enable us and the UK Government to work with the latest information, I wonder if you can tell me what has been happening in Baku in the last few days on this question. [Aliyev] I again thank you for the photographs you gave me. They reminded me of my contacts in London and particularly my sincere and businesslike talks with your country's prime minister, Mr. John Major. I once more indicate that I was pleased with those talks. One of the photographs depicts the exchange of numerous agreements between Mr. Major and myself. The Azerbaijani society and people warmly welcomed the signing of these agreements. However, the task of our two countries now is to implement these agreements. Our meetings with Mr. Eggar here were also very fruitful and beneficial. This [oil] exhibition organized with your country's private oil company BP was a major event in Azerbaijan's life. I think that this exhibition will help develop ties between Azerbaijan and the Western oil companies and with firms active in other industrial sectors, specifically with UK firms. Therefore, I reiterate my favorable opinion of this exhibition and I ask that you inform Mr. Eggar that I was very pleased with our meeting. The information you gave me about the meeting between Mr. Hurd and Kozyrev in Murmansk is of great interest to me. The principled stance of the UK on this important problem will greatly help in its solution. The continued support to be given on this issue by the UK to the Minsk Group, and to Jan Eliasson personally, I hope will, as you already indicated, help stop the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia and peacefully settle the Karabakh problem. Therefore, send my regards to Mr. Douglas Hurd. I now recall my very substantive and fruitful meetings with him in London. I would like you inform him that I would hope that he continues with his efforts to further develop the ties between Azerbaijan and the UK on the basis of our London talks and particularly to extricate Azerbaijan from its present war condition. I believe that after my visit to your country, to London, ties between Azerbaijan and the UK are developing quite fast. I invited Mr. Major and Mr. Douglas Hurd to Azerbaijan. I hope with your effort these invitations will materialize. Cooperation on oil between Azerbaijan and the UK has a great future. As you already noted, there is also favorable opportunities for cooperation in other fields, with other firms such as (?Kaizerin) Engineering Company, (?GBP) in the communications sector, and in aluminum production. I want to inform you again that I will personally take the necessary measures to develop these economic ties. I also want to say a few words on the continuing talks on cooperation in the oil sector between the Western firms and Azerbaijan. A regular meeting between the representatives of the Azerbaijani state oil company and representatives of the Western oil companies opened in Istanbul today. I received the representatives of our oil firm two days before their departure to Istanbul. We held a detailed discussion. They informed me in detail on issues they were going to raise during the upcoming talks and received the necessary instructions from me. I hope that the talks that opened in Istanbul today will yield very positive results. In this connection, I want to draw your attention to a problem. Of late, the Western companies felt a certain uneasiness in connection with an insignificant incident. You are aware that the Russian Foreign Ministry submitted a brief note to the UK Embassy in Moscow in connection with our cooperation in the oil sector. Purportedly, this note calls for caution on this subject because the status of the Caspian Sea has not yet been established. However, what I told the reception of the heads of the Western firms during the exhibition is that no attention should be given to such insignificant information. The Azerbaijani oil men have been extracting oil from the Caspian basin since 1949. The discovery and exploitation of the oil fields in the Caspian sea has a great history, and all this is linked to the Azerbaijani oil men and scientists. Therefore, no one, no force, no country can deprive us, the Azerbaijani Republic and people, from this right. Secondly, so far no question of the status of the Caspian sea has been raised. There was no such issue on the agenda. If any state has a say on the oil extraction by anyone, in this case oil extraction by Azerbaijan, in a certain sector of the Caspian, then that state should make its views known to Azerbaijan. If the Russian state and government has a say or objection on this issue, then it should contact Azerbaijan, they have nothing to do with the UK. This shows that if there was a really serious matter, a letter or note would have been sent to Azerbaijan. No such note or letter has come to Azerbaijan. In addition, I can say that Russia's Lukoil firm is participating in our consortium. We consented to its participation. That is, we included it in the consortium because it concluded an agreement with us. The essence of this is that the oil fields in these sectors belong to Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan has sovereignty over them. Despite all this, seeing that certain firms are somewhat uneasy, I held a telephone conversation with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on 31 May. I informed him that the Russian Foreign Ministry--actually I have seen that note and it had no signature-- has taken such an action. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin informed me that he had no knowledge about this affair and that the Russian Government had no such problem, that the status of the Caspian is on the agenda of neither Russia nor other countries. He informed me that Azerbaijan's oil fields in the Caspian basin are known to Russia, and we know that Azerbaijan is exploiting its own oil fields and is holding talks with the Western firms for their future exploitation. Therefore, he told me that Russia had no problem on this issue. He told me that I could officially announce this in the name of the [Russian] prime minister. I instructed Natik Aliyev, president of the Azerbaijani state oil company, to formally announce this statement of the Russian prime minister during the Istanbul meeting today, and to declare that this is the view of the head of the Russian Government. However, it is not known who wrote that note, maybe it was anonymous. In giving this information to you, I hope that you will inform London, your government, and your Foreign Ministry about this. I want to repeat that there is no reason for concern on this issue. We are going ahead with our own work and we are continuing the talks with the Western oil companies. I repeat that I have instructed our delegation to see that the talks lead to the signing of the contract.
