A statement faxed to AFP here from President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal in the Somaliland capital, Hargeisa, said Somaliland would recognize the constitutionality and legitimacy of the new sovereign republic in South Yemen and would place at its disposal all its support. Somaliland declared independence after the overthrow of Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre, but has not been recognised internationally. "Being well-placed by our own bitter experience to understand and appreciate fully the dilemma which has faced the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, we, the people and government of the Republic of Somaliland, hasten to recognize the constitutionality and the legitimacy of the sovereign republic", the statement said. "Being un-recognized ourselves, we know that in international terms our recognition carries no de-jure benefit for the Democratic Republic of Yemen, but we place at the disposal of its government all our support", the statement pointed out. South Yemen declared its independence from the north on Friday and on Sunday appointed former Yemeni Vice-President 'Ali Salim al- Bid as its new president, with the port city of Aden as its capital. But Yemen's President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northern, has condemned Baid, his sacked deputy, as "a traitor" and a statement from Sanaa hinted on Saturday that the north would cut off ties with any country recognizing the new republic. The appointment of al-Bid came on the day Yemenis might have been celebrating the fourth anniversary of union between the conservative, Muslim north and the south.
