Speaking in Pretoria, Gen. Viljoen called on political leaders not to waste manpower on an experiment which the current commander acknowledged would not work. He said it bordered on the irresponsible to rush the force through training before turning it loose in a politically unstable country. The DP [Democratic Party] candidate for the premiership in the Western Cape, Mr. Henie Bester, has said the National Peacekeeping Force is fast turning into a security farce. Speaking at an interparty breakfast meeting in Cape Town, he said alternative arrangements would have to be made urgently to ensure a free and fair election in April and economic growth afterwards.
