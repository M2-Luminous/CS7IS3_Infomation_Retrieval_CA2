The central government in Tokyo, however, is opposing the prefecture's plan. "This decision...is regrettable," said Kenichi Maruyama, an official of the Nuclear Safety Bureau of the Science and Technology Agency. He said management of information relating to transport of nuclear fuel falls within an international framework and the Miyagi Government's unilateral decision "deviates from this." The central government in April 1993 advised power plant localities to avoid divulging such information as a precaution against sensitive materials falling into the wrong hands. The Miyagi Government has decided to reveal information regarding the shipping of spent nuclear fuel from the Onagawa plant run by Tohoku Electric Power Co., the first such public disclosure in Japan. While the information will not include the time of transport, name of ship or route taken, it will detail such things as fuel quantity, container type, country of destination and whereabouts of a reprocessing plant. The decision was made in response to the urging of a local antinuclear group. Maruyama said the agency intends to summon Miyagi Government officials to discuss the situation. He said the prefecture will be advised to tighten its control of information, taking into consideration the negative overseas reaction that public disclosure of such information would likely generate, as well as how it would adversely affect other prefectures.
