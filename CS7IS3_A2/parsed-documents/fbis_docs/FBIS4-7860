As part of a reform he outlined to Sejm deputies yesterday, [Foreign Minister] Andrzej Olechowski intends to separate the ministry's political leadership from the corps. The role of deputy ministers, who, along with the MSZ chief, will constitute its political top, is supposed to be about participation in the shaping of the minister's policies, about representing MON [Ministry of National Defense] abroad, and also vis-a-vis domestic political forces. Any measures by the deputy ministers undertaken inside the MSZ must be coordinated with the minister and a secretary general. Strong Secretary The secretary general would be in charge of the civil service (in the MSZ, it is to be called the "foreign service corps.") The secretary would be someone apolitical, whose nomination would be agreed upon by the prime minister and the president, so as to prevent frequent changes at the post. The secretary general would be the boss of director generals, who would be in charge of individual departments. Both levels--that is, of the secretary general and of director generals--are part of a group of supreme government officials appointed personally by the prime minister. The outlined arrangement is supposed to alleviate some burden from the minister in terms of the day-to-day administration of the ministry, and it is also supposed to create opportunities for the minister to participate to a greater extent in proceedings by the entire government and to conduct his own policies. Corps of Officials A new statute on the MSZ is supposed to define clear principles on how to join the foreign service corps, on promotions, and on the exchange of people between the center and its foreign posts. The minister is supposed to introduce a new set of internal rules that will define with precision the links between six official grades. Vacancies in posts abroad would be announced six months in advance, and everyone could apply to be appointed after his direct supervisor agreed. Nominations to work abroad would be subject to opinions by a personnel committee (consisting of department directors). Details of the reforms within the MSZ are not being revealed for now because they could change after a debate within the government. Dispute Over Subcommission As we found out unofficially from a participant in a session by the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission yesterday, Sejm deputies who are members of the commission enthusiastically received the draft of reforms within the MSZ. So they were even more surprised when Andrzej Micewski demanded an extension of the mandate of a subcommission for personnel issues within the MSZ. Olechowski has disliked the subcommission's doings from the beginning. Professor Bronislaw Geremek (chief of the Foreign Affairs Commission) refused to submit Micewski's motion to a vote because the motion was not on the commission's agenda. A heated dispute erupted over that issue between Geremek and the subcommission's members, which later was also joined by Minister Olechowski, who spoke very strongly against any further activity by the subcommission. Let us recall that the subcomission was established in January at the initiative of Tadeusz Samborski of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. It included as its members some Sejm deputies for the ruling coalition and also one Sejm deputy for the Union of Labor [UP]. The Democratic Union [UD] and the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] refused to participate in the commission, while the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms has withdrawn from it. Olechowski denied the statement by Sejm deputies that the subcommission's cooperation with him is good: "I do not have a feeling of conducting a dialogue with the Sejm deputies. I expected the subcommission to tell me what specific human harm has been done." The subcommission's members were trying to argue that they no longer have any intention of interfering with personnel policies, but just to settle a few dozen "cases concerning real people" involving former MSZ employees. In the end, Prof. Geremek ordered that a vote be conducted. Eleven Sejm deputies (Democratic Left Alliance, PSL, and one Sejm deputy for UP) were in favor of extending the subcommission's mandate, whereas 12 Sejm deputies were against (UD, KPN, and UP, while one Sejm deputy for UP abstained). After the debate, the coalition members remained in the room, shouting that the votes were not counted properly. They announced that they would put the results of the vote in question.
