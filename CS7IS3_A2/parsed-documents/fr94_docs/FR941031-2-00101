FR941031-2-00101 FR941031-2-00072 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;315 and 50&hyph;316] Indiana Michigan Power Company; Donald C. Cook Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering the approval of the licensee's request to leave approximately 942 cubic meters of slightly contaminated sludge in place underneath the upper parking lot on the D.C. Cook site. This was proposed by Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee) for the D.C. Cook Plant, located in Berrien County, Michigan. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed action by the NRC would approve the disposal of contaminated sludge by leaving it in place at the facility, as proposed by the licensee's request dated October 9, 1991, as supplemented October 23, 1991, September 3, 1993, and September 29, 1993. The request for approval is submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2002. The total volume of contaminated sludge is estimated to be 942 cubic meters. The Need for the Proposed Action In 1982, approximately 942 cubic meters of slightly contaminated sludge were removed from the turbine room sump absorption pond and pumped to the upper parking lot located within the exclusion area of the D.C. Cook plant. The contaminated sludge was spread over an area approximately 4.7 acres. The sludge contains a total radionuclide inventory of 8.86 millicuries (mCi) of Cesium-137, Cesium-136, Cesium-134, Cobalt-60, and Iodine-131. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The licensee in 1982 evaluated the following potential exposure pathways to members of the general public from the radionuclides in the sludge: (1) external exposure caused by groundshine from the disposal site, (2) internal exposure caused by inhalation of resuspended radionuclide, and (3) internal exposure from ingesting ground water. The staff has reviewed the licensee's calculational methods and assumptions and finds that they are consistent with NUREG&hyph;1101, ``Onsite Disposal of Radioactive Waste,'' Volumes 1 and 2, November 1986 and February 1987, respectively. The staff finds the assessment methodology acceptable. The table below lists the doses calculated by the licensee for the maximally exposed member of the public based on a total activity of 8.89 mCi disposed in that year. ‚ê£ 1Pathway 1Whole body dose received by maximally exposed individual (mrem/yr) Groundshine 0.94 Inhalation 0.94 Groundwater Ingestion 0.73 n,s Total 2.61 For perspective, the radiation from the naturally occurring radionuclides in soils and rocks plus cosmic radiation gives a person in Michigan a whole-body dose rate of about 89 mrem per year outdoors, which may be altered as much as 20 mrem per year by the type of construction of the person's residence (e.g., wood frame or brick) and the amount of time spent in it. On July 5, 1991, the licensee re-sampled the onsite disposal area to assure that no significant impacts and adverse effects had occurred. A counting procedure based on the appropriate environmental low limit detection was used by the licensee; however, no activity above background was detected during the re-sampling. The 1991 re-sampling process used by the licensee confirms that the environmental impact of the 1982 disposal was very small. The staff finds the licensee's methodology acceptable. The staff has evaluated the impacts of leaving the contaminated sludge in place, and finds that the potential environmental impacts are insignificant. With regard to the nonradiological impacts, the staff has determined that leaving the soil in place has the smallest impact when compared to the principal alternatives discussed below. Alternatives to the Proposed Action The principal alternative to leaving the contaminated sludge in place would be to dig it up, package it in 55-gallon drums or other suitable containers, and ship it to a disposal facility licensed to dispose of low-level radioactive waste. This would be costly, requiring, for example, the removal of the parking surface over the disposal area, and would not provide environmental benefits in that no measurable radioactivity has been detected from the material. On the basis of the above analysis and evaluations and after weighing the environmental, technical, and other benefits against the environmental costs, the staff concludes that the action called for under NEPA and 10 CFR Part 51 is the issuance of an approval of the proposed waste disposal.
