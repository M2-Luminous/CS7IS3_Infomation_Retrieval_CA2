I want to wish you all a happy New Year. I would also like to say this to you: My dear compatriots! No, its not a slip of the tongue. Indeed, we all come from a common fatherland. Even though today we are separated by the borders of independent states, we have been brought up on the same land. A land bathed in our forefathers' sweat and blood. They worked on this land, on this field. They raised children, they believed in a better future. Special relations, special ties were established between the peoples of the former Soviet Union, binding together the hearts of all the people, and it was this that helped our fathers, our peoples, leaders of our states, to find the best solutions for the sake of the common people. Times are not easy for us now, but I am convinced that we will find ways toward prosperity; we cannot fail to find them. I believe in the wisdom of all the peoples of the former Soviet Union; therefore I believe we will find them. Now I want to address you all with just one thing. I want to wish that we all retain the friendly ties we had and still have; to retain them in the year 1994, to retain them in order to quench the fire of fratricidal war in the former Soviet Union so that 1994 becomes a year of mutual trust, a year of rapprochement, not one of divergence. We have nothing to quarrel about. I favor moving toward prosperity through unification, through mutual help, through setting up a common market space. Happy New Year, dear compatriots.
