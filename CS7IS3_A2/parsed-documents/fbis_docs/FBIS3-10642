FMLN Coordinator Shafik Handal said the inclusion of the High Command in the elections violates the Constitution and the Electoral Code. He added that the Armed Forces have always been used as an instrument to commit fraud. [Begin Handal recording] This violates the amended Constitution. The Constitution specifies very different duties [words indistinct]. This is an attempt to give continuity to an Armed Forces role -- a role that exceeds the Armed Forces' authority. No constitutional [word indistinct] authorizes the Armed Forces' involvement. The Armed Forces have always been part of the electoral apparatus, and their soldiers and officers have been used as instruments to perpetrate fraud in this country. We have unpleasant memories of this. It is time to [words indistinct]. We believe pressure is being exerted here. [end recording] Handal recalled that the National Civilian Police is the only institution authorized to provide security and surveillance in the 20 March elections. Meanwhile, the FMLN's Norma Guevara, member of the Supervisory Board [Junta de Vigilancia], stressed that the TSE drafted the plan without any prior consultations. [Begin Guevara recording] We were puzzled by the Armed Forces High Command's inclusion in the National Collection Center [Centro Nacional de Recepcion], because what is involved is a contract to offer services and means of transportation, and this institution should not be involved in this. The Electoral Code and the Constitution forbid this. Therefore, we are demanding that the TSE offer an explanation and, above all, correct this situation as soon as possible. [end recording] Meanwhile, FMLN member Gerson Martinez said the latest polls reveal that 30-40 percent of the voters have yet to voice a preference in the upcoming elections.
