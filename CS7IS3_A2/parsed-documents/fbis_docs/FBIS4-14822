"Estonia has adopted the Law on Aliens under which we can meet with humanitarian requests, but Estonia will not retreat in main issues," Tunne Kelam said at a traditional Monday afternoon picket before Russian military headquarters in Tallinn. The Estonian National Independence Party (ERSP) held the picket for the eight time to press for complete and orderly troop pullout by the August 31 deadline. Another issue they press for is that retired Russian military should not be allowed to stay in Estonia. "We have enough patience and as long as ERSP stands in the ruling coalition, there will be no concessions to Russia," MP Viktor Niitsoo said. One of the slogans carried was "Latvia's washout is a warning to Estonia" referring to Latvia's consent to allow residence of the retired military. All Estonian higher officials, including Defence Minister Juri Luik, have said that Estonia would make no concessions. Prime Minister Mart Laar said on Monday that Estonia could not possibly follow Latvia's Way as Estonian and Latvian laws are different and in order to agree to documents similar to those initialed between Russia and Latvia, Estonia would have to change its legislation which the present government would not do. Laar also expressed his regret that cooperation between Estonia and Latvia in foreign policy was not good enough.
