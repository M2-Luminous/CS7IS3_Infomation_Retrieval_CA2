The content of the support system is described by Mr. Tsuyoshi Nakai, head of the International Research Exchange Division, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Ministry of International Trade and Industry. What is the specific content of the new support system? "Preferential treatment will be applied in the taxation system for required R&D expenses when private Japanese companies undertake joint research with foreign government research organizations. Specifically, a 6% tax deduction of R&D expenses, including personnel costs, is being considered. The implementation of revisions to the tax system is targeted for 1994." Does it matter which research organization in whatever country is the partner for joint research? "We are not planning to impose limitations to specific countries. Associations with government research organizations of the United States or research laboratories of the European Community (EC) are both acceptable. Even foreign financed enterprises which have research laboratories in Japan are targets for preferential treatment." Why has this kind of support system been deemed necessary? "Regardless of whether a country is developed or developing, there is a high degree of interest overseas in the technological development strength of Japanese corporations. The desire throughout the world is to improve their country's technological strength by performing joint research in industrial technology fields where Japanese corporations are strong. "On the other hand, actions like restrictions by Japanese corporations on the expansion of R&D expenses in the recent depressed economy are occurring. Its influence on joint research with foreign organizations has begun to appear. While responding to the wishes of the world, in order to advance the technological strength of Japanese corporations through joint development, a new support policy was deemed necessary." Japan has been criticized by other countries for hitching a free ride on the results of basic research. "This support policy will be promoted while giving sufficient thought so as not to invite this kind of misunderstanding. For example, when government research laboratories in the United States and Japanese corporations embark on joint research, we would like to finalize decisions after appropriate supporting measures have been adjusted and decided in cooperation with the United States government. "Cooperation in industrial technology fields is a principal item in the Comprehensive U.S.-Japan Economic Conference. Concrete joint research themes will be future topics of discussion. The new support system will prepare for the participation of Japanese corporations in this kind of research planning."
