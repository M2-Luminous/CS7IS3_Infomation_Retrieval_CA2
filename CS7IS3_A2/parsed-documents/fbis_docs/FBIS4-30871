The deadline was extended last December until June 14, 1994. Trbojevic said that an IMF Board of Directors decision of December 14, 1992, said that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist and is thus no longer an IMF member. He said this was the first such decision of the board ever to occur since the founding of the IMF. Under the IMF decision, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's share in the succession of the former Yugoslavia's assets and liabilities with the fund amounts to 36.52 per cent. All former Yugoslavia's successors were given one month (expiring on January 14, 1993) officially to agree or disagree with their respective shares in former Yugoslavia's assets and liabilities in the IMF. Yugoslavia notified the IMF that it accepts its share, bearing in mind that this amount could not be permanent because the share of each IMF member-country should reflect its real economic power. The IMF said that Yugoslavia's status would be regulated if Yugoslavia settled its share of outstanding debts, passed a law on accepting obligations ensuing from the IMF Constitution, and if the IMF gave a positive assessment of Yugoslavia's liability to fullfil its obligations under the U.N. sanctions. All things considered, Yugoslavia has urged the IMF Board of Directors to extend the deadline for meeting these conditions, which the IMF did both in June and December 1993. The Yugoslav Government has said that its top priority task is to maintain and reactivate its cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank.
