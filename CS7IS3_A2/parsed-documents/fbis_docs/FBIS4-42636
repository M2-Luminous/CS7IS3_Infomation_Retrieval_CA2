They let the United States make the first move. Thus, as a prelude to his European trip, Bill Clinton has had the opportunity to say a few words on the Rome government's democratic ability, and on his cooperation with it. Clinton's uninhibited way of dealing with Berlusconi, Fini, and other members of the tripartite coalition must have been noticed in France, Greece, and the EU [European Union] staff in Brussels, where, remarkably enough, opposition had been expressed vis-a-vis the political changes in Italy that led to a completely new Italian party landscape. Clinton, notably younger than the leaders of Europe, and with a much fresher style, must possess a special interest in the new "Italian relationships" just like his predecessors after World War II. At that time, Washington feared a communist takeover in Italy, and sent a warlike lady as ambassador to the banks of the Tiber River; Clare Boothe Luce. From the U.S. stabilization policy pursued in Italy since the end of the war, one may conclude that even today this policy is taking place behind closed doors. After all, from the U.S. angle, Italy possesses strategic importance. Despite all its problems and uncertainties, Italy continues to be one of the largest EU members. It is a direct neighbor of the war-torn Balkans, and, last but not least, quite close to the Mediterranean basin and the troubled Maghreb countries. Apart for that, Italian Americans play a major role in the media society of the United States, something that encourages feelings of friendship toward the motherland.
