This conclusion is warranted by the CSCE report on the results of its work in 1993, released in Vienna today. The document points out that the developments of 1993 had occurred against the background of futile efforts to promote stability in the region. Bloody wars are still continuing in the Balkans, in Transcaucasia and in Tajikistan. There is persistent tension in inter-ethnic relations and the danger of new conflicts is still imminent. In these conditions the CSCE nations did their best to hold various consultations and to promote a dialogue on problems of current policy. Their new organ -- the Vienna group of the committee of senior CSCE officials -- has held more than thirty meetings during the reviewed period. CSCE peace-keeping missions have worked in many regions, including former Yugoslavia and the former republics of the Soviet Union. Their purpose was to help find a lasting, all-embracing political settlement for the conflicts, to find a mechanism to facilitate negotiations between the conflicting sides. The document specially notes the role of the CSCE high commissioner for the affairs of national minorities, who visited the Baltic states, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. He has submitted several valuable recommendations to guarantee the observance of human rights. The report stresses that one of the CSCE most important tasks is to strengthen cooperation in the sphere of security, to control armaments and promote disarmament. "The past year has proved that the CSCE is a living organism, capable of making an important contribution to the prevention of regional conflicts, to the promotion of peace-making measures and security on the continent," ITAR-TASS was told by CSCE Secretary-General Wilhelm Heink. He noted that in the coming period the CSCE nations planned to pay more attention to humanitarian aspects of cooperation, to expand their interaction in the sphere of preventive diplomacy, to activate relations with other international organisations and institutions, primarily with the United Nations.
