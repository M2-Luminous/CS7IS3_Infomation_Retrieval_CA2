FR941219-2-00112 FR941219-2-00067 5. Dr. Coker proposes to purchase the Land from the Plan in a one-time cash transaction. It is represented that as of December 31, 1993, the Land represented 1.7 percent of the Plan's assets. The applicant represents that the Land has been depreciating steadily over the years, but that this depreciation became evident to Dr. Coker in 1987. As such, after conferring with the Plan's consultants and administrators in 1991, Dr. Coker decided that he should sell the Land because of its steady depreciation and because of its illiquidity. Accordingly, the Land has been listed for sale with an independent real estate broker from October 1991 to January 1992, but there was no willing buyer. Therefore, it is represented that the proposed transaction is in the best interest and protective of the Plan because the transaction will divest the Plan of an asset that has greatly depreciated in value since original acquisition, and will enable the Plan to invest in vehicles with a higher return. The transaction is protective of the Plan because as a result of the sale the Plan will receive the higher of: a) the Original Acquisition Cost; or b) the current fair market value plus the Premium as established at the time of the sale by an independent qualified appraiser. Furthermore, the applicant represents that any amounts received by the Plan as a result of the proposed transaction, which are in excess of the fair market value of the Land will be treated as a contribution to the Plan, but that this contribution will not exceed limitations of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: (a) the proposed sale will be a one-time cash transaction; (b) the Plan will receive the higher of: 1) the Original Acquisition Cost; or 2) the current fair market value plus the Premium as established at the time of the sale by an independent qualified appraiser; and (c) the Plan will pay no expenses associated with the sale. Tax Consequences of Transaction The Department of Treasury has determined that if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and its sponsoring employer (or an affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less or receiving more than fair market value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring employer to the plan, and therefore must be examined under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including sections 401(a)(4), 404 and 415.
