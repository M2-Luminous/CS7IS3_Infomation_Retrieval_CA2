Officers from these armies leave the service to sign up immediately with the Russian Armed Forces. For instance, over 1,000 officers deserted the Kazakhstani Army for the Russian one; from Belarus, 800 officers; and from Ukraine, 1,000. For the most part, these are Air Force pilots and Missile Troops servicemen. They have been lured into the Russian Army by higher wages. It is expected that this year the flow of deserters, particularly from Kazakhstan, will grow, not drop. In Kazakhstan, they have started levying income taxes on servicemen and stripped them of some of their former benefits.
