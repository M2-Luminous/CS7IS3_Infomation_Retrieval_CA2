FR940405-2-00150 FR940405-2-00064 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33833; File No. 4&hyph;208] Intermarket Trading System; Order Approving Eleventh Amendment to the ITS Relating To Use of a Back-Up System March 30, 1994. On December 21, 1993, the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') an amendment to the restated ITS Plan pursuant to Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78k&hyph;1, and Rule 11a3a&hyph;2 thereunder. 1 The ITS participants filed the proposal to make several technical amendments to the ITS Plan including amendments relating to the use of a back-up system. Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on February 1, 1994. 2 The Commission received no comments on the proposal. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposal. 1 The ITS is a National Market System (``NMS'') plan approved by the Commission pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2. The ITS was designed to facilitate intermarket trading in exchange-listed equity securities based on current quotation information emanating from the linked markets. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19456 (January 27, 1983), 48 FR 4938. Participants to the ITS Plan include the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE''), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX''). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33520 (January 25, 1994), 59 FR 4731. The proposal makes several technical amendments to the ITS Plan to: (1) Provide for use of a back-up system in the event ITS becomes inoperable; (2) recognize the use of the Regional Computer Interface (``RCI'') by the Amex; (3) eliminate references to line costs and line sharing; (4) require a biennial rather than an annual audit by an independent public accountant; (5) change all references to the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE'') to CHX; and (6) correct the addresses of the CHX, CSE, and PSE. The proposal adds Section 15 to the ITS Plan to provide for the use of a back-up system. In the event the ITS system becomes inoperable, ITS would utilize a designated NYSE operating system (``NYSE System'') on a preemptive and priority basis. The NYSE System is comprised of computers and peripheral equipment sufficient to operate ITS at a minimum 50% of the ITS's rated 17 messages per second capacity and 75% of the ITS's disk capacity. The NYSE System would assume the functions of the ITS within two hours in the event of a limited disaster and on the next day in the event of a full site disaster. The proposal amends the ITS Plan to provide for the use of the RCI by the Amex through the Amex Display Book Manager (``DBM''). The Amex DBM is a computerized system that when fully implemented will, to some extent, replace the original ITS stations on the Amex trading floor. The proposal will permit communications, through the Amex DBM, between the ITS and the Amex floor.
