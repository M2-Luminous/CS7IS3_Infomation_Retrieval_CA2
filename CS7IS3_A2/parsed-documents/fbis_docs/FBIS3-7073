Consumption and corporate production are recuperating and corporate sentiment is improving, but capital investment is still declining and the labor situation is deteriorating, he said in a speech in Tokyo. He even cautioned that recent bright spots in the economy could have been brought about by factors concerning the fiscal year-end this month. Mieno added that Japan will have to wait a little longer for stock adjustments to be completed. He went on to say that the capability of private enterprises and financial institutions to manage risks is weakening, and called for the further introduction of a competitive environment within the industry. The governor warned that financial institutions are not operating entirely in line with basic market principles and a risk control that lacks such fundamentals may even result in greater insecurity. Further liquidation of nonperforming assets by financial institutions is indispensible for recovery of the Japanese economy, Mieno said. Referring to the recent rise in long-term interest rates, the governor said this appeared to be a reaction to overheated expectations of lower interest rates triggered by a recovery in Japanese stock prices. Mieno said any excessive movement of the rates is likely to be corrected in line with the realities of business conditions. With respect to efforts to beef up Japan's financial system, Mieno noted the need to improve methods of settlement, in addition to changes in corporate accounting and the tax system.
