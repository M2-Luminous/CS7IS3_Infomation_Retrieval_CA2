He indicated that if Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head of Sakigake [Harbinger], insists on deciding on the new prime minister at a meeting of leaders of the coalition parties, he would ask the coalition representatives meeting to enter substantial discussions on the succession issue without Sakigake. At the end of the representatives meeting on the morning of 14 April, Ozawa expressed displeasure at the conflict in the ruling coalition parties over the venue of discussions to select the new prime minister. He stated: "There has been no progress at all. We cannot afford to be dilly-dallying forever." Concerning the suggestion that the issue be taken up at a joint meeting of party leaders and representatives, Ozawa explained: "I am not the one opposed to this. Takemura is the problem." He criticized Takemura in strong terms, saying "(he) says we have to start everything from scratch, including the coalition." With regard to the Social Democratic Party of Japan and the Democratic Socialist Party, Ozawa wanted them to take an explicit position on whether they want to undertake discussions at the party leaders' meeting or at the representatives' meeting. He said: "They should talk within their own parties whether they want to do things the Sakigake way."
