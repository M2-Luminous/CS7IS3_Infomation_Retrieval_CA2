Pautova: "One Cannot Become Richer by Lowering Production." The survey is under the rubric "Economics in the Mirror of Statistics. How They Made It Through the Year." [Text] People's standard of living, for the most part, is not determined primarily by how revenues are divided up, but by the amounts that go into the budget. And this depends directly on total amounts earned by industry. The information presented here is based on data provided by the Municipal Directorate of Statistics. Last year, 1993, the production output of industrial enterprises in our city totaled 1,400 billion rubles at then current prices, the value of which was 8.3 times greater than the 1992 output. But in terms of comparative prices, the total production output of industrial enterprises decreased by 5.8 percent (if the total for 1992 is compared to that of 1991, the difference would be 16.6 percent). More than half (that is, 64 percent) of the Novokusnetsk enterprises lowered their outputs of industrial products. Among them were the Kuznetskiy Metallurgical Combine (KMK) Joint Stock Company (for 1993, this combine's output was 86 percent of 1992 production); the Novokuznetskaya Mine (89 percent); the Polosukhinskaya Joint Stock Company (71 percent); the Bungurskaya Joint Stock Company (88 percent); the Taldinskiy Open Pit Mine (80 percent); and the Viakom Joint Stock Company--the new name for the former meat combine (75 percent). At the same time, the decrease in the number of persons employed in the city's industrial enterprises in 1993 was insignificant. The city's enterprises employed 111,565 people (or, 99.4 percent of those employed in 1992). Labor productivity, however, fell by 5.3 percent. And now, some words about the dynamics of producing the main kinds of goods in Novokuznetsk enterprises. In 1993, for example, 9.5 percent less coal was extracted than in 1992. This sharp decrease in extraction can be explained by the inability of users to pay for the coal, caused mainly by the higher costs of transportation services. Certain enterprises were forced to halt coal mining completely. Thus in June 1993, the Zaryanovskaya Mine did not extract any coal, and the Baydayevskaya Mine brought out only 0.7 thousand tonnes (compared to the May output of 49.1 thousand tonnes). The output of the most important products in the metallurgical industry increased, compared to 1992: From rolled metal (by 7.1 percent), to agglomerate (by 10.4 percent), to cast iron (by 3.6 percent), and steel (by 3.0 percent). For the most part, all this production was the result of work done by the Zapadno-Sibirskiy Metallurgical Combine Joint Stock Company. In addition to the afore-mentioned KMK Joint Stock Company, two other metallurgical enterprises decreased their production of basic metal materials: The production of aluminum was 98.3 percent of the 1992 level and ferroalloys were 97 percent. Speaking of 1993 totals for industry, it must be noted that compared to 1992, the rates of decrease for volume of production have slowed down somewhat. Still, the percent by which production has decreased remains large. This is due to the inability of consumers to pay for products made in the city, increased costs of transportation, lack of raw materials, and sharp increase in the costs of all forms of energy. With regard to the food branch of the city's industry, products for which there is a specific and fairly stable demand have also been affected by the overall trend of a continuing decrease in output. The output for whole milk was 77 percent, compared to 1992; meat--67 percent; bread and bakery products--88 percent; and confectioner products--82 percent. On the whole, production of consumer goods shrank by 14.8 percent in 1993. Still, the data for 1993 alone do not provide any understanding about the "abyss" in which our economy finds itself. Let us, therefore, compare the dynamics of average daily production of basic goods for the past four years--from 1990 through 1993. The most important output of the city's metallurgical complex consists of rolled metal, cast iron, and steel. The daily average output of cast iron fell from 28.131 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 19.025 in 1993 (18.32 in 1992). The average daily output of steel decreased from 32.61 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 21.72 in 1993 (which is somewhat higher than the 1992 figure). Sharp decreases also occurred in rolled metal: From a daily average output of 22.34 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 16.39 in 1993. While the metallurgical branch showed a definite, though insignificant, increase in its daily average output in 1992, the coal industry showed a different trend. In 1992 the daily average output of coal decreased by 12.34 thousand tonnes and in 1993 it fell by nearly 5 thousand tonnes, to 44.65 thousand tonnes. Similar trends can be seen in the output of construction materials. Here are the figures for the average daily production of cement in 1990, 1992, and 1993: 3.616, 2.45, and 1.99 thousand tonnes, respectively. The drop in prefabricated reinforced concrete was even greater--from 1.316 thousand cubic meters per day in 1990 to 0.4 thousand in 1993. The output of aluminum and electrical energy decreased in the city, although the rate of decrease was not quite so significant. The general trends did not bypass the production of foodstuffs either. The daily average output of whole milk in 1990 was 334.3 tonnes. In 1993 the figure was down to 106.05 tonnes. It is doubtful that this decrease of more than two thirds in the output of a valuable product that is needed daily is attributable solely to the increase in its cost. This is also obvious in the dynamics of bread production and pastry products. There is also a decrease here, from 162.76 tonnes per day in 1990 to 143.34 in 1993. Because of this we see constant queues in bakeries. Understandably, our city has contributed its share to the rising inflationary spiral. The decrease in the output of the basic types of products invariably reflects both on price increases and on the inflation level, as well as on the standard of living in general. We cannot become richer if we produce and sell less and less.
