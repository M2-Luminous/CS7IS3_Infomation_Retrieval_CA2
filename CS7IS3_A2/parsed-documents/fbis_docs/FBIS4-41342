Henceforth an employer who wishes to attract foreign workers to Moscow must first apply to the city government departments or committees corresponding to his line of work and convincingly justify the need to "import" outsiders. A ruling on the appropriateness of such an action will be delivered to him within 30 days. If a positive ruling on the possibility of giving work to foreigners is obtained, the employer is to put down a sort of pledge for every worker invited, equivalent to the cost of the worker's return fare to his country of permanent residence. This measure is being introduced in case Moscow's law-enforcement organs need to deport the foreigner as an undesirable alien in those extreme cases which, unfortunately, happen quite often. If nothing of the sort occurs and the foreign worker returns to his home country in the normal way, the pledge is returned. The capital's Main Administration of Internal Affairs Visas and Registrations Administration registers the arrival of foreign workers and the city's statistical service keeps a permanent record of them. The number of foreigners invited is determined according to the corresponding quotas established for the number of foreign citizens as a whole and the total number per professional group that can be hired for work in Moscow. Permits to attract a foreign work force are issued by the Russian Federal Migration Service according to the ruling of the Moscow government. A permit is granted to an employee for a period of up to one year; he cannot transfer this permit to other persons or organizations; nor can he transfer the foreign workers to another place. It is of no little importance that a payment of one month's minimum salary is to be made to the city budget in return for permits for each worker. The foreigner can work on Moscow territory only when he has obtained a document from the city's migration service -- confirmation of the right to labor activity, which can be obtained only as a result of an application from an employer and only within the permitted quota. Exceptions are made for highly skilled foreign specialists invited to take up leading posts in enterprises with foreign investments, and also diplomats, major scientific and cultural figures, priests, correspondents and journalists accredited in our country, and some higher education students and specialists. The first survey of the number of foreigners invited to work in Moscow is scheduled for 1 August.
