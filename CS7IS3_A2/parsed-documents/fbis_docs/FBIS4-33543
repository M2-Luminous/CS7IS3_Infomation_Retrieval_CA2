Fausto Garcia, secretary of the Cuban Tour Operators Association, was our representative in the meeting. [Garcia] I just returned to Cuba. I come from the COTAL congress in Madrid, where Cuba's membership request was contained in point number 14 of the COTAL congress agenda. This is an important issue for Cuba, given our ongoing tourism development. For years, we had been unsuccessful in trying to become members of COTAL, until now. In the congress held in Madrid, Cuba achieved a resounding victory, with 14 countries in favor, one opposed, and one abstention. [Gomez] This is important. Now you know: Cuba belongs to COTAL, as Fausto Garcia just announced to the Exclusivo program of Radio Rebelde.
