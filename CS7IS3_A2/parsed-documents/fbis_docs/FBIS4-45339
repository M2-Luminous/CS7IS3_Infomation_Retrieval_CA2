Police spokesman Faustino Sanchez told ACAN-EFE that Guatemala is a "bridge and storehouse" for international drug trafficking, adding that most cocaine shipments arrive by air from Colombia and Panama. Sanchez said drugs are "unloaded" at night and stored in clandestine warehouses ready to be shipped to Mexico and the United States, their final destination. One of the most recent important seizures took place on 7 June in Malacatan, in the northwestern San Marcos Department, bordering Mexico. Sanchez said two Guatemalans were arrested with 79 kg of cocaine worth $1.3 million, which they tried to smuggle into Mexican territory. The alleged "drug traffickers," who were travelling in a microbus, were identified as Walter Heberto Torres Recinos and Oscar Antonio Segura Chacon.
