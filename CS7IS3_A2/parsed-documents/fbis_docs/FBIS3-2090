The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China announced yesterday it will vigorously expand its credit card business this year. Chen Xiaoyan, director of the bank's credit card department, said the goal is to increase the number of its Peony credit card holders from 2 million to 3.5 million. And the bank expects holders to spend 100 billion yuan ($11.49 billion) with the cards--twice last year's figure. The number of stores accepting the card is to expand to 30,000, 5,000 more than last year. Services will also be expanded in railroad stations, hospitals, securities markets and other facilities, Chen said. To support the plan, the bank has decided to speed up efforts to unify and standardize computer systems at all its branches. The effort will not only make operations more efficient but also make life easier for card holders, Chen said. With a unified computer network, Beijing card holders, for instance, will be able to draw cash from automatic teller machines (ATM) or charge goods at stores in Guangzhou. At present, the bank has more than 600 ATMs nationwide, mainly in large and medium-sized cities. The bank also plans to co-operate with the Ministry of Internal Trade to open more credit card services in department stores this year. Last year the bank's credit card business grew rapidly. The number of card holders and transaction volume increased 100 percent and 455 percent respectively over 1992. At present, the bank's 2 million card holders account for half of the country's total. The People's Construction Bank of China, the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China have issued their own credit cards. Internationally known Master Card and Visa have also entered the Chinese market in co-operation with Chinese banks. Credit cards made their debut in China in the mid-1980s and have become a status symbol, especially in the coastal and southern areas of the country. Because the "plastic money" also helps banks attract more deposits and reduces the flow of bank notes, the Chinese government has encouraged their development. Chen predicted China will have 7 million card holders this year, nearly twice the number last year.
