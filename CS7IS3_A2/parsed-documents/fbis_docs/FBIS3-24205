The text of the charter has not yet been made available to city residents, however. The city mayor explained the need for a general referendum on these two issues by such an important factor as Vladivostok entering market relations at a time when the city administration system has outlived itself and is no longer relevant. Viktor Cherepkov especially emphasized that introducing a centralized system in such matters as allocation of apartments and tax collection will allow, as he put it, correct justice to be achieved. The Vladivostok Charter also is extremely important in the new economic conditions and political realities. Viktor Cherepkov said that city soviet deputies had worked on the charter earlier, and he continued what they had started, reducing the deputies' version to five pages. The mayor did not describe in detail the contents of the draft city charter, only saying that the charter will delineate the functions of the executive and representative branches of power in Vladivostok and the city's relations with kray and republic authorities. Viktor Cherepkov also said that he refused to put in the draft charter a provision that the city mayor serves at the same time as head of the city duma. State law specialists, commenting on Viktor Cherepkov's address, told our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that the city mayor is most likely attempting to widen his power base, protect himself in advance from duma interference in the mayoralty's affairs, and acquire maximum powers. Blessed by a popular vote, the charter may make the mayor practically absolutely invulnerable in his confrontation with kray authorities.
