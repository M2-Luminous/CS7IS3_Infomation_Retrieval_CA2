The Guatemalan president said that, if necessary, he will order the mobilization of Army troops to various areas of the country to contain "planned" disturbances and an alleged wave of violence that aims to undermine the country's institutions. On Friday, gang members attacked pedestrians, destroyed about 100 vehicles and robbed various commercial establishments, without immediate reaction from the police. "We will impose order with the law in our hand to guarantee security for the people," the president said after deploring the violent actions by vandals who took over the center of the capital. Government Minister Danilo Parinello said the disturbances were financed by "a sector" to sow chaos and terror so as to prevent the country's pacification. Nevertheless, he did not name the sector to which he referred. Parinello said the violence unleashed in the city has the objective of preventing the replacement of 116 deputies, whose term ends in 1996, through legislative elections in August. "The wave of violence is manageable," the chief of Guatemalan security said. Prosecutor General Ramses Cuestas urged Parinello to present a report on the disturbances and on those who sponsored them so the appropriate penalties can be applied. National Police spokesman Gonzalo Figueroa Castellanos said he has information about a destabilization plan, but he declined to name those responsible for it. In this regard, the police spokesman confirmed that several dynamite charges were placed at an electricity pylon located on kilometer marker 18.5 of the highway between Guatemala City and San Pedro Ayampuc Municipality to the west. He said the explosive damaged the infrastructure, causing nearly $75,000 in damage. Meanwhile, General Efrain Rios Montt, former de facto president (1982-1983), suggested to the De Leon Carpio government that "it apply a hard hand to rebuild the country, because it is pitiful to see the way it is today." Rios Montt, who is a candidate for deputy for the Guatemalan Republican Front, said the country "has been knocked about since the beginning of the decade when the law was undermined, but now strong measures must be taken to rescue the nation."
