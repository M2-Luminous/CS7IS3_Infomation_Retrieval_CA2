S5.5.1␣Each vehicle with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds, except for any vehicle that has a speed attainable in 2 miles of not more than 33 mph, shall be equipped with an antilock braking system that directly controls the wheels of at least one front axle and the wheels of at least one rear axle of the vehicle, with no more than two wheels being controlled by one controlling output device. The wheels of at least one axle shall be independently controlled. S5.5.2␣In the event of any failure (structural or functional) in an antilock or variable proportioning brake system, the vehicle shall be capable of meeting the stopping distance requirements specified in S5.1.2 for service brake system partial failure. * * * * * 3. Section 571.121 would be amended by amending S4 to add the following definitions, revising S5.1.6, and by adding S5.1.6.1, S5.2.3. and S5.2.3.1. The revised and added paragraphs would read as follows: §571.121 Standard No. 121; Air brake systems. * * * * * S4.␣Definitions. * * * * * Directly controlled wheel means the wheel at which the degree of rotational wheel slip is sensed and corresponding signals are transmitted to a controlling device that adjusts the brake actuating forces at that wheel.

The wheels of at least one axle shall be independently controlled. * * * * * S5.2.3␣Antilock brake system. S5.2.3.1(a)␣Each single axle trailer (including a trailer converter dolly) shall be equipped with an antilock braking system that directly controls the wheels of the axle of the vehicle. (b) Each trailer with two or more rear axles (including a trailer converter dolly) shall be equipped with an antilock braking system that directly controls the wheels on at least 50 percent of the axles of the vehicle, with no more than two wheels being controlled by one controlling output device. (c) Each full trailer shall be equipped with an antilock braking system that directly controls the wheels of at least one front axle of the vehicle and at least 50 percent of the rear axles of the vehicle, with no more than two wheels being controlled by one controlling output device.
