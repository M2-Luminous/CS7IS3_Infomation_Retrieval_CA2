The northeast China plain, about 16 million hectares of fertile land stretching across the three provinces, now provides about 25 billion kilograms of grain for the whole nation. It is also supplying meat, eggs and milk for about 100 million urbanites each year. Over the past four years, the total output of grain has reached 50 billion kg each year on average, with the grain output last year topping 60 billion kg. The three provinces can now release more than half of the grain produced here for consumption in other parts of China. The central government used to supply more than one billion kg of grain to Liaoning, which is one of the most industrialized regions in the country. However, that situation ended two years ago. Liaoning Province now offers over one billion tons of grain for the nation each year. Experts here said that grain produced in this area has played a vital role in stabilizing the nation's grain prices since the government lifted price control on grain a few years ago. "Grain transported from the northeast to other parts of the country greatly eased the grain price hikes in some major cities last year as some southern grain-producing provinces witnessed a decline in output," said an expert here. Animal husbandry in the region has been growing fast too as a result of more grain. Last year, meat production topped three million tons, making the area self-sufficient in meat supply. Extra meat was sold to many other parts of China. The output value of animal husbandry grew to some 30 billion yuan, 25 percent of the total farm production value. About one million farm households now live on raising livestock. More than one-third of the 30 billion kg of corn produced in the three provinces were used for raising livestock. Several years ago, there was virtually no animal husbandry industry in northeast China because of cold weather and traditional means of raising animals. The area was China's largest meat-importing region as over 100,000 tons, one-third of the meat consumed there, came from other parts of China, especially southwest China's Sichuan Province. Officials said the grain output increase was the result of years of efforts. Heilongjiang Province has spent 1.6 billion yuan in the past few years transforming the lower-productive fields. Jilin and Liaoning provinces have spent years constructing irrigation projects. Grain output was often affected by natural disasters such as early frost. More than 20 items of new technology in cultivating grains, including the development of new species, the use of plastic film covers, proper application of fertilizer and water-saving techniques, were exploited. Experts attribute over 40 percent of the grain output increase to the use of new techniques. The three provinces have also increased investment in farming annually. Jilin Province spent 18.4 billion yuan in the past four years on farming, with an annual increase of 11 percent. Investment in agriculture in Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces also grew significantly.
