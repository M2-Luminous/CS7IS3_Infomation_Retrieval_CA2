A senior official commented: "We are checking the report which is based on the contents of a confidential letter from President Boris Yeltsin to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. We have contacted our High Commissioner in New Delhi, Mr Riaz Khokar and, in a couple of days, we should be in a position to give a formal reply." The official added that he was surprised that such a confidential letter between two heads of state could have found its way into a newspaper article. The view in the Foreign Office is that if the report is true then the letter may have been sent to New Delhi before the Foreign Secretary-level talks between the two countries were held early this month. According to the report in the Indian press which was prominently displayed in the media here, Russia has expressed its concern over grave violations of human rights and asked New Delhi to solve the Kashmir problem in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people. Earlier when Boris Yeltsin had visited India, he had reportedly spoken of Occupied Kashmir as part of India which had disturbed Islamabad. It was only after a clarification from Moscow that Islamabad announced that there was nothing new in Moscow's policy on Occupied Kashmir. One view which prevailed in the Foreign Office was that recently the United States and Russia have shown similarity of views on many issues. "Both US and Russia want India and Pakistan to continue dialogue and both (in the past) have approached the two neighbours to come to the negotiating table," said the official. "But what we cannot tell right now is whether there is really a qualitative change." Earlier, a senior US official Robin Raphael had visited Moscow after a visit to Islamabad and the growing US concerns in the region were a topic of discussions. Later, during Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow recently a joint statement spoke of peace in the region. Before waiting for any formal reply from the government, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference in a press release has hoped that the Russian advice would convince India to stop its reign of terror. While applauding the Russian stance on Kashmir, the statement said that the change was due to advent of democracy in Russia which resulted in this human and conviction-oriented stand. Meanwhile, the official at the Foreign Office said that there was some indication that the six non-papers that India had promised to send to Pakistan would arrive here sooner than expected. "Earlier, the Indian Foreign Office had said that they would send them after nearly four months," commented the official. The Foreign Office says that New Delhi had to do so because Islamabad had seized the initiative and sent them two non-papers.
