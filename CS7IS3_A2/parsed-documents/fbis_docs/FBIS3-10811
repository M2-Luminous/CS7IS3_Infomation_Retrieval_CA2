Prosecutor General De Greiff told the privately owned "Caracol" radio station in Santa Fe de Bogota that 27-year-old Urdinola is charged with drug trafficking, illegal enrichment, and conspiracy. De Greiff said Urdinola was accompanied by one person, not two as was reported earlier. The prosecutor general said he did not know who Urdinola's companion was. The prosecutor general added that Urdinola's lawyer said that the mafioso will confess to his crimes. De Greiff did not say where Urdinola is being held, but it is believed that he is at the Palmira maximum security prison. The prosecutor general said he has no information regarding the imminent surrender of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, alleged head of the Cali cartel, whose lawyers have been discussing his surrender with judicial authorities.
