[.sup]144 [/] Ce content and concentration and isotope content of plutonium in soil samples were determined. The objective of the work was to develop a model that would make it possible to assess contamination of territories with [.sup]90[/]Sr and plutonium based on data of contamination of the territories with gamma-radiating radio nuclides. The first stage of the work consisted of experimental measurements that provided gamma-spectrometry and radiochemical analysis of soil samples taken at settlements with various levels of contamination located at various distances from the Chernobyl AES. During the second stage correlation analysis of Goskomgidromet [USSR State Committee for Hydrometeorology] data and experimental measurements conducted by the authors was performed. A linear model satisfactorily describes the relationship between [.sup]90[/] Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs in the remote zone (Bryansk oblast) soils and makes it possible to estimate territory contamination with [.sup]90[/]Sr based on data of [.sup]137[/] Cs contamination.
