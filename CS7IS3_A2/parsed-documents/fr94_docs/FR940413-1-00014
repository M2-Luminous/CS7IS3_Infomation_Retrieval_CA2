FR940413-1-00014 FR940413-1-00005 While the sale of mortgages with insurance has numerous advantages, it also has some disadvantages. Sale of mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance requires HUD to budget a credit subsidy. Moreover, the sale of mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance continues HUD's responsibility to regulate the relationship between the mortgagee and the mortgagor. Regulation leads to expenditure of government staff time and money that could be devoted to other purposes. Selling mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance is also consistent with government-wide efforts to increase Federal collections, reduce regulation in favor of competition, use Federal Government personnel more efficiently, and return functions to the private sector. Finally, selling mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance is compatible with the objectives of the National Housing Act which formulates the goal of ``a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family,'' since projects should continue to provide decent and suitable housing without having a mortgage insured by FHA. Tenants in unsubsidized projects with current mortgages would not be disadvantaged if their project mortgages are sold without FHA mortgage insurance because, with some limitations, owners of unsubsidized projects may prepay their mortgages without HUD approval at any time. Similarly, these owners (with the approval of their mortgagees) may voluntarily terminate their FHA mortgage insurance. Under current conditions, prepayment and voluntary termination are likely to occur when owners refinance existing mortgages to take advantage of lower interest rates. Since HUD regulation of these projects can be terminated at any time, tenants in these projects would be provided rental housing on terms no less advantageous than those under which the original mortgage was insured prior to assignment, and they would be no more likely to suffer displacement. In addition, low-income tenants in projects with project-based section 8 assistance could continue to receive the section 8 assistance under existing contracts, even if the mortgage is no longer insured. This is because, subject to appropriations, it is current HUD policy to grant extensions of project-based section 8 contracts without regard to the status of the mortgage. Under this rule, HUD would require that purchasers of mortgages agree not to induce any project owner to terminate a project-based section 8 assistance contract, and, in the event of foreclosure, to assume any section 8 contract. Moreover, if an owner terminates the section 8 contract, it is current HUD policy, that, subject to appropriations, all eligible tenants would receive section 8 certificates or vouchers. Low-income tenants in projects without project-based section 8 could apply for certificates or vouchers from their local public housing authority. Under this rule, HUD would only sell mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance to HUD-approved mortgagees. However, this rule would allow HUD to sell mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance without such a restriction. Mortgages sold with FHA mortgage insurance would be covered by the Multifamily Mortgage Foreclosure Act, which permits HUD to require, as a condition and term of the foreclosure sale, that the purchaser agree to continue to operate the property in accordance with the terms of the original FHA mortgage insurance program. Mortgages sold with FHA insurance and subsequently foreclosed upon would also be subject to the property management and disposition provisions of section 203 of the HCDA of 1978 which provide for the preservation, in whole or part, of HUD-owned projects for low- and moderate-income persons. To guard against windfall profits by a mortgagee from the default of an insured mortgage purchased at a discount, HUD would limit insurance proceeds. C. Sale of Delinquent Mortgages In addition to selling current (i.e., performing) mortgages, under this rule HUD would sell some delinquent (i.e., nonperforming) unsubsidized mortgages to investors who would assume the responsibility for bringing the mortgages current, modifying them, refinancing the property, or foreclosing the mortgage. Under the proposed rule, HUD would not sell mortgages that it would normally foreclose upon; i.e., those mortgages with incurable defaults which are secured by projects occupied by low-income tenants not currently receiving rental subsidies but who would be eligible to receive rental assistance under section 203 of the HCDA of 1978 if the mortgages were foreclosed upon by HUD. Loan restructuring is more desirable than foreclosure from both HUD's and the tenants' points of view. In foreclosure, projects undergo long periods of uncertainty, and may suffer from physical decline because owners lack an economic incentive to invest in improvements, and from management problems as owners focus attention on economically viable activities.
