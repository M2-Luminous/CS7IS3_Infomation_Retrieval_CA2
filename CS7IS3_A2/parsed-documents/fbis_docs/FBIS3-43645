The chairman of yesterday's sitting, Dr. Dawie de Villiers, said there had been a slight decrease in violence since the TEC had given orders last month for the police to bring the situation there under control. He said that the situation was not yet satisfactory, and that it would be monitored continually. KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi warned earlier that the deployment of more police in kwaZulu would be seen as an invasion. On the controversy surrounding the government's campaign to promote the new constitution, the council decided that it would control the campaign in future. The South African Communications Service will continue promoting the constitution in the media, but it will now do so in consultation and collaboration with the TEC.
