This exceeded the goal set by the company for itself by DM100 million despite the recession, Karl Engelhardt, chief coordinator for purchases in the corporation, stated at the Hannover Fair on Friday [22 April]. The plan of buying goods and services for DM1 billion from eastern Germany by 1995 will certainly be fulfilled. The corporation has a considerable advantage regarding costs by issuing orders in eastern Germany. Ancillary wage costs in the west are twice as high as in the new laender. The increase in purchases is a sign of the competitiveness of east German suppliers. The corporation is buying most in Brandenburg, followed by Saxony, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The northernmost land was able to increase its volume by 60 percent last year.
