The first issue is related to agriculture. In addition to organizing the relationship between the two parties, the agreement has opened, for the first time, the Israeli market for Palestinian agricultural products, such as vegetables and fruits. The Israeli market was completely closed before to Palestinian products. This is one of the papers that was accomplished. The second paper deals with industry. This paper has defined the requirements for developing Palestinian industry and the relationship between the two parties. The paper even deals with the issue of standards and our commitment to these standards. Since Israel already has very rigid standards, we will not try at first to follow their standards, but we hope that in the future we will have our own firm industrial standards. The third paper deals with energy. In this paper, we insist on pricing all oil products in accordance with the income of our Palestinian people. Although they insisted on one price for gasoline, it was agreed to allow a difference of 15 percent between the prices of fuel in the West Bank and Gaza and the prices of fuel in Israel. Therefore, I believe that all these papers are good because -- although they did not meet all the demands -- they met some of the most important Palestinian aspirations to lay down the bases for an economic system that can survive and develop. [Badawi] Brother Abu-al-'Ala' [Quray' nom de guerre]: The self-rule agreement has not yet been implemented although 13 April is very close. What is the major obstacle in your view, and what do you expect to happen in the future? Rabin said the agreement on self-rule will not be reached before the first half of next month. [Quray'] I do not want to anticipate things or deal with the causes. There is no doubt they shoulder the major responsibility for not accomplishing the accord on the set date, despite the great importance of respecting the dates stipulated by the accord -- I am talking in particular about the date 13 April -- which means real implementation of the accord on the ground in terms of withdrawal, the return of Palestinian leaders, and the presence of Palestinian security and police on the ground. This should have been respected by them as well as by us. Regrettably, this date has not been met. However, I can say that the current round of talks in Cairo and the economic talks being held here will help expedite the implementation of this accord. I am optimistic that the Gaza-Jericho accord will be accomplished before the end of this month, within two weeks, or even less than this.
