Gasanov sees the programme as an important element of European security. The letter also expresses hope that Azerbaijan will join this partnership since the programme includes regulations on respecting borders. Today's scheduled visit of Georgian Foreign Minister, Alexander Chikvaidze, to Azerbaijan was postponed due to bad weather. However, towards the end of the day, the leader of the Georgian diplomatic representation is due to arrive in Baku. Important aspects to Azerbaijani-Georgian relations will be considered at this meeting. Today the delegation of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs is due to arrive in Baku as well. During meetings with Azeri Foreign Ministry officials, development of bilateral relations in policy, economy, culture will be discussed. The ratification of the treaty on friendship and cooperation, as well as bilateral treaties on cooperation in spheres of science, technology and culture are expected to take place. Agshin Mehktiyev, a Foreign Ministry official said that due to diplomatic efforts by Baku, there has been positive movement towards U.S. policy vis-a-vis Congressional restrictions on government aid to Azerbaijan, which might lead to their abolition. Azeri Foreign Ministry officials say the White House and State Department have called for the annulment of Senator Kerry's amendment that was attached to the "Freedom Suport Act" (Title IX, Section 907). However, it is Congress that must vote the final decision. This Congressional amendment bans U.S. Government assistance, of most types, to the Government of Azerbaijan. The representative of the Azeri Foreign Ministry expressed hope that the U.S. Congress will take a constructive position on this problem. A visit by the Azeri president to the United Kingdom is expected in late December. The programme of this visit is being worked out now. Aliyev will meet and negotiate with British Prime-Minister John Major. The signing of the contract on friendship, cultural, scientific and technical cooperation is expected. The signing of bilateral treaty on cooperation in oil production is also expected.
