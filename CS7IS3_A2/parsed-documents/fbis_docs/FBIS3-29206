But that is no reason to be discouraged. Prime ministers under the Liberal Democratic Party government did not fare much better either. If Japanese were asked to name the prime minister of Norway, the country where the winter Olympics is to be held, what percentage of them could give the correct answer? U.S. understanding of Japan, particularly with respect to politics, is of about that degree. But that is where Prime Minister Hosokawa is going today, 10 February, to attend the third summit meeting. The eastern United States are currently suffering from a cold wave. However, the atmosphere in Washington, where the prime minister will be received, is said to be colder still. The reason, almost needless to say, is because of deadlocked negotiations over the question of setting numerical targets on imports of U.S. automobiles and auto parts into Japan. Japan insists it can never accept such targets, the United States counters with, "It would be better to have no agreement than to have one without numbers in it." Battles at the working level are continuing with no end in sight, like parallel lines that will never meet. This is the fourth Japan-U.S. summit meeting in less than a year since the Clinton government came to power. It was in April last year that both sides agreed to hold new economic framework talks. Subsequently it was agreed in July that the forum of the comprehensive economic consultations should be instituted and that progress on consultations should be announced at the summit meeting to be held six months later. It was an agreement made by the Miyazawa government. However, since then Prime Minister Hosokawa has met President Clinton twice, and has declared that his administration will try to fulfill the agreement. That being the given condition, the economy-oriented President has tried his best not to put the prime minister in a difficult position, and to back him up openly displaying his friendliness. There is no doubt that this time the President will ask the prime minister to return the favor. As far as we can see, news media in the United States have conspicuously encouraged the President on the issue of setting numerical targets. THE NEW YORK TIMES said: "The President is about to take appropriate action." U.S. public opinion is right now boiling on the question of bombing former Yugoslavia. If there is any topic of concern as far as Asia is concerned, it might be nuclear development in the DPRK (North Korea). That being the case, there are, among Japanese working-level officials, some who feel that a serious situation can be avoided somehow by putting off a decision on the matter. That would not be a wise choice. Postponing matters is an old trick used by Japan in previous negotiations with the United States. As Washington sees it, the issue boils down to a trade deficit with Japan running to more than $50 billion a year. President Clinton thinks there is no more room for compromise and no choice but to force numbers on Japan. Kunihiko Saito, vice minister of foreign affairs, said: "Expectations of the Hosokawa government having been so great, the impact of betrayal by it will be enormous." He also warned: "If we bungle this, Japan-U.S. relations could become the worst they have been since the end of the war." Confrontations between the bureaucrats of Japan and the United States now are such that there appears to be no way out. There is no other way but for the President and the prime minister to make a political decision. The prime minister keeps talking about making "a decision at the last moment." That was what happened on the rice issue, the political reform bills, and reform of the taxation system. It looks certain now that he will have to make another "decision at the last moment." This time, however, the issue is how far he can go over the heads of the bureaucrats. But this is what the Clinton administration and the U.S. news media are hoping will happen. We are concerned lest his 1-percent recognition in the United States shoot up as a result of him becoming notorious.
