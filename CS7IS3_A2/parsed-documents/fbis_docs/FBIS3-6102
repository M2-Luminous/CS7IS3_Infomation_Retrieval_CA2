However, no reasonable [ungdanghan] results have been produced due to the South side's unreasonable acts. In this connection, the spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued the following press statement [tamhwa] on 15 March. Press statement issued by the spokesman of the CPRF: Recently, working-level delegates contacts for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and South, which was suspended in October of last year, were held on several occasions at Panmunjom. A series of progress has been made in the contacts, but no reasonable results have been produced yet. We can view that this is wholly attributed to the unreasonable acts of the South Korean authorities who are creating a barrier before the exchange of special envoys and who do not welcome the early settlement of the exchange of special envoys. As already known, at the sixth working-level delegates' contact held on 12 March, our side showed a broad-minded and tolerant position regarding the four demands that we justly presented. As one of the new measures to realize the exchange of special envoys between the two sides as soon as possible, we put forth constructive proposals that we inform the people at home and abroad in the form of a joint communique that the two sides have reconfirmed their intention for the exchange of special envoys and have agreed to the exchange of special envoys as soon as possible, and that at the same time the two sides sincerely discuss and bring to a conclusion the draft agreement on procedural matters presented by each side. This kind of epoch-making measure not only gives the condition to all the more achieve, ahead of schedule, the exchange of special envoys, it also gives hope to all the people who are worried about the future of the exchange of special envoys. Moreover, it creates a significant opportunity which provides a turning point in the new beginning of North-South relations. If the South Korean authorities truly want to realize the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and the South from the position of dissolving today's acute confrontational situation and achieve, ahead of schedule, reunification in the nineties, they must rightly show a positive response to our rational and patriotic initiative. Nevertheless, in the 12 March contact, while making remarks, the South side acted if it had interest in the exchange of special envoys, but it showed a negative attitude in putting it into practical action and rejected our constructive proposal. This kind of attitude by the South Korean authorities on the exchange of special envoys is giving disappointment to the people at home and abroad who are watching over the Panmunjom working-level delegates contacts. As already known, we proposed the exchange of special envoys of the North and South first. This is the best way to smoothly and quickly discuss and resolve pending issues between the North and South including the issue of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and the nation's grave matters for the country's peace and peaceful reunification through the top-level political determination and under the principle of national independence and great national unity. When the top-level special envoys of the North and the South travel between Pyongyang and Seoul and historic top-level North-South talks ensue, it will be no doubt that an epochal turning point will be made in North-South relations and a decisive stage will open in achieving the nation's ultimate goal of reunification in the nineties. This is why we initiatively raised the exchange of the top-level special envoys of the North and the South, which the South side could never have imagined, prepared for working-level delegates' contacts in Panmunjom, and exerted every effort to smoothly open the road for the two sides' special envoys to visit Pyongyang and Seoul. The reason our side demanded the South side suspend all of its large-scale nuclear war exercises against fellow countrymen, stop talking about an international alliance system against us for the nonexistent nuclear issue, cancel the plan to introduce new arms--including Patriot missiles, and clearly show an attitude to retract the remarks that it cannot shake hands with those who have nuclear weapons, was to successfully realize the exchange of the top-level special envoys of the North and the South without twists and turns in conformity with their primordial missions. Our demands, which are truly just in terms of the nation's craving and of the lessons from past North-South dialogues, received active support from public opinion at home and abroad and even won sympathy from many people in South Korea. Because the exchange of North and South special envoys is a precondition of the two sides' top-level talks and the missions of the special envoys are urgent and important for the sake of the country and the nation, it has become an inevitable prerequisite to remove the obstacles blocking the achievement of the exchange. Nevertheless, the South side avoided expressing a clear attitude toward our just proposal, thus casting a shadow on the future of the special envoy exchange, which after much effort had been finally scheduled, and jeopardized its destiny. At such a time, to break through the difficulty laid in front of the special envoy exchange, our side evaluated and analyzed what the South side said in the sixth working-level contact held on 12 March: that the issues of discontinuing all large-scale nuclear war exercises and abandoning the international alliance system could be discussed after the special envoys are exchanged in the future; that although conditionally, it decided to suspend Team Spirit '94 joint military exercise some time ago and withheld the plan to introduce Patriot missiles; and that regarding the remarks that it cannot shake hands with those who have nuclear weapons, the situation is now changed because there is no intelligence which shows the North has developed nuclear weapons. Based on this, we believed that although not sufficient, such a position is an expression of the South side's understanding of the feasibility of our four-point proposal. Bearing this in mind, we proposed to proclaim at home and abroad that the two sides reconfirmed their will to exchange special envoys and agreed to exchange special envoys at the earliest possible date. Our side's broad-minded measure and constructive proposal is just in every respect and is a manifestation of an active position on the exchange of special envoys. However, when viewing that the South side is not accepting the issue of releasing the joint communique without any reasonable reason, we cannot but doubt whether they truly have the will for the exchange of special envoys and whether they will actually carry out the exchange of special envoys. Also, even while discussing the procedural matters for the exchange of special envoys, the South side assumed the attitude that it cannot accept the issue of easing tension, the issue of great national unity, the issue of settling the method for the fatherland's reunification, and the issue of abiding by the principle of national independence which our side put forth in regulating the duties of the special envoys. It is nothing but clear that rather than bringing about fruitions in the exchange of special envoys, the South side is trying to make the working-level delegates' contact only as a show off. As such, the South side opposed the issuing of the joint communique that the two sides of the North and South agreed for the exchange of special envoys, and even opposed including the fundamental and principle problems in regulating the duties of the special envoys. Therefore, this creates an artificial barrier in the exchange of special envoys, and furthermore the South side is carrying out acts of intentionally putting the breaks on the third round DPRK-U.S. talks. While acting as such, the South side is intent on making nonsense by saying that the exchange of special envoys is a precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and that the exchange of special envoys must be achieved before 21 March, the date for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. In the third clause of the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New York contact which was concluded on 25 February, it only specifies that the working-level delegates' contact shall be resumed for the exchange of special envoys of the North and South. No other items were specified. There can be no other explanation for this and moreover, the South Korean authorities have no justification to come forth with any kind of condition by interfering in the process of explaining this problem. Our side resumed the working-level delegates' contact for the exchange of special envoys at Panmunjom, and it was already held on three occasions. Moreover, our side assumed a broad-minded position to draw the contact to the doors [munhogu] of the exchange of special envoys. This is being viewed as having progressed the contact even more so than the content of the DPRK-U.S. joint agreement. Even so, the South Korean authorities ignored our sincerity and positivism and even put forth unreasonable preconditions which do not even fall within their authority, and made distorted false charges. Also, for them to say that they cannot issue a joint communique on the exchange of special envoys is in reality to dissipate the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and South itself, and this cannot but be interpreted as an act of putting a wet blanket over the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. We claim that if the South Korean authorities truly have the will to improve North-South relations and discuss and resolve with us all pending issues between the North and South including denuclearization, they must correctly show the will for the exchange of special envoys which all the people can understand, and make a resolute decision on accepting our side's proposal on procedural matters. We will continue to watch over the attitude of the South Korean authorities.
