Joint Exercises by Forces From Five Navies Have Been Completed in North Atlantic; Cooperation Is Continuing"] [Text] Nowadays few would be surprised by Russia's military cooperation with powers which it once opposed. Something else would surprise a number of people: Despite all the difficulties it is experiencing, the Russian Navy is by no means playing second fiddle in this embryonic partnership. The colors of the participants' flags in the "Pomor-94" exercises were identical -- red, white, and blue. But the interests of the countries which have now sent their ships to the North Atlantic used to be as different as the design of their flags. Today they have more and more interests in common and increasing grounds for cooperation. The fact that the world's oceans are becoming safer in advance of other regions was confirmed by the "Pomor-94" exercises, which took place without a shot being fired. During this exercise six ships -- two from Norway and one each from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Russian escort ship Legkiy from the Northern Fleet -- practiced tasks involving joint maneuvers, search and rescue of those in distress, coordination of operations with patrol aircraft back at base, and coastal blockades with the aim of preventing smuggling. The phrase "for the first time" may be applied to these exercises in many ways, not least because this is the first time such maneuvers have ever been held. It is also remarkable that for the first time a Russian military journalist traveled on board a Norwegian ship during exercises on this scale. And the fact that Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander in chief of the Navy, participated in the exercises made them important enough for the Norwegian defense minister to attend as well. The "Pomor-94" exercises started and finished with news conferences by leaders and organizers of this new round of marine cooperation. The Norwegian Admiral Ove Sten Olsen, who was in charge of the exercise campaign headquarters, spoke highly of the Russian sailors and noted that cooperation of this sort would also be planned in future. In reply, Admiral Igor Kasatonov announced that the Russian Navy is this year planning to participate in a number of other similar joint exercises, including the landing of a Russian-U.S. assault force near Vladivostok. Next year the Russian Northern Fleet plans to host the "Pomor" exercises combined squadron.
