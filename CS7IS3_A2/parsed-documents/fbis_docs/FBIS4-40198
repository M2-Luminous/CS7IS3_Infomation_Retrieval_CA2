This was announced by Boris Yeltsin at a meeting with managers of enterprises of the Amur region on Wednesday. President Yeltsin, currently on a working visit to the city of Blagoveshchensk and the republic of Tuva, believes that "the current task is to transfer reforms from a macro to a micro level, to the level of enterprises," which should more actively attract investments to boost production and resolve social tasks. "The times when enterprises and whole regions lived at the expense of the state budget are over. It is necessary to find one's own resources to survive since living on subsidies under market conditions is a shame," Yeltsin said. He recommended to regional heads to make use of the president's recent decree on the expansion of the activities of foreign banks on the territory of the Russian Federation and attract major Korean or Japanese capital into the region.
