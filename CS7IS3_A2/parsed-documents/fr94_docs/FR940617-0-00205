FR940617-0-00205 FR940617-0-00026 CO mass =Carbon monoxide emissions, grams per test mode. Density CO =Density of carbon monoxide (1.164 kg/m 3 at 20 ○C and 101.3 kPa pressure). CO conc =Carbon monoxide concentration of the dilute exhaust sample corrected for background, water vapor, and CO 2 extraction, ppm. E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.029 Where: CO e =Carbon monoxide concentration of the dilute exhaust bag sample volume corrected for water vapor and carbon dioxide extraction, ppm. For flow compensated sample systems, ( CO e ) i is the instantaneous concentration. The following calculation assumes the carbon to hydrogen ratio of the fuel is 1:1.85. As an option the measured actual carbon to hydrogen ratio may be used: CO e =[1^0.01925CO 2e ^0.000323R] CO em Where: CO em =Carbon monoxide concentration of the dilute exhaust sample as measured, ppm. CO 2e =Carbon dioxide concentration of the dilute exhaust bag sample, in percent, if measured. For flow compensated sample systems, ( CO 2e ) i is the instantaneous concentration. For cases where exhaust sampling of CO 2 is not performed, the following approximation is permitted: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.030 a =Average carbon to hydrogen ratio. M 1 =Fuel mass consumed during the test cycle. R =Relative humidity of the dilution air, percent. CO d =Carbon monoxide concentration of the dilution air corrected for water vapor extraction, ppm. CO d =(1^0.000323 R )CO dm Where: CO dm =Carbon monoxide concentration of the dilution air sample as measured, ppm. Note: If a CO instrument which meets the criteria specified in §86.1311&hyph;90 of this chapter is used and the conditioning column has been deleted, CO em must be substituted directly for CO e and CO dm must be substituted directly for CO d . (4) For carbon dioxide equation: CO 2mass =Carbon dioxide emissions, in grams per test mode. Density CO 2 =Density of carbon dioxide is 1.830 kg/m 3 , at 20 ○C and 760 mm Hg pressure. CO 2conc =Carbon dioxide concentration of the dilute exhaust sample corrected for background, in percent. E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.031 Where: CO 2d =Carbon dioxide concentration of the dilution air as measured, in percent. E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.032 (6) KH =Humidity correction factor. For compression-ignition engines: KH =1/[1^0.0182 ( H ^10.71)]. Where: H =Absolute humidity of the engine intake air in grams of water per kilogram of dry air and H =(6.211)R i ×P d )/(P b ^(P d ×R i /100)) Where: R i =Relative humidity of the engine intake air, in percent. P d =Saturated vapor pressure (kPa) at the engine intake air dry bulb temperature. P B =Barometric pressure (kPa). (e) The final reported brake-specific fuel consumption ( BSFC ) shall be computed by use of the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.033 Where: BSFC =brake-specific fuel consumption in grams of fuel per kilowatt-hr (kW-hr) M =mass of fuel in grams, used by the engine during a mode kW-hr=total kilowatts integrated with respect to time for a mode (f) The mass of fuel for the mode is determined from mass fuel flow measurements made during the mode, or from the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.034 Where: M =Mass of fuel, in grams, used by the engine during the mode. G s =Grams of carbon measured during the mode: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.035 R 2 =Grams C in fuel per gram of fuel Where: HC mass =hydrocarbon emissions, in grams for the mode CO 2mass =carbon monoxide emissions, in grams for the mode CO 2mass =carbon dioxide emissions, in grams for the mode a =The atomic hydrogen to carbon ratio of the fuel. §89.425&hyph;96 Particulate adjustment factor. The following equation may be used to adjust the particulate measurement when the test fuel specified in Table 4 of Subpart D of this Part is used: PM adj =PM^[BSFC *0.0917 *(FSF^USLF CA )] Where: PM adj =adjusted measured PM level [g/Kw-hr] PM=measured weighted PM level [g/Kw-hr] BSFC=measured brake specific fuel consumption [G/Kw-hr] FSF=fuel sulfur weight fraction USLF CA =upper sulfur level weight fraction of California specification.
