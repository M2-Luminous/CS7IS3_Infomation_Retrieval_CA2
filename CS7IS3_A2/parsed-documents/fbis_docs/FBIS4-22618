The instructions of the Minfin [Ministry of Finance] and the Gosnalogsluzhba [State Tax Service] still do not facilitate any clarification of the situation. Russian taxpayers learned the price of tax laws long ago. Any of their articles may be "interpreted" by the Gosnalogsluzhba or Minfin in such a way that the initially intended meaning is entirely lost. Some statutes may simply be ignored by the agencies of executive power. This has happened repeatedly. For example, this has been the case with the prohibition on making the standard tax statutes retroactive. However, the edict issued on 27 September 1993 by the RF [Russian Federation] President, "On Improving Work With Foreign Investments," was believed immediately and evaluated as the issuance of a real legal guarantee for the effective implementation of capital investments. The edict specified that newly issued normative statutes regulating the conditions of functioning of foreign and joint enterprises on the territory of Russia shall not apply for a period of 3 years to enterprises which existed at the moment these statutes went into effect. Taxation is one of the significant conditions for the functioning of enterprises, and the question of stability of the tax legislation is a particularly acute one. With the issuance of the edict, the problem, it would seem, has been resolved: On most of the territory of the former USSR, the possibility of planning activity several years in advance has once again emerged. Foreign companies and SP [joint ventures] have undertaken the compilation of long-term programs. However, once again the enterprises have been betrayed by their faith in the fact that the presidential edict is capable of withstanding the onslaught of departmental instructions. In December of last year, routine changes were introduced into the tax system: The rates of a number of taxes were increased, the procedure for filing and payment of taxes was changed, and new payments were introduced. The foreign companies and joint ventures were not overly worried by this event, since they believed themselves (and many still do) protected against any unfavorable innovations in the tax sphere. However, as evidenced by numerous appeals by foreign companies and joint ventures, the local tax inspections maintain that the 3-year benefit on tax relations should not be applied, since "taxes are not related to the conditions of functioning of the enterprises." Since these statements bear a mass character, we may speak of an official position of the Gosnalogsluzhba and Minfin in regard to the edict, "On Improving Work With Foreign Investors." However, this time they have chosen the tactics of omission: In the letter of the Gosnalogsluzhba regarding the procedure for applying the new tax regulations, the 3-year benefit rule is absent. Foreign and joint enterprises have been widely informed about the statutes of the edict and intend to make use of the benefits which it grants. Therefore, many of them continue to pay taxes at the old rates, refuse to pay the newly introduced taxes, etc. The local tax agencies are in a state of confusion. After all, they have not received any official written explanations in regard to the edict. However, if the tax agencies do not follow the statutes of the edict in the future and deem the application of the benefit to be illegal, then financial sanctions will be applied to the enterprises in a compulsory manner. The amounts of these sanctions are considerable, and therefore there is not much reason to hope that the foreign companies and joint ventures will quietly pay the fines and that the actions of the Russian tax agencies will not evoke a huge international repercussion. Which, of course, will have a negative effect on the process of investing funds into the Russian economy.
