Businessmen fess Up. Payolas to the bosses. So they can work. In the south as well as the north. Even after "Clean Hands." And what if one rebels against the blackmail? One quits. Or escapes abroad. That is the astounding result of a survey carried out among young businessmen. Who nevertheless have not lost hope that Di Pietro & Co.... Pino Arlacchi teaches Applied Sociology at the College of Political Sciences, University of Florence, and is considered the leading Italian scholar on organized crime. The research for this article was coordinated, from the standpoint of methodology, by Professor Alberto Marradi of the University of Florence, and was carried out by a team of researchers of the ARS (Association for Social Research) of Florence. The young businessmen of Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] have had the courage to press for a survey of corruption and Mafia criminality--a survey that has long been urged but never carried out, until now, because it would be disturbing, possibly upsetting, to the paunchy and not altogether sound nor transparent body of Italy's industrial capitalism. The survey set out to measure the extent of the bribery system before and after "Clean Hands," assess the damage inflicted by organized crime on productive companies and on the development of southern Italy, and to provide an idea of the depth of penetration of the country's small and medium-sized industries by dirty money. A sector, that is, in which the almost 800 heads of companies who responded to the questionnaire sent to the 7,563 members of the Association of Young Businessmen operate. The survey was based on the assumption that a large sector exists consisting of clean businesses and businessmen who have been damaged by unfair and/or violent competition on the part of dirty and politically protected businesses and businessmen. To the question on the occasional or compulsory practice of payment of bribe money to obtain public contracts prior to the investigation of corruption, 85 percent responded affirmatively. This 85 percent encompasses much of the Italian anomaly in the field of corruption. According to the considered opinion of the company heads, in no other developed Western country are the vast majority of companies compelled to pay bribe money to its public works and services contracting officials on an ongoing regular or occasional basis. Inflation? Blame It on Bribes The cited figure proves homogeneous for the entire national territory in that individual values range from a minimum of 82 percent who responded affirmatively in the north-central regions (Umbria, Tuscany, Marche, Emilia Romagna, and Sardinia), to a maximum of 98 percent of affirmative responses by businessmen residing in the three regions in which organized crime is most deeply rooted (Sicily, Calabria, and Campania). The results of the survey therefore provide a confirmation of evaluations that insist upon the rational and systemic nature of corruption. The differences between North and South, and between "mafiose" zones and "nonmafiose" areas are not such as to justify attributing exclusively to Southern Italy, or to mafia presence, the degrading of relations between the economy and governmental authority. They provide no basis in fact for postulating a division of the country between a supposed clean, productive North, where the government and the enterprises working for it benefit from ethics and behavior typical of "advanced development," and a supposed South pervaded by an outlaw mentality and praxis. The totalizing dimension of the pre-Clean Hands incidence of corruption that emerges from this survey does lead, however, to deductions of a politico-economic nature. When the payment of a sum of money becomes a common practice, a compelling or quasi compelling custom incumbent upon all the businesses in a given sector, it will tend to be considered as a tax and to be transferred to final prices. The businesses that sell public works or services will pad their cost estimates and will request upward revisions in ongoing works projects to cover this "tax." And in the final analysis, the entire cost of those public works, and of the kickbacks and bribes included therein, is borne by the taxpaying citizens. Enter Clean Hands In the case of generalized extortive racketeering--commonplace in Italy, especially in the commercial operations sector--the costs of bribe money translate into price increases and in this case are borne by the consumer-citizen. In both cases, the effect is inflationary and its costs are not borne by the givers or receivers of the bribes, who therefore, for their part, have no great interest in breaking the circuit of solidary "omerta" [the mafia code of silence], or in rebelling. The corruption machine ran smoothly for over a decade with the consensus or support of the partners, until the Milan magistrates intervened. But the magistrates intervened on the basis of concerns other than the rise of the inflation rate. The unraveling of the system at the stitches came about by way of "little episodes" of internal origin into which the action of a third power--the judiciary authority--began to delve and eventually dismantled the gearing of the machine, but not as the result of a collective protest action by the system's entrepreneurial component. The entrepreneurial system itself mounted no opposition whatever, either on principle or in practice, to the praxis of bribery. Out of loyalty to the amoralist and familist tradition of a certain Italian capitalism? In keeping with an economic ethic averse to "protestation?" The point is arguable. The responses to the question on changes in the system of kickbacks after the advent of Clean Hands indicate a situation that is by all means positive, in that there has unquestionably been a change, but by no means certain as to its long-term effects. The entrepreneurs who responded to the question on continued payment of bribe money after the judiciary investigations of corruption are divided as follows: a) 42 percent stated that "the practice has greatly diminished"; b) 40 percent judged that "the practice is slightly less widespread" than before; c) only 5.5 percent considered that the practice "has disappeared"; d) 13 percent deemed that "bribe money continues to be paid as before." The evaluations are clearly cautious, pointing more toward the reality of a transition than of an acquired success with a permanent future. If the responses objectively reflect a factual situation, we find ourselves confronting a serious crisis, in terms of the compactness and cogency of corruption, that could lead to a split of the enterprise system into two sectors: those enterprises that "pay," and those that refuse to pay bribe money because the magistracy's growing pressure will render inoperative any possible retaliation by the government contracting officials. Any illusions as to the coming about of a duality of this nature within the intermediate term are best avoided. The enterprises that "pay" will in any case, sooner or later, end up with a competitive advantage over those that refuse to submit. The extra cost borne by the enterprises that pay will shrink their immediate profits, but this shrinkage will be more than offset by the most-favored-enterprise treatment they will receive in terms of future contracts reserved for them by corrupt contracting officials. The results of the survey relative to the damages and distortions induced by the presence of organized crime in the national economy and individual regional economies present a mixed composition of lights and shadows. While marketplace relations at a few levels have been affected to what is still a minor extent by the criminal investigations, they have been hit in a severe and alarming way at other levels. These are the most sensitive levels, in that they concern investment decisions and the growth of existing enterprises. When Corruption Nullifies the Market To the question regarding constraints on the buying and selling of capital goods and raw materials, the overwhelming majority--87 percent, or 659 in absolute figures--of the entrepreneurs who responded ruled out the presence of constraints of any nature whatever. This proportion drops to 72 percent in the three regions at maximum risk, where 13 percent of the respondents stated that they are bound by constraints stemming from "threats" or the "fear of incurring unpleasant consequences." The ratio is 3.3 percent for the country as a whole. These figures appear to contradict the cataclysmic assessments of the extent of penetration and direct conditioning of the Italian industrial markets by criminal enterprises and by the economic and political power coalitions linked with them. and to indicate the continued existence of abundant and broad-ranging free-market potentialities today in the industrial fabric of the regions most stricken by the mafia pathology. The measurement of the influence exerted by organized crime, and blackmail of a politico-administrative nature, on the bidding for public works contracts, as evaluated by this survey, confirms evaluations obtained by other means. To the question: "Have you ever had to refrain from bidding on a public works contract because of pressures or threats?" 73 percent of the young entrepreneurs who responded stated that they had not. But this "no" consists of a minority of contractors operating in the high-risk regions and a more substantial majority of contractors residing in other regions. In Calabria, Sicily, and Campania, only 42 percent of the respondents stated that they had not been compelled to forgo competitive bidding on a public works contract. All of 23 percent stated that they had abstained because of threats they had received from competitors tied to organized crime, and 35 percent because of constrictive pressures of other nature. Given the close ties or simply the coincidence between Southern Italy's corrupt politics and the mafia powers there, it is not far-fetched to deduce that the latter two figures can be combined. This gives us a total of 58 percent of the heads of small and medium-sized enterprises in Italy's more polluted South being compelled by the force of politico-mafioso intimidation to renounce one of their fundamental rights. The question on compulsory cession of capital shares produced a significant confirmation of the progression of degenerative factors in the economy of broad zones of Southern Italy. Overall, 85 percent of the respondents denied the existence of this pathology in the zones of their respective activities. But the division of the country in this respect emerged very sharply. While 93 percent of the entrepreneurs operating in Lombardy reported absence of the practice of compulsory cession of shares by enterprises, 53 percent of the heads of enterprises in Calabria, Sicily, and Campania reported a massive presence of this pathology there. If the latter figure can be taken as representative of the entire regional business community there, it follows that the presence of capital generated by organized crime or political corruption influences directly the ownership of approximately half the industrial enterprises of three Italian regions, in which 12.6 million people, or approximately one fifth of the Italian population, live. Diffusion of Tainted Capital It is in the capital market that research finds the source of a full-fledged "criminal unification" of the country. To the question on the presence, in the responder's zone of activity, of companies benefiting from the inflow of capital of dubious origin, only 38 percent responded negatively. All of 54 percent of the respondents as a whole stated that "some" enterprises benefit from tainted capital, and 6.4 percent stated that there were many such enterprises. The perecentage of entrepreneurs who affirm the existence of at least some suspicious enterprises in their zone of activity is notably homogeneous. The band of variations around this figure was narrow, ranging from a minimum of 53 percent in the central and northern regions to a maximum of 59 percent in the northwestern regions. The results of this study thus confirm the view that divides the expansion of capital and illicit investments in Italy into two fundamental periods. The first, in which profits, both lawful and unlawful, of the criminal enterprises were transformed into investments and bank deposits in the areas of interest to the criminal groups, provoking an exodus of "clean" enterprises and capital, and a stagnation of Southern Italy's economy, is identifiable with the 1970's. The second period began in the 1980's and is still in progress. It is characterized by an emigration from Southern Italy not only of clean capital, but also of tainted capital in search of exploitable opportunities and camouflage, which are no longer possible in their areas of origin that were degraded and depressed during the preceding decade. It can therefore be stated that some 20 years of expansion of illicit activities in our country have created a situation in which the presence of capital of criminal origin in virtually every geographical zone and economic sector is highly probable. The greatest damage inflicted on southern Italy's economy by the presence of political corruption and organized crime is not the imposition of kickbacks, payment of bribe money, and other forms of graft that distress the heads of industries and translate into blackmail, threats, and damage to dissenters. This is just the most visible and obvious aspect. The greatest damage is that which does not meet the eye. It is expressed in the impeding of business growth, a crippling, "silent" flight of capital from the region, and in the deterring of investment in the region by northern investors. These pathologies represent today perhaps the main obstacles to a takeoff of Southern Italy's economy. Turning to the question on abstention from investment in the entrepreneur's own region because of the dominant criminal activity there, the ratio of resident businessmen who responded affirmatively in the three regions that are traditional mafia strongholds was 27 percent, versus 3 percent for the nation as a whole, and 1 percent for Northern Italy. The discouraging effect on private investment directly attributable to organized crime involves one fourth of the young entrepreneurs in Calabria, Sicily, and Campania. Defeat the Mafia, for Economic Development If the foregoing figures are taken as indicative of the ratio of capital investment being deterred, and if the fact is taken into account that the young entrepreneurs comprise the most dynamic, and the "most resistant to discouragement," sector of the business community, it can be said that the presence of organized crime is responsible for a "shortfall" of a good one third of investments, production, employment, and revenue. In other words, it can be stated that a winning strategy for countering the mafia and corruption could contribute to raising by about one third the fundamental economic variables of the most polluted regions. To the above-indicated dynamics must be added the consequences of the shortfall of investments from outside the economic system of the high-risk zone itself and of Southern Italy as a whole. Between 25 and 26 percent of the entrepreneurs operating in Northern Italy's most industrialized regions reported having decided not to invest "in one or more zones" of the country, specifically owing to the presence of organized crime in the zones of interest.
