The meeting will discuss the conditions which U.S. President Bill Clinton conveyed to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad during their recent meeting in Geneva. The sources said these conditions are: 1. Syria should support the U.S. efforts to fight the current of fundamentalist terrorism in the region by handing over files on the Iranian personalities who support this current, on Iran's role in giving material support for this, and on Iran's present contacts with some Arab personalities to intensify the fundamentalist terrorists' operations. In this regard, the United States has asked Syria to disclose the intricate details of Iranian-Syrian relations. Clinton alleged that the United States has information that Syrian intelligence services have complete files in this connection. 2. Syria should halt the Palestinian factions opposing the peace process and turn over to Israel about 23 Palestinians wanted for committing serious (terrorist) incidents where many Israeli citizens were killed. These individuals are living under the protection of the Syrian regime. 3. Syria should halt all forms of support for the pro-Iranian Hizballah forces in Lebanon and hand over files regarding Hizballah's plans, the main figures behind the terrorist operations, and the Iranian personalities who have direct influence in Iran. 4. Syria should condemn the intifadah in the occupied Arab territories. The sources said there are some differences between the two sides regarding the U.S. conditions. Contacts are underway to narrow these differences and bring about a meeting between the Syrian foreign minister and the U.S. Secretary of State.
