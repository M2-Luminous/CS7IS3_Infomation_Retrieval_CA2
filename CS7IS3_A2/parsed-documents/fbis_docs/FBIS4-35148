Nevertheless, Naranjo reiterated that Jose Maria Figueres' administration is still interested in encouraging a peaceful transition in the Caribbean nation. In statements to the domestic media, the foreign minister noted that most of the countries on the continent want a "democratic Cuba" that can join the OAS, adding: "We believe that a solution to the Cuban crisis must be the product of exchanges and the participation of all parties interested in finding a solution to the problem."
