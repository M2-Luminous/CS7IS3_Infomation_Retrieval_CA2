Over the past decade, large sums of money have been invested in the region and significant achievements have been made in the development of energy sources, transportation, communications, irrigation, education, and other infrastructure construction projects. Tibet has scored significant results in building energy sources. As of end of 1993, the total capacity of electric power stations reached 173,400 kw, capable of generating 399 million kwh of electricity. Now 79 percent of counties and cities and 32 percent of townships are being served with electricity. The construction of the state invested Yangzhuoyong Lake pumping and power generating station, which has a capacity of 112,500 kw is being stepped up. The first phase project for the Nagqu underground heat experimental power station, which is a sino-foreign joint venture, has been completed and put into operation. China's current largest underground heat experimental power station--the Yangbajing Underground Heat Power Station--with a capacity of 24,000 kw has also been put into operation. Construction of power stations in the 19 counties which so far have no electric power is being accelerated. The construction of transportation projects in Tibet is being stepped up. As of now, the total length of highways reaches 22,000 kms. A highway network with Lhasa as the center has been formed in the main, and highways now lead to every county in the region. Tibet's posts and telecommunications facilities have been greatly improved. As of the end of 1993, there were 125 post and telecommunications bureaus and offices, and 24 earth communications stations [tong xin di qiu zhan 6639 0207 0966 3808 4541] had been built. There are 301 long distance telephone lines, and 65 counties and cities now have telephone service with a total of 35,400 telephones. A postal and telecommunications network with Lhasa as the center has been formed. In 1993, the total volume of postal and telecommunications business reached 32.73 million yuan. In the past decade, the average annual growth volume of operation of postal and telecommunications services was 16.8 percent. Capital construction for agricultural production and animal husbandry in Tibet has been further strengthened. As of the end of 1993, more than 20,000 irrigation projects of various sizes have been built. There are 174 water diversion projects and 5,075 small water reservoirs and ponds with a total storage capacity of 350 million cubic meters. There are 129 pumping stations, 174 drinking water projects for people and animals, and 21 dike projects with a total length of 252 kms. The total irrigated area for farmland reached more than 1 million mu, accounting for 30 percent of arable land. The total irrigated area of grassland reached more than 30 million mu, and 4.25 million mu of grassland have been fenced. The comprehensive development for "one river and two streams" has achieved initial results. The construction of grassland, fences, and disaster prevention bases for livestock has produced benefits. Scientific and technological services for agricultural production and animal husbandry have also made new progress. The strategy of giving priority to developing education in Tibet has been implemented. Over the past decade, Tibet has set up a new university, two new technical secondary schools, 13 new middle schools, and 775 new primary schools. At present, the total enrollment of students exceeds 245,000, and 63.2 percent of school-age children in the region are attending school.
