FBIS4-14352 "drnes083_s_94018" FBIS-NES-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Iran Majles To Control Prices of Government Goods, Services Majles To Control Prices of Government Goods, Services LD2804125094 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran First Program Network in Persian 1007 GMT 28 Apr 94 LD2804125094 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran First Program Network Persian BFN [Text] On the basis of a draft bill whose urgency was approved in yesterday's Majles session, any change in the price of goods and services provided by the government will require the approval of the legislature. On the basis of this single article bill, from the date of the approval of the bill, any increase in the prices of goods or services can be implemented only on the basis of the proposal of the Economic Council and the approval of the Islamic Majles. Any price increases that have been announced by the Economic Council or any other source since the start of the current year [starting 21 March 1994] will be null and void. If this bill is approved, the government will also be dutybound to exert precise supervision and control over the prices that have been approved and should take legal measures against those who violate the approved prices. It should be added that on the basis of the internal regulations of the Islamic Majles, the single article draft bill on controlling the prices of goods and services will be discussed and studied out of turn by the specialized [economic] committee, and will be probably debated and ratified by the open session of the Majles within the next 20 days. According to some experts on economic affairs, the ratification of the single bill article regarding the intervention of the legislature in controlling prices will be a way of expanding the scope of decisionmaking on the increase of the prices of goods and services. Consequently, when necessary, any changes in prices will be implemented after a deeper expert discussion and on the basis of realities and needs. This will prevent some illogical decisions that may be taken by some executive officials regarding unprincipled price increases. At the same time, this move to control prices in itself will be regarded as a lever for controlling inflation. It should be noted that the First Development Plan of the country [which concluded 20 March 1994] was drawn up on the basis of a balanced economy. In other words, the prices of government goods and services should have been set at a level which would, at least, cover the cost of the production of those goods and services; so that, on the one hand, by lowering its costs, the government could reduce its financial liabilities and, on the other hand, those revenues [thus saved] could be spent on development projects and investments in infrastructure. Consequently, the consumers should pay an appropriate price for making use of government goods and services, so that the sick economy of the country will be directed toward recovery and its structure will be corrected. During the past five years, in order to implement a balanced policy, economic programs were drawn up in such a way that in the medium term to support the oppressed [poorer classes] the level of cash payments and subsidies would be gradually reduced on a balanced scale so that the consumers could adjust their purchasing abilities with the prices. In the same connection, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani has explained the government policies on a balanced economy, and stressed the need to increase the people's income and purchasing power. He said: There should be a balance between the people's income and expenditure, so that they will need government assistance. Therefore, in the policies of economic equilibrium, hand in hand with correcting the prices of goods and services there should also be an increase in the purchasing power and salaries of vulnerable classes. In the same connection, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the esteemed Leader of the Islamic Revolution, in his 12-point instruction to the government, stressed the need for serious legal support for all the oppressed classes of society in various fields. The esteemed president of the Islamic Republic also described the achievement of social justice as the main target of the Second Development Plan of the country. In any case, under the present conditions when our country is in the process of its economic reconstruction, the legislative and executive powers of the Islamic Republic of Iran are determined to pave the way for the achievement of economic independence and public welfare of the Iranian people.
