I make this statement on the basis of two major events: 1) Asia's economy has grown rapidly. While trying their best to preserve their existing relative interests, Western countries have shifted their attention to the Asia-Pacific region. 2) The sanctions against China by the West have fallen through. China's important position in the world has been further established. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact indicated the withering away of a political and economic bloc and the disappearance of one of the two poles. It represented an "earthquake of a global scale." Immediately after the incidents, almost all countries, including developed and developing countries, reassessed their own strengths and the world situation to discover their positions on this celestial body. While repeatedly bringing pressure to bear on China in an attempt to topple socialist China and to create a "domino effect," the developed countries made greater efforts to start an economic war on a global scale to establish themselves as economic powers in the 21st century, a war which means a keen competition of the overall strengths of the countries involved. Under the new situation, China met the challenge calmly and outmaneuvered the rivals wisely. The development in 1993 proved China's policy decisions and measures were entirely correct. China arrived at a correct understanding of itself. A few years ago some people said that China, the United States, and the Soviet Union constituted a big triangle. The statement sounds reasonable from the political point of view. However, since China has a long way to go to adequately liberate and develop its productive forces and it still ranks behind many countries in terms of economic strength, the triangular relationship cannot be interpreted as a situation of tripartite economic confrontation. According to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic idea, China will not reach the economic level of moderately developed countries until the middle of the 21st century. Even at that time, China's per-capita GNP level will still lag behind. Therefore, in handling the relationship between internal and foreign affairs, China puts emphasis on the former. Namely, China will initially try to succeed in internal affairs by focusing on economic development. China's foreign policy will naturally serve this central task. This does not in any way mean that foreign affairs are not important. On the contrary, the task of carrying out foreign policy becomes more strenuous. To create a favorable international environment for its economic development, China has pursued an omnidirectional diplomacy. China is willing to establish and develop state-to-state relations with any countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, irrespective of their political systems and ideologies. This has enabled China to greatly expand its field of activity as described by the saying: "The wide sea allows the fish to leap about and the vast sky the birds to fly." As a third-world country, China has maintained its traditional friendship with many other third-world countries in the world. While refusing to treat itself as a "leader," China has stressed time and again that it opposes hegemony and that it will never seek hegemony. Such a position wins sympathy and support from the broad masses of people in the third world. China has made unremitting efforts to stabilize the situation in surrounding areas and has firmly pursued a good-neighbor policy toward surrounding countries. It has taken positive steps to solve territorial disputes. For instance, when Indian Prime Minister Rao visited China, the Chinese Government reached a consensus with him on preserving peace and security in the border areas. For those territorial disputes which defy solution for the time being, we proposed that "relevant parties shelve the dispute and join forces to develop the disputed area," thus creating a peaceful environment. A favorable external environment has proved conducive to reform and opening up. After several years of rapid economic growth, China was still able to preserve the favorable economic momentum in 1993. The GNP increased by 13 percent, the foreign trade volume may beat the record figure of $190 billion, and the foreign capital actually absorbed in the January-October period stood at $17.2 billion. With these achievements, China basically changed its position in 1993. Some countries attempted to get China into trouble or to subvert it and regarded the human rights issue as the breakthrough point, but they ran into a stone wall. At the international human rights conference held in March this year, all the proposals against China went down the drain. On the contrary, a "declaration on development rights," which points out that right of development is an inalienable human right and which reflects China's consistent position was adopted by the conference. In the future, some people in some countries will continue to make an issue of human rights, but since their attempts have been seen through, they will not be as overbearing as before. Toward the end of 1993, German Chancellor Kohl visited China. Soon after the visit, President Jiang Zemin met with U.S. President Clinton. These two events show that the West realizes that isolating China will not only put China in trouble, but also jeopardize their interests, with the result that they hastily wound up the sanctions against and the plan to isolate China. President Jiang Zemin's presence at the unofficial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization and his visit to Cuba, Brazil, and Portugal manifested China's enthusiasm for economic cooperation in the Asia- Pacific region, which holds a rosy future. President Jiang Zemin's trip also indicated China has extended its antenna to Western Europe and Latin America. The world could not afford to ignore the existence of China as a political power long ago, and it also cannot afford to ignore China's economic prospects and potential. In the final analysis, state-to-state relationships are based on interests. Western countries cannot develop themselves by turning away from Asia, a huge and attractive market, while China is an important country in this region. American entrepreneurs, who are very sensitive and are optimistic about China, have made arrangements to expand business in China. Likewise, the Asia-Pacific region must develop themselves through intensifying international trade and economic cooperation. China has now further consolidated its foothold in the world because, apart from its political influence, its economy has become an important link in the global economy. Taking advantage of this favorable strategic position, China is now holding high the banner of "peace and development" in the international arena while holding high the banner of reform and opening up in the country and seizing on the favorable opportunity to expand. In 1994 China will introduce a series of major reform measures. As a result, its economy will further converge with the world economy, its economic strength will continue to grow, and its international status will improve, thus enabling it to play a bigger role in the world. The sudden rise of a unified, powerful, and prosperous China in the East represents a historical trend which no force on earth can stop.
