The MSZP's foreign policy program is "not typical of the party" in the sense that it is free of the ambiguities that can be seen in the economic and domestic political ideas. Anyway, the SZDSZ that has been balanced all the time will not change something purely because others also think similarly, Szent-Ivanyi added when he spoke about the party's foreign political program. He said that the idea of European integration, security policy, and politics relating to the neighbors that includes national minority policy as an organic part are the three basic pillars of the program. The SZDSZ has managed to keep the three issues in balance all along. The government's foreign policy can be criticized precisely because the proportions have shifted and the situation of the Hungarians living beyond the border has been given a primary role. It can be said that the government's foreign policy is bad compared to what it could have achieved. Starting from a favorable position, it realized little of the actual possibilities. On the issue of joining Europe, Szent-Ivanyi pointed out that, in the views of his party, rather than setting "magic deadlines," the goals have to be implemented as soon as the country's and the economy's condition facilitate it; haste would only cause harm. For this reason, in his view, the government should not, as a campaign measure, overhastily submit its request to the European Union. In the area of security policy, he emphasized that, in addition to urging foreign guarantees, we mainly have to strengthen our domestic efforts. This proposal does not mean increasing the military force. A balanced and internationally respected attitude, domestic stability, the development of the democratic institutional system, and the improvement of the economy are more important factors. As for the policy concerning the neighboring countries, the SZDSZ expects a slow progress and the basic agreements would only move the processes from their deadlock at the most. These agreements are not products that can be sold and bought; the party clearly states that the borders cannot be changed but this can only be included in agreements together with other guarantees. We must not give up the collective rights of national minorities, but unutilized reserves also exist in the area of individual rights. The elimination of dual taxation, investment protection, new cultural and scientific agreements, and the opening of new border crossing points would increase the confidence of the neighbors. It is generally true that the establishment of a modernized, attractive, democratic, and stable Hungary is a precondition to implementing the concept, Szent-Ivanyi told NEPSZABADSAG. Also speaking to our newspaper, he said that the changes in the foreign affairs staff (which affected about half of the diplomatic staff) often had political motivations. If the SZDSZ came to power, it would only initiate the change of ambassadors in 15 to 20 cases at the most. Talking about integrated foreign representations, Szent-Ivanyi noted that the economic diplomacy tasks of the Ministry for International Economic Relations [NGKM] could be drawn under the authority of foreign affairs, the licensing functions could be transferred to the Industry and Trade Ministry, and the services to the chamber [not sepcified] or the National Federation of Entrepreneurs [VOSZ]. Szent-Ivanyi noted the deficit of the foreign affairs budget which might result in the apparatus becoming unable to function by the end of this year unless a supplementary budget is made.
