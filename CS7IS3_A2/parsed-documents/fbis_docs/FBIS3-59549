The result is a new Institute for Development and Resources in High-Performance Computing (IDRIS), which replaces three previous centres -- CCVR [Vector Computation Center for Research] and CIRCE [Interregional Electronic Computing Center] in Paris, and the Strasbourg Computing Centre. IDRIS was officially opened at the old CIRCE site at the University of Paris-Sud last month. With the development of the RENATER high-speed computer network, it made sense to have just one supercomputing centre, according to Victor Alessandrini, professor of theoretical physics at University of Paris-Sud and director of IDRIS. RENATER offers 35 megabit/s connections in some regions and two megabit/s elsewhere. "The mission from the CNRS", says Alessandrini, "was to develop a centre of excellence and to promote world-class high-performance computing and numerical simulation in all areas of science in France." IDRIS will also be the focus of French involvement in European and international collaborations in high-performance computing and networking. IDRIS's most powerful machine is a Cray C98 with eight processors. The C98 has a peak speed of eight gigaflops (8 x 10 in the ninth power floating point operations per second) and is routinely achieving three gigaflops - making it the most powerful vector supercomputer available to academics in Europe. The Cray has about 1500 users at present and some 40-50 percent of its time goes on climate change modelling, oceanography and other environmental research. Other subjects include quantum chromodynamics, fluid dynamics, quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics simulations of materials and plasma physics. IDRIS plans to buy a massively parallel computer next year with a peak performance around 20 gigaflops and hopes to have teraflop performance (10 in the twelfth power flops) available in about three years. The centre has about 70 staff, including 50 specialists in the use of high-performance computers. Some 15 staff are working on the user interface; another 15 are working on scientific applications and will interact closely with users of the machine. There are also five staff porting existing computer codes to massively parallel machines. Other high-performance computers available to French university scientists include a Connection Machine at the University of Paris with a peak speed of 16 gigaflops, and an IBM 3090 in Montpellier.
