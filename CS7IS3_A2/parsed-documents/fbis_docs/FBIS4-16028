But recent examples set by Russia in helping to bring about a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina have clearly demonstrated to the whole world that it is possible to manage without using or threatening force in political dialogue. So it is extremely distressing that we have witnessed a departure from civilized forms of political dialogue with the air strikes by NATO aircraft in the Gorazde region and have slipped back into methods of force. Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of the International Affairs Committee of the Russian parliament's Federation Council, made these remarks in an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. He is in Strasbourg as part of an Russian Federation Government delegation which is taking part in the work of the latest session here of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly which unites 32 European states.
