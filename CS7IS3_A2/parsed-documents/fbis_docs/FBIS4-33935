The seizure occurred 199 miles east of Cabo Blanco, off Santa Cruz Province, where the Navy detected the "potero," which is how squid fishing boats are known here. The Taiwanese boat obeyed the order to stop and was boarded by a Navy Visiting and Registering contingent. The Argentine Navy released a communique saying that the "Man Wei III" did not have a permit. On deck, in the hold, and in the tunnels [as received] were several metric tons of fresh squid. A recent resolution issued by the Agriculture, Livestock and Fishing Secretariat forbids the fishing of squid south of Parallel 43 30'. The "Parker" is escorting the Taiwanese fishing boat to Port Madryn where it will arrive on the night of 12 June. The appropriate authorities will then take over the investigation.
