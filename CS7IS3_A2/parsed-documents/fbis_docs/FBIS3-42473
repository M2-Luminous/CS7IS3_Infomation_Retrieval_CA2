Graduated in 1968 from the Riga Command Engineer School. He served in the Strategic Missile Troops for more than 13 years. He worked his way up from gun crew member to missile regiment commander. He graduated from the F.E. Dzerzhinskiy Military Academy Command Faculty. In 1984, after completing postgraduate studies by correspondence he submitted his dissertation for the degree of Candidate of Military Sciences. From 1985 he worked in the Armed Forces General Staff Center of Operational-Strategic Research. After graduating in 1990 from the General Staff Military Academy he became Senior Tutor at the Department of Strategy and a Senior Lecturer. Since June 1992 he has been Chief of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Directorate for Military Organizational Development and Reforms. He holds the rank of Lieutenant-General. [Falichev] Gennadiy Dmitriyevich, the Directorate of Military Organizational Development and Reforms which you head was one of the first directorates set up in the Russia Ministry of Defense, and it was there at the very beginning of the elaboration of the Concept of the Russian Armed Forces' Organizational Development. Evidently this is why interest in the directorate, and in you personally, is so great. [Ivanov] Yes, the Directorate's main task is to develop and validate conceptual theses in various spheres of military organizational development. The adoption of decisions on the practical implementation of these theses is the prerogative of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Defense Collegium, and sometimes the supreme organs of state power also. Public interest in us is indeed high. Only I would say that the interest is not in the Directorate but in the Armed Forces, in the processes taking place in the Army, in army reform. Our positions have frequently been explained to journalists. There are articles in the newspapers and magazines which have covered the progress of the Russian Armed Forces' organizational development, the creation of its legislative fundamentals, and the results of military cooperation in the framework of the CIS -- in other words, the questions which come under our directorate's jurisdiction. [Falichev] The Russian Armed Forces will very soon be two years old, and evidently it is possible to do some summing up. [Ivanov] The main result of Defense Ministry activity in this period is the fact that the Russian Federation right now has its own Armed Forces, which are disciplined and capable of performing the tasks assigned to them. Now let us recall where it all actually began. Despite the fact that, in line with the President's 1992 decree, a significant proportion of the troop groupings of the former USSR became part of the Russian Armed Forces, they did not constitute an integrated military organism. The existing troop command and control and material/technical supply systems were disrupted; there was virtually no military infrastructure on Russia's European territory.... These were the conditions in which our Armed Forces were set up and in which the foundations for maintaining Russia's military security were laid. The importance and complexity of this problem is shown by, for example, the fact that even in the first three months of the Russian Armed Forces' existence the concept of their organizational development was examined at two sessions of the Security Council. The changes in the military-political situation and Russia's geostrategic position and the reduction in the size of the Armed Forces necessitated the elaboration of new approaches to the organization of troops. Today it is no longer expedient to have troops all along the border, as was the case before. The principle of mobile defense is the cornerstone of the reform of force groupings. This principle posits the existence of small but sufficiently strong forces that are ready for effective use wherever a real threat to Russian security arises. The Ministry of Defense's proposals for the combat strength, structure, and size of the Armed Forces and its approaches to the location of force groupings were approved by the president and formally expressed as the Concept for the Organizational Development of the Armed Forces and the corresponding plans and programs which are currently being implemented. New force groupings are being set up and the previously existing ones strengthened; this applies first and foremost to the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts. The number of fully staffed, combat-effective combined formations and units has been increased through a drastic reduction of the number of under-strength combined formations and units. The creation of Mobile Forces has begun. The transition to a mixed system of recruitment is being implemented. The system of military education has been restored, and reform in this sphere has begun. At the same time the Armed Forces are performing a number of other tasks. One of the most important is the phased withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of other states. In 1993 alone more than 100,000 servicemen, more than 5,000 units of armored equipment and artillery systems, and around 700 airplanes and helicopters were withdrawn. This year the withdrawal of troops will be largely completed. Everyone knows that our troops are performing peacekeeping functions in accordance with Russia's international commitments. The social problems of servicemen and their families are being resolved. All this is the result of the very considerable efforts of the whole Army. What was formerly elaborated and implemented over many years has taken the newly formed Russian Armed Forces not quite two full years. [Falichev] Do you think that the charges made by certain newspapers that the doctrine appeared too late are just? [Ivanov] Elaboration of the doctrine began from the moment the decision to form the Russian Armed Forces was made, that is to say from May 1992. An interdepartmental commission was formed under the Security Council to create this doctrine, and we took the most active part in its work, in conjunction with other General Staff and Ministry of Defense structures. All our plans were presented to the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Defense Collegium, and the chief of the General Staff, all of whom made several amendments and criticisms. I should remark that representatives of many state structures, including the military, worked on the doctrine. The document that was adopted is the fruit of collective efforts. Was the doctrine too long emerging? I wish to explain that several of its provisions were reflected in the very first presidential edicts on the formation of the Russian Army. Subsequently, military questions were frequently examined at sessions of the Security Council and the government and in organs of the representative power. The main provisions of the Russian Federation's military doctrine, adopted in November 1993, above all constitute a composite document incorporating military-political, strictly military, and military-technical aspects of ensuring the state's defense capability. [Falichev] The doctrine treats the possibility of employing the Armed Forces within Russian Federation territory to suppress armed conflicts. In some sections of the mass media the Armed Forces are described as policing forces, no less. Could you clarify this? [Ivanov] Yes, the Army, as an attribute of the state, is designed above all to defend it from external aggression. But in certain circumstances danger to state institutions can come from within. Why then should the Army remain on the sidelines in such a situation? In developed democratic countries, for example in the United States, Germany, Britain, and France, the possibility and necessity of employing Armed Forces to safeguard internal security are legislatively enshrined. The difference is only in the formulas, which take account of the specific features of those states. I should stress that, first, the Russian Army is allocated only an auxiliary role in the performance of internal functions, since the accent in suppressing conflict is mainly on the Russian Federation's internal troops and security forces. Second, the Army is mainly intended to localize the area of conflict. Thus the use of the Armed Forces to safeguard internal state security is strictly limited. The question of the Army's direct participation in a conflict can only arise in the event that the internal troops and security forces in the crisis zone are insufficient to defend the interests of the state, Russian citizens, and society in that region. [Falichev] Today the process of creating a military doctrine is behind us. The main avenues of the organizational development of the Armed Forces in the long term have also been defined. Does this mean that your directorate will be left with no work to do? [Ivanov] I will reveal to you the directorate's "secret" work plan for 1994. It envisages: the elaboration of conceptual proposals for bringing previously adopted laws into line with the Constitution and the fundamental provisions of the Russian Federation's military doctrine; the preparation of drafts of essential new laws in the sphere of defense and of draft normative-legal acts providing for their realization; the development of a Concept of Armed Forces Military Law Reform; the elaboration of approaches to ensure the realization of the Treaty on the Collective Security of CIS Member Countries. Much needs to be done in the organizational development of the Armed Forces also. We are taking part in the elaboration of options for the structure of the Armed Forces in the period after 1995. I stress, options, so that they can be submitted for discussion. A whole range of scientific research work is being carried out to validate the prospects for the organizational development of the Armed Forces. But there is a subtle point here. Each branch of the Armed Forces will probably envisage the existence of its structures in their former capacity and in the long term. But a narrow departmental approach must be avoided. And this is not easily done. As for the lack of competence of which we are accused, let me show you by way of example a selection of the directorate's cadres. Of the 45 staff members three are doctors of sciences, 14 are candidates, and 10 have academic titles. People serving in the directorate mostly possess a wide experience of working in the troops, the General Staff, and the staffs of branches of the Armed Forces. I assign to the directorate's "gold fund" the consultants and specialists among the civilian personnel and people who have served in the forces for more than 30-35 years in leading positions of the Ministry of Defense structures. Judge for yourself whether we have knowledge, experience, and professionalism. [Falichev] Don't you have too many tasks and commitments, Gennadiy Dmitriyevich? This way you could become a ministry within a ministry, subsuming other structures... [Ivanov] I think that that is an "outsider's" point of view. We have already read comments to that effect.... I believe that our directorate is only a part of a complex machine whose name is the Ministry of Defense. Everything that is created here is a common product, and that is all. [Falichev] Gennadiy Dmitriyevich, I cannot help asking you about articles which have appeared in recent times. They concern the defense minister's inner circle. What do you feel about them? [Ivanov] I believe that such publications pursue only one goal -- to compromise the country's military policy, the Army, and the Defense Ministry leadership. If you analyze the articles on this topic, you will easily be convinced that they bear a self-serving character and appear at times when important events are taking place in the country and in society: the referendum, the elections.... Typically the authors of these articles always refer to various mythical sources of information, trying to hide their own uninformed opinions and elementary ignorance in military questions. Let us leave these articles to the consciences of the authors, who either do not understand or, on the contrary, understand only too well that the Army is one of the few state institutions which, in this highly difficult period, are guarantors of stability. As for the defense minister's inner circle, you will agree with the following: Any leader comes with his own team, relying above all on those people he knows well. This is a worldwide standard, a generally accepted practice, and there is nothing surprising in the fact that there are such people in the minister's entourage.
