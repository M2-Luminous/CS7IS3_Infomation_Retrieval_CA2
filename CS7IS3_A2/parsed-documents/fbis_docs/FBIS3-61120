Waving it before the nose of the man in the street, the government uttered a tirade about the prompt stabilization of the economic situation in the country and the introduction of a new monetary unit which would be capable of real conversion. It remains a rhetorical question whether this is possible given hyperinflation, a 13.3-percent drop in production, and other economic "joys." As Minister of the Economy R. Shpek hinted, at a minimum, equilibrium should be restored at the macrolevel and a stabilization fund of the new monetary unit should be established in order to introduce the hryvnya properly. According to data from experts, $2-3 billion will be needed to this end. Meanwhile, the National Bank of Ukraine does not have such funds, as V. Yushchenko, its chairman of the board, testifies. The 10 percent of foreign exchange sold to the state on a compulsory basis which is called upon to generate this fund will hardly be able to serve as even a feeble prop for the hryvnya. However, this does not at all mean that the public release of the Ukrainian currency is far away. According to a report from Deputy Prime Minister V. Landyk, this will happen after New Year's day. As V. Yushchenko specified, "on one of the Thursdays." In all of this, as recently as a few weeks ago, it was planned to count on the cost of one hryvnya coming to 1,000 karbovantsy. Now the hryvnya is valued at 10,000. This multiple will change as time goes by, and it will hardly change downward. For now, the economy of Ukraine continues to exist in the environment of a dual-rate policy. One of the rates will be established on the exchange where 4 to 7 percent of the foreign-exchange proceeds of Ukraine will be sold. The second, official exchange rate will be set a day later at a meeting of the tender committee consisting of the representatives of ministries and headed by V. Landyk. This committee will decide who to give or not to give the foreign exchange to, having compiled a list of enterprises and high-priority facilities that need it. At present, according to the committee's calculations, the exchange rate of the dollar comes to 12,600 karbovantsy whereas by the end of the year it will not be higher than 25,000 karbovantsy. The chief of the committee observed: "Everything will depend on our work and on the issuance of inflationary karbovantsy; after all, our rate is no longer fixed but floating." However, despite more favorable currency regulation, many enterprises are getting ready to go bankrupt before the introduction of the hryvnya. Their number has already been calculated by the Cabinet of Ministers. In the event of a sharp increase in unemployment, which is called the "period of plummeting," the Cabinet of Ministers confirmed a program of public works which calls for the use of funds from the budget (in order to have something with which to occupy the people who have lost their jobs). However, this is not a mandatory stage on the path toward reforms. The streamlining of enterprises will be conducted which, in the opinion of the government, may solve their problems. The rest of the salutary measures of the government fit within a program for urgent measures to overcome hyperinflation in Ukraine which has been adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers. According to the program, in the future our reforms will balance the full freedom of the market and administrative regulation, advancing along the path of "strictly disciplined market relations." However, even if we succeed in avoiding a new cycle of inflation owing to these measures, they are hardly adequate to completely prepare the Ukrainian scene for the appearance of a new national currency. At a minimum, a certain sustenance is required to ensure the viability of this currency--a state loan and liberalization of foreign economic relations. While the National Bank of Ukraine, together with a group of specialists, is preparing to issue bonds, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, in its turn, is trying to expand foreign trade, although these measures could hardly be called complete liberalization. While export duties are canceled, a system of quotas remains. Import restrictions are introduced. The "go-ahead" will mainly be given to raw materials imported to the country. Be that as it may, in the opinion of experts Ukraine so far lacks appropriate funds for the introduction of the hryvnya. In turn, the government does not venture to seek assistance from international organizations--the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In the words of government representatives, "as a member of the fund, we may demand support from it. However, we will not ask." This is a rational thought: In the opinion of D. Kaufman, the representative of the World Bank in Ukraine, the introduction of the hryvnya under current conditions makes no sense and is capable of bringing about not only its depreciation but also the complete economic collapse of Ukraine. Domestic experts foretell the same fate of the hryvnya. However, we should hardly expect the government to give up its boldly planned hryvnya-step. As a deputy prime minister said on one occasion, "We will proceed to take measures so as to work in a market environment while simultaneously continuing our policy." We are left hoping for a delay. Otherwise, the unviable Ukrainian currency will be introduced with a move of the imperious baton on a not-so-remote Thursday. It will kick in then--when pigs fly.
