Was this topic placed on the agenda? [Basindwah] At this session the council was informed that some Arab states that have contributed forces to the peacekeeping troops in Somalia intend to withdraw their forces. Naturally, if the Somalis agree among themselves and engage in a quiet and objective dialogue, they will not need forces to safeguard their security and stability. It seems that the existing situation in Somalia will not continue. Somalia will inevitably emerge from its current crisis, God willing. [Hijazi] Yemen is a member of the Arab League. Yemen's security is part of Arab national security. How can Yemen overcome its domestic crisis and what are the latest developments in this crisis? [Basindwah] Thank you for your question. On this occasion I would like to make it clear that the situation in Yemen is now better than before. The cabinet convened in Aden on Wednesday. It reconvened in Aden on Sunday. The cabinet is expected to meet in Ta'izz tomorrow. The Presidential Council will meet in Sanaa tomorrow. We hope all constitutional establishments will resume their work in Sanaa within one month. Naturally, if what has happened in Yemen had happened in another Arab country or another developing country, civil war would have broken out. Despite the passage of seven months since the crisis began, we Yemenis have not been dragged into a civil war or ferocious infighting. This proves that despite our differences and disputes, we have been able to steady our nerves and apply political pressure on each other without reaching the level of a civil war.
