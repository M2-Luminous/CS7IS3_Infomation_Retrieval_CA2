FR940628-0-00025 FR940628-0-00017 Repayment Period Comments : Some commenters stated that they understood that the Secretary had agreed during the negotiated rulemaking process to permit a 13-year repayment schedule to be established for a borrower who chooses to repay a loan under an income-sensitive repayment schedule. The commenters also suggested that the definition be revised to incorporate the 10-year repayment requirement for variable rate interest loans. The commenters suggested that the 10-year repayment period be extended in the case of an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. The commenters also pointed out that during negotiated rulemaking, the Department agreed that in the case of the PLUS and SLS loans with a variable rate, the lender could use the rate at the time the loan entered repayment for purposes of establishing the initial repayment period. Discussion : During the negotiations the Secretary repeatedly made it clear that he had no authority to extend the 10-year repayment period provided by statute. The Secretary did agree to authorize a three-year forbearance period in the case of an income-sensitive repayment schedule and agreed to allow forbearance for a period of up to one year in the case of a variable interest rate loan or graduated repayment schedule. The Secretary noted that these extensions have the practical effect of extending the repayment period to eleven or thirteen years. The Secretary is developing final regulations to the NPRM published on March 24, 1994 that addresses extending the period of forbearance in cases where the repayment schedule causes the extension of the maximum repayment term of the loan. The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a lender should use the variable interest rate at the time the loan entered repayment for purposes of establishing the initial repayment period. If the repayment schedule leads to balloon payments or increased payments, and the borrower is unable to make those payments, the lender may grant forbearance, which is excluded from the 10-year period. Changes : None. Comments : A few commenters suggested that the Secretary revise the definition of repayment period to include a cross-reference to §682.209(d), which requires that the calculation of the repayment period on the loans included in a PLUS or SLS combined repayment schedule be based on the date entered repayment of the most recent included loan. Discussion : The Secretary does not agree that there should be a cross-reference to §682.209(d). The definition of repayment reflects statutory requirements. The provisions in §682.209(d) govern specific servicing adjustments necessary in a combined repayment situation and do not modify the basic statutory definition. Changes : None. Comments : Some commenters suggested that the definition of repayment period for SLS be revised to incorporate the borrower's option to delay repayment for a period consistent with the grace period in the Stafford Loan Program. The commenters noted that it should be clear that the delay in the repayment of an SLS is not a period of deferment or forbearance and, as such, special documentation is not required. The commenters also suggested that, since §682.202(c) permits capitalization during grace periods if provided for in the promissory note (and the addendum and common applications provided for this capitalization), the Secretary should clarify that the lender may capitalize interest during this period. Discussion : The Secretary agrees with the commenters. Changes : The Secretary has revised the definition of repayment period to reflect the borrower's option in the SLS program to delay repayment for a period consistent with the grace period in the Stafford Loan Program. This change is consistent with the change made in §682.102(e)(3) by the technical corrections. The regulations have also been revised to clarify that the lender may capitalize interest during this period. Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements Comments : While a number of commenters supported a uniform standard for determining ``satisfactory repayment arrangements'' for defaulted borrowers, many commenters objected to the use of the proposed uniform standard for all purposes, including reinstatement of Title IV eligibility for defaulted borrowers, rehabilitation of defaulted student loans, and consolidation of defaulted student loans. The commenters believed that use of the proposed standardized definition to qualify a borrower for rehabilitation and consolidation is not in the FFEL Program's best interest. Although the commenters supported a standard definition of the term ``satisfactory repayment arrangements'', they did not view the proposed definition as adequate. Commenters believed that it did not adequately recognize the increase in payments once the loan has been rehabilitated or consolidated and that it did not provide for more lenient treatment based on the borrower's individual circumstances. Discussion : The Secretary notes that for purposes of rehabilitation and reinstatement of borrower eligibility, the statutory language does not provide flexibility in establishing the number of payments to regain eligibility or rehabilitate a defaulted loan. In regard to Consolidation loans, the 1993 Technical Amendments amended section 428C of the HEA to refer to ``arrangements satisfactory to the holder.'' The Secretary does not believe that this language was intended to conflict with the statutory requirement in section 432 of the HEA that common procedures be established or the need to ensure that similarly situated borrowers be treated fairly. In light of these considerations and the other comments received on this provision, the Secretary has determined that three consecutive monthly payments will be required for a borrower to consolidate a defaulted loan. The Secretary believes the making of three consecutive monthly payments would allow a borrower to initiate loan consolidation and add the defaulted loan to the consolidation loan within the 180-day provision provided under section 428C(a)(3)(b)(II) of the HEA.
