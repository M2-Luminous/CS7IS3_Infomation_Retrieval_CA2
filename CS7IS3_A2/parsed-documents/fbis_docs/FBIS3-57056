Borovskaya; place and date not given: "It Is Easier To Win in Elections With Numbers; as Well as in Life"] [Text] [Borovskaya] To begin with, I would like to congratulate you on the occasion of being elected a deputy to the Council of the Federation. [Matochkin] Thank you. [Borovskaya] How do you assess the results of the elections to the Council of the Federation in our oblast? [Matochkin] The situation in the Kaliningrad Oblast is similar to that in Russia. However, we should study this situation, make conclusions, and weigh our mistakes. The distribution of political forces during the elections in Kaliningrad Oblast is not so gloomy. In my opinion, despite a high percentage of voters who had supported Zhirinovskiy, the majority of our people favor reforms. The majority of the population have voted for democrats. They number some 75 percent of the entire electorate. [Borovskaya] How can you explain why Kaliningrad citizens -- despite all the complexities of our life -- traditionally support democratic trends? [Matochkin] I would not speak about our democratic traditions. If you remember, during the presidential elections our citizens voted not for Yeltsin but for Zhirinovskiy? However, after August 1991, public opinion began to change. That means that reforms began to work. The results of the April referendum in 1993, as well as the December elections in 1993 proved this change. [Borovskaya] Maybe our geopolitical localization is a factor.... Kaliningrad citizens see how the surrounding world is living, they believe that their life cannot be worse. Maybe this factor differentiates us from outlying Russian provinces? [Matochkin] In my opinion, you are right. In fact, we see how people in other states, where radical reforms are implemented, live. This affects the state of mind, gives the impression of the irreversibility of changes. [Borovskaya] Before the elections, you were hesitant either to run in the elections or to quit this idea. You do not regret your decision.... [Matochkin] I am used to working with numbers. I am not an emotional person. Speaking sincerely, we -- the heads of the local administration -- have found ourselves in a dubious situation. If, according to the Constitution, only one representative of legislative and executive branches could run in the elections, how should the acting leaders of the administration behave? If the electorate does not elect me, how can I remain in the same position? Yes, I was hesitant. I understood that I was taking risks, and some of my colleagues persuaded me not to participate in the elections. Therefore, I studied the situation through poll results. When in the last decade of the elections I understood what category of population supports me, I felt more confident. I understood that I had a moral right to represent our oblast in the new Russian legislature. [Borovskaya] I have heard that your people had facilitated your elections by neutralizing your opponent Leonid Gorbenko and by pressing our Duma Deputy Yuriy Voyevoda.... [Matochkin] From the start, we -- Leonid Gorbenko and I -- were in tandem. At that time, Shumeyko was not yet running in the elections and Gorbenko's rating was high. Over the last decade, everything changed. However, Leonid Gorbenko matched this situation perfectly well, and I had no reason to put him out of the elections. On 7 December, I met with him and discussed the situation. All of a sudden, I received a phone call informing me that he had withdrawn his candidacy. It was a surprise to me. He had destroyed the planned situation. We knew who would receive his votes. This turn of events was undesirable and sudden. I did not authorize anyone to talk to Leonid Gorbenko and if someone has taken the initiative, this is another case. In addition, I did not ask anyone to persuade Yuriy Voyevoda to withdraw his candidacy in exchange for my chair in the local administration. It is nonsense. How can you appoint an officer on active duty to a civil position? [Borovskaya] That is clear. What about Shumeyko? We elected him according to his official post. We required a person in the government who could patronize the entire oblast. However, he can currently head the Council of the Federation. What will the oblast get from his election? [Matochkin] He would be of greater use to us if he became a member of the government. However, if he becomes the chairman of the Council of the Federation, he could aid us in resolving the status of our oblast. [Borovskaya] In my mind, we owe the rapid adoption of the edict "On Kaliningrad Oblast" to Shumeyko. Does this edict summarize our achievements in this sphere? [Matochkin] Yes. Despite the fact that the edict has no word combination "free trade zone," it contains elements of "free trade zone" regulations, in particular, the lifting of export-import duty limitations and the introduction of tax breaks. [Borovskaya] This edict has come into force from the moment it was signed, has it not? Is it currently being implemented? [Matochkin] Yes, the edict has come into force. However, the mechanism for its implementation has not yet been developed. For example, what about customs duties? The value-added tax has been lifted, however, there are no regulations on how it should be lifted. [Borovskaya] Who develops this mechanism: Moscow or Kaliningrad? [Matochkin] All the documents are being drafted here. Later, they are sent to Moscow. We have to do a lot of work. For example, the issue of earmarking a tax credit for investments. What documents are required, who issues this credit, and so on. Such questions are arising on each and every issue. Each paragraph should be thoroughly developed, and the initiative is always in our hands. How has the federal program for development of Kaliningrad Oblast appeared? I met with Chernomyrdin and said that we badly needed such a program. The Economy Ministry has allocated 170 million rubles to its draft. Researchers from the Central Research Institute for Economic Issues, who had been charged with drafting this program, have already visited Kaliningrad. By the end of March 1994, we should present this draft program to the government. [Borovskaya] What does this program give Kaliningrad? [Matochkin] We want to provide centralized financing to the sites that are of all-Russian importance, such as airports, seaports.... [Borovskaya] Under the former Supreme Soviet, attempts to receive our "own" law were enviously met by the representatives of other regions. Similar people will come to the Federal Duma.... [Matochkin] We hope for the wisdom of the new Duma. We are going to explain our position. Currently, we are working on holding an international forum of Baltic states. It will be held in March in Sopot [Poland]. We invite representatives of all the oblasts of the North-West region and Central Russia to participate in this forum. [Borovskaya] However, if your explanations do not help, what will happen then? [Matochkin] Then, we will hold a referendum in Kaliningrad. The Council of the Federation will have to consider the viewpoint of the Federation. However, I am not a pessimist. Not a single initiative was left without the support of the president and the government. Deputies will debate this issue but the issue should be positively resolved. [Borovskaya] Does this edict give our free trade zone any advantages before the other free trade zones of Russia? [Matochkin] Are there any other zones? In the opinion of the international community, there are two such zones in Russia -- in Kaliningrad and Nakhodka. We are in a more advantageous position than Nakhodka is. However, it has more natural resources and a larger territory. We have a bigger foreign investment sector -- 9.5 percent of the total sum of Russian foreign investments. Our ports are processing 4.5 million tonnes of freight (St. Petersburg -- 15-20 tonnes of freight). We can increase this figure to 10 million tonnes, and our final goal is to process 30-40 million tonnes of freight. [Borovskaya] Recently, Pavel Globa [famous CIS astrologist] has published his terrible prognosis of our near and distant future. What are your predictions at the beginning of the new year? [Matochkin] I am not an opponent of Globa. Each of us has his own profession and earns money the way he can. However, we should become realists: If we begin to consider modern trends in the development of production, the tempos of collapse will decrease. I foresee the lowest critical level in 1994-95. We will not have worse times than we have already lived through. At the same time, two menacing specters are currently alarming me -- the rise of unemployment and the bankruptcy of enterprises. We should take some measures, in particular, to protect small- and medium-size business which must create new jobs for the unemployed. We are establishing a fund to protect these small- and medium-size businesses so that people are able to get credits for building their own workshops. However, bankruptcy is not as alarming; it just means changing the owner. By the way, I have data showing that Kaliningrad citizens not only look at consumer goods in our shops but they buy them. In nine positions out of 20, Kaliningrad consumption indexes are higher in 1993 than in 1992. It is important not to frighten ourselves with various troubles. Then our life will become better. This is my New Year wish.
