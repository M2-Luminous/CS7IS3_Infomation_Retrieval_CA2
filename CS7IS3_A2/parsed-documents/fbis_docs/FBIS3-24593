V. Polyakov, N. Ye. Dmitriyev, Arctic and Antarctic Scientific Research Institute; UDC 551.466.7.001.572(268)] [Abstract] This is the first of two articles. Mathematical modeling with a three-dimensional nonstationary baroclinic model with a free surface is used to reproduce the three-dimensional structure of the M[.sup]2[/] tidal wave in he barotropic Arctic Ocean. The second article describes the results of numerical experiments studying the M[.sup]2[/] tidal wave in a stratified Arctic Ocean. Here, it is found that the oscillations of the level correspond to generally held ideas about the tidal wave dynamics of the Arctic Ocean level. The main mechanism responsible for the structure of the field of the M[.sup]2[/] level in the Arctic Ocean is resonant adjustment of level oscillations to morphometric features of the basin. Deep ocean is characterized by weak, vertically homogeneous currents. Vertical motions in the upper layers of the ocean depend on the dynamics of the free surface. As depth increases, the bottom relief becomes decisive for the vertical component of the tidal wave current. A nonperiodic component is found in the barotropic tidal wave current. The effect of the boundary between a continental shelf and deep ocean on currents is outlined. Figures 7; references 22: 6 Russian, 16 Western.
