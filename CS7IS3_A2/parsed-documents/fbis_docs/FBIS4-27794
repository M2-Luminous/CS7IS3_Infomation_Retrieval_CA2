Such action is being taken because of banks' inevitable dependence on profits from bond trading for a while even after establishment of subsidiaries and the prerequisite to secure a comprehensive customer base in order to ensure success in underwriting, which the banks see as a potentially lucrative area. Moves to strengthen the bond sales force are being taken aggressively by expanding formerly understaffed sales staff handling government-secured bonds and local government bonds and aggressively pursuing sales to small and midsized regional financial institutions. A bond trader at a major securities firm testifies, "Formerly, most city banks would not consider approaching small and midsized financial institutions, but recently they have gone on a sales offensive and have succeeded in taking away our clients." City banks have already embarked on the steady building of an operating base even before establishing securities subsidiaries. Securities subsidiaries will be able to handle trading in bonds such as corporate bonds, Euroyen bonds, and interest-bearing financial institution bonds, which are not handled by banks. However, these ordinary bonds, unlike government bonds, are issued in small quantities and are thinly traded and city banks will sell most of these bonds to small and midsized regional financial institutions with whom they had only limited dealings in the past. The view is widespread that Nomura Securities is strong in underwriting services because it has a "strong sales force." For city bank securities subsidiaries without a network of branches, the key to enhancing profits from bond trading and effective performance of underwriting services will depend on how well they can attract and process buy and sell orders from clients. That being the case, city banks which had previously emphasized government bonds and large investor accounts are now emphasizing expansion of their sales forces to handle government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds. At the end of November 1993, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank led other banks in using computer terminals to provide the bid and ask price on government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds. Such information is now being made available on 11 issues for both central government agency and local government bonds. The bank intends to expand its client base by trading in government agency and local government bonds and to accumulate knowledge on how to serve as market maker for future corporate bond issues and manage bond inventories on ordinary bonds that are thinly traded. The actions being taken by the bank, according to trading sources, are motivated by "opportunities for larger profits" with government agency and local government bonds where the spread between bid and ask prices is wider, in comparison with government bonds where spreads are limited. Sources at Mitsubishi Bank comment, "Trading in government agency and local government bonds is visibly increasing as transactions in the over-the-counter market are taking place in blocks of tens of billions of yen." Sales of government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds which were underwritten in the past year by the investment accounts department are being sold aggressively, while privately placed local government bonds which cannot be handled by banks' product accounts departments are being purchased from investment accounts departments of regional banks and resold to life insurance and trusts. It is a case where increased use of such transaction conduits are proving to be effective. Noticeable is the success being registered in acquiring new clients in regional areas by building a sales force and providing carefully tailored services. In April 1993, Sakura Bank launched "Operation Roller" staffed by three specialists who approached local banks, second local banks, trust banks, credit associations, and agricultural cooperatives on a concentrated basis to sell long-term government bonds, government agency and local government bonds, and privately placed local government bonds. Bond operations were expanded by the team to all parts of Japan from Hokkaido to Okinawa into areas other than prefectural government seats where bond sales had previously never been made. Sources in the securities sales department of Sakura Bank, conceptualizing the establishment of securities subsidiaries, express hope in "making even modest inroads relative to potential corporate bond clients to whom it can sell via the telephone." If sole dependence is focused on public bonds, there will be a limit to acquisition of new clients. In the competitive bidding for 10-year long-term government bonds, Fuji Bank won bids in fiscal year 1993 for 380 billion yen, three times that of the previous year, with the objective of increasing clients through the sale of government bonds. However, the bank decided that more measures had to be taken and for two years has been dispatching personnel to Daito Securities, an affiliate. Currently, over 10 personnel are engaged in sales of corporate and foreign bonds and are fully dedicated to making preparations for future growth. It appears that derivatives such as options and swaps which are highly profitable will become one link in building up the sales force. The investment accounts department of Sanwa Bank began research in arbitrage trading involving derivatives composed of an assortment of underlying products such as bonds and stocks and in April formed a team that specializes in such trading. In the case of Sanwa Bank, according to sources in its trading department, it has the objective of "using the current period to accumulate knowledge on how to respond to the diversification and sophistication needs of clients with a view toward expanding future operations." However, sources at major securities firms which must deal with the new competition state, "At present, the sales capabilities of city banks pose no threat." Banks' securities subsidiaries face major restrictions in terms of personnel, branch networks, and securities that they can handle, such as with stocks, thus placing them at a definite disadvantage to major securities firms. A leading city bank official states that steady efforts being made by city banks to launch city banks' securities subsidiaries are a "necessary step toward ensuring the profitability of the subsidiaries," and it appears that they have not been afforded the best of operating conditions.
