He said: "Yes, we agree that a problem does not exist at the present time. However, we wish to consider the future on matters related to the transnational waters. Our producers and farmers wish to see a document on that vital matter, which concerns their future..." The views al-Shar' conveyed merely reiterated Syria's position. Recalling that Turkish statesmen signed protocols calling for "an agreement between the two countries on transnational waters," al- Shar' urged that the two sides move to hold talks on the matter. Meanwhile, he asked: "Why have Turkish officials failed to fulfill their promises?" Likewise, Hikmet Cetin's and Tansu Ciller's views reiterated Turkey's position. For example, Cetin responded: "We do not wish to create a problem for Syria on the question of transnational waters. However, considering the anxiety of our press, parliament, and people about acts of terrorism and their conviction that Syria supports terrorist activities, we cannot conclude an agreement with your country at the present time. This state of affairs must be removed. No anxiety must exist over security. Under the existing conditions, concluding an agreement on transnational waters may be interpreted as a step linked with terrorist activities. That would be wrong. A problem does not exist on the supply of transnational waters at the present time. Why do you not agree to cooperate to remove our anxiety about terrorist activities?..." The Syrian foreign minister responded: "Syria does not support terrorist activities against Turkey. That is impossible. Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] camps do not exist in the al-Biqa' Valley. We have conferred with Lebanese officials on that matter. Not a single camp remains. Furthermore, PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is not in Syria." An interesting point was that al-Shar' went as far as saying that "Abdullah Ocalan has several European passports and is able to use them to freely travel anywhere he wishes." Cetin insisted that the Turkish side has evidence confirming that Ocalan is still in Syria. Al-Shar' replied: "That may have been so in the past. However, he is not in Syria at the present time. We are committed to the promise we have made. We cannot be involved in any terrorist activity against Turkey. How can we support an initiative against Turkey's territorial integrity when we support Iran's and Iraq's territorial integrity? That would also affect Syria." Obviously, Syria has not made a significant change in its position, regardless of Turkey's persistent diplomacy on terrorism and high-level U.S. pressure. Syria continues to demand that past Turkish promises be fulfilled and Ankara, suspending its past promises, insists that "the question of security be settled before the question of transnational waters is resolved. The only important element in the dialogue between the two countries is the limited steps Syria has recently taken on the PKK problem. A high-ranking government official informed us yesterday: "We have received several reports on that matter. We are aware that Abdullah Ocalan is in Syria. However, it seems that his freedom of movement has been considerably reduced." This was an indication that certain steps have been taken by Syria on the problem. The present issue is that the limited measures Damascus has taken have not been effective enough to convince Turkey to reconsider its approach on the question of transnational waters. Syria continues to hide Abdullah Ocalan, who it regards as the most important trump card in its relations with Turkey. All this indicates that a stalemate has emerged in the chess game between the two countries.
