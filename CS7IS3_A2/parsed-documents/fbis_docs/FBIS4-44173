We are going to look together at the reports from our special correspondents in Rwanda. I will, of course, ask you first of all to tell us how you assess the beginning of Operation Turquoise, is it going as you hoped, and it is slightly better understood today, in your opinion? [Balladur] I believe so. I believe so. Why did we decide to launch this operation in Rwanda? Because the whole world, the whole of France was moved, shaken by the pictures which we saw, and it seemed to us that the French Government could not remain indifferent or inactive, and thus that France, along with others -- but with France taking the initiative -- should organize an international humanitarian operation. Having said that, it was necessary to take precautions in order not to be dragged into what is a internal civil war in Rwanda. That is why we established a certain number of principles, which I outlined to the National Assembly: We are there to carry out a humanitarian operation and for this reason alone; we are there for a limited period of time; we are waiting for reinforcements from other nations, and we hope that by the end of July the United Nations will take over from us. [Duhamel] A question everyone is wondering about in this case is that, since, as unfortunately everyone has seen, there have been appalling massacres, and no doubt hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, why were we not able to make this decision earlier? [Balladur] I believe it is better to have made it when we did than not to have made it at all. Obviously, we could have made it earlier, you are right, Alain Duhamel, we could have made it earlier, we could have made it sooner. We made a certain number of contacts beforehand, but in the end it appeared to us that we were going to have to set the example, and this is what we did, but at the same time we had to take precautions to avoid our soldiers being needlessly put into dangerous situations. So, I repeat, there is no question of their taking part in the internal fighting, there is no question of their becoming a buffer force. They are there for a humanitarian purpose for a limited period of time, and for this alone, and I hope that the example which France is setting will stimulate other countries around the world to ensure that others quickly take over. [Chabot] You say that in fact the French troops are not there to form a buffer force or to take part in the fighting, but what happens if, for example, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] advances, takes Kigali, and in advancing they come extremely close to the French troops. How are they to react? [Balladur] We will review the situation at that time. I would note one thing: The RPF which was very reticent -- not to use a stronger expression -- with regard to the French operation, has been saying for the last 24 hours that it realizes that we are there for a humanitarian purpose, for a humanitarian purpose alone, and that under these circumstances it had fewer reservations -- I am not saying that it approves of it, but that it had fewer reservations -- concerning the operation which we are carrying out. [Duhamel] Can one say that with regard to the question of the French humanitarian operation in Rwanda, there is complete agreement between the president and the government, point by point? [Balladur] I spoke with the president about it, about 10 days or so ago, I think, and we both agreed that there was good reason for intervention, and we defined the mission together in a perfectly precise way in order not to be dragged -- and this was my express wish -- not to be dragged in any further than necessary. [Duhamel] A question which is often asked is that France -- and you are no doubt going to tell me that this was in the days before your government, but in any case France had, let us say, good relations with the previous government in Rwanda, and it was the henchmen of this previous government who behaved in an appalling manner. In your opinion, do we basically bear a portion of indirect responsibility? [Balladur] No, I do not believe so, and, furthermore one of our first actions, 48 hours ago, was to go to the assistance of the Tutsis, to clearly demonstrate that our goal was to carry out an operation aimed at defending everyone. We do not want to take sides with one against another. [Chabot] Are not some people saying basically with regard to this operation in Rwanda, perhaps we could do some thinking about France's policy in Africa and what kind of cooperation we should be giving? Does this in fact seem to you to be an occasion for doing some thinking about that? [Balladur] It is certainly an occasion for doing some thinking, but, you know, things are clear and straightforward: France aspires to be a world power. This is its ambition and its pride, and I want it to maintain this ambition, and the main sphere of its action is Africa, where, according to a tradition which now dates back many years, it has a distinguished role to play, especially in francophone Africa, so, because it is Africa, because Rwanda is a francophone country, we could not remain indifferent. However, we have to define and conduct this operation in such a way that we are not dragged in any further than we wish. [passage omitted] [Duhamel] You have known Jacques Delors for a long time, for at least a quarter of a century? [Balladur] Yes, for a good 30 years. [Duhamel] Do you think that he would be a fierce contender for the candidate or the candidates of the majority, whether you are one or not? [Balladur] I do not have any judgement to pass on this. [Chabot] Would you like him, for instance, to stay in Brussels -- as some of the European Union [EU] do, the Greek Government for instance, who yesterday asked him to do so because there is a difficult succession problem? Do you think that this is a good idea? [Balladur] If I did, what conclusions would you draw and which ulterior motives would you attribute to me? [Chabot] About the EU... [Balladur, interrupting] I believe that we have dwelt on the subject at length. [Duhamel] About Europe, there has been a summit. This summit stumbled on one point, the election of Jacques Delors' successor. Could they [changes thought] there were 11 countries, including France, which agreed that the Belgian prime minister should succeed Jacques Delors. There was one country, Great Britain, which opposed this. Would it be conceivable to have new conditions: one country against 11? [Balladur] I cannot answer you just like that, Alain Duhamel, you will understand that. What is needed, I think, is for us to reach a general agreement and I hope that each and every one will be aware of what is at stake. The stake is that Europe must not appear to be divided: People would not understand it. There is a candidate, who received a very significant number of votes. He is a very competent and valued candidate. [Duhamel] The Belgian prime minister, Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene. [Balladur] This is all I have to say. I hope that this issue will be settled on good terms, I do not like personality conflicts on the whole. [passage omitted]
