News agencies failed to react not because they doubted the authenticity of the Moslem calls for Serbs to be lynched but because of their view of the reality in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a view shaped by the political leaderships of the countries in which the agencies' headquarters are based. It is not clear why it is in the interest of the West to ignore even the obvious aggressiveness of mounting pan-Islamism, which itself, has termed the number one threat in the world. "The arrow has been shot and is moving towards its target" -- were the words of the sentence passed by the Iranian fundamentalists, headed by their late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeyni, on poet Salman Rushdie five years ago. Rushdie, sentenced by fundamentalists for a book he has written, has to remain in hiding because the sentence was confirmed yesterday -- Rushdie must die, as must also the Serbs in Bosnia. The progressive world public was indignant with the death sentence passed on Rushdie by the fundamentalists and it strongly reacted, defending the poet. On the other hand, that same public is threatening Serbs with NATO bombs and missiles only because Serbs do not fit into the visions contained in the "Islamic declaration" of Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic. There is no answer to the question what it is that Serbs should do to finally eliminate the threats they have been facing for two years, i.e., since the outbreak of the Bosnian Moslem "holy war" for Izetbegovic's state whose genuinely Islamic order would be based on the Koran. All negotiations to date have failed because the Bosnian Moslem side has been set on achieving its goal, but has not been able to do so because "there are too many Serbs and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina," as it sets out. The Moslems have rejected all offers made by the Serbs. Whatever concessions the Serbs have made, the Moslems have asked for more in an effort to achieve their goal by means of war. They are not doing bad in central Bosnia, where they are confronted with Croats, but they need NATO's assistance in the case of Serbs. The world omnipotents, who have engineered the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and everything that has happened in the past three years, surely know whether NATO's arrow has already been shot at the Serbs or if it has just been drawn back. The scenario and stage-managing in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been brought to perfection, and the story continues to unfold towards its pre-conceived end. Only Serbs in no way fit in. They should disappear according to Izetbegovic's idea, but they refuse to do so. And, NATO can hardly do anything about it.
