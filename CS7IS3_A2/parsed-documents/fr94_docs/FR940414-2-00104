FR940414-2-00104 FR940414-2-00073 Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (IBP, Inc., Common Stock, $.05 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;6085 April 8, 1994. IBP, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Exchange, the Company is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. IBP would like to delist from the PSE based on the low volume of trading and the costs associated with the PSE. Of the Company's total stock traded on the NYSE and PSE for 1993, only 1.3% of the trading occurred on the PSE. The Company has also determined that each trade on the PSE costs IBP about double the cost of a trade completed on the NYSE. Based on these figures, IBP has determined it should delist from the PSE. Any interested person may, on or before April 29, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
