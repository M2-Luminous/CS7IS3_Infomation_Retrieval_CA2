The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, told the heads of various delegations in informal meetings in Geneva that abstaining in the event of a voting on the Pakistan-proposed resolution on Kashmir will undermine the very concept of human rights and will encourage Islamabad's involvement in terrorism. Talking to Indian reporters, Mr. Khurshid said New Delhi expects a categorical rejection of the resolution.
