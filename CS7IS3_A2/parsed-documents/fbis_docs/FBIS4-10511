FBIS4-10511 "drlat071_b_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Dominican Republic General Monitoring Haitian Border Dismissed General Monitoring Haitian Border Dismissed PA1304023994 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0042 GMT 13 Apr 94 PA1304023994 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 Apr (EFE) -- The Dominican Army dismissed General Aurelio del Rosario Polanco on 12 April and appointed Tommy Fernandez Alarcon to monitor communities on the Dominican border to prevent the trafficking of fuel to Haiti. The replacement took place after del Rosario objected to the presence of international observers in Dominican territory. Army Chief Major Gen. Ivan Hernandez Oleaga ordered the dismissal. The Army has been monitoring the border area since 11 April. Del Rosario assumed responsibility of commanding the military garrisons 15 days ago as the Dominican measures to strengthen the UN-imposed embargo against the Haitian military coupists toughened. Hernandez is in charge of an operation to restrict the trafficking of fuel to Haiti at the Dominican border. The presence of Haitians in Dominican communities has decreased since the military officer's arrival at the border, because they fear arrest by Dominican military agents. As fewer Haitians cross the border, Dominicans stand in long lines to buy fuel which later will be illegally traded with Haitians. The Armed Forces reported this week more than 10,000 Dominican agents are guarding the border to prevent the trafficking of fuel. The surveillance of the Dominican-Haitian border increased three weeks ago after the meetings Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer held with U.S. officials. In addition, the Dominican Government is trying to silence an international campaign accusing it of violating the embargo on the neighboring country.
