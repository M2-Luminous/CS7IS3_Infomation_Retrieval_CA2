According to Azerbaijani intelligence data, the arms and military hardware are being flown from Sochi to Gyumri on board military cargo planes. The same source says the Russian military cargo planes are carrying out around 30 flights a day. TURAN claims that Armenia has already received a few dozen modern tanks from Russia. According to the news agency, the arms dispatch was stepped up following Armenian defeats on the battlefront. As proof, TURAN cites an AFP correspondent in Armenia claiming that officials in Yerevan are not hiding that the flow of military hardware from Russia became possible after Yegor Gaydar resigned; he was stingy about this. In connection with untrue Azerbaijani press reports, a SNARK reporter asked Seyran (Shakhbugaryan), the head of the Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service, to comment on this issue. (Shakhbugaryan) stated that the military cooperation between Russia and Armenia is in line with the status of the Russian troops in Armenia. Beyond that, no arms have ever or are being dispatched.
