But as John Major issued a statement backing Mr Rushdie, Iran renewed its threat to the author's life. Javad Larijani, an adviser to Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani, said: "We consider Rushdie as a man who tried to betray Islam, to downgrade Islam and to downgrade the sentiments of more than one billion Muslims. So...he does not deserve to exist." On February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Khomeyni, then leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, issued his death threat -- or fatwa -- against Mr Rushdie and others associated with the publication of the author's book The Satanic Verses. Mr Major said in his statement: "I met Salman Rushdie last May to demonstrate the Government's full support for his fundamental rights. "I have been heartened by the way in which many governments around the world have demonstrated their support both by meeting Mr Rushdie and in their discussions with the Iranian government. "We all want to make clear to the Iranian government that they cannot enjoy full and friendly relations with the rest of the international community unless and until we can be satisfied that there is no further direct or indirect threat from the Iranian authorities to Mr Rushdie's life, or to that of others associated with his book. "I hope very much that they will listen to the message." When on Tehran radio Ayatollah Khomeyni pronounced on Mr Rushdie for alleged blasphemy, his words changed the Indian-born author's life, led to a breakdown in relations between Europe and Iran, and sparked violence across the Muslim world. Now, despite statements that Mr Rushdie intends to resume a more normal life, there is little prospect that he will be able to do so. So serious is the death threat that ever-watchful Special Branch bodyguards still move him from safe house to safe house. In the first five months of his "captivity" he was shifted 50 times. Hitmen have already killed the Japanese translator of The Satanic Verses and attacked the Italian translator. Last October, the Norwegian publisher of the novel was shot and seriously wounded outside his home in Oslo. The author's 24-hour protection has so far cost an estimated £5 million, but he has contributed more than £500,000 of his own money. When Mr Major met Mr Rushdie at the Commons last May, Iran responded by raising from £14 to £504 the cost of a visa for British citizens travelling to Tehran. At the same time, top Iranian officials reiterated that Ayatollah Khomeyni's death sentence on Mr Rushdie was "irrevocable." Despite reaffirmation of the death threat, Mr Rushdie has refused to remain hidden, visiting 15 countries since June 1992 and even sharing a stage with rock group U2 before 70,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. Last November he met President Bill Clinton at the White House. Tehran cut relations with Britain in March 1989 over publication of Mr Rushdie's book. Diplomatic links were restored in September 1990, but Britain has made it clear that the resumption of full diplomatic relations depends on Iran lifting the fatwa.
