Such a title is not surprising in the least for the magazine headed by [Greater Romania Party President] Corneliu Vadim Tudor. As one can see, the paper expresses the obsession of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, Ilie Neacsu, and other native nationalist-communists who see everywhere smaller or bigger spies that have come to Romania from all parts of the world, by ship or by plane, to be discovered and seized by our brave and well-fed patriots. In this respect it is easy to notice that the title strikingly reminds us of the reports devoted by the SCINTEIA [official organ of the former Romanian Communist Party] of the fifties to the trials of "certain saboteurs, spies, and agents of English-U.S. imperialism." Under this sign of the Stalinist spy-game that disappeared in the early days of the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej [first Romanian post-war leader] regime and reappeared and is flourishing in the Iliescu regime, the ROMANIA MARE weekly accuses some of the current state officials of being spies. The respective officials are the following: Adrian Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies and executive president of the ruling party [Social Democracy Party of Romania]; Minister of State Dan Mircea Popescu; Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary of state at the Ministry of National Defense; and Ioan Talpes, head of the SIE [Foreign Intelligence Service]. Together with others, the aforementioned persons are revealed as belonging to an organized group that has infiltrated the structures of our country's leadership in order to promote the policy and interests of foreign powers. In the Romanian press that appeared after the 1989 December revolution, many stupid things were published on the issue of certain public figures having been members of various spy networks that were established in Romania. Unfortunately, the so-called revelations have not appeared only in the pages of the nationalist-communist press, but also in the pages of the independent press. Therefore, without any proof, the members of the leadership and of the opposition were accused of being members of the CIA, KGB, and Mossad. At first glance, the ROMANIA MARE article should be counted as another proof of journalistic dilettantism, seriously influenced by the cheap thrillers read by their authors. That is how, I believe, the officials accused by ROMANIA MARE viewed the respective article, because, although quite some time has passed since the publication of that article, they still keep silent and pretend that nothing has happened. I believe that this position of ignoring things adopted by the respective personalities is erroneous. The scandal has much greater proportions than what the accused ones believe or allow to be believed. The respective article was not published in just any publication, but in the weekly whose owner and director is the leader of a party that is part of the government coalition. Had the accusation come from the opposition or independent press, there would be no need to notice it. It has already become a nervous tic of Corneliu Vadim Tudor to denounce the opposition and the independent press as being full of English and U.S. spies. However, the article is talking about members of the current leadership. And this leadership makes a great fuss about the issue of the fierce battle that it wages to defend the independence and sovereignty of the country. Within this context, the denunciation by the Greater Romania Party leader (that is, the leader of a party that is a member of the government coalition) of an espionage network that penetrated the leadership, at such a high level of the government, Chamber of Deputies, the Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service, and the Army should provoke a rapid and firm stance by those who are involved and the respective institutions that are in charge of watching over national security. Needless to say that had a foreign espionage network penetrated the structures of our leadership, that would be one of the most serious attempts against the sovereignty and independence of our country. The stand of those public figures should make things clear to the public. Either what Corneliu Vadim Todor published in the ROMANIA MARE weekly is true, and in that case the accused persons should not only be urgently removed from office but also brought to justice, or the accusations included in the respective article are completely erroneous, and in that case, the Social Democracy Party of Romania and Ion Iliescu must definitively break the alliance with Corneliu Vadim Tudor. The act of launching false accusations against high officials of the state proves the completely irresponsible attitude of the PRM leader. And the presence of such an irresponsible person in the structures of the country's leadership -- thanks to the alliance with the PDSR and thanks to Ion Iliescu -- is just as serious an attempt on the national security as the existence of an espionage network that penetrated Romania's top leadership.
