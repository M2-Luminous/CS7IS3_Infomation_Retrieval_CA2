According to their report, ``short of resuming nuclear testing, France is not assured of being in a position to provide itself with a simulation system that guarantees absolute mastery over its defense systems, that is, over its security and independence.'' About 20 new tests are said to be necessary. For the first time in the Fifth Republic, members of Parliament have been led to act as investigators in a field--the implementation and maintenance of the nuclear deterrent--recognized as being the sole preserve of the head of state. This is a precedent, although mission members are prompt to note that such has long been the case in the United States. In France, the report contends, ``the secrecy and `overclassification' which surround anything to do with nuclear technology, and the extreme scientific and technical complexity of military nuclear technology have often combined to obscure the approaches followed in this field.'' Mr. Galy-Dejean states that it is time the government established a scientific and military council open to personalities with differing backgrounds, and which would participate in the decisionmaking process by giving advice and directions. According to the parliamentary mission, France ``tackled belatedly'' the problem of nuclear testing simulation. The United States began studies on the matter as early as 1980, carrying out about 50 experiments. France only performed one, in 1991, out of the 204 tests (including security tests) it performed since its first one in 1960 in the Sahara. Another experiment had been scheduled for 1992, but Mr. Mitterrand then decreed a suspension, which is still standing. Why are experiments needed? According to Mr. Galy-Dejean, whose information comes from the Atomic Energy Commission [CEA], the purpose of testing is as follows: -- validating fundamental physics concepts as they relate to nuclear weapons; -- validating concepts selected for weapon development and production; -- checking weapon reliability over time, as aging characteristics are difficult to predict with certainty; -- maintaining scientist and researcher know-how; -- enhancing the deterrence effect, by showing the world that weapons work; -- checking, through safety tests, that a stored weapon does not constitute a hazard. Significant Investments In 1981, France performed on average about 12 tests a year. This figure was gradually reduced to five. In 1991, to remedy this cut and ``not at all as a measure taken in anticipation of a total ban on nuclear testing,'' notes Mr. Galy-Dejean, the PALEN (preparation to nuclear testing limitation) program was implemented. The goal was twofold: Checking the effectiveness and safety of operational weapons, and renewing deterrent payloads through nuclear tests involving minimal energy expenses. Significant investments need to be made in computing power (some Fr400 million in computers 50 times as powerful as today's platforms), in radiographic accelerators (no less than Fr430 million) and megajoule lasers (Fr6 to 7 billion should France not be able to develop such equipment jointly with the United States). It is expected that this equipment will not be available before the year 1998 or 2002. This is why the parliamentary mission states that, according to the experts it has consulted with, France needs another 20 or so full-size tests. Ten such tests should make it possible to develop PALEN procedures, and another 10 are needed to finalize the design of the nuclear warheads of the M.5 and ASLP (long-range air-to-ground) missiles intended for future strategic submarines as well as the Rafale aircraft.
