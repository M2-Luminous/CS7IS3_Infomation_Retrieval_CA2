Fuel reserves at two of the town's heating plants are running out. Here, heat and electricity are used only for the social sphere, they are supplied to houses and enterprises to ensure the port's vital services. A critical fuel situation has appeared in Arkhangelsk. The temperature in the heating systems has been lowered. Main production lines of the paper and pulp combine in Novodvinsk, which is a major combine in the oblast, have been stopped. Power engineering workers in the White Sea region do not have the money to buy fuel. Non-payers -- mainly organizations financed from the budget -- owe them over 20 billion rubles. This situation in power engineering causes special concern in connection with the weather forecast -- which predicts a sharp fall in temperature in Murmansk Oblast this week -- down to 30-40 degrees [centigrade] below zero.
