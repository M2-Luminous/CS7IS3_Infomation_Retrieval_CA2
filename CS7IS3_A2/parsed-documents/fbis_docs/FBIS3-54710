The letter says: Russian news sources have recently circulated news of the Russian Government's decision to lift the economic sanctions imposed on Abkhazia. As of now, Abkhazia's towns and villages are receiving electricity without hindrance. The Abkhaz committee for human rights and interethnic relations states that the Abkhaz side has several times breached the clauses of the Geneva memorandum on mutual understanding signed by Georgia and Abkhazia; it has not stopped combat actions against Georgians in the Kodori gorge, is settling scores atrociously with the peaceful Georgian population in the Gali rayon, and is not taking any measures for finding those missing and reburying the killed; it is doing virtually nothing for the return of those evicted from their own land. The Russian Government's new year gift is nothing less than a breach of Resolution No. 876 of the UN Security Council and casts doubt on the implementation of the Geneva memorandum on mutual understanding.
