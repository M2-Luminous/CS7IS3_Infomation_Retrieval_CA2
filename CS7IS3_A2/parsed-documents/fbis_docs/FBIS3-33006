He has just made a tour of the former Yugoslavia and thinks that this mission was "the most unfruitful" that he has made to the region. He blamed the Muslims who decided on Tuesday [15 February] to boycott the meeting between the commander in chief of the Serbian forces in Bosnia and the commander in chief of the government army, although this meeting was described as "crucial" by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. This meeting was to make it possible to define the procedure for the withdrawal operations and the establishment of control over the heavy weapons, a process deadlocked on Monday by mutual distrust. The fact that Mr. Silajdzic said he knew nothing of this meeting to justify the absence of General Delic does not argue for the Bosnian prime minister's sense of responsibility, and it is not known what his motives might be. But can anything else be expected from somebody who had pledged -- even to President Clinton's special envoy to Sarajevo -- not to exploit the shelling truce to regain territory, although the UNPROFOR's observations on the ground proved the contrary. Mr. Silajdzic's attitude is lamentable; but that of the leader of the Serbian Forces, who has just stated that Serbian artillery will not pull back, is no less so. Nothing more is needed to prompt new tensions at a time when the NATO ultimatum is running out.... In fact, there is nobody in diplomatic circles who wants the Atlantic alliance to carry out its threats. But everybody knows that NATO will not hesitate if the conditions it has put forward are not met. The situation being what it is, there is reason to fear that there are people in the two camps who do not fear air strikes at all, and who even imagine that they might serve their purpose. When you hear Mr. Karadzic stupidly counting on the collapse of the alliance if it launched air raids, you have to admit that the disaster met by Saddam Husayn -- who also believed that he could defy the international community with impunity -- has not served as a lesson. All these signs suggest that reason is not triumphing this week. In this case, there is strong reason to think that the alliance will have to intervene and thus strike heavily -- with all the risks of collateral damage which this operation carries -- to secure the results it is seeking. That would not necessarily change the face of Europe....
