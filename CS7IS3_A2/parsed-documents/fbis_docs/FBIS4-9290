This has been confirmed by the main participants in the Belgrade meeting -- Milosevic, Akashi, and Karadzic. In a brief statement for journalists after today's second round of talks, the Serbian president expressed satisfaction with the success of the talks between UN representatives and the republic of Srpska. "I believe that a big step has been made toward peace," Milosevic said and added: "In the future, the Republic of Serbia will continue to lend support to peaceful solutions to the Yugoslav crisis through negotiations because we believe that this path has no alternative, and it is the only one which leads to such a solution." Yasushi Akashi also expressed satisfaction with the results of the talks, stressing that "a possibility has been created to avoid the crisis." He expressed gratitude to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for the initiative which resulted in the two-day meeting in Belgrade. Akashi said that he is satisfied with the readiness to cooperate on the part of the Bosnian Serb representatives, especially Karadzic. According to Akashi, it was agreed over the past two days that the Serbian forces should withdraw to three kilometers from the center of Gorazde. "We are planning to deploy peace forces around that town as early as this afternoon. I am convinced that in that respect we will have full cooperation for the free movement of the peace forces on their way to Gorazde before the end of the day." Republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic's statement was in the same vein. He said that the Serbian forces will withdraw to three kilometers from Gorazde and that relations with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] have been fully normalized. If there is peace in Gorazde, and peace forces are deployed there, that is, if the area is demilitarized and the possibility of a Muslim offensive removed, we can hope for a total peace, the president of the Serb Republic said in conclusion. The initiative for the two-day meeting in Belgrade was launched by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who based it on the firm conviction that the crisis can be solved through negotiations and not through escalation of the war. Milosevic suggested that the representatiaves of the United Nations and of the republic of Srpska should discuss three issues: the normalization of relations between the republic of Srpska and UNPROFOR, an end to the conflict around Gorazde, and an agreement on a cessation of hostilities throughout the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Milosevic's proposal was accepted and a full accord was reached on six issues. There is no doubt that the most important agreement is the one on the immediate and total cease-fire in and around Gorazde. Under the agreement, the cease-fire was to come into force at noon today. The agreement on the normalization of relations between the republic of Srpska and UNPROFOR is also of great importance, as well as the consensus that an agreement on a cease-fire throughout the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina must be reached. The question now is: Whose turn is it to make a move after the Belgrade agreement? Everything indicates that the conclusion is that it is the Bosnian Muslims. The wish of only one side is not enough for a cease-fire, nor is it enough for a war. In a certain way, NATO made a move out of turn by issuing fresh threats and ultimatums, and only to one side -- the Serbian side.
