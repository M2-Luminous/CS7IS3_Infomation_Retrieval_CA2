President Kim Il-song in the letter said the conference would mark an important milestone in strengthening and developing our party into an unconquerable party and fortifying the bulwark of socialism in our country, by enhancing the function and role of the party cells. He further said: Our party is a glorious party which has grown up from deep historical roots. It is a revolutionary party of chuche which, guided by the chuche idea, struggles for the popular masses' cause of independence. The foundation of our party and its development are inconceivable apart from the development of its cell, the basic party organization. In view of the cell's very important place and role in party building and party activities, we have consistently paid a close attention to strengthening party cells and other grassroots organizations ever since the days when its foundation was prepared. In accordance with the policy adopted at the historic Kalun meeting in 1930, we conducted the work of founding the party by forming the basic organizations first and then increasing and strengthening them. Since its foundation, our party expanded its ranks by recruiting advanced elements from among workers, peasants, intellectuals and other working people, and organized its cells in factories, enterprises, farm villages and in all other places where there were its members and the masses, and strengthened the militant function of its cells to meet the actual requirements at each stage of the revolution. Through the strengthening of the cells and the enhancement of their function and role, our party grew into an invincible party which achieved the unity and cohesion of its ranks on the basis of the chuche idea and became a harmonious whole with the popular masses. In the period when the historic task of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea came to the fore, our party put great efforts into the work of cementing its cells to meet the requirements of a new, higher stage of the revolution. After the training course held at the proposal of the Central Committee of the party for the party cell secretaries from all parts of the country in 1991, a vigorous movement was launched to create loyal party cells throughout the whole party under the slogan, "Let us make all the party cells loyal cells ", and their militant function and role have been enhanced as never before. Today, the party cells are performing their noble mission and duties with credit in further developing the party into a revolutionary party of chuche and carrying on and promoting the chuche revolutionary cause. The brilliant successes in our party building and in the development of our revolution are associated with the silent efforts and exploits of the party cell secretaries. With a high sense of pride and revolutionary awareness that they are the junior political workers of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea, the cell secretaries have devoted their all to the struggle for the party and the revolution, wishing for neither honour nor reward. The most important revolutionary task now facing our party and our people is to safeguard and defend the people-centred socialism of our own style from the challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries and develop it further. The socialism which has been established in our country by implementing the chuche idea under our party's leadership is a genuine socialism which accords with the people's aspirations to independence. Whether or not we defeat the enemy's manoeuvres, and defend the socialist cause of chuche and accomplish it depends on how we strengthen the party, the general staff of the revolution, and how we enhance its leadership role. Party cells are the cornerstones of our party as well as the revolutionary posts which guard our socialism. They are the base for training party members into revolutionaries and assimilating them to the working class, the base for linking party members with its Central Committee and establishing unbreakable ties between the party and the masses, and the base for mobilizing its membership and other working people for the implementation of the party's lines and policies. Strengthening party cells is precisely an important guarantee for increasing the motive force of our party and our revolution and firmly defending and developing our socialism. All the party cell secretaries must, with a high sense of responsibility and honour, train their cells to be unfailingly loyal to the party, to be militant cells which powerfully organize the masses for the struggle to defend and develop the cause of socialism. The party cells must, above all else, loyally support the unified leadership of the party Central Committee. Ensuring the unity of leadership in the party is the fundamental principle of party activity. Loyally supporting the undivided leadership of the party Central Committee is the lifeblood of the party cells. Today the cause of our party, the chuche revolutionary cause, is honourably carried on under the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il who possesses excellent personality and qualities as the people's leader. Our party has successfully solved the question of ensuring the continuity of leadership to meet the requirement of revolutionary development and the desire of the popular masses. This is the success in which our party can take the greatest pride in its development; this firmly guarantees a bright future and a brilliant victory of our party and our revolution. All the party cells must keep the main line of effort to establish the monolithic system of party leadership. The cells must accept the party's lines and policies, its decisions and instructions unconditionally and carry them out; they must educate and lead the party members and other working people to be unfailingly loyal to party leadership. Party cells must be efficient in organizing and guiding the party life of its members. The party cells must intensify organizational and ideological life of the party members to train all of them into staunch revolutionaries who are unfailingly loyal to the party and the revolution and can unyieldingly fight for the victory of the socialist cause in any adversity. The party cells must improve work among the masses and unite broad sections of them firmly behind the party. The party cells must efficiently work among the masses to give revolutionary education to broad sections of them and rally them closely behind the party Central Committee and make an active contribution to strengthening the single-hearted unity of the whole society. Party cells must push ahead with the ideological, technical and cultural revolutions to effect uninterrupted innovations and upsurge in socialist construction. Regarding the ideological revolution as their first and foremost revolutionary task, party cells must intensify education in the chuche idea among the party members and working people. We should bring them to cherish an unfailing loyalty to the party, staunch revolutionary spirit, unshakable faith in socialism, ardent patriotism and noble moral traits, and bring into fuller bloom in our society the beautiful communist morality of helping and leading each other forward and sharing weal and woe on the principle of one for all and all for one. Party cells must make a great effort to carry out the cultural revolution so that all the party members and working people learn hard and strive to thoroughly improve their cultural and technical standards steadily and enjoy to their hearts' content the socialist cultural life, with rich emotional feelings and a high cultural attainment. Party cells must strengthen organizational and political work to make sure that the party members and working people accelerate the technical revolution and make innovations in building the socialist economy. For the present the party cells in all sectors of the national economy must effect a fresh, revolutionary advance in building the socialist economy by organizing the party members and working people effectively for the implementation of the party's revolutionary economic strategy. Party cells must always pay deep attention to national defence. We are striving to build socialism in sharp confrontation with the enemy. The imperialists and their lackeys are now daily intensifying military threats and provocations against our republic, the bulwark of socialism. Party cells must see to it that the party members and working people sharpen their revolutionary vigilance against the enemy's manoeuvres of aggressive provocation, learn military affairs in real earnest, and make full preparations for defending the security of the country and the socialist gains reliably. Party cells must encourage the party members and working people to display fully the traditional traits of unity between the army and the people and ensure that the Army and the people, as one, defend the socialist motherland firmly. First, to support the unified leadership of the party Central Committee with loyalty, second, to organize and guide party life effectively to train all the party members into the revolutionaries of chuche type, third, to do work with the masses efficiently to strengthen the blood-sealed ties between the party and the masses, fourth, to expedite the three revolutions in ideology, technology and culture to promote socialist construction, and fifth, to defend the security of the country and the socialist gains reliably--these are the five major tasks party cells must tackle at present. All the party cell secretaries must adhere to these five tasks and carry them out to the letter.
