Why have the contents of this treaty not been made public? That does not conform to international practice. [Byczewski] Ministers Povilas Gylys and Andrzej Olechowski merely initialed the treaty. That merely signifies the formal conclusion of the negotiation process. The contents of important international documents like this are revealed not after they have been initialed but after they have been signed. The signing ceremony will probably take place in Vilnius in April. The treaty will be signed by the presidents of both countries. [Gmyz] Does that mean that the president will ratify the treaty without parliament's consent and that it will enter into effect immediately after it has been signed in Vilnius? [Byczewski] The ratification and the signing of a treaty are two entirely different things. The Small Constitution envisages two ways of ratifying international treaties. Treaties that alter borders or result in budget spending have to be approved by the parliaments of both countries in the form of ratification laws before they can be ratified by the politicians. As far as lesser treaties are concerned, the president of each country may ratify them without the consent of parliament. The treaty with Lithuania is, of course, a treaty of great importance, and we want it to undergo what we in diplomatic language call major ratification--i.e., following parliament's consent. [Gmyz] The greatest problem during the negotiation process was presented by history itself--to be more precise, the taking of Vilnius by Polish General Zeligowski in 1920. How has this problem been resolved? [Byczewski] Treaties are concerned not with the past but with the future. For this reason, the Polish side has clearly been saying from the very beginning that the treaty cannot contain any assessments of history, and it does not contain any. The preamble does contain certain standard general references to history. Both sides express regret at the conflicts between our countries and the use of force that no doubt occurred, but no concrete events are mentioned and nothing is evaluated. [Gmyz] Is it true that, in the treaty, we guarantee Vilnius as the capital of Lithuania and they guarantee us Warsaw as our capital? If so, what would happen if the Lithuanians wanted to move their capital elsewhere? Would they require Poland's consent? [Byczewski] The preamle mentions both cities as capital cities, but the treaty itself contains no guarantees that they remain capitals. This is a domestic matter for each country and has nothing to do with international documents. The Lithuanians have always considered Vilnius their historic capital, and I very much doubt if they would ever want to move it somewhere else. [Gmyz] How does the treaty address the rights of minorities? [Byczewski] The treaty fully guarantees the rights of minorities in accordance with European standards. The press has unnecessarily been reporting on the treaty only from the angle of history and minority rights. Yet the treaty also addresses other important spheres such as cross-border and regional trade. After all, it calls for the opening of new border crossings and other important matters. [Gmyz] What were the talks like? [Byczewski] I make no secret of the fact that they were hard and complicated. There were five rounds of talks. The negotiations themselves did not exhaust all issues, of course. The ministers mentioned letters about which the general public knows nothing. One day these will be interesting documents for historians. The informal visits of Lithuanian politicians in Poland were also important. First, we hosted Lithuanian Parliamentary Speaker Jursenas, who was accompanied by Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislavas Domarkas. Later came Prime Minister Adolfas Szelevicius. Polish Minister Andrzej Zakrzewksi headed a presidential mission to Lithuania in February. The recent telephone conversation between the presidents of both countries was also important. [Gmyz] Is the treaty a success of Polish diplomacy, as the Lithuanian opposition parties claim it is? [Byczewski] It is the conclusion of the talks and the resolution of all thorny issues that constitute a success. It is a bilateral success. Of course, there are always specific people behind every document. At this point, I must commend my colleagues, especially Stefan Meller, who is deputy director of Department One, dealing with Europe. He is a historian, and there were times when his advice and remarks provided the talks with a helpful push. The treaty completes the round of international political agreements with our neighbors. Yet we did not start until 1989.
