FBIS4-4949 "dreas066_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 South Korea Think Tank Advises Seoul on Section 301 Bill Think Tank Advises Seoul on Section 301 Bill SK0604002894 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 6 Apr 94 p 8 SK0604002894 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES English BFN [By staff reporter Kim Chang-yong] [Text] No country in the world but Korea has fallen victim to Section 301 of the U.S. omnibus trade bill even before Washington designated it as the target of comprehensive retaliation, a state- run think tank said in a report yesterday. The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy [KIEP] advised the administration not to be scared by the invocation of the bill, which is originally a domestic law and contradicts the freer world trade order under the Uruguay Round accord. Washington, which recently revived the section, popularly called Super 301 provision, is pressing Seoul to reduce what it describes as barriers in the auto market and threatening to designate Korea's auto import regulations as a "priority foreign country practice" otherwise. Korea and the United States held two-day working-level trade talks in Washington yesterday which focused on the auto issue. The Bush administration designated Japan, India and Brazil as priority foreign countries under the Section 301 in May 1989, putting six import practices of the three countries in its sights for urgent improvement. What Americans called unfair trade practices concerned the Japanese government's procurement of supercomputers, India's purchase of artificial satellites and Indonesia's allegedly technical barriers in forestry development. The three countries all turned down negotiations with the United States roundly as far as the talks entailed retaliation, ultimately escaping any retaliatory step, the KIEP said. Actually, Japan agreed with the United States to comply with the latter's demand for economic restructuring that could facilitate U.S. access to the Japanese market on condition Washington excluded Tokyo from the list of priority foreign countries and reserved retaliation. Washington got little tangible outcome from its talks with Tokyo on restructuring. Brazil also led the United States to reverse its earlier designation by reducing import restrictions on some products through subsequent negotiations. India was solely put on the list but was given no substantial retaliation. Korea, for its part, expanded the farm market opening wider and committed itself to reducing tariffs on seven products while the United States was just reviewing its import practices with a threat of retaliation. "Korea was the only country that yielded to the shadow of the Section Super 301 and made great concessions to the United States all ahead of the application of the provision," the report said. The research body said that Korea does not have to be concerned too much over the Section Super 301 to lose core interests before negotiations. "Many countries point out that the U.S. provision will be contradictory with the Uruguay Round of the new international trade regime which will set forth the World Trade Organization," it added.
