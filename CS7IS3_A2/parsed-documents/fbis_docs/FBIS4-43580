Having (successfully) gotten two elections behind it, the Freedom Alliance is now setting its sights on a grand reform of the state. "The time for a presidential system has come," [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini said in this interview with IL GIORNALE. "We are initiating a parliamentary debate on the direct election of the president." But meanwhile a test of strength is under way between [Prime Minister] Berlusconi and [League Secretary] Bossi, and the majority has split in the Senate over the decree to salvage the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. As though that were not enough, [Interior Minister] Maroni has proposed the "integration" of Forza Italia, the National Alliance, and the Northern League. [Guiglia] Is a great "Freedom Party" about to be formed in our country, as in America? [Fini] The proposal made by Maroni needs to be further detailed, but must certainly be encouraged. The government must govern, and it needs the utmost cooperation among its allies. But their backgrounds and identities are different and cannot be nullified. The important thing now, right away, is to create electoral and administrative cartels. We and Forza Italia have done so, also in the north, whereas the League is going it alone. And it is making a mistake. [Guiglia] Berlusconi is demanding a "clarification" from Bossi. Is it their own affair or does it concern the whole of the majority? [Fini] Each political group has its own autonomy, and there cannot and must not be any interference in internal party debates. Having said that, the prime minister is entitled to demand from his coalition partners a clear position, which is essential to the stability of the majority. [Guiglia] But in the Senate Forza Italia, not the League, voted for [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's decree to salvage the RAI, together with Communist Renewal. Is there a test of strength on the way between the government partners over the media too? [Fini] There will be no test of strength, because I am sure that in the next few days it will be easy to find a common stance on the issue. The National Alliance has no intention of dismantling the RAI. But there is a large difference between dismantling and approving a watertight measure. I am sure that Forza Italia's future options will no longer be in tune with those of the Left, as unfortunately happened in the Senate. That decree must be modified. the RAI's wise men are neither representative nor guarantors -- as they should be -- of pluralism within that public service. [Guiglia] Berlusconi is experiencing a honeymoon with the voters. Did you, as his ally, feel somewhat "neglected" on 12 June? [Fini] For us that day's positive vote is a starting point, not the electoral target of the Italian Right. We will work to make ourselves even more clearly identifiable by the public, through a presidential system, which we will now make the subject of a debate in Parliament; economic liberalism combined with social solidarity, and the renewal of public administration, from the ethical viewpoint, too. [Guiglia] The National Alliance has a secretary, but does not give the impression of having a leadership class. Is this the weak spot of Italy's Right? [Fini] There would be no leader unless he were flanked by a substantial group of officials. Nobody is so presumptuous as to do things entirely by himself. We have 17 members in the government, either as ministers or as under secretaries. We have another five who are chairmen of parliamentary committees and two deputy speakers of Parliament. Do I need to go on? [Guiglia] Yes: Who is your "deputy?" [Fini] There is no one deputy; we have four or five. [Guiglia] Who are they? [Fini] I cannot say; otherwise the other six or seven will get angry. [Guiglia] When will you convene the National Alliance congress? [Fini] Before the end of the year, at the same time as the MSI [Italian Social Movement] congress. There must be an operational and organizational agreement between the National Alliance and the MSI. The Alliance no longer consists solely of MSI members: There are Catholics, Liberals, Republicans. Then we need to update our policies to tae into account particpation in government, reform, the electoral law, developments on the Left , plus all that has happened in recent months. [Guiglia] Will you also discuss the greatest statesman of the century? [Fini] I no longer express any judgments about the past. [Guiglia] Is this an embarrassing way of eliminating it? [Fini] It is a way of eliminating polemics and artificial disputes over the Alliance policies, which have nothing to do with the past. [Guiglia] Israel has placed the MSI members in the government under observation. When will they emerge from quarantine? [Fini] I can very well understand the Israelis' sensitivity. Foreign Minister Peres said that he will judge our ministers on what they do. This is the greatest reassurance that we could be given. The facts will speak for themselves. [Guiglia] Will the PPI [Italian Popular Party] help you in the Senate? [Fini] That depends entirely on them. I foresee not their joining the majority, but their ability to adopt responsible positions different from those of the progressive forces in each instance. [Guiglia] Who is best: D'Alema, Veltroni, or Cacciari [candidates to succeed Occhetto as Democratic Party of the Left secretary]? [Fini] They are all the same. As long as it remains illiberal and continues systematically to denigrate its adversaries, the Left will not go anywhere. This, even if it changes, and keeps changing, its secretaries.
