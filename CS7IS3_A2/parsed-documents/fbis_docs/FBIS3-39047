General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; ANAP [Motherland Party] leader Mesut Yilmaz; ministers and other officials, participated in the ceremony. In a speech he delivered at the ceremony, President Suleyman Demirel said that Aliyev's visit, which coincides with a period when significant developments are taking place, will enable a useful exchange of views on regional and international issues concerning both countries. Indicating that the Armenian attacks prevent both the socioeconomic and political formation of Azerbaijan, which has embarked on a process of reconstruction and unification with the international community, Demirel stated that this situation is starting to endanger regional stability. Demirel further noted that nothing can be achieved -- neither territorial acquisition nor political advantage -- with these acts of aggression which are in violation of international norms, adding that he takes advantage of this occasion to condemn the Armenian aggression once more. Noting that Turkey attaches great importance to regional peace and cooperation, Demirel added that he sincerely believes that stability and security cannot be separated. For this reason, Demirel further stated, he believes that the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia will be justly solved when Azerbaijan's territorial integrity is achieved. Demirel said: [Begin Demirel recording] It has to be known that Turkey will not be content with supporting Azerbaijan only in international issues. While embracing its Azeri brothers as a state and nation after a 70-year longing, Turkey, as a contemporary democratic state, will also continue to extend all-out assistance in the reconstruction process of Azerbaijan. [end recording] Aliyev, in turn, indicated that Turkey and Azerbaijan had established a close cooperation and support in recent years and added that the newly constituted Azerbaijan Republic has always been aware of Turkey's support and help. Explaining that the most important issue Azerbaijan faces is the Armenian aggression, Aliyev added that his people strongly feel Turkey's assistance regarding this aggressiveness. Adding that Azerbaijan conducts a peaceful policy, Aliyev said that their aim is to have friendly relations with their neighbors. Aliyev said: [Begin Aliyev recording] We are calling on the concerned countries', especially Turkey's, support in achieving a peaceful solution to the artificial Karabakh issue which was created by the Armenians. [end recording] Subsequently, the two presidents held a meeting and thereafter the respective delegations of the two countries started their discussions. Aliyev later received Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at the hotel where he is residing and conferred with her for some time. The guest president also met Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz. Aliyev will continue with his contacts in Ankara tomorrow and depart from Turkey on Saturday.
