The whole affair is an example of what is bad in trade relations between the European Union and the Czech Republic, Klaus said. Trade barriers are a problem for the Czech Republic, which would welcome the abolition of duties before 2001, the deadline set by the association agreement, he continued. The anti-dumping procedures were initiated on March 28 against Slovak and Polish as well as Czech producers. The European Commission, at the request of the German Association of Cement Producers, opened an investigation similar to a trial, in which the accused are represented by lawyers.
