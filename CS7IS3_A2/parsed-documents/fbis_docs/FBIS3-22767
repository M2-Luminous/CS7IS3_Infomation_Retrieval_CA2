Referring to "a few" countries succumbing to the will of the big powers, Zarif said such actions instead of leading to peace and stability will only entrench the same threat perceptions which will lead to "further insecurity and instability." The "past erroneous approaches and perceptions" deter the common attempts "towards a better world order", the daily quoted Zarif as saying.
