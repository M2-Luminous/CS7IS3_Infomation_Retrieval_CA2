The goals of the forum are to discuss policies for promoting industry in Saitama as prefectural industry becomes more advanced and to seek methods by which the prefecture's research institutions and companies can cooperate. Beginning in FY94 the prefecture plans to make the research results of prefectural universities available through the research institutes so that the prefecture's companies can develop them. It will aggressively promote exchange between industry, academia, and government on industrial technology. Participants in the forum will include six schools: Saitama University's engineering faculty (Urawa), Saitama Institute of Technology (Okabe-machi, Osato-gun), Shibaura Institute of Technology (Omiya), Tokyo Denki University (Hatoyama-machi, Hiki-gun), Toyo University engineering faculty (Kawakoshi), and Nippon Institute of Technology (Miyashiro-machi, Nishi Saitama-gun). In addition, it will include bodies under the jurisdiction of the Science and Technology Agency (STA): National Space Development Agency's Earth Observation Center (Hatoyama-machi, Hiki-gun), Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (Wako), and Research Development Corporation of Japan. In addition to fostering mutual understanding and cooperation between universities and research institutes based in Saitama, the forum will collect a broad range of opinions related to Saitama's future industrial promotion policies. Some of the broad topics they will discuss: 1) policies for cooperation between the prefecture's engineering schools, kohsetsushi institutes, and small to medium sized companies; 2) applications and utilization of research results by small to medium sized companies; 3) policies for administrative support of increasing exchange between industry, academia, and government. Regular meetings are planned at the rate of two per year beginning in FY 1994. Until now the separate efforts of sections -- such as the industry, academia, and government section and the industrial promotion section -- of the industry division have promoted cooperation among the research institutes' professors and researchers. In FY 1992-1993 approximately 40 members participated in study groups on joint research between industry, academia, and government and on the investigation delivering grants and ventures given grants. It is thought that the start of the forum will strengthen cooperative links between the prefecture's universities and research institutes.
