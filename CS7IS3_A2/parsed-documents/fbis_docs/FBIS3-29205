The United States apparently plans to put pressure on Japan because Japan has rejected U.S. demands to abolish or reduce tariffs on forest products and other items. The Japanese Government has raised objections, charging that "the United States is breaking its promises." The Uruguay Round of trade talks came to a successful conclusion on 15 December 1993 when GATT member nations agreed on abolishing or reducing tariffs. Since then, the United States has demanded that Japan further reduce or abolish tariffs on such items as forest products and nonferrous metal products. Japan, however, has rejected such demands, asserting that agreements have already been reached. During trade negotiations at the Uruguay Round talks, Japan had staunchly demanded that tariffs on electronic equipment be abolished. In this connection, the U.S. plan to withdraw its proposed tariff cuts could be considered a retaliatory move against Japan.
