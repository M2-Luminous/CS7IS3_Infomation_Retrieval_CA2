Ryslash said today. Kiev maintains relations with 132 states and has 44 diplomatic missions, Ryslash pointed out when opening the first Ukrainian Embassy in Latin America. Present at the ceremony, among others, were: Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the Cuban parliament; Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of State; and Isabel Allende Karam, vice foreign minister. In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon emphasized the significance of the event as this is the first Ukrainian diplomatic office in Latin America. The Ukrainian flag was raised over a building located in the Miramar area, in western Havana, while a memorandum of bilateral cooperation in various fields was being signed at the same time. The document, signed by the mayors of Havana and Kiev, Pedro Chavez and Leonid G. Kosakivskiy, contributes to strengthening the ties between the two important cities and calls for the development of economic relations. Kiev, with a population of some 3 million, wants to obtain pharmaceuticals in exchange for food and other merchandise, said city Deputy Mayor Aleksandr Taranenko, who thanked the Cuban Government for the medical assistance given to the 12,000 children of his country affected by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl. The signed document represents one more step in the improvement of ties between the two states, said Mayor Kosakivskiy moments before attending a meeting with Sergio Corrieri, president of the Cuban Friendship With the Peoples Institute (ICAP). The Ukrainian delegation led by Vice Foreign Minister Ryslash arrived in this city on Sunday and will return home next Friday.
