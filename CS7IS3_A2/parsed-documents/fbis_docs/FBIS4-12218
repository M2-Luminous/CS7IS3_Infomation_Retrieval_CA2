Tunisia's Agency for External Communications (ATCE) formally notified us yesterday of this without further details. Explanations were to be found in the previous day's issue of the government-controlled daily LA PRESSE. Under the headline "Tunisia's Dignity and Its People's Honor Foremost," the paper attacked, without quoting it, an article by a Tunisian intellectual that was published in LIBERATION's "Rebounds" section on 23 March. The article's author, who lives in exile in France, was expressing his reaction to the reelection of head of state Zine el Abidine Ben Ali with 99.92 percent of the votes. Condemning the absence of "a democratization process" in his country, he gave his support to the former president of the Tunisian Human Rights League, Moncef Marzouki, who had not been allowed to run in the presidential election. Contrary to LA PRESSE's allegations, the Tunisian Government did not use its right of reply in LIBERATION, but prompted instead a representative of a "Confederation of Tunisian Associations in France" to submit two texts. LIBERATION was unable to publish these texts due to the personal nature of their attacks as well as a total lack of sound arguments. We need not remind readers that the "Rebounds" section is an opinion column reserved for outside contributors. In any case, our Tunisian readers were denied any opportunity to read the offending article, as LIBERATION was not made available in Tunisia that day, as is the case every time the paper deals with that country's political situation. The ban on LIBERATION is but the latest in a long series of measures against foreign media. The BBC correspondent for Tunisia was expelled in mid-February, and the offices of Kuwaiti agency KUNA were closed down temporarily. [French] newspapers LE MONDE and LE MONDE DIPLOMATIQUE as well as British daily THE GUARDIAN were banned in turn. Last week, the Tunisian authorities turned back the lawyer of "Reporters Without Frontiers, an international organization working to preserve the freedom of the press. As to Moncef Marzouki, whose candidacy had caused an uproar in Tunisia, he is currently in jail.
