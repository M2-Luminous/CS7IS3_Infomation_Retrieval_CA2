Just how far this is possible will be determined by how employment develops. This position can be found in our old and new election program and has also been enshrined in law for some time. There is no intention of changing it in any way. For this reason we reject the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] position of announcing in advance, regardless of economic developments, a four-year freeze for the AOW, social security, and salaries of civil servants, teachers, and health care workers. In our election program we have not chosen the easiest way: We promise no pots of gold, nor do we promise the maintenance of purchasing power nor a permanent and full linkage between AOW and wage levels. The PvdA only promises that the purchasing power of AOW pensioners will not fall behind the purchasing power of those earning (higher) incomes, regardless of whether or not the link between AOW and wages is applied. Positive Message Perhaps it would be easier to call for the AOW to follow wage levels in comings years (as the VVD [Union for Freedom and Democracy] does). That suggests a positive message, which, however, is not there. But by doing so we would disavow both our own program and the law: They both state that the relationship of the number of working people to the number of AOW pensioners and people receiving benefit is an important issue. To translate it into popular terms: If employment increases by more than 100,000 jobs, then there would be economic leeway to allow AOW and social benefits to follow wages. Everyone must understand that such leeway does not exist in a year when unemployment increases by 100,000 people. But in such a year the government should ensure that income ratios remain fair using taxation and social bonuses. This explanation alone proves that the PvdA is not seeking to win people over with empty promises. Voters do not believe in "higher wages and lower prices." Furthermore the world economy cannot be influenced from The Hague. Therefore, it is irresponsible to promise in February 1994 that some two million AOW pensioners plus several hundred thousand unemployed and people who are unable to work can follow salary levels every year until 1998. Even reduced The fact that the VVD is saying this tells more about the VVD than the economy. When the VVD had some influence in the government in the 1980's, the AOW never matched wage developments. On the contrary: The AOW was even reduced. To promise the opposite now -- while in the opposition -- of course lacks complete credibility. But the opposite is also true: To decide in advance on a four-year freeze, as the CDA has done, provides no room for the annual assessment which the law requires. Or does the CDA not believe that its election program can have a positive influence on employment? Working together on work: young and old, rich and poor. Each contributing as he can afford. We are convinced that in this way it is possible to create some 100,000 new jobs over the next four years. The CDA has set the same goal, but says that a four-year freeze is necessary. That is a clear choice, but it differs from the PvdA's choice. So in contrast to what is often claimed, the voters on 3 May do have something to choose.
