Peres sent a letter and Rabin sent Shahal to the Knesset podium to deny it. It is an embarrassing event, perhaps the most embarrassing since this government was founded. The biggest scandal is not the contents of the letter but the attempt to deny its existence. Up to now, we have known that one party to the Oslo agreement -- Yasir 'Arafat -- has a credibility problem. Now we are starting to understand that the other side has a problem, too. The letter was sent after tough wrangling between Israel and the PLO. 'Arafat demanded the personal status of patron of the Christian and Muslim holy sites, as well as a permanent political entity in East Jerusalem. Israel wanted to totally circumvent the Jerusalem issue. In the end, if our government sources yesterday told the whole truth, 'Arafat gave up including the Jerusalem issue in the agreement and its annexes. Israel, for its part, agreed to send Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst a letter summing up Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem. The letter has an annex containing sections on Jerusalem from Peres' speech to the Knesset -- that is, if they are telling the whole truth. The letter undertakes to uphold and respect all the Palestinian institutions in the eastern part of the city: They are performing an essential task. Israel will not hamper their activity; on the contrary, it will encourage them. The same holds true for the Muslim and Christian holy sites. This implies the beginning of recognition of 'Arafat's preeminent status over Christian and Muslim assets in East Jerusalem -- not Saudi Arabia's, not Jordan's, not even an international body's, but the PLO's. It, of course, involves recognition of the activity of the PLO institutions in Jerusalem. 'Arafat was inaccurate when he said in his Johannesburg speech that the undertaking was given to him in Cairo, but he did not lie when he said that he had received a commitment. Dan Meridor suspected that there was some truth to 'Arafat's remarks. He should be praised for his investigation. Twice, Moshe Shahal got up in the name of the government to clarify 'Arafat's remarks, and twice he said there was no letter. Shahal received his information from Eytan Haber, head of the prime minister's bureau. Shim'on Peres was on a tour of North and Latin America at the time. He did not know whether the government was telling the truth. Last week, Rabin addressed the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Meridor called on Beni Begin to question the prime minister. Begin exerted pressure; Rabin wriggled out of by answering: "To the best of my knowledge, there is no letter to 'Arafat." It was a semiadmission. It is true that the letter was not addressed to 'Arafat but to Holst. It is true that the Rabin government did not hurt the status quo in Jerusalem. It was the Shamir government that approved the activities of the PLO institutions in Jerusalem, under the direction of Orient House. It made a grave mistake, from its point of view. In fact, Peres wrote to Holst what Shamir had authorized for al-Husayni. That does not significantly change the fact that Rabin and Peres were caught with their pants down. For days, they have been humoring us with the story that the Peres letter is merely a reiteration of the position he expressed in the Knesset debate on the Oslo agreement. I read the speech and the letter. In the speech, Peres said that "each community in Jerusalem can uphold its cultural tradition, its special character, its social, religious, and other institutions." He barely deserves a passing grade for the resemblance between the two versions. For months we were told that 'Arafat represents a different culture, a different mentality. We are responsible for every word we utter; he lies through his teeth. The letter incident has somewhat blurred the differences. This may be the new Middle East Peres has been talking about so much.
