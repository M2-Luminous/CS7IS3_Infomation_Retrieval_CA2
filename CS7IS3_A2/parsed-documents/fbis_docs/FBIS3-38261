[Text] Rome -- So what about this squaring of the circle? "I do not know whether bringing the League into a program agreement was an attempt to square the circle, as [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli says. I know that it was my duty to try. I could have met with [League Secretary] Bossi and [League's lower house floor leader] Maroni in secret. But I decided to do so out in the open. I preferred to present a proposal in black and white. Of course, since the signing there has been some opposition. What can I do about it? Now people will see. They will form their own assessment." So is it all over? "Well, judging from the League's communiques...." What, then? "I would say that a major opportunity has been thrown away." Mario Segni feels embittered. The other evening success seemed to have been achieved. But instead.... "Bossi's veto against the Popular Party is ridiculous. Ridiculous. It splits the liberal democratic area. It consigns part of it to the left...." [Stella] So what was it? A trap to get rid of you? [Segni] What does it matter? [Stella] It does matter: Is it or is it not true that the League regards you as the only person that can deprive it of votes in a certain area? [Segni] If so, they are miscalculating. Because while I may appear naive, they look like crafty fellows. So I will be even more competitive than before. I think, rather, that there is major unrest within the League. That there are several conflicting thrusts. In any case, I would not have been criticized if I had not acted out in the open. [Stella] [PPI Deputy] Bodrato says that only the naive do not realize that Bossi is bringing his adversaries closer in order to be better able to attack them.... [Segni] I have not been attacked. It is the chance of creating a major accord for Italy that has been attacked. [Stella] Some people are saying, it serves you right for trusting someone like Bossi who said: "Segni is a slimy snail...." [Segni] Let us leave personal matters aside. I have tried to transcend them. What we have attempted remains the only strong proposal for building an alternative to the left wing forces. The proposal of an accord based for the first time not on identities but on a government platform. In the same spirit as the referendum. And for 24 hours it did raise the hopes of millions of Italians. [Stella] The fact remains that after finishing with you, Maroni went off to telephone Berlusconi to tell him to be ready.... [Segni] I am not concerned with other people's conduct. What concerns me is facts. [Stella] Do you mean that the document that begins "There is only one Italy, and it is indivisible" is more of a fact than Bossi's veto against that "chicken thief," Martinazzoli? [Segni] I told you: Bossi has shouldered a huge responsibility. A large proportion of League voters are moderates. To win them over to a liberal democratic platform, persuading them to transcend the phase of destructive protest, is essential to Italian democracy. And everything that can be done in this direction must be done. The document that was approved was perfect. Of course words are also deeds. [Stella] Did you not ask Maroni whether or not he had real authority? [Segni] He was officially authorized. We explicitly asked that. [Stella] Whether he was authorized to sign? [Segni] Whether he was authorized to negotiate. The answer was affirmative. So we proceeded. [Stella] Was this due to some misunderstanding on Maroni's part, or... [Segni] Maroni seemed to me to be sincere and in good faith. But let us return to what we were discussing before. The effort that we made was to escape from the old rules. Those whereby the parties proceed on their own and form agreements after. Whoever undermines such an opportunity is shouldering a huge responsibility. [Stella] Do you think that Bossi changed course because of the complaints that immediately arose within the League? [Segni] I repeat: I think that there are some huge tensions within the League. [Stella] Do you think that he represents only part of the League members? [Segni] How should I know? I think that there are huge tensions. [Stella] You now seem to be left with no choice: You are left with Martinazzoli, Amato, any nonconfessionals that are amenable.... [Segni] I am opting for the Pact for Italy, which addresses itself to all Italians. Primarily, of course, to the Catholic and nonconfessional areas. The PPI and part of the nonconfessionals had already granted their support. I hope that other nonconfessionals will now join. [Stella] Have you felt prompted to suspect that the purpose of all this was to pave the way for Berlusconi? [Segni] Of course, if this option had succeeded, it would have been a hindrance to him. But what has happened has not helped him. Berlusconi had already made his mind up beforehand. [Stella] But it did clear away the last obstacles, did it not? [Segni] Maybe. But it seems to me that he decided to enter the arena long ago. [Stella] with regard to the moderate pole, Montanelli wrote in CORRIERE DELLA SERA: "Assuming that we succeed, we will be creating merely yet another agglomeration of wreckage and hucksters." [Segni] Well, there have always been fears. But together with the stopgap measures and the resistance, I also perceive great thrusts. And I also see many new people that want to stand as candidates. There is an impetus in ordinary society that will emerge in these elections, even though there will still be a long way to go. [Stella] Do you think, as [PPI Deputy] Buttiglione does, that "however badly things have gone over the League, at least we have clarified matters?" [Segni] Certainly. But I will tell you something else. The underlying impetus behind the League voters' rapprochement with the liberal democratic area is inexorable. If the leadership supports it, it could guide it itself. Otherwise it will lose control of it. The North cannot remain bound to mere protest. It wants to build a new Italy. [Stella] Did you see Berlusconi's message? How did it strike you? [Segni] I have already said this several times: I am afraid that it is something that will make this area even more fragmented than it is now. [Stella] Galli della Loggia says that it seems highly artificial. [Segni] I am not interested in such definitions. I know that it is not Giscard's party. [Stella] Is it more like Ross Perot's? Or Peron's? [Segni] Let us drop the subject. [Stella] What about these opinion polls, according to which one in four Italians longs to be governed by Berlusconi? [Segni] I think that they are of very little value two months away from the elections. [Stella] Feltri has written that Berlusconi enjoys the support of honest, hard-working people who pay their taxes and obey traffic signals... [Segni] Well, I think that such people support the Pact for Italy much more. [Stella] Augusto Barbera says that even though you have made some "turnabouts" you are no turncoat. What does that mean? [Segni] That ever since our first rallies the programs that we have put forward have been the same -- the struggle against state control, the completion of the institutional reforms.... All this, based on Catholic and nonconfessional culture. I have merely tried to extend this front and to persuade the League to adopt these stances. It would have been a major achievement. It had to be attempted. [Stella] What now? [Segni] We will proceed. Whoever support us, supports us.
