The two countries also signed an agreement on cooperation in export processing zone development. The two agreements were signed here by P.K. Chiang and Nigerian Trade and Commerce Minister Melford Okilo on behalf of their respective governments. Okilo, who arrived in Taipei Monday for a trade promotion tour, said Taiwan businessmen are welcome to invest in Nigeria. "Nigeria spans a large area and has a huge population and rich natural resources," Okilo said. "We welcome foreign investment to help boost our economic development." Chiang said Nigeria is an important country in West Africa. "It is also a promising market worthy of exploration by our businessmen," he noted. Chiang said Taiwan will help the oil-rich African country develop an export processing zone (EPZ) in Calabar, a port city in southeastern Nigeria. Nigeria has sent personnel to Taiwan to study EPZ administration and other related expertise during the past two years. Chiang said Taiwan will use its international economic cooperation development fund to offer practical training for more Nigerian administrators and professionals following the signing of the EPZ cooperative agreement. Taiwan does not maintain an embassy in Nigeria, but has a representative office in Nigeria's largest city of Lagos and a consulate-general in Calabar. Taiwan exported U.S.$140 million worth of goods to Nigeria in 1993, but no official records of imports from that country was available. In addition to Nigeria, Taiwan has signed similar investment protection agreements with 11 other countries -- Argentina, Indonesia, Latvia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.
