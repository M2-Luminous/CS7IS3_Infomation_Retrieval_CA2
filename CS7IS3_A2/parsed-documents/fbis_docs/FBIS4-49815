Governor Jia Zhijie, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, and Vice Governor Meng Qingping made speeches. Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, stressed several questions. Vice Governor Zhang Baojiang, the mayor of Wuhan, attended the meeting. First of all, Jia Zhijie made an analysis of our province's political and economic situation, saying: Like the other parts of the country, our province's political and economic situation is fine on the whole. The party Central Committee's principle of grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability has become the consensus of the people throughout the province. The several major reform measures adopted by the central authorities are being implemented smoothly. The economy is developing a cycle of sustained, rapid, and healthy growth. The momentum of agricultural production is gratifying. Summer grain and oil-bearing crops are doing well universally, and a bumper harvest is in the offing. Town and township enterprises continue to maintain their breakthrough development momentum. With a relatively good takeoff at the beginning of this year, industrial production maintained comparatively high growth for the second time since the Seventh Five-Year Plan was implemented. The market is brisk, with the sales of major commodities increasing by a wide margin. The financial situation is generally stable. Foreign trade exports have registered rapid expansion. What is commendable is that party committees and governments at all levels, as well as various departments, trades, and professions are trying to overtake each other in friendly emulation. They are in high spirits, full of drive in vying with each other in the race against time, and going all-out for development. Nevertheless, we also must notice that this year is of crucial importance to deepening reform and establishing a socialist market economy structure. Contradictions in various aspects of our endeavor are complicated. Some temporary difficulties in economic life are relatively pronounced. Some destabilizing factors in social life are growing in number. If they are not remedied in real earnest, they possibly may affect social stability. Therefore, he particularly stressed the need to handle correctly the relationship between reform, development, and stability. He pointed out: Stability is the most important task at present. As for the relationship between stability, on the one hand, and reform and development, on the other, stability is of overriding importance. He said: The most pronounced issue affecting stability at present is that state-owned enterprises are not invigorated, the amount of losses suffered by loss-making enterprises is increasing, and the number of enterprises completely or partially suspending production is expanding continuously. This being the case, the province should mobilize itself urgently and do its utmost to invigorate state-owned enterprises and help them get out of their dilemma so as to ensure social stability. He pointed out: The fundamental way to invigorate state-owned enterprises is to deepen reform and effectively change the way they operate. In light of current conditions, however, we should adopt emergency measures in accordance with the principle of taking both stopgap and radical measures. First, we should solve the current most pronounced fund- shortage problem, raise funds through various channels, and regenerate those enterprises completely or partially suspending production. So far, the provincial authorities have raised one billion yuan in funds and will use the money to regenerate some enterprises that have completely or partially suspended production and to solve the "triangle debt" problem among enterprises. Second, we should firmly lighten the burdens of enterprises. Third, we should adopt supporting measures in policy terms. He especially pointed out: We should practice a policy of tilting to large and medium-sized state-owned cotton textile industrial enterprises. Currently, we should devote great efforts to organizing cotton supplies and help a number of selected cotton spinning enterprises overcome their cotton shortages. He went on to stress: Party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen leadership over the work of maintaining stability, with the principal leading comrades taking up the job personally. On the one hand, they must solve the pronounced problems in social life. On the other, they should invigorate state-owned enterprises, lighten enterprise burdens, and carry out in a down-to-earth manner the various measures designed to maintain stability, right down to the grass-roots units. Efforts should be made to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy and to achieve our province's overall goal of overfulfilling the plan, catching up with the nation, lifting the economy to a new level, and every trade and profession making a new breakthrough. Vice Governor Meng Qingping made a speech specially dealing with the contradictions and problems currently facing enterprises. He emphatically pointed out: It is necessary to attach great importance to the problem of demanding forced donations from enterprises, thus placing unreasonable burdens on them, and to take it as an important task of implementing the central authorities' principles and maintaining social stability to curb the collection of apportionments of expenses and to lighten enterprise burdens. In conclusion, Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, stressed: Currently, we must effectively cut the number of meetings to a minimum, go down to the grass-roots units, keep in touch with the masses, devote great efforts to maintaining stability, and ensure reform and development with stability. He went on to stress: A solid job should be done in the propaganda orientation of public opinion and in the comprehensive management of public security.
