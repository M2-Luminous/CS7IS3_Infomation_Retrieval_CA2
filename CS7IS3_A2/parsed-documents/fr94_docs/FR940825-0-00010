FR940825-0-00010 FR940825-0-00002 This rule will allow artichokes to be imported into the United States from Argentina and South Africa under certain conditions. Argentina produces approximately 165 million pounds of artichokes annually. We estimate that Argentina could export about 44,000 pounds of artichokes per year over the next 3 years to the United States. This volume of artichoke imports will constitute about 2.0 percent of current total imports to the United States, less than 0.10 percent of current domestic production, and less than 0.10 percent of the current total artichoke supply in the United States (domestic and imports). Assuming that a less than 0.10 percent increase in the supply of artichokes would lead to an approximately 0.12 percent decrease in the domestic price of artichokes (using the price elasticity for fresh vegetables, ^0.320), we estimate that this increase in supply will result in a price decrease of about $0.038 per hundredweight (cwt), or $0.00038 per pound, from an original price of $33.40 per cwt. As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in the total revenue of domestic artichoke producers of about $45,000, roughly 0.12 percent of their total revenue of $39.2 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing artichokes to be imported into the United States from Argentina will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers. Allowing artichokes to be imported from South Africa will have an even smaller impact on domestic producers. Production data for South Africa is not available. South Africa's total exports of artichokes were less than 2,000 pounds in 1991 and less than 700 pounds in 1992. Even if South Africa exported 2,000 pounds annually to the United States, which is unlikely, the price decrease would be negligible, as would be the decrease in total revenue. Therefore, allowing artichokes to be imported from South Africa also will not have a significant economic impact on domestic artichoke producers. Asparagus In 1987, 3,033 domestic producers harvested asparagus. It is likely that most of these producers would be classified as small entities by SBA standards. In 1992, domestic producers harvested 135 million pounds of asparagus for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $116 million. This rule will allow asparagus to be imported into the United States from Thailand under certain conditions. In 1992, Thailand produced approximately 26.5 million pounds of asparagus and exported 5.5 million pounds. Japan imported 80 percent of Thailand's asparagus exports (4.4 million pounds), with the remaining 20 percent imported by five other countries. Currently, there is no reported excess supply of asparagus in Thailand. We expect annual asparagus imports into the United States from Thailand will be minimal, possibly 220,000 pounds, as a result of this rule. This volume of asparagus would constitute about 0.38 percent of current total imports to the United States, about 0.16 percent of current domestic production, and about 0.11 percent of the current total asparagus supply in the United States. Assuming that an 0.11 percent increase in the supply of asparagus would lead to a decrease of about 0.36 percent in the domestic price of asparagus (using the price elasticity for fresh vegetables, ^0.320), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $0.31 per cwt, or $0.0031 per pound, from an original price of $86.00 per cwt. As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue of domestic asparagus producers of about $415,000, roughly 0.36 percent of the original total revenue of $116 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing asparagus to be imported from Thailand will not have a significant economic impact on domestic asparagus producers. Blueberries In 1987, 3,911 farms in 36 states harvested 109.4 million pounds of cultivated blueberries. Additionally, 501 farms in six of the same states harvested 32.6 million pounds of wild blueberries. It is likely that most of these producers would be classified as small entities by SBA standards. In 1992, domestic producers harvested 44.7 million pounds of blueberries for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $48.0 million. This rule will allow blueberries to be imported into the United States from Ecuador and Peru under certain conditions. Blueberry production and export data are not available for either Ecuador or Peru. Blueberries are not a formal crop in either country; they only grow wild. There is limited local consumption near the production areas. We anticipate that an insignificant amount of blueberries, if any, will be exported to the United States from either country as a resulted of this action. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing blueberries to be imported from Ecuador and Peru will not have a significant economic impact on domestic blueberry producers. Sweet Cherries In 1987, 7,171 domestic producers harvested sweet cherries. It is likely that most of these producers would be classified as small entities by SBA standards. In 1992, domestic producers harvested 191 million pounds of sweet cherries produced for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $115 million.
