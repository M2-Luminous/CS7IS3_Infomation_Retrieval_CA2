"This agreement is extremely important, as it inaugurates a more normal relationship with the EU," said Ortega, after signing the agreement with Rene Steichen, European agricultural official, at the EU headquarters in Brussels. The agreement reached last week in Brussels is temporary, until the commitments of the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks -- which are improved in this agreement -- go into effect in 1995. Chile promised to immediately withdraw the charges submitted to GATT against the European Community regulation on the importation of apples and pears with reference prices and compensatory rates penalizing the low price imports. As a result of the Chilean-EU agreement, the tariffs Chile had to pay on its exports of apples and pears have been reduced by half. Therefore, the current tariff of 6 percent for apples drops to 3 percent and the tariff of 4 percent for pears drops to 2 percent. The agreement also established that the entrance price of these fruits can drop to 12 percent (it is currently 8 percent) below the European reference price without receiving the penalty of the highest EU tariff (54 percent), but rather a lower tariff of 11 percent. The basis to be taken into account for the overall calculation of the entrance prices of apples and pears into the EU will also be 60 percent of the total amount at the lowest sale prices, instead of the current 30 percent. In addition, after Chilean apples' absence from the price list on the European market for four days (instead of the current six), the compensatory rate will be eliminated. Steichen expressed his satisfaction over a "friendly solution" having been found to this conflict, which began in September 1993 when Chile decided to file charges. [passage omitted]
