Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today states that it is not the North but the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique of South Korea who are scheming a war on the Korean peninsula. The news analyst says: The Kim Yong-sam group adopted a "policy of tough response" to the North at a "high-level strategic meeting." It worked out long ago a war scenario against the North codenamed New Operation Plan 5027, and promoted a plan for introducing Patriot missiles, crying for "a prompt entry into action" and "surprise operation." The Kim Yong-sam group is driving the situation to the brink of war against fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. In this it seeks to stifle the DPRK with "strength," realise its ambition for unification by invading the North and prolong its power with the military support of its master. The Kim Yong-sam group is a gang of treacherous political charlatans most dependent on outside forces among the successive rulers of South Korea. In order to ease the tensions in Korea, save the nation from disaster and promote peace and peaceful reunification of the country, the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK must be changed and such traitors as Kim Yong-sam be removed from power in South Korea.
