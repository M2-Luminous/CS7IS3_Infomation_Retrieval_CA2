The unofficial office of the Senate (?wants) the parliamentary plan to be sent to them so they can look into it. The following is a report by Daly Valet: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Stanley Schrager spoke at the beginning of the week, saying that the parliamentary plan would be voted on in the Senate this week. From 14 March through 17 March, the Senate situation has remained the same. Nothing has changed. The days that pass at the Senate look like one another: The Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP] senators are meeting in camera; the Senate session room is empty; and Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the legitimate office, has been absent since the most recent clashes of last week. The problem of two offices within the Senate has remained unchanged despite negotiations and discussions underway among the ACP senators. How can the parliamentary plan come to a vote in this situation of confusion? We know the office presided over by Firmin Jean-Louis has already received a copy of the resolution passed in the Chamber of Deputies. But has Bernard Sansaricq's unofficial office been informed of the parliamentary plan? [Senator Osny Eugene] No, Daly, until now, we have not been officially informed of the plan passed by the parliamentarians in the lower chamber. We have heard about the plan through the press. We expect the lower chamber to inform us of this plan so we can look into it. [Valet] This answer is the stand of Osny Eugene, quaestor of the unofficial office, who will apparently continue to hear about the plan in the press because it is the office presided over by Firmin Jean-Louis that the Chamber of Deputies has acknowledged for work on the issue. Eugene says he does not give much importance to the parliamentary plan. According to him, a plan signed in Washington does not deserve much importance. [Eugene] [passage omitted] We have nothing against the fact that a plan was discussed in Washington but, as long as the plan has not yet been concluded here in Haiti, it is very difficult for us to give it importance. We think there are enough people in this country. There are enough institutions to look into the presentation of a plan. I see no reason for us to go as far as Washington for a plan. [Valet] As an 18 January parliamentarian, the quaestor of the unofficial office, has sworn hundreds of times that he will not allow anybody to ask him to abstain so the parliamentary plan can be voted on by the Senate.
