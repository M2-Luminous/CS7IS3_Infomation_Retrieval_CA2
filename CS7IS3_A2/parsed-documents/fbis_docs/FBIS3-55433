During the talks, the officials briefed one another on the current situation in the two countries, laying special emphasis on finding ways for achieving real cooperation in the future between the two countries. They also tackled financial, economic, law-making, social, and political issues. Lucinschi presented the situation in the eastern and southern rayons of Moldova, detailing the difficulties facing the leadership of Moldova in ensuring legality in those areas. In that context, Lucinschi made some remarks referring to the situation of the Ilie Ilascu group [imprisoned and sentenced to death by the authorities of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic], assessing that within a short time, the entire group will be transferred to Chisinau and handed over to the authorities of Moldova. Assessing Romanian-Moldova relations, the speaker of the Moldovan Parliament asserted that, unfortunately, the results obtained so far in the furthering of those ties do not correspond to what was originally intended and expressed his hope that in the future the cooperation between the two states will develop from mere declarations to concrete actions, including in the law-making field. The meeting was also attended by Marian Enache, Romania's ambassador to Chisinau.
