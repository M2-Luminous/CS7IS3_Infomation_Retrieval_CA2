It would request the opposing parties to display self-control and not inflict further suffering on a civilian population already sorely tried by the war. It reaffirms its support for the principle of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and calls for a peaceful solution to the conflict. Given the danger of internationalization, which could aggravate the situation, it would urge the parties concerned to cease fighting and implement the relevant resolutions of the United Nations security council. The European Union requests the opposing parties to resume current negotiations immediately under the aegis of the CSCE Minsk group and fully backs those negotiations.
