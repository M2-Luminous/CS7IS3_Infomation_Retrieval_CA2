After the National Anthem, the President gave a short address. "I greet you on the occasion of your gathering as the second freely and democratically elected National Assembly of the Republic of Hungary. I must note with pride that the 1994 general elections went smoothly and faultlessly, showing the strength and maturity of our democracy. High electoral turnout shows that Hungarian people care for their own future and are consciously ready to express their political opinion and will." Goncz thanked all those who helped organize the elections. ``The Parliament is Hungary's supreme public-law body, with responsibility for the future of the country. "Its accomplishments determine our life day by day. The National Assembly is based on the past, tried by the present, and judged by the future," Goncz said. "How Hungary's citizens see our democracy work depends on you. And Hungarians all over the world, who are bound to Hungary not by legal ties but a common past, language, culture, fate, and vital interests, will also watch your moves carefully," Goncz continued. ``I beg you -- never forget that legislative work and duties do not put Parliament above society, but oblige it to serve society. ``It is not my place to sum up or even touch on the four years' work of the previous Parliament. Nor will I answer the frequently recurring question whether the nation has voted for or against something. But I believe I can firmly state that people voted in hope that their expectations will be fulfilled in the future, and they would like to see life secure and predictable -- and peaceful. "People want to follow a route that advances the country in time instead of taking it back to some earlier stage, allowing as much of the past to be built on as needed to stabilise the future."
