"And we do not see a tendency toward reduction of state expenditures, which is clearly not within Russia's power," stated the deputy director of the Institute of Economics of Problems of the Transition Period [IEPTP], Sergey Sinelnikov, at an international conference organized by the IEPTP. Thus, while in 1993, according to the institute's estimates, the deficit amounted to 10 percent of the GNP, during the first quarter of this year, it was 11 percent. And the budget continues to be in debt to a number of spheres and branches of the economy. In turn, this debt returns like a boomerang as nonpayments from enterprises not only to one another and the banks but also to the budget itself. The real amount of the value-added tax is decreasing. Taxes are devalued by inflation, which was conditioned, in the words of IEPTP Director Yegor Gaydar, by the 8-percent growth of the money supply in April. In the future, because of the issuance of money, inflation is expected to be at a monthly level of 12-15 percent. In such conditions, the resolve of the Central Bank to normalize the credit sphere by reducing the rate for refinancing, which in recent weeks has decreased by 5 percent, remains only a good intention. Rejection of the policy of monetarism, in the opinion of IEPTP specialists promises nothing good. In the opinion of institute experts, if the government had paid of state debts, the budget deficit would have been twice as great at the end of 1993 and would have reached 20-22 percent of the GNP. But, covering it with credit emission from the Central Bank would only exacerbate inflation, which in any case is apparently approaching the limit of social tolerance. Viktor Chernomyrdin's government, participants in the conference noted, during the first quarter did not refrain from decisions that generated further expectations of inflation. Fulfilling the commitments made by the cabinet for last year alone would require funds in the amount of 1.5 times the GNP. Obviously, this cannot be done merely by increasing the revenue side of the budget. But, there has been a clear tendency toward its reduction since last summer. Thus, while in 1992 the revenues amounted to about 16 percent of the GNP and, during the first half of 1993, 13 percent, in the second half it was only 7 percent. The average annual volume of budget revenues thus amounted to 10 percent and, taking into account centralized exports, 13-14 percent of the GNP. During the first quarter of this year, this indicator dropped to 8.1 percent and for the past four months, to 7.1 percent. The reduction of revenues is exacerbated by the decline of prices on the world market for oil, aluminum, and other exported kinds of raw material and products. The 1994 draft budget envisions incomes of 16.5-16.7 percent of the GNP. But, in the opinion of IEPTP experts, one can realistically count on only 9-11 percent. At the same time, the planned budget expenditures remain at last year's level, 25 percent of the GNP. Groups representing the interests of the military-industrial complex, the coal miners, the agrarians, and others are lobbying in the State Duma for increasing budget expenditures. Under their pressure it is possible to keep the budget deficit within reasonable limits only by reducing other expenditure items--on the social sphere, science, education, and public health. In the investment policy, in the opinion of IEPTP specialists, it is necessary to take a selective approach. Today, when 5,000 out of 22,000 large enterprises are standing idle, 58 percent of the capacities of industry are operating at a loss and are not eligible for investment support. Investments are actually needed for structural rearrangement of the economy. But the financial resources are not adequate for that either. Gaydar experts think that there is reason to hope for help from abroad, in particular since during the next few days in Moscow there will be negotiations between the Central Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance and the IMF mission concerning Russia's receiving $4 billion in credits this autumn. As was reported at the international conference in the IEPTP, a meeting of the government presidium regarding the creation of a consultative council on foreign investment under the prime minister is earmarked for the beginning of June. It is anticipated that it will meet twice a year--alternately in Moscow and London.
