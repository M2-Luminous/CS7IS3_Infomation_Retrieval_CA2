The apparatus categorically refused to give details of the meeting, saying it was of a confidential nature. However, it was learned in a telephone conversation with a representative of Karimov's administration that a communique was signed on the results of the meeting. ITAR-TASS has learned that the meeting in Karakol was devoted to the problems of creating an effective mechanism for a single economic zone in the region. Observers are expressing the supposition that they were discussing the possibility of a regional transformation of the idea of creating a Eurasian union. We remind you that in Moscow on 29 March Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed the creation of a new association of CIS member states -- a Eurasian union. At that time he said that if the idea did not find sufficient support in the CIS, a Eurasian union could be joined by individual states. Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian union of states proposes the formation of supranational bodies to coordinate economic, defense, and foreign policy; the formation of a single parliament and councils of defense and foreign ministers; and the introduction of common citizenship. The idea of creating a Eurasian union met with a restrained reaction from leaders of CIS member countries. They described it as interesting, but premature. Therefore, one can suppose with some confidence that on the shore of Lake Issyk-Kul the presidents of Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan jointly launched an "integration offensive" within the framework of bringing regional interests closer together.
