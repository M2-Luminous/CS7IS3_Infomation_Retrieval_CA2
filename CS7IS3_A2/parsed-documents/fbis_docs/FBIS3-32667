It is also believed that Castellanos will be released quite soon. In a communique, the organization stated that, "following Red Cross International (IRC) criterion, IRC delegates were allowed to see the hostage, who sent a memento to his relatives." Castellanos was abducted from his ranch by members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). The rebels "tried" him and sentenced him life in prison. That decision was later overturned. The organization's communique added that "if an agreement regarding any hostage release can be reached, the IRC is ready to meet its commitment as a neutral intermediary." A majority of people in San Cristobal believe that Castellanos will be released very soon. Some reports say that the event may even take place this very Sunday. Other sources, however, say Castellanos will be freed after the first round of talks between the EZLN and the government. The place and date for the talks is still unknown, although it is believed that they may begin in the next few days.
