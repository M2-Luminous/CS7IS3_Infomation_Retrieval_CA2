Hajrudin Fermic reports from Maglaj on "the Serbian aggressor's fierce attacks on the free territories" and says that "tank and mortar shells are occasionally (?pounding) all the front lines and chetnik snipers are looking for civilian victims in the northern part of the city." A correspondent whose name is indistinct reports that "Olovo was again a target of the aggressor's attacks yesterday. During the day, long-range artillery was occasionally used to attack the defense lines. In the evening, [words indistinct] (?villages) came under heavy fire from the aggressor's howitzers, guns, and mortars." He says that "in Olovo this morning the enemy army is making infantry provocations." Mirza Sadikovic reports from the Bihac region that "despite Yasushi Akashi's open invitation for NATO aircraft to be used to prevent the Serbian aggressor from running further amok in the Bihac region, they have nevertheless continued their [word indistinct] practice of ignoring the international public." He says that "artillery and tank activity against the center of Bihac intensified in the afternoon and evening. There are many casualties, and incomplete information indicates that at least eight citizens have been seriously wounded. There are many more people with slight wounds and some have been killed. The material damage is huge. These activities then spread to the outskirts, to the Cazin commune region, as well as to major roads. As for the defense lines, the artillery and tank activity and attempts at infantry breakthroughs are incessant. For the first time since the beginning of the offensive, the chetniks have shelled Orjanska Glavica and (Culumak), while in the zone covered by the Headquarters of the Croatian Defense Council, chetnik artillery targeted [word indistinct] the front lines and the regions around (Skocaj). There have also been activities from the so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina. In this period, major infantry battles have taken place, in which our defenders managed to thwart new attempts to break through. In addition, the chetniks have introduced a new tactic--their snipers are using silencers. At the front lines facing the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy, there are sporadic provocations and artillery activity all the time, particularly in the Cazin regions of (Trbac) (?or) [word indistinct]."
