Comrade Wei Jianxing delivered a very good report to the session. I am in full agreement. We should redouble our efforts and make new progress on top of the achievements already made. Here I would like to address the following three issues: 1. A Realistic Assessment of the Achievements of the Anticorruption Drive in the Previous Period Half a year has passed since the Central Committee announced last August specific plans for intensifying the anticorruption drive, improving party work style, and promoting clean government. In assessing the work in the previous stage, we should, I think, stress the following four points: A) We have been fairly successful. Taken together, party committees, governments, discipline inspection, supervision, and judicial departments at all levels have worked actively and done a great deal of painstaking work in implementing the Central Committee's plans. We have, by and large, achieved the expected results. The broad ranks of cadres and people have responded positively and offered active support to the party and government in intensifying the anticorruption drive. Thanks to the common efforts of all quarters, we have achieved varying degrees of success in the three tasks set by the Central Committee for the near future. The momentum of spreading corrupt manifestations has been halted. The results are even more pronounced in localities and departments that have done a better job in implementing this work. Although the anticorruption drive involves considerable difficulties, we are able to cut, step by step, corrupt phenomena to a minimum so long as the leadership takes it seriously, enlists the participation of the masses, and works together with them with one heart and one mind. B) The work has proceeded in a healthy manner. In setting the short-term plan for fighting corruption, the Central Committee pronounced a number of specific principles and policies which have fundamentally guaranteed that this work will be closely integrated with reform and construction. Practice has shown that this work has -- rather than standing in the way of reform and construction -- served as an important guarantee for reform, opening up, and economic construction. C) Judging from the problems that have been exposed, corrupt phenomena are serious. Corruption has penetrated into broad sections of our society; in particular, it is corroding our party and government organs and the ranks of cadres. Criminal offenses including abusing powers for personal gains, participating in corrupt practices in violation of the law, taking or demanding bribes are widespread to an alarming degree. The situation tells us that if we do not fight this hard battle with resolution, the party and state are in deed in danger of collapse. D) The tasks are tremendous and we must not slacken our efforts. In view of the actual problems that are out there and the people's demands of us, the work we have done so far falls considerably short. Many problems have not been solved well and the masses remain dissatisfied. The work has been implemented unevenly from region to region and from department to department. Some localities and department relayed the plans and arrangements but did not pay enough attention to implementing them afterwards. Some even just went through the motions. Some localities and departments were guilty of gross protectionism and there has been obstruction and resistance to the investigations of major cases. Some leading cadres who still entertain all sorts of misconceptions about the anticorruption drive have not displayed adequate initiative. All in all, we must continue to pay close attention to the anticorruption drive. In short, we must affirm the achievements, take note of the problems, sum up experience, keep a clear head, and redouble our efforts to implement the anticorruption drive well. 2. Several Suggestions for the Anticorruption Drive in the Next Stage A) The Central Committee has set the basic principles and overall situation for the work of the whole party in 1994. The anticorruption drive must subordinate and serve these principles and overall situation and it must be implemented in a deepgoing, sustained, and more effective manner. This is the general requirement. B) The anticorruption drive cannot be accomplished overnight. Hence, we should solve problems one by one, investigate cases one by one, and deepen the drive step by step. A slightest relaxation of guard may spoil all that has been achieved. We must be prepared to fight a protracted battle and push the drive forward phase by phase. We must never provide a "pliable environment" for corrupt behavior; and we must never allow the corrupt elements to act willfully and get off scot-free. C) In addition to the three main tasks set by the Central Committee last August, the current session has put forward some new requirements. All localities and departments must combine these three tasks with the new requirements and earnestly investigate and solve outstanding problems in each locality or department. Those departments or localities that did not pay adequate attention to the drive in the previous stage must bestir themselves and catch up. D) We gained an important experience from the anticorruption drive in the early period; namely, we must firmly believe and rely on the masses and must combine the arousing of the masses to report corruption cases to the authorities with the special organs' investigating them according to law. The merit of this experience is that it can help uncover problems and promote the conducting of the drive in an orderly manner. We must continue to adhere to this experience. We must pay attention to protecting people who report corruption; and must commend and award those whose reports contribute to the drive. E) We must earnestly investigate and handle corruption problems exposed, especially major and important cases. We must never turn big problems into small problems and end up with nothing accomplished. We must never let bureaucrats shield each other and localities and departments practice protectionism. Those who harbor criminals must be punished according to party discipline and state law. F) We must pay attention to policies and stress focal points. Those who violate criminal law and party discipline must be sternly dealt with according to law and party discipline. People engaged in unhealthy practices should, in general, be criticized and educated. Those who voluntarily examine and mend themselves are fine; and those who refuse to undergo education and to mend their ways should be punished by party or administrative disciplinary action as deemed necessary. This is for the purpose of education and enforcement of discipline. G) We should bring into full play the role of the democratic parties and people without party affiliation. We should organize them to take part in implementing various tasks of the anticorruption drive, and should listen to their opinions and suggestions. H) While launching the anticorruption drive, we must rectify mistakes and promote party building at the same time; we must address the issue by looking into both its root cause and symptoms. The problems exposed show the existence of many loopholes in our management system and of serious defects in leadership style, which provide the opportunities for criminals and corrupt elements. We must learn from mistakes and earnestly sum up experiences and lessons by stopping the loopholes, improving rules and regulations, strengthening management, and resolutely getting rid of bureaucracy. I) The key lies in strengthening leadership. Party committees and governments at all levels must properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. They must firmly grasp the central task of economic construction and persist in grasping two links at the same time, mapping out overall plans to effectively combine the anticorruption drive with the deepening of reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. Principal party and government leaders must personally attend to the drive and solve important problems. They must support the work of discipline inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs and coordinate various departments concerned so as to join forces and promote in-depth development of the anticorruption drive. 3. Further Consolidate and Strengthen the Party's Flesh-and Blood Ties With the Masses In the final analysis, the anticorruption drive aims to consolidate and strengthen the party's ties with the masses and consolidate the position of the CPC as the ruling party under the new circumstances so that our party can more effectively carry out the historical responsibility of leading China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The ties between the party and the masses is a fundamental political issue that has a bearing on the success of the party's cause and on the survival of the party. This principle must be stressed repeatedly and for a long time to make sure that all comrades of the party attach great importance to it. The CPC is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, and its sole objective is to serve the people wholeheartedly. Our party represents the people in exercising political power; all party activities are aimed at protecting and fulfilling the interests of the broad masses of the people. If we do not pay attention to strengthening the party's ties with the masses and eliminating phenomena of divorcing ourselves from the masses, and if we let corruption spread unchecked, the CPC as the ruling party will degenerate and lose popular support. If the economy fails, we will collapse [jing ji gao bu hao hui kua tai 4842 3444 2269 0008 1170 2585 1006 0669]. Even if we do well in the economy, but corruption, embezzlement, and bribery spread unchecked and we seriously divorce ourselves from the masses, we will collapse, too. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said as early as 1980: "We must resolutely criticize and correct various mistakes of divorcing ourselves from the masses and showing no interest in the people's hardships. The masses are the source of our strength; the mass line and mass viewpoint are our cherished heritage. Party organizations, members, and cadres must identify themselves with the masses; and must never stand diametrically opposed to the masses. If a party organization divorces itself from the masses and cannot make up its mind to correct itself, it will forfeit the source of its strength, be doomed to fail, and be abandoned by the people. All comrades of the party and cadres at all levels, leading cadres in particular, must always bear this point in mind and use it as a criterion for examining their speeches and actions." We must always remember these incisive, pertinent words and resolutely implement them into concrete work. The vast numbers of cadres and, in particular, leading cadres must study hard the Marxist mass viewpoint, adhere to the party's mass line, constantly immerse themselves among the masses, and improve their ideological and work style in a down-to-earth manner. This is a necessity not only for implementing the party's line, principles, and policies and successfully fulfilling various tasks, but also for continuously remolding world outlook, resisting corruption, and preventing [peaceful] evolution. At the present, the masses in some areas still live in poverty as they still do not have enough to eat and wear. Each and every party cadre should constantly remember their hardships. The stand, thinking, and feelings of party cadres is a fundamental issue. When party cadres divorce themselves from the masses, are indifferent to the masses' weal and woe, and become apathetic, their thinking will inevitably degenerate and it becomes hard for them to avoid corrupt behavior. The current situation in the country as a whole is very good. However, we must be aware of some contradictions and problems confronting us in our march forward and of the existence of some destabilizing factors in society. These problems should merit our keen attention and should never be treated lightly. Leading cadres at all levels and, in particular, principal leading cadres must personally take a hand in successfully solving the conspicuous problems in their own local localities. Where problems are serious, leaders should visit the place to solve the problems. If leaders sit in the office and make empty talk, acting like bureaucrats and seriously divorcing themselves from the masses without solving practical problems, how can they fight corruption? The tasks we have undertaken are very heavy. We must steadfastly rely on party organizations at all levels and on cadres and the masses. The party and its cadres must work together with the masses with one mind to maintain political stability; to create a favorable social environment; to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy; to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0202 2170 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]; and to promote smooth progress of the undertaking to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.
