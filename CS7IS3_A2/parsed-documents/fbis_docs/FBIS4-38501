In particular, the funds gained are invested into the arms business and financing of hostilities in zones of inter-ethnic conflict. In addition, the stolen gold and diamonds are accumulated in order "to create a currency basis for newly created independent state entities." According to Major General of the Militia Ivan Sardak, deputy chief of the Main Department on Economic Crimes within the Russian Interior Ministry, a tendency for worsening characterizes the crime situation in the sphere of currency circulation which may still aggravate in the near future. Over 1993 the Interior Ministry's services on economic crimes confiscated about two billion rubles in foreign currency in the course of criminal investigation, that is about 20 percent of all confiscated currency valuables. Over the first quarter of this year the law enforcement bodies have already confiscated 1,183 million rubles. In addition, while investigating the cases of robbery of precious metals and stones, the law enforcement bodies have confiscated as much as 253 kilograms of gold, 49 kg of platinum, 1900 kg of silver, 2000 carats of diamonds, and other valuables amounting to 15.573 million rubles. At the same time the real scale of precious materials robbery greatly exceeds the mentioned data because not more than 5-10 percent of the total number of such crimes are exposed by the law enforcement bodies.
