FR940706-1-00003 FR940706-1-00001 Since the issuance of that AD, improved and modified bearings have been approved by the FAA for these model helicopters. Additionally, the manufacturer has issued The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter (SIL) No. 0110, Revision B, dated March 18, 1993, that extends the previous visual inspections to include the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2 helicopters. The SIL describes an approved swashplate modification and indicates that the SIL should only apply to those affected helicopters manufactured prior to January 1, 1981. In addition, a swashplate modification that would constitute terminating action for the requirements of this AD has been approved. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 76&hyph;06&hyph;11 to require visual inspections of the lower swashplate bearings; expand the applicability to the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2 helicopter; establish a retirement life of 1,200 hours' time-in-service for certain upper and lower swashplate bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing part number in the existing AD. This proposed AD would also provide an optional terminating action from the requirements of this AD and limit the applicability of the AD requirements to those affected model helicopters manufactured prior to January 1, 1981. The FAA estimates that 660 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 5 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,400 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,105,500. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;2560 (41 FR 13906, April 1, 1976), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation: Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;26&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 76&hyph;06&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;2560. Applicability: Model F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, 280, and 280C helicopters, manufactured prior to January 1, 1981, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the upper and lower swashplate bearings (bearings) and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following:
