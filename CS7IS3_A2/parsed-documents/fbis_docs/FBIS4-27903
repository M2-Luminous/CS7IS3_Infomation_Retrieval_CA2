FBIS4-27903 "dreas109__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-109-A Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Ministry Criticizes U.S. Demands on Securities Ministry Criticizes U.S. Demands on Securities OW0606041994 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0606041994 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was learned on 4 June that the United States asked Japan at the bilateral financial talks to amend the Securities and Exchange Act [SEA] and the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Act [FEFTCA]. This was revealed by an international financial source. The United States reportedly wants to broaden the definition of "securities" in the SEA, and is asking Japan to ease regulations on overseas transactions in financial instruments by institutional investors under the FEFTCA. Financial services have been designated as an additional priority sector in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The United States has also asked for the liberalization of the market for public pension funds. This sector is now expected to emerge as a major controversial issue in the framework talks. Finance Ministry Takes a Negative Attitude [subhead] The present Japanese SEA adopts the "positive list" method under which a list is drawn up of financial instruments considered to be "securities." The United States, however, wants this changed to the "negative list" method which details everything not considered "securities." It seems the United States wants to broaden the definition of "securities" to create a better environment for foreign securities firms -- which have an advantage in designing new financial instruments -- to freely develop new products freely in order to increase their business opportunities. In the past, new products from foreign securities firms have taken an extremely long time to win permits because they were not considered "securities" under the SEA. When institutional investors other than banks and securities firms buy financial instruments overseas, they are required to have minimum foreign currency deposits. Under the present FEFTCA, such foreign currency deposits are governed by a permit system. A senior U.S. Government official has pointed out that "Japanese institutional investors are obstructing full access to innovative products and services available from foreign financial institutions." According to the Securities Bureau, the Finance Ministry takes a negative view on the issue of amending the SEA, claiming that "if coverage of securities gets even partially out of control, it may not be possible to protect the investors." As far as FEFTCA is concerned, the International Finance Bureau says that "the existing law fully meets the needs of investors." Bilateral talks are expected to experience rough sailing.
