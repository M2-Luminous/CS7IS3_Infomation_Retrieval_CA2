Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In their filings with the Commission, the self-regulatory organizations included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments they received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organizations have prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Regional Exchanges are requesting a three month extension of their respective pilot programs relating to price protection of limit orders based on after-hours prints in a primary market. The pilot programs require Exchange specialists to provide primary market protection for those limit orders entered during an Exchange's primary trading session which are designated as executable after the close of the regular Exchange auction market trading session, known as ``GTX'' orders (``good until cancelled, executable in the afternoon session''). The Regional Exchanges have provided the Commission with updated reports describing their experience with the new rules. 5 The Commission will be reviewing those reports and new reports during the three-month extension of the pilots. 6 5 See letter from David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley & Lardner, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Commission, dated September 30, 1993; letter from Karen A. Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Commission, dated September 17, 1993; letter from Michael D. Pierson, Seni0r Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Commission, dated January 6, 1994; letter from William W. Uchimoto, Vice President and General Counsel, Phlx, to Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney, Commission, dated January 13, 1994. 6 In its orders approving the pilot programs, the Commission requested that the Exchanges provide the Commission with specific data regarding the operation of their respective after-hours pilots. The Commission requested that the Exchanges report on, among other things, GTX executions on its trading floor to ensure that their specialists are not taking unfair advantage of information derived regarding which orders on their books are designated GTX and the priority among those orders. In addition, the Commission requested that the Exchanges submit a report to the Commission describing their experiences with the new rule during the pilot period. The Commission requested that the following information (broken down by month) be included in the reports: (1) Whether customers who have entered GTX orders experienced any problems when they attempted to cancel such orders; (2) whether the Exchange has experienced any difficulties in monitoring the activities of specialists with regard to determining their particular obligations to fill GTX orders; (3) the number, if any, of GTX orders executed after the close of the regular auction trading session pursuant to the new rule; (4) the number, if any, of GTX orders that remain unexecuted after the specialist has fulfilled his or her obligations in connection with the new rule; (5) the number and percentage of good until cancelled orders on the book that were designated ``GTX'' and thus eligible to be filled; (6) whether the marketplace has experienced any increased volatility during the last hour of the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading sessions after the initiation of the new rule; (7) whether there were greater (wider) quote spreads during the last hour of the 9:30 a.m.to 4 p.m. trading session after the initiation of the new rule; and (8) whether the Exchange or any specialist has given any special guarantees to execute GTX orders over and above the requirements of the new rule.
