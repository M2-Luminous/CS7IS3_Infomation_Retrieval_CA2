FR940203-1-00004 FR940203-1-00002 ``Occupational dose'' is defined currently in the revised standards ``as the dose received by an individual in a restricted area or in the course of employment in which the individual's assigned duties involve exposure to radiation and/or to radioactive materials *␣*␣*.'' (10 CFR 20.1003) Through meetings with licensees to discuss the revised standards, the Commission has become aware that this definition can be interpreted to allow individuals who are members of the public to receive an ``occupational dose'' and exceed public dose limits if they enter restricted areas. This was not the intention of the Commission in promulgating the revised standards. A fundamental principle present in the regulations is that a member of the public is subject to the limits for a member of the public (§20.1301 (a)(1)), irrespective of that individual's location. The Commission is separately considering revisions to parts 20 and 35, whereby licensees who have been administered radioactive materials to patients and released them in accordance with §35.75 would be exempt from the provisions of §20.1301 (a)(1) with regard to the radioactive material in the released patient. Licensees must be able to ensure that a member of the public, if present in a restricted area, as well as any other area, will not exceed an exposure of 100 mrem/year. The suggestion that permission to expose a member of the public to a dose in excess of 100 mrem in a year, is created by that individual's location in a restricted area, can be removed by a simple modification to the definition of occupational dose, specifically by eliminating reference to dose received in a restricted area. In addition, ``radiation and/or radioactive material'' should replace ``radiation and radioactive material'' to correct a technical error in the text of the rule. With these changes, it would become clear that occupational dose is dose received as a result of an individual's employment in which assigned duties involve exposure to radiation and/or radioactive material. These changes would also make it clear that the dose received by a member of the public cannot be permitted to exceed the public dose limit even if the individual is receiving a portion of that dose while in a restricted area. The remainder of the definition of occupational dose would not be modified by this action, and maintains the description of both what is included and what is excluded in occupational dose for purposes of clarity. The regulation entitled ``Instruction to Workers,'' 10 CFR 19.12, currently requires that all individuals working in or frequenting any portion of a restricted area be instructed in the health protection problems associated with exposure to radiation and in radiation protection procedures needed to minimize exposure. Under this provision, if a worker never enters a restricted area, he or she would require no radiation protection training. On the other hand, members of the public, such as delivery persons who might occasionally enter a restricted area, would be required to be trained even though the nature of their activities would perhaps not warrant such instruction. The proposed change to §19.12 would make it clear that anyone in the course of their employment in which the individual's assigned duties involve the potential for exposure to radiation and/or radioactive material would have to be provided appropriate radiation protection training. Concern about training requirements has been expressed for certain categories of workers and members of the public illustrated by the following cases: Case (1) involves a member of the public who is potentially exposed to some radiation while visiting a facility or making deliveries, and, Case (2), a maintenance worker or contractor who is exposed to radiation while performing repairs or cleaning. In order to decide if training is required, and what type of training is appropriate, certain provisions of the rules must be considered. First, after January 1, 1994, a member of the public cannot be permitted to receive more than 100 mrem in a year unless specifically approved by the Commission (10 CFR 20.1301). 1 Second, training commensurate with the potential radiological health protection problems present would be required by the proposed 10 CFR 19.12 only for individuals whose assigned duties involve a potential for exposure to radiation and/or radioactive materials. In the first case above, the individual's activities, i.e., visiting a facility or making deliveries, were not assigned by the licensee or a licensee contractor. Under these conditions, the individual is a member of the public, and the licensee must ensure that exposures are less than 100 mrem in a year, and further must be as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Doses to these individuals should be controlled by other measures that would be included in an ALARA program, such as shielding, escorting, removing radioactive sources during visits, and controlling stay-times. Therefore, the Commission believes training is not required. However, nothing in the rules prevents providing training to any individuals. 1 As discussed above, the Commission is separately considering revisions to parts 20 and 35 to address cases whereby licensees have treated patients with radioactive material and released them under the provisions of §35.75, and thus would not fall under the provision of §20.1301(a)(1) with regard to the radioactive material in the released patient.
