The new plan will not be drawn up by simply increasing a 430 trillion yen [Y] budget for the current basic plan for public investment (effective FY1991 to FY2000), which is under government review. The source said the government is considering appropriating about Y550 trillion for the new plan, which is over Y100 trillion more than the budget for the current plan, and using 65-70 percent of it for investment in programs to improve "living conditions and cultural facilities" in view of the need to better a quality of life. The new plan's formulation is aimed at showing other countries the government's strong determination to stimulate domestic demand. The government will finalize the plan in June and will present it to the July G-7 summit (Naples summit) as a main pillar of Japan's macroeconomic policy. In an external economic policy outline issued at the end of March, the government indicated a plan to increase the budget for the current public investment plan and to review the budget allotment in the plan. Based on this, the government has been studying specific measures. But the budget increase is possible only if financial resources are secured. Thus, depending on the final content of a tax reform program, the size of the increase may possibly be reduced. The idea about the new plan has surfaced because the current plan no longer fits the actual situation, as a result of an increase in public investment proposed in a series of pump-priming packages. Public investment during the FY1991-93 period is expected to increase about 10 percent from the previous period. Even if the government increases public investment by merely 3 percent every year from now on, the current plan will easily be carried out. Since Japan entered the era of low economic growth, commodity prices have stabilized. Now, the target of 5-percent economic growth in nominal terms, a prerequisite to carrying out the current plan, does not fit the actual state of the economy at all. Therefore, some government officials are calling for reviewing the rate of year-on-year increase in public investment (which is set at 5.7 percent under the current plan) accordingly. However, even if the increase rate is lowered, "it is still possible to increase the budget for a new plan by Y100 trillion" from that for the current plan because planned spending on each year's public investment is already high due to an increase in public investment proposed in pump-priming packages, a government source said. The current plan appropriates about 60 percent of the budget to investment in programs to improve "living conditions and cultural facilities," including water supply and sewage systems, parks, housing and housing sites, and welfare facilities. In the third supplementary budget for FY1993, the government allotted most of public investment budget for living-related programs. It also reviewed the ratio of allotment in the FY1994 budget. As a result, if a new plan is formulated based on the FY1993 and FY1994 budgets, investment in programs to improve "living conditions and cultural facilities" will increase to 65-70 percent. The reason the government is studying the new plan is that it thinks it can show other countries its strong determination to expand domestic demand if it forwards a new plan with an increased budget. Also, the new plan will enable the government to speed up the review of the ratio of budget allotment to public works projects, although many are opposed to it.
