The minister told XINHUA recently that Macedonia has suffered heavy economic loss from the war and the related sanctions against Serbia. Macedonia had been the poorest republic among the six republics of the former Yugoslavia. About 80 percent of its national economy was related to other republics and 45 percent of its external trade depended on Serbia, Stefanov said. After the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, and especially since the Bosnian conflict, Macedonia's overseas market has shrunk sharply. The main railroads and highways to the outside were almost paralyzed after the UN sanction resolution against Serbia, which was compounded by Greece's imposition in February of an embargo on Macedonia. Macedonia's monthly average economic loss now stands at 150 million U.S. dollars this year, and total losses reached 1.8 billion dollars in 1993, Stefanov added.
