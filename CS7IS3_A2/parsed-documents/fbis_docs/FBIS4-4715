The Karen National Union (KNU), the strongest ethnic group which has been fighting the ruling Burmese for more than four decades for greater autonomy, had earlier refused to enter negotiations with Rangoon unless the venue was outside Burma. It had also demanded that the talks be held in the presence of UN representatives and the media. Informed border sources said the talks will take place at Myabadai village, which is located between Kyaido and Nabu district, and that powerful junta leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt will also participate, in addition to senior local Burmese Army commanders. The Burmese junta or the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) had earlier proposed Pa-an, the Karen capital, as the negotiating site. But the proposal was turned down by the Karen for security reasons, citing previous experience when Karen negotiating delegates were hunted down by Burmese troops after the failure of peace talks. The sources said the Karen eventually agreed to meet inside the country at Myabadai because the village used to be under the control of the Karen and the KNU could easily provide security for its delegation from bases along the border. However, both sides agreed that they will not be accompanied by troops and that all delegates will be unarmed. The Karen were not available for comment as of the press time. The sources said preparations have been going on for the past few days and that Burmese forces in Kawkareik, about 15 miles to the north of Myabadai village, recently went to Myawadi, which is opposite Mae Sot, to buy food and other provisions. Two GMC trucks were filled with the purchases, they said. The meeting, the first since a new group of military officers under the banner of Slorc seized power in September 1988, is a preliminary forum aimed at building mutual confidence and paving way for future ceasefire negotiations, according to the sources.
