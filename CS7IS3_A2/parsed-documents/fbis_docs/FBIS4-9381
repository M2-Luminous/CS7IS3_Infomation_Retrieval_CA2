Krajisnik stresses that the Srpska republic has long been demonstrating that it is ready to cease fighting and make peace and find a peaceful solution in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, everything that is being displayed in the media and ultimata testifies to an intention to vilify the Serbs and satisfy certain interests that lead to war rather than peace. It is ever more evident that the intention is to achieve a certain goal -- set in advance -- namely, by ultimata with the help of NATO, the United States, and UNPROFOR, the Muslim side should achieve everything it has militarily failed to achieve in the battlefield. Gorazde and the situation surrounding it, Krajisnik cautioned, was just a launch pad for Muslim forces and their intervention in the direction of Cajnice, Visegrad, and Srbinje (Foca). The support of NATO, the United States, and the UN for such an escalation can lead to one thing only -- fierce war, Krajisnik said. He noted that the leadership of the Srpska republic had successfully finished their negotiations with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special envoy, but these agreements were not being honored and that solutions are being forcefully imposed on the Serbs. This is something the leadership of the Srpska republic cannot accept, since this is something that the Serb people on the soil of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot accept either because they are fighting for their survival and will not succumb to any ultimatum or force.
