Guido Tarqui, leader of the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] Commission for Coca Affairs, has stated that despite the militarization of the coca production zones, the coca growers are not going to move a finger to make substitutions for or reduce their coca plantations. [begin recording] Tarqui: Three important points have been taken into account. One of them is that the measures in the Cochabamba tropical region, such as the blocking of highways, must be implemented because they are in a state of emergency. But they have decided that this state of emergency will prevail until the end of the COB congress, during which we are going to propose declaring a state of emergency in all coca production zones.
