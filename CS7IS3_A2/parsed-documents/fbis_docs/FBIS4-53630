FBIS4-53630 "dreas099__a94030" FBIS-EAS-94-099-A Daily Report 23 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Bureaucrats Defended, Politicians Criticized Bureaucrats Defended, Politicians Criticized 942A0112A Tokyo SHOKUN in Japanese Mar 94 pp 66-74--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0112A Tokyo SHOKUN Japanese CSO [Discussion by Yoshihiko Morozumi, former vice minister for international trade and industry and currently adviser to Electric Power Development Co., and Kaoru Moroi, author; place, date not given: "Bureaucrat-Bashing Is the Very Path to National Ruin!"] [Text] If told to mind their own business, bureaucrats will lose the will to carry on. Then, who in the world will sustain Japan? [Moroi] It seems to me that criticism of bureaucrats began suddenly to grow stronger after the change of government last summer [1993]. You are a veteran of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], but for example, at MITI there was a rare incident of a minister for international trade and industry intervening in a vice ministerial appointment because of promotion of an official who was going to run for election. To be sure, the minister does have the power of appointment and dismissal, but I wonder if it would not leave a source of calamity for posterity if a precedent in which a minister actually exercised that power at will were recognized; but when one scans opinion in the media, it is not necessarily that kind of atmosphere. Behind this there probably lies the justifications of deregulation and administrative reform, and it looks to me as though there exists, by common agreement, a view of bureaucrats as villains, which holds that bureaucrats are the ones who are riding on the trend of the times. I think that, basically, Japan's bureaucratic organization became too large. As might be expected, we probably must attempt to make it leaner. But at the same time, I still want to make a distinction between that recognition and today's trend of bureaucrat-bashing. [Morozumi] Today there is certainly a great deal of criticism of bureaucrats. But one thing that can be said is that there is within that no debate on how an administrative organization or bureaucratic organization should function within today's government structure and political system. From the outset, there is not even a clear consensus. Some people say that bureaucrats should be weak, and government should be small, or, conversely, they say that bureaucrats need not be so deferential.... The other day I read comments by a certain British industrialist in a newapaper, and he says that Japanese are criticizing their own political and administrative system because they take it for granted that U.S.-style organization and use of staff are good, but that each country has its own history and national character; therefore, it is to be expected that each will have a system corresponding to that, and it is not satisfactory to just go along with the current of the times and attack one's own system without any fixed principle. It does not mean that I go along with that argument, but it appears very much as though the current criticism of the bureaucracy lacks a philosophy or vision in that sense. [Moroi] In the United States, bureaucrats are certainly replaced every time there is a change of administration. But that system works because in the United States, state governments exist securely, and local autonomy is firmly established. If in Japan we were to change top bureaucrats every time that ministers changed, the bureaucratic system would end up breaking down completely. The Bureaucracy Is Japan's Line of Resistance [Morozumi] Of course, speaking from the constitutional setup of a parliament-cabinet system, ministers--and there is no requirement that they be Diet members--formally hold the power to hire and fire personnel. But in employing that power, to respect the spirit of personnel-neutrality, which guarantees neutrality of administration, up till now there has been no conspicuous intervention though there were informal consultations. That had been a tradition. I am not saying that there were no former examples at all. But in those cases a scar was sure to remain. As a former member of MITI, I think the recent incident was truly deplorable and inexcusable. But, not in the sense of permitting politics to intervene in personnel matters, in the sense that an undesirable situation within administration was the cause of the trouble. [Moroi] This is a layman's view, but I wonder if it is not a matter of Japan's parliament-cabinet system itself, in which Diet member-legislators are the chiefs of administration, are not functioning skillfully today. In other words, the division between administration and legislation has become very blurred. [Morozumi] I think it has. I have been saying for some time that Japanese politics has become administration. The politics is not taking up what are by nature political matters, and conversely, those very detailed technical questions have become political matters. For example, as a question of the nation's basic posture, let us assume a defense problem; if the authorized number of Self-Defense officials changes suddenly because the cabinet changes, it will influence morale. To what extent has politics debated such things which really should be debated as security questions, the question of becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and development of Japan-U.S. relations? I feel that a situation which can only be called a domestic Diet and domestic administration has continued for a long time. [Moroi] The commentary by the Englishman mentioned earlier was aptly put; I suppose that the bill has come due for Japan having come along under the U.S. umbrella, not making any politically independent decisions while calling itself an independent nation. Now that it suddenly becomes independent leaving the U.S. umbrella and building a relationship of equality by its own ideas, Japan is literally forced to bear the brunt of internationalization. Both politicians and bureaucrats resemble inexperienced maidens. Naturally, politicians ought to be the ones who should take the lead at this kind of time, but political leadership itself has become weaker, and with that weak leadership, they are trying to intervene in administration. An outsider sees best, and the recent political situation looks like that to me. [Morozumi] Looking at it internationally, one wonders just how much one can really depend on the level of Japanese politics, the direction of which is set by new politicians who made their entrance with great fanfare by riding the crest of some boom or other. The performance up till now has necessarily been satisfactory. In the final analysis it may be the fault of Japanese people. If that is so, who, in what manner, should support Japanese action that will be sufficient to make independent statements and independent achievements in the international community? To give no thought to that, and just bash bureaucrats because they stand out, will not solve a single problem. For example, arguments which as if to tell bureaucrats in a rude manner to mind their own business are lined up in a certain general magazine as a special issue on the bureaucrat question. That is probably the trend of the times today. I think that bureaucrats will be happy to mind their own business if they are convinced that there is a reason they should do so and a responsibility for them to do so. However, even if the kind of malice or envy mentioned earlier and lots of arguments are lined up against bureaucrats as though turning that malice or envy into logic, bureaucrats will not easily accept it. [Moroi] You called it the trend of the times, but rather than the true opinion of average Japanese citizen, I think that is something which the mass media and journalism often create. Journalism reported the public's distrust of politics on the single point of monetary influence and corruption, but in fact, there was annoyance over the fact that there were many incompetent politicians and their level kept going down with time. What the public now thinks about bureaucrats, in an unsophisticated way, is probably that there are too many of them and they cost too much in taxes. They do not think that bureaucrats are too meddlesome; rather, they feel that bureaucrats should stand firm. I feel that in the kind of climate of which you speak, it would be a national loss for bureaucrats to back down. [Morozumi] It amounts to citing a self-serving example, but I, too, am worried about that. In the course of Japan-U.S. negotiations in all sorts of fields, including the economic framework talks, the U.S. side has begun criticizing Japanese bureaucrats severely. It is because Japanese bureaucrats do not obey what the U.S. side says. The resistance line which rebuffs the United States, even if it tries to overwhelm opposition in a domineering manner by unreasonable arguments, is found in bureaucrats. And the ones who understood that fact well were, for example, the former trade representative, Carla Hill. The United States would probably be overjoyed if the persons it negotiates with are replaced by politicians. [Moroi] Bureaucrats resist, but after all, Japanese politicians back down quickly if you bluff a bit. [Morozumi] How ironic it would be for officials now to mind their own business and for Japanese to join with the United States in rejoicing. The Danger of "Confusion Between the Imperial Family and the Shogunate" [Moroi] But what is it like? I mean the relationship between politics and that kind of think-tank type official, so to speak, not officials who conduct business at the point of contact between the public and administration. Are they being used by politics or are they using politics? That is another area that I cannot see clearly. [Morozumi] That is the point. It is a somewhat disconnected simile, but Japan is a country in which the duality of power of the imperial court and the Shogunate has functioned in a fairly skillful manner. Conversely, there is no example of a single-power style having operated smoothly. There are such examples as the military before World War II and of The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan after the war; however, if political power were to flaunt making decisions on its own authority as "the supreme authority of state power," Japanese society would indeed become a politically omnipotent social system as though the imperial court and the Shogunate had merged. But would Japanese have been able to use that kind of system in a skillful manner? Would it have been possible to elevate Japan's level as a nation by that means? I think that the role of politics is bear the responsibility for choices. And as for administration, I think that officials are entities which should first, provide the options for choices and second, execute in a fair and neutral manner the laws which are decided on. But the transformation of politics into administration began by politicians saying that they would do both of those things by themselves. I do not know for sure whether that is Ozawa's idea, but I would like to venture to ask whether one can govern the country efficiently that way, and what its quality level would be. [Moroi] Ultimately, I always end up returning to the post-war argument; under the U.S. occupation, Japan did not consider independently the political and administrative principles and philosophy set forth in the preamble of the Constitution. Japan has only come along until now by incorporating into the existing system what it was told by the occupation authorities. [Morozumi] If people say that in future Japan's administrative functions should be taken over by politicians, how about Japan, too, copying the United States and making everyone up to police chiefs and prosecutors subject to election? That is probably fine for a country where an ethos by which even the fact that a sheriff can carry a pistol on his hip is because he was chosen in an election has permeated to the farthest reaches of the society. But that is not true of Japan. I cannot help but say that to bring in that kind of idea and suggest putting it into practice is an unrealistic argument for marital union between the Shogunate and the Imperial Family. [Moroi] Therefore, what I would also like to ask you is that in the trend which is like Edo and Kyoto uniting, Diet members who are former bureaucrats have begun to increase greatly. One of the embers that ignited the incident of interference in promotions by the minister for international trade and industry was also the problem of promoting an official who was standing as a candidate. What will happen to the question of independence and neutrality of administration if the number of politicians who were former bureaucrats increases? Will not the distinction between politics and administration become more and more blurred? [Morozumi] It will. Particularly if one is speaking of zoku [interest group] Diet members, this is without doubt an evil of the long reign of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and its origin lies in bureaucrats having cozied up to politicians or political parties. That is, at the beginning they cozied up to politicians and curried favor with them, thinking it would be good for developing their own work. Then they went beyond currying favor, and this time came to strongly aspire to become politicians themselves. But in a certain sense, this can be seen as a counteraction in which the result of politicians' position having become stronger is that bureaucrats, and especially the younger generation, fell into losing confidence in the relative significance of the position of bureaucrats. In order to compensate for losing confidence, they themselves aspire to be politicians, and one cannot deny that it is charged with danger of confusion between the Shogunate and the Imperial Family. But if we change the way we look at it, this problem probably becomes one which relates to the foundation of Japanese government. [Moroi] Politicians who are former bureaucrats are not the only problem. [Morozumi] You are right. One cannot say that the rapid increase in second-generation Diet members is without problems, and Diet members who are former members of labor unions and former members of prefectural assemblies also have their problems. That is, Diet members come only from such places is the basic problem of Japanese society, and that indeed is a large factor which determines the level of Japanese politics. [Moroi] Therefore, it is no use to argue about unimportant details of the problem of bureaucrats and administration without debating that part in a rigorous manner. Similarly, we have dealt for a long time with the debate on revision of the election law and a law to prevent corruption, but if we are to carry on a substantial debate, since democracy politics does not operate by the power of a monarch or military power or by the power of a party in a Communist Party dictatorship, it is bound to cost money. Actually, I think it is necessary for us to pin down first the difficult question of to what extent it is acceptable to spend money. It may be that the question of Diet members who are former bureaucrats will also, in the end, become that kind of delicate debate. [Morozumi] I agree. Let me say in passing, and this is also true of the minister in the current personnel incident, that no one has a side which is as cold toward bureaucrats as a Diet member--and it may not be limited to Diet members--who was once a bureaucrat. It is probably because in a certain sense they can be independent of bureaucrats. Diet members who are not former bureaucrats need help from bureaucrats; so, they cannot be cold toward them. [Moroi] It is not unlike stories that if a committee chairman of a labor union, and a militant type at that, leaves the union and becomes an entrepreneur, he will carry out coercive labor measures in such a way as not to recognize unions, and to crush them if formed. Can One Expect Fairness From the "Invisible Hand"? [Moroi] Incidentally, I also mentioned this at the beginning, but the one thing I must agree with in the chorus of criticism of bureaucrats is the poor efficiency, the red tape, of Japan's bureaucratic system. One might call it elaborate, but why did it become like this? [Morozumi] Let me give a technical explanation. If we search for its roots it is probably something like this. There are many laws, there are many items for authorization, and there are many bureaucrats. That was because postwar democratic politics decided that every matter related to the rights and duties of the people must be set by law. But in practice it takes too much time and trouble to explain each and every item to Diet members and make a law. Therefore, on the economic-policy side we thought we would do it by persuasion and dialogue, that is, by point-of-contact guidance. There existed in this, to whatever degree, a sense that laws are a nuisance. However, if it turns out that, from the viewpoint of human rights, entrusting it to the arbitrary decisions of officials, which is termed point-of-contact guidance, does not guarantee rights, there is no choice but to return to laws. That is, it becomes authorization and regulation. The above is strictly a technical explanation. I am very much in favor of reducing the items for authorization and criticizing red tape. But my opinion differs fundamentally from that of the members of today's financial circles in regard to the kind of criteria by which it should be done. They call in unison for operating by free competition and entrusting things to market principles. This, too, can probably be called the dominant trend today. Adam Smith is fine. But what are market principles? Its reverse side are profit principles. Will social fairness and national welfare really be guaranteed by profit principles? At least in the past, we could not trust the "invisible hand." It was, rather, expansion of the gap between rich and poor. Do the Japanese public think that cheap government is better and that a political philosophy like that of the U.S. Republican Party is better? Speaking from the standpoint of working under the principle of a certain kind of fairness and neutrality, not just whether taxes are low, and judging from the inevitability of a time when we are moving toward a nation of aged, a welfare state, it is difficult to accept, even if free competition and market principles are presented to us as though they are symbols of supreme authority and we are told to mind our own business. [Moroi] I agree with you on that point. Market principles in themselves have neither philosophy nor morality. One need only make a profit. Enterprises and business have, by nature, no such thing as ethics. That is precisely why morality is required in it, and administration and legislation are sought. It would be terrible if we really entrusted everything to market principles and such. If one asks what were the various kinds of regulations, they were not the spirit of the new constitution, but I suspect it was a matter of how to go on making an equal society, and that in order to do that, regulations which control market-principle-type tyranny by the strong gradually became necessary. It is simply incomprehensible to me that even the mass media, which once professed to be the guardian diety of equality and fairness, now forgets that and suddenly joins in the chorus calling for abolition of the tax system. The regulations and items for authorization become out-of-date over the course of time, and at the same time new items become necessary. Notwithstanding that we must abandon what is old and make something new, we pile new things on top of previous items; so, it ends up becoming red tape. Does it mean that politics was lazy? [Morozumi] No, one cannot necessarily say that. Administration can scrap and build on its own, and it probably should. It is good to scrap regulations which should be scrapped by bureaucrats themselves. I am not opposed to keeping regulations to a minimum; I am opposing the simple philosophy which says that the fewer regulations there are, the better it is. [Moroi] You remember there was a Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform. It has been widely reported that it could not produce an ideal report because of opposition by bureaucrats. The problem of regulations and items to be authorized is one thing; if it became a matter such as consolidation and integration of the bureaucratic system, could it be done by the power of bureaucrats themselves? [Morozumi] One could also be stated this way, for example. If one were to assemble several bureaucrats now and tell them to debate and come up with the long-term outlook for Japan's administrative reform according to their individual qualifications, a definite plan would emerge within one or two months. But if you told them to debate it together with one as representative of the Ministry of Finance, one as representative of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and one as representative of the Ministry of Home Affairs, it would absolutely not emerge. Therefore, it is not a matter of them not having ideas. Why can they not do it? I often wonder this question. To tell the truth, I do not understand what it really is, but I think, for one thing, the organization law of each ministry is causing problem. The work conducted by each agency is listed in the organization law of each ministry. Such being the case, when a new problem arises, an argument is bound to develop as to which agencie's work it falls under. One can probably say that turf wars derive from the very fact that it is listed in laws. In short, if, for example, the content of books published by private-sector publishers were determined in advance by law so that company A published works on literature and company B published works related to law, there would be bound to be a fight over the publication of books whose content fell between law and literature. When all is said and done, it is the same thing as that. When you get to that point, it is a question of choice; so, probably the only way is for politics to decide. When the issue of administrative organization comes up for discussion, questions of international cooperation, for example, are within the province of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MITI, and the Ministry of Finance; therefore, there sometimes emerge lateral-organization views that cut across existing agency boundaries, such as that it would be better to make a Ministry of International Cooperation. I am not impressed with this kind of idea. The people of the country would be troubled before bureaucrats were troubled. If a Ministry of International Cooperation is acceptable, a Ministry of Social Welfare should also be acceptable. And, if we divided each administrative unit by function, it would end up becoming unclear what was what. Vertical division by agency is not without problems, but if we create a ministry for international cooperation, it is certain that there would develop within it departments and bureaus in charge of foreign affairs, trade and industry, and so on. It means that this kind of lateral organization would retransform into vertical organization. [Moroi] But when I look at the Uruguay Round and so on, I cannot help feeling that neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries functioned in a satisfactory manner. Both were timid, and I cannot deny a kind of vexation just like when a fly ball falls between fielders who are deferring to each other. [Morozumi] Concerning current diplomatic problems, there is a very strict rule called centralization of diplomacy, and because it cannot be removed by any means, every ministry must operate within its framework. [Moroi] Therefore, we entrust to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs even matters which need not be entrusted to it. It will not do for the trade representative to negotiate with full authority and have what is left be only the talk with the White House. [Morozumi] Well, this problem has a long history that, before the war, when they created that Ministry of Greater East Asian Affairs, the chiefs of every bureau in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did their best to oppose it by submitting letters of resignation. There could probably be a debate over whether that logic is appropriate in this era of internationalization, but.... [Moroi] Certainly, vertically organized administration probably has merits. If that is the case, I hope that administrators will cooperate with each other firmly by the leadership of politics. [Morozumi] Yes. The present cabinet system also has the Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs and the Councilors' Office on External Affairs, and as organizational theory, it is arranged that this place is in charge of the coordination function. But since the power of each ministry is strong, coordination does not turn out satisfactorily. [Moroi] Particularly when politics is weak, decisionmaking will end up being timid. Putting aside Kakuei Tanaka's merits and demerits, the biggest problem today is probably that politicians lack Kakuei-Tanaka type resolve. Not a Public Servant, "One Who Serves the Common Good" [Morozumi] Certainly there exist limitations on bureaucratic thinking. I say this with the sense of a tribute to former Prime Minister Tanaka, who I served as vice minister for international trade and industry; his thinking was totally opposite to the thinking of we bureaucrats. Our thinking is bound to be deductive; first there is an idea, and in the development of that idea, we pick up individual items and fit them in. But former Prime Minister Tanaka's thinking was inductive. He would collect practical questions and create a picture before one knew it. It was like making a garden by bringing rocks from river banks here and there at random. In our case, first we draw a plan of the garden. We go so far as to determine the size and shape of the rocks and bring only those rocks that fit it. That is what was great about Mr. Tanaka; conversely, that is also the reason we bureaucrats, who have not spent our lives gaining practical experience, are criticized as lacking conceptual ability which is rooted in reality. [Moroi] We are told that Kakuei Tanaka once called for raising teachers' salaries by 50 percent. What I would like to ask you about is the question of bureaucrats'compensation and the satisfaction in their lives. Also, according to the tone of the media, retiring from the bureaucracy to a good position in the private sector is absolutely bad. If that is so, elite bureaucrats retire from office too early, and it is odd why the media does not discuss the nature of bureaucrats' compensation up to the time of their retirement at the same time. The government agencies of Kasumigaseki usually have their lights burning until past midnight. In fact, a MITI bureaucrat whom I know told me that he rarely returns home before 0200 hours. If one continues that kind of life, one will surely becomes frustrated. After all that, if bureaucrats are told that they must not retire to a good position in the private sector, I am sure they get discouraged and no longer want to serve as bureaucrats. [Morozumi] There are all sorts of arguments concerning retirement by bureaucrats to good positions in the private sector. I do understand, for example, the argument, developed by the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, opposing retirement to public corporations and government enterprises because, looking at it from the perspective of career staff, someone who has just entered the organization is putting on airs. A large corporation has hundreds or thousands of subsidiaries, and therefore there is no difficulty finding other employment; however, there are no such opportunities in government agencies. If one compares things in relation to that one point, if bureaucrats' compensation is poor while on active government service, staff will not gather. When I entered the Ministry of Commerce and Industry before the war, the minister was Nobuskuke Kishi, who was 42 years old; the administrative vice minister, Etsuro Shiina, was younger. Chiefs of all the bureaus, from the General Affairs Bureau down, there were even ones in their 30's. The early retirement is partly a hangover from that time. But today the number of years which an official serves has greatly increased, and for all practical purposes it has become lifetime work. Young staff will not gather unless we devise some sort of system to give them appropriate salaries. [Moroi] I think that what is at the root of media criticism of bureaucrats is a "public servant" thesis. They do not come right out and say "you are only public servants," but I feel that they have a premise of looking down on bureaucrats as "servants." [Morozumi] The translation of "public servant" [Japanese transliteration of the English phrase] is clumsy. If you consult a dictionary, it may be listed as "koboku," but the meaning is "one who serves the common good" because the main idea is found in the point that the work of bureaucrats deals not with a private enterprise, but with total capital, that it deals not with some private individuals but with the entire society. What is stressed is the "public," not the "serve." [Moroi] What do they mean by "servant"! As in all men are created equal, democratic societies do not have relationships of superior and inferior, right? [Morozumi] Bureaucrats probably do not dare to dispute being classified as "servants" in a democratic society. [Moroi] When I think about that kind of problem, I always think of bureaucratic structures during the Tokugawa central government which included elders and junior elders. The amount of their stipend was, at most, 40,000 or 50,000 koku [1 koku=5.119 bushels] of rice. They were small daimyo [feudal lord]. But they also had authority, and I think they had their own pride and high ideals. I think that the true worth of Japanese government offices is that bureaucrat ability and pride which continues uninterrupted. All sorts of things are said about them, but Japan's bureaucrats are excellent. [Morozumi] Well, I do not say they work for the sake of the country, but people with old-fashioned sensibility, so to speak, who dislike the kind of work where one takes money into consideration, join up. Persons with such hidden intentions as using the position as a stepping stone to political circles also do come. But as things stand now, such excellent staff also gradually disperse to the private sector or other places. [Moroi] Bureaucrats are not ordinary salaried staff. I think they have similar to such journalists as newspaper reporters, an aspect of being able to go on working because they have that kind of consciousness. [Morozumi] What I said to Eiji Suzuki of the Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform was that I hope the council would please not destroy officials' will to work. I said that if they say there need not be a will to work, they should create the most efficient kind of salaried worker organization. But the trade-off will be that staff will not gather. If that happens, the level of Japan's public relations will probably decline. The level of Japan's administration and politics will probably lose international competitiveness. It was in that sense that I said that the problem will not be solved by telling bureaucrats to mind their own business. Since I was a bureaucrat of the prewar school, I joined the ministry with pride in service. And I think that the image of an official, image of a bureaucrat, that we inherited has been inherited, even after the era of the Public Service Workers' Law arrived after World War II, by a generation which is conceptually close to us. However, it has probably grown weaker. A generation has been born which scoffs at service without a fixed amount, and which returns home when the time arrives. I do sense a gap there. One can probably say that in that transition period that today's problems have arisen. [Moroi] No, speaking from my own observation, leaving aside the question of working hours, rather in the generation of the bureau-chief class of many government agencies today, I sense a "public servant" type of timid posture. Conversely, it is in those one level lower, in the division-chief class, that I think the kind of prewar-type pride or confidence that you spoke of now seem to exist. That can also be sensed in MITI's recent trouble; if that is so, it will be another new generation gap. [Morozumi] Well now, that is a very encouraging observation, but I am sure the times will also be critical of it.
