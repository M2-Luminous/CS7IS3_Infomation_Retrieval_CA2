SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the remarks when he met reporters shortly after Hosokawa announced he was resigning. The SDP differs from Shinseito, another powerful group within the seven-party coalition, over major policies including defense and tax. However, asked what the SDP would do if Shinseito leader and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is picked up as new premier, murayama said if the coalition parties reach an agreement on it, "we will cooperate with the agreement." A meeting of representatives from the ruling coalition partners is currently under way to discuss who will succeed Hosokawa. Murayama also said the coalition government should not change its present seven-party structure.
