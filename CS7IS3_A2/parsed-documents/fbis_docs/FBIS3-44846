Interviewed by XINHUA before his visit to China in his Tel Aviv office, the minister said the economic and trade relations between the two countries have developed significantly since the establishment of diplomatic relations in February 1992. As a result of the trade agreement signed in October that year, he noted, the bilateral trade in 1992 totaled more than 54 million U.S. dollars, representing a 137 percent increase compared with the previous year. He revealed that "in the first nine months of 1993 China's exports to Israel grew more than 750 percent." He said the aim of his forthcoming visit to China is to identify areas of cooperation" in the framework of the 1992 trade agreement. "We are doing two things now. One is at the official level and the other involves business people and companies," he said. Since the visit of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to China in October, who was also accompanied by lots of business people, many Israeli companies have approached the Chinese side in various aspects of cooperation such as joint ventures and import-export projects. He said Israel maintains three free trade agreements with the United States, the European Community (EC) and the EFTA countries (Sweden, Norway, Austria, Iceland, Finland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland). These free trade agreements give Israel a unique position in international trade, of which Chinese businessmen can take advantage. He said Chinese manufacturers can export semi-processed goods to Israel, finalize their manufacturing process there according to established "rules of origin" and then export them to the U.S., EC and EFTA countries with no tariff at all. Thus, businesses in China can use Israel as a bridge to western markets. He said his government is seeking a trade strategy of diversification and China, Japan and India will be its best partners in Asia and Pacific region.
