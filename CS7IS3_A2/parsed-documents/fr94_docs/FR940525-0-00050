FR940525-0-00050 FR940525-0-00022 The two arbitrators so chosen, if they are unable to reach an agreement, shall select a third arbitrator who shall act as umpire, and such umpire's determination shall become final only upon approval by the FIA. The Company and the FIA shall bear in equal shares all expenses of the arbitration. Findings, proposed awards, and determinations resulting from arbitration proceedings carried out under this section, upon objection by FIA or the Company, shall be inadmissible as evidence in any subsequent proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction. This Article shall indefinitely succeed the term of this Arrangement. Article IX_Errors and Omissions The parties shall not be liable to each other for damages caused by ordinary negligence arising out of any transaction or other performance under this Arrangement, nor for any inadvertent delay, error, or omission made in connection with any transaction under this Arrangement, provided that such delay, error, or omission is rectified by the responsible party as soon as possible after discovery. However, in the event that the Company has made a claim payment to an insured without including a mortgagee (or trustee) of which the Company had actual notice prior to making payment, and subsequently determines that the mortgagee (or trustee) is also entitled to any part of said claim payment, any additional payment shall not be paid by the Company from any portion of the premium and any funds derived from any Federal Letter of Credit deposited in the bank account described in Article II, section E. In addition, the Company agrees to hold the Federal Government harmless against any claim asserted against the Federal Government by any such mortgagee (or trustee), as described in the preceding sentence, by reason of any claim payment made to any insured under the circumstances described above. Article X_Officials Not to Benefit No Member or Delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Arrangement, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom; but this provision shall not be construed to extend to this Arrangement if made with a corporation for its general benefit. Article XI_Offset At the settlement of accounts the Company and the FIA shall have, and may exercise, the right to offset any balance or balances, whether on account of premiums, commissions, losses, loss adjustment expenses, salvage, or otherwise due one party to the other, its successors or assigns, hereunder or under any other Arrangements heretofore or hereafter entered into between the Company and the FIA. This right of offset shall not be affected or diminished because of insolvency of the Company. All debts or credits of the same class, whether liquidated or unliquidated, in favor of or against either party to this Arrangement on the date of entry, or any order of conservation, receivership, or liquidation, shall be deemed to be mutual debts and credits and shall be offset with the balance only to be allowed or paid. No offset shall be allowed where a conservator, receiver, or liquidator has been appointed and where an obligation was purchased by or transferred to a party hereunder to be used as an offset. Although a claim on the part of either party against the other may be unliquidated or undetermined in amount on the date of the entry of the order, such claim will be regarded as being in existence as of the date of such order and any credits or claims of the same class then in existence and held by the other party may be offset against it. Article XII_Equal Opportunity The Company shall not discriminate against any applicant for insurance because of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, marital status, or national origin. Article XIII_Restriction on Other Flood Insurance As a condition of entering into this Arrangement, the Company agrees that in any area in which the Administrator authorizes the purchase of flood insurance pursuant to the Program, all flood insurance offered and sold by the Company to persons eligible to buy pursuant to the Program for coverages available under the Program shall be written pursuant to this Arrangement.
