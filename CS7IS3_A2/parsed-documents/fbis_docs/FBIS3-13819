Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Knesset Member David Mena' has handed the Knesset speaker a list with the 30 signatures required in order to convene the plenum during the recess. The NRP [National Religious Party] faction has announced that in reaction to Prime Minister Rabin's proposals, it will hold its next meeting tomorrow in Hebron.
