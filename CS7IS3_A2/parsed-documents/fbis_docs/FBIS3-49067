At midday wounded were still arriving at Sarajevo hospitals as the bombing continued. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Ray Wilkinson said the number of humanitarian airdrops over Bosnia would be increased over the next few days for psychological reasons, with about 17 planes, mainly American, taking part in the operation instead of eight. Regions which had so far failed to receive any relief goods would be targeted first, he added. [passage omitted] Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic was due to meet with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Vienna Tuesday ahead of upcoming peace negotiations in Geneva on the Bosnian conflict. The latest deaths in Sarajevo come after 15 people died and 22 people were wounded during heavy shelling Monday in one of the worst violence in weeks, according to UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Idesbald van Biesebroeck. On Tuesday at least six shells rained down on a building between Marsal Tito Avenue, the main street of Sarajevo's old town, and the Skenderija neighborhood where a large UNPROFOR contingent from France has been deployed. The shells fell a few hundred meters (yards) from Skenderija and the Bosnian president's offices. Shelling was also reported from other parts of the city. Van Biesebroeck said UN military observers estimate the Serbs lobbed 203 shells on the capital Monday while predominantly Moslem government troops fired 37. Serb forces have besieged Sarajevo since April 1992. Van Biesebroek said artillery fire was also reported from Gornji Vakuf and Busovaca, central Bosnia Monday. Bosnian Croat forces fired 20 mortars on east Mostar, the Moslem-dominated main city of southern Herzegovina, but no toll was immediately available. In eastern Bosnia, the situation was calm Monday but Bosnian Serbs prevented a humanitarian aid convoy from reaching the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, the spokesman said. [passage omitted] Greek European Affairs Minister Theodore Pangalos meanwhile said it would be "absurd" to bomb targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina as this would only "worsen the massacre in a bid to end the atrocities." Greece, which took over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Community on January 1, was "absolutely opposed" to air strikes. "Not one but all (belligerants) would have to be bombed, which would be a rather absurd peace plan," Pangalos told Radio France International. [passage omitted]
