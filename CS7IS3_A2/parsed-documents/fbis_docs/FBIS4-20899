Our correspondent asked Deputy Director Aleksey Nikolayev of the Earth Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences for his comments. Here is what the scientist said: "It is true that I discussed these matters with the Moscow correspondent of the SUNDAY TIMES some time ago. He was interested in my articles about the effects of nuclear explosions on earthquakes and the development of seismic processes. I was virtually the only person researching this connection. I told the correspondent that one thing was absolutely clear: It would be virtually impossible to develop a seismic weapon. I also said that nuclear explosions do have some effect, however slight, on earthquakes--not in the sense that they cause them, because this is a result of massive natural processes, but in the sense that they can hasten the onset of a burgeoning quake. My findings were based on the use of extremely sensitive equipment, which was capable of measuring even the slightest influences. I denied that the earthquakes in Armenia and Georgia were the result of nuclear explosions in Semipalatinsk and on Novaya Zemlya." "I do not know what the SUNDAY TIMES reporter had to say about this meeting, but I have the FRANCE SOIR item, which was clearly based on the British article, here on my desk. It says that Aleksey Nikolayev believes that the earthquakes in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Armenia are the after-effects of nuclear tests. This is the exact opposite of what I said. It says Yablokov `suspects' that a seismic weapon is being developed in our country and that Oleg Kalugin, `chief of Soviet counterintelligence,' frankly admitted his awareness of scientific projects related to this weapon. `That is utter nonsense,' Kalugin said when one of our staffers asked him about this." "This `wild goose' in the newspaper is far from harmless. Articles of this kind arouse doubts about our country and encourage people in the West to make decisions with negative implications for us. And the West is not the only problem...." "You may recall that after the earthquake in Georgia, then Georgian leader Zviyad Gamsakhurdia declared that it was caused by the Russian tectonic weapon. This is how the anti-Russian hysteria started." "I hope the article in your newspaper will put an end to all of this speculation," Aleksey Nikolayev said at the end of our conversation.
