[Toepfer] Why would I? Certainly not. [DIE ZEIT] You just took on an important post with the United Nations: you were just elected chairman of the Commission on Sustained Development [CSD]. Can this mammoth task be done on the side from Bonn, as it were? [Toepfer] That is an honorific title. And I can quite readily combine it with the job of environmental minister of the Federal Republic of Germany. But, of course, it requires lots of concentration, coordination, and a good staff. [DIE ZEIT] Environmental and developmental groups from many countries take quite a different view. They fear that the commission's work could trickle away through the sands, if you do not meet the new challenge with all your energies. [Toepfer] There is, clearly, the danger that the results of Rio could be lost. On all sides, there is the concern that the Commission on Sustained Development is not in a position to advance the principles and the cause of Rio. Many, especially in the developing countries, are convinced that the CSD has accomplished too little in its first year. [DIE ZEIT] The chairman of the UN General Assembly even thinks that the decisions of Rio, and the partnership that was concluded there between North and South, have long since been forgotten. [Toepfer] For precisely that reason, there would have been many good reasons for saying: Even I cannot change it. But would that be the proper conclusion? Either the matter is left to trickle through the sands, or an attempt is made, wholeheartedly, with all the risks that that entails, and small chance of spectacular successes. But at least I want to, I must, try to change this trend toward resignation. [DIE ZEIT] That sounds very optimistic. What do you intend to do? [Toepfer] The Rio process, that is to say, the partnership that has been forged between north and south, must be advanced honestly and substantially. At the present time, we are holding one conference after the other. In September, the World Population Conference is slated for Cairo, then there is the World Social Summit in Copenhagen, then the Women's Summit in Beijing, and so on--all events with a clear reference to sustained development. But it must not come to pass that we rush from one summit to the next, only to determine, in the final analysis, that we are marching without a compass, without any internal guidelines, without a common goal. Up to now, the brackets between the conferences have been missing. [DIE ZEIT] How do things stand with the often-cited global partnership between north and south? [Toepfer] For the developing countries, to an ever greater degree, the tough consequences of the conflict between East and West that has been overcome, are becoming apparent. In former times, the north helped--in the East as well as the West, and they did so, in part for strategic considerations; playing the competing systems, one against the other, brought them developmental opportunities, and material assistance. That is missing now, and the poorest of the poor are suffering because of it. Then, too, the long, deep recession in the industrialized countries has been a factor, as has the economic break-up of Central and East Europe. [DIE ZEIT] So, you want to procure more money for the poor countries? [Toepfer] That plays quite a central role in the case of the developing countries, of course. We must see what will become of the "new and additional funds" that were decided upon in Rio. There are positive signals, but it is also clear that because of the economic problems in the donor countries, the monies are not being made as readily available as the developing countries correctly thought they would be in Rio. But it is not just a matter of money; there is also the matter of transferring technology, administrative assistance, and opening up the markets. [DIE ZEIT] Little is coming, even from Germany. In Rio, the chancellor promised 780 million German marks [DM]. When it came time to pay, not even DM400 million was left. [Toepfer] It is correct that we, too, have to come to terms with the economic break-up, but by no means have we sent out the signal that we are getting out of the global partnership, which is based on solidarity. For the future, the question whether we develop and conclude innovative financial instruments will be an important one. The developing countries are calling for international taxes, a supplement on airfares, for example, which would then be funnelled to them. Matters of this type will occupy us at the CSD. [DIE ZEIT] What would be more significant than small gifts are open markets. [Toepfer] That is how things stand right now. To be sure, due to low raw material prices, the developing countries, in particular, are suffering from the weakness of the world economy. In Rio, we missed the opportunity to talk about trade issues. Now, it is quite important not to disappoint anyone. The positive conclusion of the GATT negotiations provides a very good basis for this. [DIE ZEIT] And yet, Europe unabashedly limits the importation of bananas from Latin America. [Toepfer] That was and is, truly, a signal in the wrong direction. And we must not arouse the suspicion that, under the cloak of environmental policies, we want to establish new trade barriers. Some politicians from the Third World are already fearful that even eco-labels, like our blue environmental angel, are signs of a green imperialism, as my Indian colleague, Kamal Nath, has said. Environment and trade, therefore, are issues that will keep us intensely busy. They are a very hot topic... [DIE ZEIT] ...about which the World Trade Organization will be occupied as well. [Toepfer] But we cannot simply leave it to trade policy. For example, in the UN Commission for Sustained Development, we shall soon be dealing with matters of forest policy. In Rio itself, the best we could do was agree on a few nonbinding principles. Now the matter is beginning to pick up some momentum. Think of Greenpeace's action against Canadian wood. Something like that is effective. And so the question is raised: What is sustained forest use? And, we must allow the question to be put to us why we do we want to dictate to other countries what they may do and what they may not. It is just the same with social policy. We want neither social nor environmental dumping--others want no hindrances to trade outside the constraints of the rates insofar as environmental or social standards are concerned. We must take care that our efforts on behalf of environmental policy are not misunderstood as a barrier to our own benefit. [DIE ZEIT] But how is that done? [Toepfer] I can give you an example: a German cement producer recently told me that at present, the cement from our Eastern neighbors is delivered at prices that are lower than the cost of the wages he must pay in Germany alone. One reason for this is the lack of environmental surcharges in Eastern Europe. His proposal was: let us collect an import duty that does not disappear into our coffers, with the help of which the eastern cement plants can be retrofitted. Considering something of this sort is urgently needed at the CSD. In Rio we decided that trade, the environment, and sustained development must be mutually supportive. [DIE ZEIT] Can you actually imagine such a form of partnership? [Toepfer] Certainly. By decreasing emissions of carbon dioxide, which are harmful to the climate, we want to do precisely that: the industrial countries promise to stabilize their emissions, or better yet, to reduce them by a certain amount, as we decided, in Germany's case, to reduce them by 25 to 30 percent. For what the industrial countries do together with the developing countries beyond that to curb carbon dioxide, they must, to some degree, be given credit. [DIE ZEIT] Let us remain with the threat to the world's climate. The International Energy Agency predicts that the wealthy OECD countries, by the year 2010, will spew out approximately 30 percent more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. That is in diametrical opposition to what was decided at Rio. [Toepfer] That stands in particular opposition to the Rio climate convention, which is binding from the standpoint of international law, and which, in the meantime, 68 countries have ratified. [DIE ZEIT] Evidently, that is not worth much. [Toepfer] From the standpoint of international law, it is binding! But it is all the more important that now all the industrialized countries must get to work; for example, that we in the European Union [EU] not only decide to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions, but that we also provide the instruments for doing so. [DIE ZEIT] The carbon dioxide/energy tax. [Toepfer] That is a must... [DIE ZEIT] ...concerning which Brussels fights continually. [Toepfer] There are precisely five reasons for that. The southern Europeans say that the northern Europeans--that means we Germans, too--with their high per capita carbon dioxide emissions, should reduce these emissions and bear the cost associated with doing so. Others say: if a tax at all, please, only a carbon dioxide tax--whereas the critics see in that an instrument for the promotion of nuclear energy. The third point is the so-called conditionality: the EU should become active only if the OECD countries--Japan and the United States in particular, do something. The fourth group argues: with a tax of $3 per barrel of oil, there will be no reaction at all insofar as demand is concerned, and for that reason, it should be left alone. And finally, the argument that the introduction of new taxes is a matter that should be left to the member countries. Things get hung up at that point and nothing moves. [DIE ZEIT] Because, to put it quite simply, the political will to do anything is lacking. [Toepfer] That, among other things, certainly plays a decisive role. And that is why I agree with my French colleague: what is not done in this area in the next 12 months in the EU--Germany, then France, will hold the EU presidency--probably will not be done so quickly. [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Toepfer, we have the impression that your election to the chairmanship of the CSD was a belated thank you for your involvement at the Rio conference. Your colleagues in Bonn seem to be less grateful. [Toepfer] How do you arrive at that conclusion? [DIE ZEIT] Think of your struggle against the superstition that environmental protection costs jobs. [Toepfer] It is sometimes enervating. That is true. [DIE ZEIT] Think of your promise to fight the climatic catastrophe. In the old laender, carbon dioxide emissions have even increased slightly since 1987. [Toepfer] They increased from 715 to 716 million tons, which is to say they have remained virtually constant. At the same time, however, the population in the old laender has grown by circa 7 percent. That means that in terms of per capita emission of carbon dioxide, we have had a definite decrease. [DIE ZEIT] So you still believe you can keep your promise to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 by 25 percent with reference to 1987 levels? [Toepfer] If we can manage to control the growth process in the new laender with the emissions level that has been achieved at present--incidentally, this level is, per capita, still above that of the old laender, then we shall have 15 percent less carbon dioxide than in 1987, the base year for our reduction obligation. [DIE ZEIT] Ten percent is still lacking. [Toepfer] By way of a variety of important measures, these can still be reached: by way of the thermal utilization regulation, by way of traffic-related measures, all the way to the thermal protection regulation... [DIE ZEIT] ...which a leading producer of building materials has already characterized as "outmoded" before it was even passed. [Toepfer] I tend to be rather grateful for such criticism. It proves that legislative regulations are still being undercut, but we also need the European carbon dioxide/energy tax. And we need a European provision for limiting carbon dioxide emissions from cars with the average of at most five liters per 100 kilometers. I agree with my French colleague that we shall tackle the problem together if the commission does not soon present a draft. [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Toepfer, why would you not rather tackle your task in New York wholeheartedly, and rid yourself of the albatross that is hanging around your neck here? [Toepfer] The new job, naturally, has much to do with the fact that I perform a function in Bonn on the national level, that we are held in esteem in terms of environmental policy worldwide. [DIE ZEIT] And your frustration threshold has not yet been crossed? [Toepfer] No. Quite the contrary. Even if one stands in the midst of criticism in such a fascinating time of historical changes, that does not mean that one has not moved anything or that one has advanced nothing. And, in New York, I shall have to face the question again and again how I do my homework. That is the most important basis, even for credibility on a worldwide scale.
