Backed by an ample amount of funds, it has exercised uncanny influence not only in the political, bureaucratic, and financial worlds, but also in the underworld, and moreover, we have been in the dark about the real situation. However, an internal family feud commenced the same time as the Liberal Democratic Party split, and the taboo has begun to crumble. It goes without saying that the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation was built up in one generation by Ryoichi Sasagawa. He is the final survivor of the A-class war criminals. Ryoichi Sasagawa is the man who has reigned as "Japan's don," wielding great authority in the political world, right wing, and gangster world after the war. It has been the post of chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, the acme of the motorboat racing world, which the don has continued to protect. The Motorboat Racing Law was enacted by Diet legislation in 1951 when Japan was heavily colored by the war defeat. The current Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation was established in 1959. It is the achievement of Ryoichi Sasagawa, who is well versed with inside and outside of society, commanded this industry that initially was said to be "a place of employment for members of ex-special attack unit, Special Service Agency, and military police members" and was said to "have tattooed gangsters among its racers," modernized it, created a nationwide organization, and nurtured the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation which was its core until it became called "the world's foremost financial group now surpassing Rockefeller." It was also called the Sasagawa empire, and it has become an abode of demons not easily penetrated by the outside in which his family of "three illegitimate children" and "common-law wife who is called the Mrs." are cleverly linked to the vested interests of the motorboat racing world backed by his influence. The don will be 94 this year and his former figure of vigor has come to an end. "He has stopped jogging, which he had done every day for some time, and I recently happened to see him after a long while, wondering how he was doing. The chairman was standing in a daze in front of the house, looking up at the sky. Since it was very different from his previous figure, I was shocked" (neighbor of Ryoichi Sasagawa). "He repeats the same thing over and over as if he were a broken record.... There are times when he feels good and times when he feels bad. He no longer carries out a hard schedule like before. When he goes to a party, he has private secretaries with him and if they notice anything "strange" about him, they immediately take the chairman outside" (motorboat racing source). It seems that he is no longer able to hide the characteristic symptoms of being old. Amount Allocated Is 140 Billion Yen When the strength of the don weakened, it was inevitable that the empire would begin to collapse concerning his successor. Currently, the don's third son Yohei (53) is in the post of chief managing director, which ranks next to the post of chairman. Criticism about Yohei began spreading at the beginning of this year. Then, there has been opposition between Yohei, who has been steadily making preparations to inherit, and Shuhei Omori (president of Rengo Kaihatsu), and Shigetoshi Kano, chief of the Public Relations Office (former private secretary to the chairman) who were formerly said to be Sasagawa's closest associates. It is reported that an internal feud is occurring, and that Shizue Sasagawa (69), his "common-law wife," has begun to wield power in place of the weakened chairman. Moreover, a scandal has begun to be revealed that Yohei is involved in big projects, which he commenced as a symbol of "the start of my own second era of founding businesses." Before daybreak on 18 June, a pistol suddenly was fired into Yohei's home in Setagaya, Tokyo. Moreover, the pistol thought to be used by the culprit and 15 live bullets were placed before the entrance as if to attract attention. What in the world is happening in the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation? I began to investigate the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation at the end of March 1993. Now, dozens of pages of inside information lie near at hand. Searching through them, one will inevitably notice a surprisingly tricky and complicated flow of money that is behind the accounting of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, which has been called clean. Below, I would like to close in on the dark side of the Sasagawa empire that has not yet been told, based on that inside information and interviews with several inside sources. First, I will touch lightly on the motorboat racing world. The scale of vested interests held by the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation there exceeds by far our imagination. In the house cut system, the amount the motorboat racing associations in various regions earn is about 2 trillion yen annually with 24 boat raceways nationwide. Seventy-five percent of that is returned to fans and the remaining 25 percent is allocated to expenses for holding them or the local autonomous bodies that sponsor them and the motorboat racing associations in the various regions. The take of the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation is 3.3 percent of sales. In other words, it has become a system where a house cut of about 66 billion yen annually rolls in by doing nothing. This is allocated as subsidies related to merchant shipping and ship construction (Title I grants) and culture and welfare groups (Title II grants). However, the actual amount of the allocation balloons to about 140 billion yen if the interest portion is included. This house cut system takes on a "public" nature and should be called tax money that formerly was collected by the Treasury, and administration in full view of the public is stringently sought. It is Ryoichi Sasagawa who sits in the post of chairman that runs the show in subsidy allocation. Moreover, he has a hand in the budget as chairman of the National Motorboat Racing Association Federation [Zenmoren] that is the agent for the racers. According to a racing association source, that system "collects the dirty house cut with the right hand and distributes it as honest money with the left hand. Moreover, the more it distributes, the more gigantic it becomes and stories roll in of vested interests from around the world with connections to Ryoichi Sasagawa who has an ample network of people in it. For example, if a single company is designated for a project, a commission is accepted." It is an "ingenious system, completely untainted," so to speak. Moreover, the greatest feature of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation is that it is a juridical foundation as opposed to other forms of gambling, such as cycle racing and horse racing in which, being special corporations, personnel authority for officers is held by a supervising government agency. In other words, personnel changes are completely at the will of Sasagawa and it is "the only publicly operated gambling organization" that gets by just with the approval of the Ministry of Transport. <graphic> </graphic> Under the law, approval of the Ministry of Transport must be obtained for the allocation of those subsidies, but the relationship between the chairman and the Ministry of Transport is such that "when the chairman goes to give New Year's greetings, all the employees stand erect and greet him, and even the bureau directors come to the entrance and stand up straight" (Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation source). He even has the Ministry of Transport under his thumb. Sasagawa designates his own related groups, which are just like the tentacles of an octopus, as the recipients to whom the subsidies flow. He has cleverly managed to control the matter within ahe family by appointing his third son Yohei to important positions such as chief managing director of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation and concurrently chairman of the Tokyo Prefecture Motorboat Racing Association, and placing at end points of the industry "Taiyo Printing" (managed by his eldest son Masatada), which prints boat tickets, etc.; "Yamato Motor," which has a monopoly on racing boat engines; and "Nihon Tota," which supplies boat ticket issuing machines (management participation in these two companies by second son Takashi, currently member of House of Representatives). In the past, criticism has been raised many times about this organization that "it is improper to have the same family involved in the income and outgo of money," and "it should be a special corporation like cycle racing and horse racing." However, no impropriety has been discovered at all, and consequently, Sasagawa control has not been shaken. Everything has been accomplished because of the very fact that it is Ryoichi Sasagawa. A Dismissal Incident A rent in that empire began to be seen about one year ago. It was because a rumor started that "the chairman was senile." It is said that immediately "there was a telephone call" from Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who spearheads the Seibu group, "wanting to meet with Chief Managing Director Yohei" (Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation source). A rumor spread that Tsutsumi was involving the Ministry of Transport and aiming for the position of chairman. A shock was generated internally. On 26 May 1993, an internal feud in the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation surfaced all at once. On this day, Kano, the head of the Public Relations Office, who reportedly opposed Yohei, suddenly was fired. It was disciplinary dismissal action. The reasons were recorded thus on a standard sheet of paper transmitting the official announcement. "1. Spoke exceeding job authority, intimidated and committed intimidating acts, and carried out coercive actions against superiors. "2. In addition, took similar actions against fellow workers and committed impardonable acts in an organization." "The above-stated points 1 and 2 pertain to No. 2 and No. 5 of Article 49 of the Work Regulations." Intimidated superiors and fellow workers -- is not a gentle reason. However, in essence, it seems the gist is that "he went against Yohei who is the chief managing director." "He made use of the media and leaked the inside situation to the outside." Kano met Ryoichi Sasagawa when he was 27, became entranced by the Sasagawa idea, and "hired himself as private secretary." Until a certain time, he was the fellow usually at the side of the chairman and thereafter came to work for the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation for a period of 20 years. Something extraordinary must have happened for a man like Kono to be punished unilaterally and in a form equivalent to "a death sentence" for a white-collar worker. The Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation began to shake inside with the disciplinary dismissal of Kano. Chief Managing Director Yohei's side began a purge of the Kano group. Section chiefs who were believed to be friendly with Kano were called one by one and given a hearing on the circumstances. Furthermore, agents who were acquainted with Kano from the standpoint of chief of the Public Relations Office were pressured. Clearly, something unusual was happening in the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. What was the real reason that he was fired? I met Kano. Along with claiming that the punishment was improper, he informed me about the real state of affairs and that a reign of terror by Chief Managing Director Yohei had begun inside the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. Below, I will pursue the background for this sudden punishment based on testimony from Kano and some 10 odd inside sources whom I met. A Single Word From the "Mrs." The strategic preparation for the recent disciplinary dismissal actually goes back to a year ago. Last year, a similar incident occurred inside the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation concerning a personnel change of the chairman's private secretary. In March, Chief Managing Director Yohei broached the subject with M, who had been the chief of the chairman's Private Secretary Section, that he wanted "to replace him soon." The various department heads acknowledged that and left it up to the chairman. However, when Managing Director Yohei and Masahiko Yoshimatsu, director of the Secretariat, sounded him out, the chairman indicated that M would stay in his post and, ultimately, it was left at that. However, it was 31 March, the day before delivery of the appointments. When M, chief of the Private Secretary Section took the chairman to his home in Sengoku, Tokyo, his wife, Shizue Sasagawa, came out and said, "You won't need to come starting tomorrow." The chairman was silent and said nothing. With these words, the personnel change was made. The personnel change was settled overnight in a form that accepted the will of the wife, not a discussion of the chief of the Secretariat and others with the various department chiefs. The next day, M, chief of the Private Secretary Section, was transferred to be chief of the Loan Section. His wife Shizue is the person mentioned before who is called "Mrs." in the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. She is said to be "the woman closest" to the chairman and is the only person who can influence the mind of the weakened chairman. Perhaps for that reason, Chief Managing Director Yohei, who "had been on bad terms with her for a long time" (according to a source), quickly got close to the wife, beginning about one year ago. However, although she lives in Sengoku and carries the last name of Sasagawa, she is not actually the legal wife of the chairman. Ryoichi Sasagawa's legal wife is Kazue (73), who is called "the Osaka Mrs." by those inside. Shizue took the last name of Sasagawa by becoming the adopted daughter of the chairman's younger sister. Of course, she is neither the real mother nor the foster mother of Chief Managing Director Yohei. However, she is said to be "the woman that the chairman has loved the most since the war," and she was the woman who made visits almost daily to meet Ryoichi Sasagawa when he was incarcerated in Sugamo Prison as a class-A war criminal and was awaiting a death sentence (later released). Sasagawa later told those close to him that Kazue became extremely angry at him when he told her that he was `thinking of putting Shizue on the family register.'" She is talented on the chikuzen biwa (style of lute playing) and it was Shizue's biwa at the end of the NHK program that ended with "Goodbye, everyone in Japan" on the day of the Iwo Jima defeat. She is also a scholar in Chinese poetry recitation and currently is vice chairman of the Japan Recitation, Sword, Poetry, and Dance Promotion Society [Ginkenshimai], one of the related groups of Ryoichi Sasagawa. A person close to the Sasagawa family says, "She is a charming person and still like a schoolgirl." However, there is another face to her. That is the face of "empress of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation." This spectacle is often witnessed by the staff in the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation building: A person connected with the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation waits holding a hot towel in front of the women's restroom. When wife Shizue comes out, he says, "Here you are, Mrs." and holds it out to her respectfully. Moreover, the Benz in which she rides, including the driver, comes from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. The gorgeous recording room across from the elevator hall on the 10th floor of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation building was made for her, and it is said that "special consideration is made" to her group for subsidies that are granted by the foundation every year. It is a privilege given to "the woman that Sasagawa loves most." Her words that "you won't have to come here starting tomorrow" truly rival the words of the chairman. [passage omitted] Secret Agreement on Coup d'Etat? On 26 May, the fateful day for Kano came. It was the disciplinary dismissal action. Kano has filed a personal integrity suit with that as a complaint. It could be that Chief Managing Director Yohei punished Kano, who previously had been close like a brother, as a warning for "a fellow who knows too much about me" because he coveted the post of chairman. It seems that the results were immediate. A person connected with the foundation whom I contacted designated a hotel room as the place for collecting the information and was worried about being noticed and being followed. "Indeed, such punishment was unusual. However, he had been making very threatening moves for the past year. It was punishment for that series of moves." Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu explains thus. And after acknowledging an apology in front of the department and section chiefs on 5 April, he flatly says, "There is no internal feud as has been reported. It (the foundation) is extremely calm." On the other hand, he said there is an anti-Yohei group inside that sympathizes with Kano. Unmistakably, a serious disturbance is occurring in the Sasagawa empire that had boasted of being a monolith. Such information has leaked from in and around the foundation as if it aimed at the cracks. "Actually an emergency motion was scheduled to be introduced at the board of directors meeting to approve the settlement of accounts on 27 May. It was to move Chairman Sasagawa to honorary chairman and install Chief Managing Director Yohei in the post of chairman. Then the director of the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau at the Ministry of Transport would receive a post-retirement appointment [amakudari] to the empty post of chief managing director. There had been a meeting for that purpose between Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu and Director of the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau Toda and it seems that Director Toda had said, `If the post of chief managing director is returned to us, Yohei will be appointed chairman somehow or other. The Ministry of Transport will take the responsibility and make the rounds of Nagata-cho (the politicians).' "However, Takashi, who heard this, said that `It would be a serious matter to do such a thing when trouble has been reported,' and called it off. Ultimately, the secret agreement on the coup d'etat plan could not be materialized." Managing Director Yohei, Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu, and Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau Director Toda deny the secret agreement, but several persons on the inside say there is no mistake. Nevertheless, what are the serious allegations that have come out from time to time? The big project allegations that Kano told to Chief Managing Director Yohei at the Hotel Okura and were later reported by some of the media are the allegations concerning the "Hotel Kaiyo," the super high-rise hotel that is said to have had total construction costs of about 25 billion yen, and "Boatopia Himeji," an off-track boat ticket sales office that the motorboat racing world launched to compete with horse racing. Perhaps Kano might have been fired because he touched upon that "alleged secret agreement." Tracing the flow of money, I came up against some rather interesting facts. One purpose of this report is to shed light on the actual situation of that accounting. Before that, however, I would like to review the details concerning the appointment of Yohei to the position of chief managing director, which is virtually the No. 1 post. It is because he was appointed to this post that the propriety of heredity, which should not exist at all in a foundation that is a nonprofit corporation, is being questioned. Ironically, it was Kano and Omori who made Yohei the chief managing director. At one time they worked together in the foundation as a "reform group" which involved Yohei. In May 1989 Yohei was appointed chief managing director of the foundation. The post of foundation chief managing director originally had been a seat designated as an amakudari post for successive directors of the Ship Bureau (later, the director of the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau) in the Ministry of Transport. It is said that when Ministry of Transport bureaucrats were appointed to that seat "the foundation had been virtually taken over." The Ministry of Transport had the authority to distribute amakudari to important places. "They would wait patiently. That was the feeling in the Ministry of Transport, and when the chairman died, they would take control at once and make it a special corporation like the Japan Keirin Association and JRA [Japan Racing Association]." When they tried to hold department or section chief conferences, they were rejected with the words, " Go talk to the Ministry of Transport and discuss that with them," or "There is no need for you to think about that," and they could not even hold conferences. "They wanted to grasp the post of managing director and make the foundation a private enterprise. They wanted to create a free, open-minded work place." That was the reform. Kano and Omori were at the center of the group promoting it. The two schemed to recapture the chief managing director post, which is basically the top post after chairman, from the Ministry of Transport, place a private citizen in it, and make the foundation a private enterprise. "There Is No One Left But Me" The chance came suddenly. In 1983, Chief Managing Director Eiichi Tasaka, a Ministry of Transport veteran who was widely known as an able man, suddenly died. It was just about that time that Yohei had joined the foundation as a director. Until then, Yohei had been at "Nihon Tota," which was connected with Takashi Sasagawa, but "He was young, smart, and articulate. This person might some day...." Thinking thus, Kano and Omori brought him along. They probably could sweep out the Ministry of Transport completely by this. Quickly, Kano and others persuaded the chairman. Everyone was fervent. Yohei also was in the middle of it. The one planned for the post was Yujiro Shinoda, professor at the Social Economics Research Center at Sophia University. He also was a director of the foundation and was not totally unrelated. "We will have Shinoda take over the post." The Ministry of Transport was silent in the face of a mere word from the chairman. It happened in 1984. At the time, this personnel change received much attention by the media, evoking talk about "the appointment of a literary scholar to what had been an amakudari post for successive directors of the Ship Bureau of the Ministry of Transport." However, Shinoda changed the moment he sat in the chair of chief managing director. It was a position where the budget of 100 billion yen could be moved anywhere by his signature alone. That was magic power. The power little by little ate away at Shinoda who had been a scholar. The crowd hoping for subsidies set him on a pedestal and he became alienated from the staff. Shinoda fell ill. That was the time. Yohei, who had been reticent up until then, said to Kano and the others, "I will be it. There is no one left but me." So, Yohei was appointed the post of chief managing director in 1989." However, the reaction of the Sasagawa family was strange. The chairman extremely disliked Yohei's appointment to the position of chief managing director. It was Omori and Kano who persuaded him. Ryoichi's three children, including Yohei, are illegitimate, and Ryoichi Sasagawa did not hesitate to say to people around him that "he is no child of mine." When his associates said that his face resembled him, Sasagawa would make a serious face and say, "No, I went to the hospital and fully checked this out (pretending to squeeze his crotch). I have no offspring." At times he has shouted at Yohei, "Give back your name (of Sasagawa)!" On those occasions, Yohei has turned pale. It can be said that Sasagawa is more severe than necessary with Yohei. When Yohei volunteered that he wanted to be chief managing director, the Sasagawa family was rigidly opposed. At the time, the wife Shizue, with whom he was on bad terms, said with rage, "If you do that, the Sasagawa family will be destroyed. It will fall to pieces!" Takashi, who already had turned to the political world, was furious with anger. "What are you doing!" he stormed in with rage, and it is said that a terrible quarrel between brothers took place. It was a fight to be heir to the don. It will be mentioned in more detail later, but the Sasagawa family had to have "a flesh and blood fight" concerning the heir to the don. It is said that Yohei begged, "Father, why don't you approve me? Let me do it," while crying in front of Ryoichi in Sengoku. It was Chief Managing Director Yohei that was born as a result. It was a difficult delivery, but the birth of the young chief managing director seems to have held the hopes of the reform faction staff that "it will change the image of the foundation at once by this." [passage omitted] Yohei was born the child of Kiyoko Ogawa (deceased), a hostess at Tokyo Kaikan, a high-class cabaret in Ginza, Tokyo, in 1939. According to a person close to the Sasagawa family, "she was the most beautiful of all the women with whom the gallant chairman had relations." However, Ryoichi visited the home of Kiyoko in Asakusa, Tokyo, only several times a year. It is mentioned in The Unprecedented Man Ryoichi Sasagawa (by Sohachi Yamaoka), which is said to be written based on dictation from Sasagawa, that Yohei remembered Ryoichi coming to the house in Asakusa only three or four times when he was about five. [passage omitted] It is reasonable that Yohei grew up as a child without knowing the face of his father at all. After Ryoichi left Sugamo Prison, he lived with Shizue. When Yohei turned 18, he was placed in the charge of Ryoichi at Sengoku, but it was in 1970 when he became 31 that he formally took the last name of Sasagawa. Although Ryoichi was his own father, he was not a father to him. Such probably was the existence for him. Yohei was daunted in front of Ryoichi. On the other hand, Kano and Omori were the closest associates of Ryoichi and those outside say, "The two seem to be just like children of the chairman." [passage omitted] There is a crowd that is on more intimate terms and closer just like sons to Ryoichi Sasagawa than him [Yohei]. It is not strange that the buds of love and hatred toward them already had been cultivated there. When Yohei grasped authority -- the post of chief managing director -- he changed completely and probably could not avoid looking at them with a harsh eye. The reason for Yohei's later favorite phrase, "I will act differently from the chairman," probably lies in his early days. Chairman Collapses at Party On the chairman's state of health, Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu says, "He is in good health. He comes every morning and decisions are made every day. He has no illness peculiar to the old as written in the media. Being old, however, he sometimes repeats the same story from beginning to end. Other than that, he has somewhat lost his ability to remember. His only chronic disease is hemorrhoids and he was hospitalized only for two days for surgery on an ulcer on his shoulder," but.... Ryoichi Sasagawa's health condition has been concealed until now by a very few close associates. Only a very few know about it even within the foundation. It is because the Ministry of Transport, who had the position of chief managing director stolen away since Eiichi Tasaka, has been on the alert, looking for a chance to recover it. They must not give them an excuse. According to those around him, Sasagawa, when he was healthy, "would not use the elevator in buildings of some 10 stories, but would walk down the emergency stairs. When asked why, the chairman would say, `I am chairman of the World Federation of Firefighters. I can certify safety; besides, it is good for the body.' The people with him got tired. It was hard when they reached the bottom of the emergency stairs and found the door locked and they all had to go back up the stairs with the chairman. They got really tired." "In any event, he is healthy. Even though he is over 70 years old, he shows people that he is healthy by doing push-ups. Even if you say `please don't,' he continues, saying `No.' You'll be amazed." "At any rate, he has good intuition. He goes through the thick documents at tremendous speed, stamping his seal of approval, bam, bam, bam, bam. Yet sometimes he comes to a sudden stop; he knows when there is something wrong. It's like he smells it. It's magic. You'll be amazed." Sasagawa has a tremendous tenacity for life. To prevent senility, he runs high voltage electricity through his body to make the blood circulation good for peripheral nerves. Moreover, he does all sorts of things, such as taking the fresh air and taking tonics. This healthy Sasagawa suddenly collapsed around 1981 or 1982 in Hakone. "He was attending a party and when everyone made a toast, the chairman collapsed with a thud, still holding his glass. What? I thought, but the chairman collapsed so that the contents of the glass did not spill. `Chairman, you must not joke,' Eeveryone was saying. Then he began snoring and everyone was alarmed and confused." A doctor was called immediately. It was a light cerebral hemorrhage. Sasagawa was in a state as though he was dead for about two months and could not move. When he gradually became better, "he pulled out his own hair and saying, `It must not be good to have so much hair,' `How could I allow myself to succumb to a trifling thing like this hair!' he glared at the hair that he clutched. Then when he had a little command of his body, he crawled restlessly around the room." Those concerned concealed it with a trip abroad. The second time he collapsed was in 1983 when Sasagawa was 84 years old. The site was the Keio Plaza Hotel. He was returning from a lecture. In the lecture that day, Sasagawa had talked to the audience with exceptional strength. "Just as he got into the car, he tottered. When I looked, he was asleep, snoring. He was immediately hospitalized at St. Luke Hospital. It took one week for him to recover." That too was completely concealed. After that, Sasagawa was fatigued and collapsed many times. Even though he was urged to rest, he carried out a hard schedule, saying, "Even if I hide in a vault and have 100 doctors manage my health, when it is time to die, I will die." The restoration of Sasagawa's health began when he was 88 and started jogging, but his body gradually has weakened like a fire going out. It seems that his close associates, who watched him deteriorating, began to think that they would like to make it so that they could speak of him with a nicer title, not the title of "left wing, A-class war criminal" when he died. The strategy to capture the Nobel Peace Prize was born there. One thing is noticed in viewing the profile of Ryoichi Sasagawa. The image of "respect motivated by fear" which he has had before and after the war has changed dramatically in two aspects. One is the conversion from a symbol of anti-Communism, and the other is the start of aggressive activities abroad. Ulcer Was the Occasion for Weakening When the controversial Unification Church established its first base in Japan in 1963, it was Ryoichi Sasagawa who became its consultant. In the late 1960's, Sasagawa was appointed chairman of the International Victory Over Communism Federation, but at the time, several staff members of the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation and his related groups, by order of Sasagawa, "took lectures to become leaders of the Unification Church at the training center for motorboat racers at Lake Motosu" (inside source). Also it is said that he gave ministers of the Unification Church part-time work and supported them by giving them a salary for about a year. The sudden conversion from such "anti-Communism" was in 1972. Actually, this was due to advice from his close associates. Then in the late 1970's, Sasagawa became aggressively involved in activities abroad with their advice. The object there was acquiring the Nobel Peace Prize. The beginning of a chance seemed to be when the grandson of Nobel came to Japan. It is noted during the various talks there that he was convinced that "The Nobel Prize is not given, it is acquired. There are people in the world who nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize. I must make inroads with them." However, their names are concealed. He obtained the information little by little. Then his private secretaries found their way to the nominators. For example, there is Linus Pauling. He was a person who took two, the Nobel Peace Prize and the Nobel Chemistry Prize. He was a researcher on vitamin C and he also was one of the nominators. So, the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation began subsidies to the Linus Pauling Research Institute.... He just privately diverted foundation money to satisfy his own desire for fame. This was a secret that Ryoichi Sasagawa was being promoted as a candidate of the Nobel Peace Prize. [passage omitted] The occasion when Sasagawa gradually began to wane was the surgery for the ulcer that Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu previously mentioned one year ago. However, an informed source says that it was not an ulcer, but a burn scar. He explains, "When he was in Sugamo Prison, U.S. officers mistakenly suspected that the moxa cautery administered by the B- and C-class war criminals to people in China was `torture' and they were about to inflict severe punishment. When the chairman heard this, he said, `That is medical treatment. It is done this way,' and he burned some moxa at the nape of his neck to show them and dispelled the misunderstanding. It was the burn that came from that time." It is said that when that scar was neglected, it became cancerous and was removed by surgery, but the total anesthesia of his body was the clincher and Ryoichi weakened all of a sudden. [passage omitted] This weakening made Yohei uneasy. Preparing for the worst, he had to begin creating a hasty system. "Favors Sold to Politicians" As previously mentioned, the motorboat racing world is a world that could be created because of the very fact of Ryoichi Sasagawa. When Yoshio Kodama, who was called the leader of the right wing, controlled the seven chivalrous groups of Kanto and created the "Kanto Association," visited Sasagawa, he would take a rigid, upright position before the room and enter, saying, "Kodama is coming in, sir." He never sat on a chair until Sasagawa urged him. Moreover, if a fellow came in hopes of money, Sasagawa chased him away with a roar, saying "you have to kill me to get it!" Yohei does not have that power. He has only the influence of his father. So what was he thinking? It was an alliance with the political world and the Ministry of Transport to replace that. That is what Ryoichi most hated and especially alliance with the Ministry of Transport was close to "shaking hands with the devil" for a group who was defending to the death the position of chief managing director and wanted to promote privatization. In the case of Chief Managing Director Yohei, however, it probably was absolutely necessary to achieve inheritance of the chairman post which he eyed relentlessly. Thus, it was a natural course of events for the hearts of close associates who had come to serve Ryoichi and Yohei to be alienated from Yohei. It is said that Tsuneo Watanabe, president of YOMIURI SHIMBUN, has become the "political world instructor" for Yohei. It is said that Yohei quickly became close to both former prime ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita through him. For example, on 5 May 1990, he played golf with both former prime ministers Nakasone and Takeshita and Tsuneo Watanabe at the Fuji Sakura Country Club in Yamanashi Prefecture. On 14 June, he played golf with Takeshita, Kiichi Miyazawa, and Tsuneo Watanabe at the Three Hundred Club in Shizuoka Prefecture. Moreover, on 31 July, he golfed with both former prime ministers Nakasone and Takeshita and the deceased Shintaro Abe, and they chatted for two hours the night before at Yohei's villa on Lake Kawaguchi. The staff says about such things, "When we meet with officials, we are instructed to report casually that Yohei met with Takeshita yesterday..." Moreover, in September 1990, when he returned to Japan after a meeting with former Soviet President Gorbachev, Yohei spread the rumor among the staff that "I was carrying secret documents for Takeshita." Moreover, now that Takeshita has lost his standing, he has begun to say inside, "Takeshita is no good. Now it is Mitsuzuka." The problem, however, is not the indiscreet talk or golf. The problem is the reason why he is contacting the political world. He is using subsidies from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, which is inherently public money, to try to buy favors from politicians. The subsidies allocated by the Japan Shipbuilding Foundation are under the rigorous supervision of the Ministry of Transport, and such a thing should not be permitted. However, "There are many recommendations from Diet members in the Foundation subsidy applications, but when Chairman Sasagawa was healthy, he highly detested such strings attached. Therefore, a sense of fair play was required. Chief Managing Director Yohei, however, is different. He gives preferential treatment to them and when the subsidy grants are informally decided, he orders staff to `quickly contact the politician and sell a favor'" (informed internal source). Moreover, each time, he has the staff confirm whether thanks have come from the interceding Diet member and if not, he has them phone for a reminder. This is just like using the subsidies allocated by the foundation as a tool for Yohei's political schemes Actually, I have two pages of inside information at hand. One is a letter in memo style. The other is a list entitled "Project Applications for Fiscal 1988." In other words, it is information related to the spoils from Yohei's "selling favors" to politicians. Written in the letter is thus, "Yoshimatsu, There was a telephone call of thanks from the distinguished gentleman previously mentioned. After referencing your list of names, please let me know the names of those who have not contacted us. Sasagawa." Sasagawa, of course, is Yohei. Written on the left under "Foundation welfare appreciation TEL" is a list of the names of 23 House of Representatives members, including Koichi Kato, and three House of Councilors members. There is another list. On it are the names and telephone numbers of 42 Diet members, including Yasuhiro Nakasone, Ryutaro Hashimoto, and Yoshiro Mori, and then the name of the group and scheduled amount for the grant. Like this, for example: Name of Diet member or other introducer: Shoichi Nakagawa (Hokkaido 5) Name of group: Yubetsu Welfare Association Name of project: construction of special home for care of senior citizens Ranking: (blank) Amount of subsidy/assistance request: 194,300 Amount scheduled: 194,300 The unit is 1,000 yen. Then there is a mark believed to be a check ahead of the name. Perhaps being no contact of thanks yet, "later" is written next to Noboru Takeshita. There is also his older brother's name, Diet member Takashi. When I tried to confirm it with Diet member Nakagawa, he said, "The item of your inquiry was recommended by my office. When building a special home for the care of senior citizens, at the request of the Hokkaido Development Agency, we asked the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation and others for a construction fund grant for the portion not covered by the Ministry of Health and Welfare budget. Since this is a open matter, I do not thing that there is any special problem" (Private Secretary Saito, Nakagawa's office). Regardless of the fact that the source of the funds is the house cut on gambling, the subsidies allocated by the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation are treated as public money and acts that can be misunderstood are strictly forbidden. In addition, this is supposedly supervised rigorously by the Ministry of Transport. Why has the Ministry of Transport ignored this situation? Actually, it is a circumstance where it can only be believed that the Ministry of Transport also adheres. Golf With 11 From Transport Ministry Vice Minister on Down An informed source of the Foundation says, "Our jurisdiction is the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, but that is a technical officer position. Chief Managing Director Yohei says, `It is the administrative officer, not the technical officer, who has power. In the future, we must get close to the Transport Policy Bureau or future candidates for administrative vice minister.'" For that reason, on 9 August 1992, Yohei invited Ministry of Transport bureaucrats to golf at the Fuji Sakura Country Club. There were a total of 11 people participating: Administrative Vice Minister Toru Nakamura Transport Councilor Kiyoshi Terashima Secretary General Minoru Toyoda Senior Councilor Hideaki Mukaiyama Director, Transport Policy Bureau, Hideo Otsuka Director, Road Transport Bureau, Yasutoshi Tsuchisaka Director, Maritime Transport Bureau, Yoshitoshi Asami Director, Ports and Harbors Bureau, Masaaki Uemura Director, Civil Aviation Bureau, Michihiko Matsuo Director, Documents Section, Shogo Arai Director, Seafarers Department, Masakazu Nagao It is a prominent line-up. All of them should be called the central officers of the Transport Ministry. Looking at the list which forms "the car preparation report" for the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation from the Ministry of Transport and the "8 August (Saturday) Car Dispatch Allocation Preparation List" that the foundation prepared upon its receipt, which I have obtained, it is learned that they went the day before to Yohei's villa in Yamanashi Prefecture, riding separately in four foundation cars and two hired cars chartered by the foundation, spent one night there, and then met for golf. Naturally, they had a reception at the villa and the return home probably was similar. Isn't this unprecedented "entertainment"? How does the Ministry of Transport respond? It was Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau Director Toda who replied. " I have been told that they all went. I also received an invitation, but didn't go because of business. Such golf parties are not routine, but it seems like there have been several so far. They probably went because it would be rude to refuse. I believe that it is within the scope of etiquette." Furthermore, in regards to matching the schedule of 11 officers, "It probably was planned a long time ago. Oh yes, it was golf at the beginning of August, wasn't it?. Everyone clears their schedule before the Bon festival." The common sense of the Ministry of Transport must be doubted. I asked a bureau director-level bureaucrat about "the scope of etiquette." He was speechless. "Entertainment of so many people normally is impossible. It is not common sense. It will end up becoming a big problem," he said. Can they really say that they are supervising the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation in this manner? He had hold of politicians and the Ministry of Transport. Did he think that now there was nothing to fear? Yohei rushed full speed into the big projects of "Hotel Kaiyo" and "Boatopia Himeji" which were to be the symbol of the start of the "second Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation era" which was his own aim, and these were much bigger projects than the scale of previous projects. "Hotel Kaiyo" opened in October 1992. Total construction cost was about 25 billion yen. It is a building with 23 floors above ground and four below ground. It has a rather splendid appearance and soars up unexpectedly in the shopping district of Shin Okubo. A panoramic view of the neighboring Kanto prefectures is possible from the bar lounge on the 22d floor. [passage omitted] Once Permission Is Given, It Is Unrestricted The issues are the following two points. According to an inside source, "One point is that a request for a subsidy was made to the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation from the Marine Foundation with the objective of repairing the Ship Science Museum, and the funds that were granted were transferred into the "Hotel Kaiyo" building fund, which is a special account. Moreover, it was not just for a single fiscal year. Looking at the statement, that transfer of money was continued for four consecutive years with 2.63 billion yen in fiscal 1990, 2 billion yen in fiscal 1991, 2 billion yen in fiscal 1992, and 1,395 million yen in fiscal 1993. "Furthermore, the second point is that 3 billion yen borrowed from the general account is different in pretext from the time of application. It was a project, including provision of the infrastructure, for the permanent anchorage and display of the "Yotei Maru," an Aomori-Hakodate ferry boat that already had been purchased, in the waters in front of the Ship Science Museum." In other words, it was this. A subsidy that was received under the pretext of a public works project was applied to the construction expenses for the "Hotel Kaiyo" every year. Moreover, the foundations involved with this hotel are all controlled by the Sasagawa family. I would like you to look at the following: Marine Foundation chairman, Ryoichi Sasagawa; chief managing director, Eichi Kamiyama; director, Yohei Sasagawa. SO Foundation chairman, Ryoichi Sasagawa; director, Yohei Sasagawa (former chief managing director). Upon further investigation, we find that these foundations were all established with subsidies from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. It goes without saying that Yohei, the chief managing director, is the one who holds real power in the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. This means that Sasagawa-affiliated foundations poured money from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, from right to left, like a tunnel company, to raise construction funds for the "Hotel Kaiyo." It is no different from a money-laundering scheme by the Sasagawa family. It can be said that the "Hotel Kaiyo" was created with grant money from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, which supposedly require strict examination.. I reiterate, Yohei controls the strategic positions in that flow. Moreover, the amount of the subsidy granted to foundations by the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation normally is said to be 1 billion and some yen in both the welfare sector and special cases. The amount for the Marine Foundation alone is very large. How was such a thing done? Subsidies from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation need the permission of the Ministry of Transport at the time of application. What about the check system of the Ministry of Transport? A very interesting fact came out upon investigation. "When you want to transfer a subsidy once it has been granted, you don't use it and leave it in a pool and you can make a project change at the end of the fiscal year. This change can be made just by a settlement inside the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation." In other words, regardless of the pretext, once permission is given and the subsidy comes out, they change the object of fund use. It becomes what is called ex post facto approval by the Ministry of Transport. The Marine Foundation "was inspected by the Ministry of Transport twice regarding construction objective, purport of construction, fund procurement, contracts, and payment. Since it passed everything in February and March this year and received a license, I believe that there won't be any problem. The reason for two inspections was that, being cautious, the Ministry of Transport wanted to inspect with another set of personnel. The General Affairs Section of the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau was in charge" ( Yasuki Tobita, acting general manager, Marine Foundation "Hotel Kaiyo"). The Ministry of Transport responds thus, "We were shown in advance the details of the fund allowance. We do not think that there is a problem. As for the transfer from the general account, it was just a transfer to the "Hotel Kaiyo" in the form of a temporary loan of the subsidy obtained from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation with the objective of improving the environment of the Ship Science Museum. That is because it was involved with the Marine Subcenter of Tokyo Plan, the construction was delayed from the outset and ended up not being used for that reason. We approved it in advance and do not believe that there is any problem. Since it is effective use of funds within the same foundation, the method of use is not strange, but it probably will be a problem if they do not return it" (Director Toda, Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau). However, I wonder what the Ministry of Transport thinks of using a subsidy under a certain pretext and transferring it elsewhere and continuing to do that for over four years. It could be understood if some subsidies were transferred to another project just for a year. However, how can you explain a subsidy that is given under the same pretext every year and changed to the same project every year? The misunderstanding cannot be avoided that the large, excessive flow of money to the "Hotel Kaiyo" is a juggling of the books. Why wasn't the transfer of that portion to another public works project considered? It is not a matter that it should be returned as the Ministry of Transport says. The moral responsibility for a method of granting subsidies that can be misunderstood must be brought to question. [passage omitted] Bride Also Was Introduced [Kaga] Please explain the reason for the disciplinary dismissal of Kano on 26 May. [Sasagawa] You can't do a disciplinary dismissal half-way. It is now pending in court. Since it is an issue of a person's honor, we cannot say anything. [Kaga] But, a disciplinary dismissal is like a sentence of death for a white collar worker. [Sasagawa] No, since he is a man of considerable wealth, I don't think that he will have trouble eating. [Kaga] Some see the recent strife as an internal feud of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. [Sasagawa] I don't know why you would say a feud. The organization is not split into two. If you look at events, there is only the matter of one capable staff member having a disciplinary dismissal. If you call it a feud when one person does bad things, then that probably is the word, but I don't believe so. [Kaga] Was there a secret agreement with the Ministry of Transport on creating a "coup d'etat" on 27 May? [Sasagawa] I know that such a thing was floating around as a rumor and it became an interesting and amusing story, but it probably doesn't merit comment. (At this point, there was still time to get responses and I directed the questions to the two allegations.) [Kaga] Why did you build such a lavish "Hotel Kaiyo"? [Sasagawa] Actually, there have been few facilities recently for students making a school excursion to Tokyo to stay, and since it would not be good in terms of education to complete a school excursion without seeing Tokyo, I wanted to build such a thing. Since regional hotels and facilities recently have improved, we decided to rebuild. Whether it is lavish or not is a subjective issue. There is a total of 12,200 tsubo and the total construction cost was 25 billion. Since the tsubo unit price construction cost was 1.6 million, we do not believe that is so lavish. [Kaga] However, is it permissible to transfer a special account to the general account? [Sasagawa] Since it is efficient use of funds within the foundation, there isn't any problem, is there? Since construction was delayed on the Tokyo Subcenter, we just borrowed it to use because a money surplus was created for a year or a year and a half. [Kaga] What process is undergone for the procedure of transferring money? [Sasagawa] The process is that first, a Marine Science Promotion Foundation board of directors meeting is held, approved items are brought to the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, and there are discussions with the person in charge of title one grant money at the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. Then if approval is made, it is brought to the one in charge at the Ministry of Transport to get their understanding. [Kaga] Allegations have been whispered about "Boatopia Himeji" also... [Sasagawa] We wanted a low-interest loan to do work on expanding the off-site boat ticket sales offices, and the first was "Boatopia Himeji." Fuji Rex is a company where I was an administrator a long time ago. We decided that we should have them do it and created it by persuading a great opposition movement. Now it is much appreciated by the shopping district, we are increasing the days that it is open and it seems that it is changing to cooperate for the benefit of the shopping district. [Kaga] It is said that there is a deep connection between you and Fuji Rex. Should it be called your company? [Sasagawa] It is a company where I worked for a portion of my youth since I served as administrator at the age of 32. I have had a very friendly acquaintance with Fujita and also was made an officer of Nihon Hikosen. Moreover, it is a fact that when I heard that the performance of the company had not been that good and they needed funds, I wanted to help. He also introduced me to my bride. However, he now is retiring. [Kaga] It seems that Fuji Rex is thinking about opening a chain of off-site boat ticket sales office with Store No. 2 and Store No. 3, but why is it centered on Fuji Rex? [Sasagawa] There is a head office promoting Boatopia nationwide and there are about 70 or 80 companies that want to build them now. Among them, the only ones that by chance are bearing fruit at the present point in time are the three locations of Himeji, Kure, and Akita. Major firms also have said that they want to participate in the future. It does not means that other businesses cannot participate because Fuji Rex is doing it. [Kaga] There are a lot of Fuji Rex staff members at the Marine Foundation. [Sasagawa] They are people who have been employed because they said they wanted to be devoted to hotel management over 20 years ago when I joined Fuji Travel as an administrator. [Kaga] Was financing initially a part of the modernized center concept? [Sasagawa] It was from the start. [Kaga] Last year, weren't the regulations revised to make financing possible for the first time? [Sasagawa] No, since government offices proceed with work in order, it only was approved in order. [Kaga] At the Fuji Sakura Country Club on 9 August last year, you played golf with 11 prominent members of the Ministry of Transport bureaucracy. Moreover, hired cars were sent to get them from the Foundation and they all stayed at your villa. [Sasagawa] Wasn't it seven or eight? It is a fact that we played golf. It is also a fact that we used foundation cars. However, our chairman is very strict, and the entertainment expenses for the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation are 16 million in all. Therefore, it is a fact that I personally invited them at my own expense, but it is only once a year. [Kaga] Is it an annual custom? [Sasagawa] No, it's not. It was a one-time courtesy thing last year and the year before last. I suppose you might have a good image when you hear a villa, but I and my wife laid out the bedding and they all slept together in a group.... [Kaga] You said it was personal, but drivers were hired. [Sasagawa] They were borrowed (from the foundation). [Kaga] Did you use your pocket money for their wages too? [Sasagawa] Since they are drivers that belong to the staff of the foundation, I do not pay. "This Is Awful Information" (He seemed to assume a threatening attitude and asked what was wrong with have a reception for government officials. What about another alliance, his connections with the political world?) [Kaga] Are there requests from politicians for approval of subsidies? [Sasagawa] Ryoichi Sasagawa has a better reputation to respond specifically to such a thing. It is a famous story, but long ago he asked, "Have any requests come from kith or kin?" When I said, "This and this have come," he said to remove those unconditionally. That is the way we have come to do business. In the words of Ryoichi Sasagawa, "Our work is a job that makes 10 people happy and 90 people enemies. We are thanked by the people who receive, but the many people who are left off say that Ryoichi Sasagawa is disgraceful." It is only the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation that so long as the case is good, it is the same whether or not it is particularly introduced by someone, and that is not involved with Diet members. [Kaga] You said that it would be rejected just by seeing the name of kith or kin, but among the grant projects in fiscal 1988 is a welfare facility mediated by Takashi Sasagawa. In the case of the chairman, is it just when seeing the name of Takashi that he does not say, "No good."? [Sasagawa] Naturally, he says it. [Kaga] I have heard that when you became chief managing director, political schemes were necessary and your have permitted applications with ties to politicians or ordered mediating politicians to express thanks. [Sasagawa] There is no reason for that. [Kaga] Don't you do confirmation work as to whether or not thanks have come by phone? [Sasagawa] That is not so. [Kaga] Would you take a look at this (look at "thanks list" in this article)? I believe that this is a request to get proper thanks. [Sasagawa] That is not so. [Kaga] But this has been checked as to whether someone mediated and whether there were proper thanks regarding projects with strings attached. In other words, isn't it the exact opposite of what you said now? [Sasagawa] It is a fact that there have been telephone calls (from politicians). They ask to be informed if anything happens... [Kaga] Looking at the items on this list, there is, for example, the item of ranking. There are no numbers, but viewed generally, this is something which you cannot help saying has strings attached. [Sasagawa] That is a matter of if it were to come, it would be nice that it came. I don't think that it is necessary to make a list of whether or not telephone calls of thanks came from Diet members. This is just a matter of my secretary writing down the telephone calls received. (To the chief of the No. 2 Operations Department) We are now talking about the philosophy of the chairman. In the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, the chairman determines whether a case is good or bad, no matter who requests it. When I explain that it is not that it was done or not done because it was requested by a Diet member, he says aren't we dealing with so many cases that involve politicians. I have not seen this information. Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: We in the No. 2 Operations Department undertake consultation on applications. Naturally, we consult with local autonomous bodies, and distinguished members of the Diet and the local community. Since there are cases where the private secretary seems to be in charge together with us, there are cases where we make up a list of them. An examination cannot be made by the administration if the details are not definite. The reason is that we have to create rigid criteria. [Sasagawa] I am just bragging. Compared to others, the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation has extremely little involvement with politicians. Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: Your use of such expressions such as involvement is causing problem, chief managing director. That is because when asked by people who do not understand this system, they take it to mean that it is controlled by them. [Kaga] No one is saying that this information is a forgery. We have confirmed that there were thanks from Diet members. Actually, it would not be necessary to create information that includes the names of Diet members if had no effect. [Sasagawa] We don't need this. I am amazed. This is awful information. Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: As a supervisor, I believe that it is a little different from whether this or that information created by the person in charge is not needed. I will not stop information for attempts to do highly motivated work. Contradiction in Yohei Sasagawa's Ambitions (He appeared considerably flustered. Inherently, the occurrence of this internal feud was due to the weakening of his father Ryoichi.) [Kaga] What about the health of the chairman? [Sasagawa] He laughed when I mentioned it (rumors of serious illness) to him. He still walks on his own feet. He doesn't need a hearing aid or eyeglasses for the old. We recently had a birthday party at the "Hotel Kaiyo" just for the family, but I led in the toasting and when I said, "They always say that the chairman will live until he is 200 years old, so please excuse us ordinary people if we precede you," he shouted loudly, "What foolish talk. You will live to be 200 years old too." In view of his age, I think that he is exceedingly healthy. [Kaga] I heard that there was opposition within the family when you were appointed chief managing director. [Sasagawa] That is not true. In fact, my older brother is taking the path of the politician. [Kaga] What do you think about the inheritance system? [Sasagawa] Honestly speaking, I think that it is the issue of a successor, but the successor is decided by the board of directors. Since there are people who have insight on the board of directors, I cannot be one just because I want to be it. I am putting all my effort into seriously doing the job that I now have been given. My interest is filial piety and I have been working by considering what would be best for Ryoichi Sasagawa. [Kaga] Yohei responded to the interview in the office of the managing director at the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation for about two hours. He is a man small in stature who resembles Ryoichi Sasagawa. He had a constant smile on his face. . His voice was sonorous and seemingly eloquent. His expression changed when I showed him the aforementioned "list of thanks." His expression up to that point vanished and he bent his head and was silent for a while. The two projects that are proceeding through the good offices of Yohei are his strategic preparation for inheritance. Moreover, the fact that Yohei has gotten close to politicians and the Ministry of Transport is to cover the influence that is far inferior to his father and to have those inside the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation as well as the Sasagawa family approve his "inheritance." However, there is a big contradiction. The closer he gets to the Ministry of Transport, the stronger will be the voice of the Ministry of Transport, and the farther will be the path toward control by the Sasagawa family, or in other words, to his "inheritance" and it might inevitably be linked to a special corporation like horse racing or cycle racing. Solidifying his position in the Sasagawa family and placing the Sasagawa empire under his control truly are nothing but a contradiction. Does Yohei really realize that contradiction? The motorboat racing world is an empire that has been maintained because of the very fact that it was Ryoichi Sasagawa. When the problem of Sasagawa's health was born, the collapse of the empire was inevitable.
