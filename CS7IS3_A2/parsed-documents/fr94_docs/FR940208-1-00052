FR940208-1-00052 FR940208-1-00011 Data directly from bulk gasoline terminals or pipeline facilities was not available to analyze the equipment leak potential emissions and reductions. The Agency used the emissions data that had been previously collected at petroleum refineries, including the Agency's published AP&hyph;42 emission factors. Subsequent to the Agency's analysis, new data specific to leaking components at bulk gasoline terminals was released in a published report. This data appeared to indicate lower emissions than those derived from the refinery data, and industry commenters urged the Agency to reconsider leak detection and repair standards for this subcategory. These commenters also stated that equipment components in use at gasoline production and distribution facilities are quite different, so the assumption that the leakage characteristics of components at these two types of facilities are similar may not be valid. To address this latter comment first, the Agency believes that the magnitude and frequency of leaks from components at these facilities are similar. This conclusion is based on several years of gathering and analyzing data on all configurations and uses of equipment at refineries and chemical production facilities. The Agency, in these data gathering efforts, found no correlation between temperature, pressure, or component size and the magnitude or frequency of leaks. The Agency performed a thorough review of the new data collected at bulk gasoline terminals. It was determined that, while acceptable test protocols were used, the quantity of data (which were for only a few terminals) were insufficient to warrant a change in the emission calculations for these components. Therefore, the Agency's conclusion that a periodic equipment monitoring program would be a cost-effective means of ensuring maximum HAP emission reductions is unchanged. The data discussed above indicates potentially lower equipment leak emissions rates than those found in testing refineries. It should be noted that any facilities where this may be the case, could qualify for the less frequent monitoring requirements in today's proposed standards, as provided for in 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV. The Agency is open to receiving additional data that could be used to quantify emissions and control levels of leaking equipment at bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations. This includes leak frequency data, leak correlation data, and information on programs that may be in place to reduce equipment leaks. Such data should include specifics on test procedures, applicable rules, control methods, etc. The Agency will review all data received in developing and assessing the final control requirements. The full range of control options presented here will be included in the consideration. 5. Consideration of Cost Implementation of Alternative IV, IV&hyph;Q, or IV&hyph;M is estimated to result in identical capital costs, approximately $125 million. This cost is primarily associated with retrofit or installation of vapor collection piping and vapor processors for loading racks at bulk gasoline terminals. However, there is a difference in annualized cost among these three alternatives due to annual costs and recovery credits associated with implementing LDAR programs at existing sources. Recovery credits are calculated based on the value and the amount of gasoline not allowed to evaporate or collected under each control alternative. Alternative IV&hyph;Q requires the smallest annualized cost, $15.8 million/yr, due to having the largest recovery credit per dollar spent on implementation of the program. Alternative IV&hyph;M is slightly more costly at $16.3 million/yr (recovery credits per dollar spent are not quite as large as IV&hyph;Q). Alternative IV has similar annualized cost as Alternative IV&hyph;M.
