Zaunitzer-Haase; place and date not given: "`Kohl Is My Man'"] [Text] [Zaunitzer-Haase] Who should be the head of the next government? [Stihl] I would like it to be Helmut Kohl. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Rudolf Scharping is out of the question? [Stihl] There were positive signals from industrial circles before the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] presented their draft government program. With these ideas, the Social Democrats have dropped back in terms of economic policy. The new taxes proposed in the SPD program have a deterrent effect on the economy and on me personally. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Does Helmut Kohl meet with your full approval? [Stihl] "Full" would be an exaggeration. Let us put it this way: Industry is basically content with the coalition's overall achievements. Just a few examples: European Union [EU] enlargement, the GATT agreement, the privatization of railroads and postal services, the first moves toward securing Germany as a business location. These are positive results. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Is there a "but" hidden somewhere? [Stihl] The government has made a dramatic mistake recently: The compromise on the nursing care insurance is unacceptable. You can take my word for it: Industry will not stop resisting this. [Zaunitzer-Haase] What are you planning to do? [Stihl] Well, we are not going to block highways. But we will take suitable measures. You can rely on that. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Let us come back to the "cabinet of your choice." Helmut Kohl should remain chancellor. Who will be economics minister? [Stihl] For me, the best economics minister of the past 20 years was Otto Count Lambsdorff. I would not mind his return. [Zaunitzer-Haase] You are have not participated in the recent attacks on Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. [Stihl] On the contrary. I have even protected him. When he speaks out against the law on shop-closing hours I applaud him. I hold two views on this issue: An official one that advocates limited extension of opening hours. And a personal one that says: Abolish the outdated shop-closing regulations. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Finance Minister Theo Waigel is said to be tired of his office. They say he does not want to hold this office beyond the current legislative period. [Stihl] If this is true -- but only on that condition, because Waigel has done his job quite well, considering the existing difficulties -- if it is true that he no longer wants to be finance minister, I have an idea who could become his successor. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Who? [Stihl] Karl Otto Poehl, the former Bundesbank president. He would certainly be a good choice. [Zaunitzer-Haase] But Pohl is a Social Democrat. [Stihl] What counts for industry is professional competence. It takes priority over party membership. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Can you imagine the Greens in the government? [Stihl] A government including the Greens is unthinkable for industry, because they have disqualified themselves even further by their recent party program. [Zaunitzer-Haase] How can we get out of recession? [Stihl] No additional taxes! No further tax burdens beyond the 7.5 percent surcharge from 1995, no reunification tax, or whatever. Industry misses convincing austerity measures on all levels. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Where and how? [Stihl] The Bundestag has too many members. We have too many ministries. Their number has to be reduced. [Zaunitzer-Haase] That will not be enough! [Stihl] The number of laender must be reduced. It is impossible that several of our 16 laender cannot support themselves financially. The so-called financial crisis of the laender is simply due to insufficient austerity resolutions. This has to be changed. [Zaunitzer-Haase] The financial crisis in most of the local governments is undisputed. [Stihl] I am not so sure about that. I hear nothing but complaints. But at the same time, taxpayers are stripped of their money. All the taxes are constantly being increased. This is an unacceptable situation!
