This spokesman said the embassy was not considering emergency measures "either for the community or for enterprises" as a result of the group's threat of "extremely ferocious and strong" operations against foreign tourists and investors issued Wednesday [2 February] after seven of the Islamic militants were killed in a police raid on an apartment in Cairo. "Caution and good sense mean not going into areas and quarters which are notoriously dangerous, avoiding provocative conduct and clothing, and taking account that Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, is about to begin," said the embassy spokesman to the Italian news agency ANSA. Also explained was that checks run on visitors to the diplomatic representation installed long ago, following earlier threats of this nature, were being kept in place. The president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Cairo, Cesare d'Ippolito, said he had witnessed no panic among Italian businessmen, who had all been informed of the statement sent out by the Islamic group.
