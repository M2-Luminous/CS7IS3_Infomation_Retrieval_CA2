In addition, the document states the country's minerals belong to the nation as a whole and urges a reversal of the current private ownership of mineral rights. However, this would not be through nationalisation. Speaking at an international executive communications conference in Johannesburg, ANC mineral and energy policy co-ordinator Paul Jourdan released details of the final draft of the reconstruction and development programme [RDP] completed Wednesday morning. The RDP put forward as a priority the further benefication of the country's minerals in order to boost foreign exchange earnings and increase the number of jobs in the mining industry. "Exporting raw ore is not benefiting our country in terms of employment and in terms of earing forex," Mr Jourdan said. The document also recognised industries involved in exploiting mineral resources were in long-term decline and an effort to move further downstream into fabrication activities would help alleviate the inevitable job losses. The RDP suggested the creation of incentives to encourage benefication such as a form of royalty payment that was dependent upon the further processing of ore. The establishment of a mineral marketing auditing office to control transfer pricing is also mooted. "We're thinking of a hit-squad that looks at transfer pricing of inputs and outputs by companies and takes them to the courts if necessary," Mr Jourdan explained. Import-parity pricing by sa mineral producers would be scrapped and replaced with less expensive export- or profit-parity pricing to benefit domestic fabricators. Underlying the reform of the mining industry, is changing the pattern of private ownerhsip and control of mineral rights. Mr Jourdan said this could involve a tax on mineral rights; expropriation on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis; and exchange through a system of licenses. He denied this would involve nationalisation but admitted it could be perceived as a "legislative, sleight-hand" form of nationalisation. In addition, the RDP suggested the creation of a black mining house through the sale of assets by private mining houses. The two key obstacles to small-scale mining would also be removed; namely, the lack of access to mineral rights, and the inadequacy of financing and technical support. The RDP document, drawn up by the ANC in conjunction with the Congress of SA Trade Unions and the SA National Civics Organisation, is to be discussed and amended, if necessary, at a conference later this month and adopted as official ANC economic policy, he said. The full RDP document on the economy is expected to be released later Wednesday or Thursday.
