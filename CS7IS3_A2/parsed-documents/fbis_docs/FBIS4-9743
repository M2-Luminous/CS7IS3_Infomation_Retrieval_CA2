Not only is this area plagued with the factors of violence that have hit the whole country--subversives with an urban wing, paramilitarism, drug trafficking, hired gunmen, land piracy, and family feuds--but municipal and departmental authorities are literally paralyzed by the lack of resources for carrying out social programs to deal with the poverty that is overwhelming the residents of the department capital (some 100,000) and of the 30 districts or hamlets (70,000). Along the highway between Cienaga and Santa Marta, drivers are waylaid and robbed about 10 times a week; and since the 1960's, the Sierra Nevada, which encompasses Cienaga, has been a center for the cultivation of marijuana, and more recently, coca and poppies. These activities, as is always the case, have led to violence. This situation prompted the inspector general of the Army, General Juan Salcedo Lora, to say about three weeks ago that "this is one of the most troubled areas in the country." The municipal jurisdiction has a paltry annual budget of 5 billion pesos. It has no capacity to contract debts, and is running a deficit of 1.2 billion pesos. Mayor Victor Dangond Noguera, in view of this difficult plight, is calling for a societal response. "It is not just a problem of armed individuals," he says, "it is a question of investment, of state presence, of absolute abandonment." In general, public efforts in this department have borne little fruit. Governor Miguel Pinedo Vidal blames the national government. He says that all local residents see is the work of foundations set up by some banana growers and marketers, who have invested about 750 million pesos in recent years and have brought in additional state investment amounting to 450 million pesos to improve essential services and housing in towns such as Varela, Orihueca, and Rio Frio. But these are mere bandaids in the face of needs that require an estimated 35 billion pesos in investments. In Pinedo's view, "Cienaga is going through one of its worst moments because of subversion and common crime, but above all because of a widespread moral crisis. Every day we see how crime is proliferating." And the director of the local office of the Administrative Department of Security (DAS), Mario Mejia, observes that many crimes are not connected, but are isolated incidents. In particular, those committed against political leaders--five have been murdered in the last four months--have caused the most anxiety. The council feels so threatened that it does not meet. In Cienaga and the rural area surrounding it, nine people are killed every 10 days. The victims are landowners, administrators, agronomists, workers, civic leaders, people passing through the area, and of course, the members of the 10 crime rings known to be operating throughout the region. The latter tend to have their headquarters here, particularly in the El Polvorin neighborhood, where it is very difficult to get a taxi driver to help you find an address. Other personal and property crimes have proliferated, as well. In the capital, even the tavern on the town square was closed down for lack of customers. In Cienaga people now go to bed early. Fear means that the law of silence prevails, and few believe that the authorities really investigate crimes, since there is so much impunity. The fear is so widespread that officials of the Investigative Unit of the Prosecutor General's Office refuse to go to the banana-growing region for any activities unless they are guaranteed adequate protection, and that protection must become "more and more adequate." The commander of the Army's First Division, General Rodolfo Torrado Quintero, whose office is only 15 kilometers from the area, demanded greater cooperation so that his 800 men and some 200 police officers could operate more effectively. "We are willing to do our duty. But we can do nothing if people do not cooperate, report crimes, or provide information. Without cooperation we can accomplish practically nothing," he says. Even the Catholic Church is losing ground in the area, which covers some 112,000 hectares, 18,000 of which consist of banana plantations, because new Protestant sects are displacing it in all of these areas of misery and despair. The population has skyrocketed in these places over the last three years, due to the highly publicized boom and the cotton crisis. But the boom was neutralized by the European Economic Community's restrictions and by Hurricane Brett last August. The only health clinics are in Rio Frio, Orihueca, El Reposo, and Guacamayal, and the doctors come every two weeks. These are the only towns with schools, as well. None of the streets or roads are paved, and communication between towns is limited. To serve 70,000 people there is only one telephone in the entire area of Orihueca. On a tour of the region, not a single police officer was to be seen, but soldiers were seen patrolling (the Cordova Battalion is based in the town of Santa Rosalia). They must deal with about 300 guerrillas of the Coordinating Committee, who camp in the most rugged parts of the Sierra Nevada and come down to fish in these troubled waters. According to Governor Pinedo, "We are becoming more like Uraba each day." [Box, p 9c] Little Has Been Done National Planning took the lead in promulgating the Social Action Plan for the Banana Region (Pasban), which earmarked 2.6 billion pesos for projects in the 30 banana-growing towns, to be carried out by the two private foundations that operate here (Fundeban and Fundauniban), the municipal jurisdiction of Cienaga, the Agrarian Fund, Findeter, and the community. The Pasban was supposed to be implemented over a two-year period beginning in June 1992. But since the state agencies--with the exception of the Agrarian Fund--have not come through, most of the burden has fallen on the shoulders of the two foundations. Moreover, they have had to carry out the procedures that municipal and departmental authorities were supposed to transact with the national agencies, because National Planning also abandoned them. Sixty-nine small construction and renovation projects have been completed under the auspices of the Pasban at health clinics, schools, electrification facilities, cemeteries, chapels, aqueducts, and playing fields. The investment amounts to approximately 1.2 billion pesos. The Solidarity and Social Emergency Fund (Foses) has just pledged with Fundauniban to contribute 208 million pesos for aqueducts in La Gran Via, Reposo-Aguja, El Salon, Soplador, and Palomar. [Box, p 9c] Murders Prompt Work Stoppage Yesterday Yesterday, to protest the murder of five members of the Trade Union of Workers in the Agriculture Industry (Sintrainagro), banana workers stopped cutting and packing the fruit in the Magdalena banana region and blocked the road from Cienaga to Fundacion. The killings occurred at the entrance to the La Ceiba plantation, owned by the Compania Frutera de Sevilla, in La Esquina Caliente in the district of La Gran Via (Cienaga). The victims were Juan Jose Tapias Hernandez, 39; Jairo Francisco Villa, 35; Auden Quintero Plata, 38; Jose Antonio Torres Zuniga, 25; and Robinson Caballero, 41. At 0530, 10 armed men in a red Daihatsu jeep with tinted windows stopped a group of laborers who were traveling in a "gondola" (a cart pulled by a tractor or an ox). "They had Galil rifles, submachineguns, and 9 mm. pistols. They called the workers by name, referring to a list they had, and then they shot them," stated a witness. When news of the killings spread, residents of Varela and Santa Rosalia (where the victims lived) gathered and began burning tires, painting the slogan "Down with the `Paras'" on cars, and demanding justice. The general secretary of Sintrainagro, Alfonso Maiguel Guerrero, was murdered in his home on 14 February. Yesterday's work stoppage affected some 65 plantations, and forced a temporary halt in exports. Magdalena Governor Miguel Pinedo Vidal sent a letter to President Cesar Gaviria urging him to give attention to "this area, which is practically becoming another Uraba." According to Pinedo, "Two developments have disturbed the communities in this department: The first was tropical storm Brett, which flattened 6,000 hectares, and you did not even bother to send a message of solidarity." The second is the violence that has brought tension to an area "that used to be peaceful in other times. Today it is gripped by murder, extortion, and blackmail by organized crime and all kinds of other criminals."
