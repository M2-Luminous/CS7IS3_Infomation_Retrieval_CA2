SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct in the following case: Keith A. Caruso, Cornell University. An inquiry conducted by Cornell University Medical College found that Dr. Caruso, while a medical student in the Department of Psychiatry, altered, fabricated, and destroyed primary laboratory data while learning techniques for insulin receptor binding on erythrocytes at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; this work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Caruso admitted to these acts of alteration, falsification and destruction of primary data. ORI has accepted the university's findings, and Dr. Caruso has signed an agreement with ORI accepting the finding of scientific misconduct and the administrative actions previously imposed by Cornell University. This agreement was made final on April 6, 1994. ORI has determined that the university's administrative actions were sufficient, and has not imposed any further Public Health Service actions.
