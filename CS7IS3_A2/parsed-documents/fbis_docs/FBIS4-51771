FBIS4-51771 "dreas085_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 South Korea Talks With Russia on DPRK Logger Issue Viewed Talks With Russia on DPRK Logger Issue Viewed SK0305003894 SK0305003894 BFN [Editorial Report] The conservative vernacular daily CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 2 May publishes in its "Reporter's Memobook" column on page 2 a 1,200-word article by Moscow-based correspondent O Chung-sok, under the headline "Diplomacy for Loggers." Reporting that ROK-Russia foreign ministers' talks were held in Moscow on 14 April to discuss the issue of North Korean escapees from logging camps in Russia, the article notes the Russian Government's basic position, according to the Russian foreign minister during a news conference after the talks, that Russia "promised" to protect the safety of the escapees and that Russia is not opposed to their "defection" to the ROK. However, he "politely" rejected the interference of a third party, such as the United Nations, in the issue of giving them "refugee status," stressing that the issue can be resolved through "ROK-Russian cooperation." Nevertheless, the article explains that a responsible government office in Seoul said with a "preconception" that the foreign ministers of the two countries "agreed" to give the refugee position to the North Korean escapees and to "send" them to the ROK "as soon as possible." Besides, despite a "frank confession" by Foreign Minister Han that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the "refugee status issue," the mass media reported that the foreign minister stated during a news conference after returning to Seoul that the Russian Government "completely agreed" on all issues including the refugee status issue, thus "distorting" the truth. Noting that our diplomatic activities are "ununderstandable," the article criticizes the attempt of the ROK Foreign Ministry to "distort and exaggerate" the result of the talks, and stresses that the issue of defection of the North Korean escapees from logging camps in Russia has now been thrown into a "deadlock," because the Russian side is not moving toward the "concrete steps," although it promised to "cooperate in principle." The article points out that the ROK diplomacy, which attempts to resolve problems "at a breath" without paying attention to the situation in its partner country, has now been "caught in a trap," and that most of North Korean loggers, who escaped from the camps, have "disappeared" fearing that their lives are "threatened." The article concludes by asking our government how it should take the "responsibility" if their defection is "not realized" and their safety is "not guaranteed."
