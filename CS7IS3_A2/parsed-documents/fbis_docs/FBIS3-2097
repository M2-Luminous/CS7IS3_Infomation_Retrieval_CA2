The construction of the first phase of the Haicang port, involving a total investment of some 406 million yuan, is aimed at building a container berth of 30,000 dwt and a berth for bulk cargo with a planned handling capacity of some 500,000 tons annually. Another construction project begun in Haicang last Saturday [26 February] is the first phase of the Xinyang industrial park. With a total area of some 6.7 sq km, the industrial park will attract domestic and overseas businesses involved in such sectors as computers, plastics, chemicals and machinery electronics. Meanwhile, three giant firms, including Xiamen "Huili" Investment and Development Ltd., the Xiamen "Dazhong" Taxi Company and "Yongsheng" Container Ltd., a Sino-Hong Kong joint venture, went into operation last Saturday in this China's largest Taiwan-funded development zone. With favorable natural and geographic conditions, the zone, opened to the outside world in November 1993, is expected to become the third largest development zone after Pudong area in Shanghai and Yangpu in south China's Hainan Province. To date, the zone has invested nearly 800 million yuan to upgrade its infrastructure and has worked out a series of preferential polices in a bid to attract more overseas investors.
