They can no longer, however, hide the fact that the political crisis is now stirring up a financial crisis in Mexico. In fact, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is starting to lose control of financial variables [variables] because his main U.S. allies feel deceived. Moreover, an outflow of about $6 billion shows that local and foreign capital has already cast its vote against Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the new PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate for president. Currently, there is a dangerous paradox that could prompt a new crisis now that the current six-year period is drawing to an end: Zedillo guarantees economic continuity and offers security to large-scale capital in the long run, but, in the short-term and midterm, he cannot offer leadership or confidence. The goal of this capital flight is not, specifically, to reject Zedillo, but the fact is that domestic and foreign circumstances are making it difficult to create a stable atmosphere for investment. Doubts are emerging over Zedillo's political sense and his ability to maneuver in a complex electoral process characterized by division and struggles within the PRI. Mexico also is facing a dubious investigation into the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio amid a yet-to-be-clarified plot that presages new outbursts of violence, as well as a conflict in Chiapas that threatens to drag on as long as a dying system that resists political and social opening continues to lean toward a harsher, authoritarian line in order to survive. If there are additional indications of a vicious circle characteristic of a politically insensitive state and worsening social decomposition, the first fallout could be a financial crack [previous word in English]. Increasing interest rates in the United States and political uncertainty in Mexico are inspiring additional hikes in domestic interest rates, which in turn discourage private investment and economic growth. This will lead to higher unemployment, low consumption, and growing social pressure that will reinforce political instability. It might seem pessimistic to say this, but our undeniable national reality is frightening investors. Confidential data available to this reporter indicate that eight out of 10 businesses have stocked up [se han cubierto] on dollars. For the first time in years, the country began to experience capital flight last month, and the outflow reached nearly $6 billion by 8 April. The country's international reserves, estimated in late February at $28 billion, have dropped by a comparable amount. This has virtually nullified a line of credit the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have granted Mexico. The peso has lost 8.3 percent of its value and is currently near the ceiling of the range of floating rates. This and no other reason explains why interest rates on 28-day treasury certificates have increased from 8.81 to 14.31 percent within the past 40 days. At the expense of the domestic market, the Mexican Government is trying to retain investors by offering then outlandish incentives. Former "allies," however, are no longer seeking high financial or speculative profits. Instead, they are now looking for safety and security that the former Mexican "miracle" can no longer guarantee. All quarters feel deceived. Two events have coincided to create this sentiment. 1. One day after Colosio's assasination, Pedro Aspe, Miguel Mancera, Guillermo Ortiz, and Jose Angel Gurria tried to get the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to extend their lines of credit from $1 billion to $6 billion. The White House became concerned over the impact a devaluation could have on the Mexican economy. However, on 28 March, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL said: "Mexico managed to maneuver behind the scenes, and a secret agreement prevented panic from seizing the market." With this information leaked by Mexican officials, the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Trade Committee, headed by John D. Dingell, is investigating Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Stock Commission President Arthur Levitt on suspicions of having improperly suspended Mexican shares on the U.S. market. Bentsen is quite annoyed over the leak because the Mexicans violated a secret gentlemen's agreement, and he may refrain from promoting the $20 billion line of credit the Mexican Government is negotiating with the World Bank and IMF to avoid a financial crack [previous word in English] in the country, which will take several months despite efforts by Jose Cordoba, Mexico's representative at the IDB. 2. From the evening of 23 March until Holy Week, the highest-ranking officials of the Mexican financial sector assured employees, bankers, and consultants for U.S. investment funds that Colosio's death was the product of the "sick mind of a crazy assassin who read books on Marxism-Leninism, and not a plot," but on 4 April, Assistant Prosecutor Miguel Montes officially admitted that Colosio was the victim of "a planned action." The U.S. financial sector (capital) is also annoyed by what it considers a betrayal, and it has noted that its contact in Mexico (the financial sector) is unrealistic. This has led to the flight of U.S. capital, which is also being prompted by other fears: How will the electoral process turn out? How much rope will Salinas give Zedillo? What will happen between now and 21 August and from 21 August through 1 December? After all is said and done, it is undeniable that with the same frivolity that Lopez Portillo staked the country's future on would-be and thwarted wealth from oil, Salinas de Gortari has staked the country's inclusion in the First World on the Mexican Stock Market. The greater the risk, the greater the gain or loss. What else can I say? Those are the rules of the market.
