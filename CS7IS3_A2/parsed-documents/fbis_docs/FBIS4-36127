FBIS4-36127 "drnes109dd_94004" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Husayni on Shahal Meeting, Jerusalem Status Al-Husayni on Shahal Meeting, Jerusalem Status JN0706121794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 0945 GMT 7 Jun 94 JN0706121794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Report by Qol Yisra'el correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi; from the "With the Midday Events" program -- italicized passages are recorded] [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal has renewed his past regular meetings with Faysal al-Husayni following the imposition of a security cordon on the territories and the appointment of al-Husayni as PLO official in charge of following up the situation in Jerusalem. Shahal's meeting with al-Husayni came at a time of media clamor and exchanged accusations between the government and opposition parties against the backdrop of the letter Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres sent to his Norwegian counterpart late Jorgen Holst. During his meeting with al-Husayni, Minister Shahal underscored the government's position on the current crisis. Talking about this meeting, al-Husayni adds: He also raised the issue of the existing relationship, the political process, the status of Jerusalem, and all related matters. Regarding the Palestinian viewpoint on the contents of the letter Shim'on Peres sent on the status of the Palestinian institutions, al-Husayni says: Yes, this is the way we understand the letter. We believe that the subject of Jerusalem or negotiations on the future of Jerusalem will take place in the second phase. Until then, the status of these institutions and the importance of Arab presence in Jerusalem should be maintained. The letter is with the Israelis, Norwegians, and the PLO. It was considered secret. Consequently, it is not with us. But since it was announced, I think we can obtain it. Orient House has in the past served as a starting point for several activities on the peace process, including the preparation of working papers for the Washington talks. Orient House is a Palestinian institution. Many activities on the political process as a whole sprang from it. These activities are completely linked to the political process, that is, to a comprehensive solution, God willing. As for partial solutions like the issue of the national authority in Gaza and Jericho first, these are partial and not comprehensive. Consequently, Orient House remains in its place doing the same services it used to do until we enter the final stage and until we reach a final solution, God willing. Regarding the meeting held at Orient House yesterday evening in the presence of several Palestinian political and religious figures, Faysal al-Husayni says: The situation in Jerusalem was reviewed. The problems facing us, including the closure of Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied Palestinian areas and the financial problems facing some institutions, were also reviewed. We also discussed the current crisis of these institutions and this controversy between us and the Israelis as well as the sensitivity of the subject and the need to address it without creating useless side battles. I was asked to follow up the establishment of this committee [not further identified] in order to follow up all issues related to the Palestinian institutions and Palestinian citizens.
