The SPU leadership met Oleksandr Morozov's request and decided to suspend his powers as the party's leader. According to a declaration issued by the Political Council, this was a justified move: The Supreme Council chairman is not allowed to pursue internal party interests (which are many) to the detriment of national interests (which are even more). On the other hand, the document's authors said that Oleksandr Moroz will remain unquestioned leader of the party. Sergey Kishko, people's deputy and assistant professor at the Donetsk State Technical University, was appointed acting head of the organization. According to its statute, the issue of the party's chairman will be examined at its congress set for this fall. Curiously enough, Oleksandr Moroz did not attend the meeting since he went to Kanev to participate in festivities devoted to the reburial of Taras Shevchenko's remains.
