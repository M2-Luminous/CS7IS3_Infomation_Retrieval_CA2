The conference is being attended by senior military and police personnel and officials of the African National Congress [ANC] and the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC]. Trevor Grundy has the details: The conference this week is being organized by the Southern African Peacekeeping and Peacemaking Project, which operates under the auspices of the Institute of International Education in New York. The first conference of this kind on South Africa was held in Harare in June of last year. Over 70 delegates are attending at the Harare International Conference Center and this afternoon Justice Richard Goldstone will be talking about the prevention of public violence and intimidation in South Africa, before and after the elections. Other contributors will be General Smit, the deputy commissioner of the South African Police Force, Chief Superintendent (Peter Stephens) of Scotland Yard, Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn, the former Chief of Staff of the SADF [South African Defense Force], Enoch Dambuchena, Zimbabwe's former chief justice, plus representatives of the ANC and the PAC. The conference opened as President Mugabe was meeting President de Klerk for the first time in Botswana. That meeting was attended by Defense Minister Moven Mahachi, so in Harare someone else has to read his speech. Minister Mahachi praised the SADF, the ANC, and the PAC for making attempts to work alongside one another to create a national defense force. He also called on all soldiers in South Africa to be democratic and fair after, as well as before, the April election. It would, he said, be a very sad day indeed if the freedom of democratic processes -- if the South African Defense Forces should be found rejecting the wishes of South Africans, where the process is judged to be free and fair by the international community. In a keynote address the current president of the United Nations General Assembly warned against widespread violence. Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana said that the South African law authorities must begin to deal effectively and fairly with any threat or disturbance to peace. Deviation at this stage, he said, would only lead to disaster and plunge South Africa into what he calls dangerous uncertainty.
