He said every effort should be made to keep the Duma from ratifying a treaty on chemical weapons destruction. He said that "since Russia does not have an environmentally safe technology for chemical destruction, the period of chemical weapons scrapping should be prolonged from 10 years, as is envisaged in the treaty, to 25-30 years." He called for an early debate on the issue with the leaders of parliamentary factions from Russia's Choice Party, Russian Unity and Concord Party, Yavlinsky's Association, Communist Party, and Liberal Democratic Party. Mirzayanov argued that the proposed technology of burning chemical weapons could not guarantee safety and explained that this method provided for burning toxins in special hermetically sealed chambers and for filtering the resulting gasses. "But here the question arises as what to do with the filters, which absorb poisonous pollutants", Mirzayanov said. Besides, in his words, nothing guarantees that through the filters chemical weapon components could not pollute the atmosphere. He urged the Duma to sanction a chemical weapons inventory. In his words, "a weapon that has been buried is as dangerous as a weapon planned to be sealed." Mirzayanov noted that "pollutants have not only instantaneous but also delayed impact on people." He predicted adverse effects for the next generation and said that "gradual but damaging changes are taking place in humans."
