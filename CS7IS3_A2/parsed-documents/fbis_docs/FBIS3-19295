Assistant Secretary of State Steven Oxman's inflexibility over maintaining the embargo on Iraq created an argument in the bilateral talks held with the Turkish side. Oxman remained irreconcilable on withdrawing oil from the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline, saying that that would breach the embargo. Oxman was informed that Ozdem Sanberk, under secretary of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will visit Baghdad to hold talks with Iraqi officials on the issue. The Turkish side informed the U.S., French, and British officials of the existing problems and suggested that the world should move to normalize its relations with the Baghdad administration with a view to solving these problems. Sadi Calislar, Turkey's charge d'affaires in Baghdad, explained his observations in Iraq and stressed that the view that the embargo would remove Saddam Husayn from power is wrong. But Oxman clearly said that the adopting of a moderate approach toward Saddam Husayn by Washington was out of the question. The Turkish side responded by explaining that the problems relating to the Hammer Force, northern Iraq, and the embargo cannot be solved if the current approach to the Saddam administration is not relaxed. Turkish officials also explained that Ankara upholds that view, not because it supports Saddam Husayn, but because the embargo and the confusion it has created have seriously affected Turkey's economy and security. The Turkish side listed its views in the summit as follows: 1. The confusion in northern Iraq must be removed quickly. The Hammer Force cannot remain in the region indefinitely. New clashes may occur as a result of the confusion. That could affect the entire region. 2. Turkey cannot allow the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq. The West is inclined to favor the establishment of a Kurdish state, something that has caused anxiety in Turkey. Extending the flight region of the Hammer Force aircraft to the southern sector of the 36th parallel in Iraq is out of the question. Make no decision to encourage the Kurds on that issue. Instead, encourage them to establish a dialogue with the Baghdad administration. Ankara is convinced that the effort to be made in that direction will yield a result. 3. The problem must be solved by the peoples in Iraq through democratic methods and on the basis that Iraq's territorial integrity is maintained and Baghdad is recognized as the central authority. 4. The embargo on Iraq still creates problems for Turkey. It must be lifted. It has been established that the embargo cannot be a solution. The Baghdad administration must be encouraged to fully comply with the UN Security Council resolutions.
