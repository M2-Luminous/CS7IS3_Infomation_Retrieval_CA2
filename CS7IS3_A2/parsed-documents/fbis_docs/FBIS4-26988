They are shouldering a large portion of security work at enterprises, government and financial organs, markets, railway stations, and airports, filling a gap left by the limited number of policemen. During the past nine years, their work has shown effective results, said Gao Xu, the President of the China Security Association (CSA). Gao was speaking at the close of a three-day conference in Beijing to mark the establishment of the CSA. In Beijing, security workers from the Beijing Security Service Company act as guards for 2,278 clients. Last year, these employees handled more than 1.1 million cases--involving 20,000 thefts or fights and caught 2,474 offenders. Gao says the CSA will help boost China's service force, which needs to be strengthened further. The security service first appeared in 1985 to meet the changing domestic situation, which called for more security work in enterprises and government organs. The forces now have 200,000 employees across the country, whereas the police team stands at about one million, Vice Minister of Public Security Mou Xinsheng said yesterday. They are working at about 1,000 security service companies nationwide. The security work mainly involves guarding gates, conducting patrols for them, and escorting bearers of money or valuable goods. Also, they can be asked to safeguard exhibitions, sports, or enterprise activities and install security equipment at buildings, Mou said. However, they are not allowed to own guns and batons or to act as bodyguards for individuals. Before beginning their service, these guards usually receive training for one to three months at one of the service companies. Beijing and Shanghai now have the largest teams of security workers. Beijing has 23,000 security guards in 26 service companies while Shanghai has 20,300 in 25 companies, Mou said. Security service companies get paid by the organizations that hire their guards.
