[Woerner] I feel better, my health is improving. The doctors tell me that "things are looking up." That is what I think too. I have gained 18 pounds and have recovered my appetite. Yesterday, my wife brought me a bottle of beer and the tomato soup that I am so fond of. [Vogel] You have worked every day since your last operation..... [Woerner] Unfortunately, it was a question of duty for me. If one assumes a task, then one must carry it out, irrespective of whether one is well or not. The doctors warned me that I would have to pay the price. I hope it has not caused me too much harm in the long term. [Vogel] Have the NATO alliance partners shown you enough consideration? [Woerner] To this day I have had the full support of the alliance foreign ministers. I am pleased about that, grateful, and happy. Following the last foreign ministers meeting in Istanbul, I received a letter from British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. He wrote to me on behalf of all his colleagues. "Look after yourself, and make sure that you are fully fit by the time the summer break is over!" U.S. Secretary of State Christopher also phoned me. [Vogel] What gives you so much strength? [Woerner] Without the support of my dear wife, without the enormous sympathy displayed by an incredible number of people, I would never have succeeded. I also read the bible every day. My life has acquired an entirely different meaning. My relationship to God plays an important role. [Vogel] Today, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev will sign the Partnership for Peace with NATO. Do you regret that you will not be there? [Woerner] Yes, very much so, it has always been "my baby" since my first visit to Moscow four years ago. It is very dear to my heart. The former foe will now come as a friend, and I cannot be there. That does leave a bitter feeling. I invested so much energy in this partnership. The relationship between NATO and Russia will also play a key role in the future. [Vogel] What significance will this new cooperation between Russia and NATO have? [Woerner] It represents a great step forward on the way to genuine partnership. [Vogel] Can the Russians now influence NATO decisions? [Woerner] We will, of course, hold consultations with the Russians on important security policy questions, especially in those areas where Russia can make a special contribution. However, we have not given the Russians a veto right. We will also continue talking to our partner states. [Vogel] Is this the first step toward full membership of NATO for Russia? [Woerner] No, not at all. There should not be any misunderstandings in this respect. The impression should not arise that we want to carve up the world together with the Russians, to grant the Russians the right participate in decisionmaking. I do not envisage Russia's full membership of NATO being possible in the foreseeable future. [Vogel] When will you be back at NATO headquarters in Brussels? [Woerner] I want to get back as quickly as possible. I am being looked after by fantastic doctors. I owe my life to them. I am optimistic, but, of course, no one can say exactly how my condition will develop. I want to be fit again by the end of the summer break.
