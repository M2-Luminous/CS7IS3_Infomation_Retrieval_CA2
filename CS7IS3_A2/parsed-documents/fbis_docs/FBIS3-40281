Are there good reasons for this? "This is the greatest stupidity that could have been adopted," Duka Samardzic, in charge of the private sector in the Economic Chamber of Belgrade, says. "Judging from the text of this decree, several provisions in it are logically hard to explain and to understand. For example, it calls for representative offices of foreign firms to pay the highest tax amount of 10,000 dinars. Do we want in this way to chase away even the few such offices that are in our country? I had thought that it was in our interest to keep foreign firms in our country, to be in contact with the world through them, and now I see that the people in the government think differently." Samardzic believes that this decree especially affects the owners of private firms. The majority of firms are registered to conduct several types of business activity, including, for example, foreign trade. The authors of the decree call for firms to pay taxes based on the business activity for which, according to this decree, the highest tax amount is set. Thus, the majority of private businessmen will have to pay the 5,000 dinars set for foreign trade, although they did not transact a single business deal in this sector, having worked mostly in the services sector, for which the prescribed tax is only one-fifth as much. Samardzic says that this decree will also affect those who have recently registered their firms and so far not carried out any business deals: "If they have not managed to earn anything yet, how will they pay these 5,000 dinars? This equals 5,000 German marks. This is a lot of money today, and it is not easy to pay it just so that one might gain the right to work. Anyway, many do not manage to make that much money even in a whole year, so how can they pay this amount?" To make the problem worse, the closing of a firm is not a way out for those affected by this decree, because the procedure for closing a firm can cost even more. "At this moment it is really difficult to be wise and advise people on what they should do," Samardzic says.
