Have the clashes and skirmishes stopped? [Barzani] The security situation is moving toward relaxation. Efforts to disengage the forces are continuing in all areas. Everyone, with the participation of the Iraqi National Congress [INC] and the Kurdistan Front, is making commendable efforts to consolidate the cease-fire and separate the forces. These efforts have, to a large extent, been reflected on the ground. [Qusaybati] What, in your view, is the way or the solution that would consolidate security? [Barzani] I believe the solution that would consolidate security lies in faith in pluralism, democratic methods, and recourse to the people and to political dialogue to contain problems. I do not see any other solution. That is how it is with all democratic systems. The solution also lies in adherence to the decisions of the operations room and serious and responsible implementation of these decisions. [Qusaybati] Do you really believe that a dispute over land is a good enough reason for an outbreak of fighting that is harmful to the region? [Barzani] No, it is not a question of a piece of land. It has to do with ways of tackling problems and resolving a political matter, and it also has to do with the mobilization and education of cadres, and with the question of hegemony. At the beginning of the crisis I sent a cable to the [Patriotic] Union [of Kurdistan, PUK] and [Kurdistan] Democratic Party [KDP] officials in the Raniyah area, urging them both to act in unison to contain the problem in Qal'at Dizah, and I held them responsible for that. Contrary to my expectations, the PUK official in Raniyah dispatched a military force to Qal'at Dizah. And when a government delegation from both sides was in Raniyah, our forces' positions there were the target of occupation and looting. Within three days, the fighting covered the areas of al-Sulaymaniyah and Karkuk. The PUK then moved its forces directly to Irbil. We can conclude from that that there was a premeditated plan. We have some evidence, which we do not wish to reveal now, supporting the theory of a military coup by the PUK. Despite the harm done to our forces, a meeting was held on 4 May and leadership committees were formed to normalize the situation in all areas, but these committees made no progress. After 4 May, we had to resort to positive defense to stop the excesses of the PUK forces. [Qusaybati] Jalal Talabani has told AL-HAYAH that Iranian Revolutionary Guard elements supported the KDP fighters and "Revolutionary Hizballah" with artillery shelling. What is your reaction to that? [Barzani] We have been hearing that a lot and we have also heard that some Iranian Revolutionary Guard members were taken prisoner. We called on the PUK at the time to show these captives on the television screen so that the Kurdish people would know. We have also read statements claiming that the PUK was the target of a comprehensive plot with the participation of Iran, Turkey, our party, and the Islamic Movement in Iraq. Then we read that Jalal Talabani had asked Iran to invite the PUK, our party, and the Islamic Movement to Tehran, and to mediate. And there were other statements. At any rate, I do not know of and have not seen any Iranian participation in this dispute. [Qusaybati] Talabani's statements and confirmations by Iraqi opposition sources seem to indicate that he feared an attack on his motorcade on his return to Kurdistan (from Damascus), and this delayed his return. Do you believe these fears are serious? [Barzani] We have been awaiting Talabani's return for three weeks and I see no justification for the delay. His presence would certainly facilitate the cease-fire and solve many problems. Many attempts were made to secure Talabani's return, and Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi (chairman of the INC Executive Council) and I sent a written message on 14 May assuring him that all precautions would be taken to ensure his safe return across the Syrian-Iraqi border. Talabani wanted me to go to Zakhu to receive him. I have no objection to doing that, but I cannot leave my headquarters because of the situation and the efforts to consolidate the cease-fire. I told him that I would send a high-level delegation from the political bureaus of our party and the PUK to receive him. Fear of an attack on his motorcade in the area of Dahuk is unfounded. Treachery is not one of our characteristics. [Qusaybati] The PUK has been critical of the 50/50 principle with your party (in jobs) and sees that as one of the factors contributing to the tension. [Barzani] The 50/50 principle in the administration has caused major problems and has been one of the causes of tension. We believe that principle should be abolished in a democratic way, by going back to the people. We suggested that idea months ago and we promised to respect the result whatever it may be. The suggestions we made at our joint meetings calling for new elections were met with an extensive media campaign and other measures and manifestations reaching the point of direct aggression. Despite all that had happened, I did not expect matters to reach this dangerous level and did not expect a recourse to force to overturn the balances of power. [Qusaybati] Turkey has announced that it is preparing for a meeting between you and Talabani. Do you see a need for such mediation? [Barzani] Several friendly quarters have offered mediation. We viewed the Turkish initiative positively and a meeting was held between two delegations from the leaderships of our party and the PUK in Silobi. The meeting was positive. We are interested in all initiatives aimed at containing the crisis.
