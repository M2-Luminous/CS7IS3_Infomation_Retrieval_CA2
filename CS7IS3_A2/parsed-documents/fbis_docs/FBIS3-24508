Bostan, I.G. Botez, and V.Ye. Dulgeru; UDC 621.757:002.72] [Text] The manipulator is a mechanical structure with a large number of articulated elements and, as a rule, a large number of degrees of freedom. In a perfect structure, such a manipulator may assume any shape in the three-dimensional space. This exceptional flexibility makes it possible to employ manipulators in various fields of industry where the maneuverability space is highly constrained. This flexibility engenders new problems: how to monitor each element when the arm is moving within a constrained space with obstacles and eliminate collision with them, what is the optimum control of various arm elements which can realize the necessary trajectory, etc.? It is obvious that in order to improve this manipulator's maneuverability, the number of elements must be quite high. Assuming that each element has two-to-three degrees of freedom relative to the preceding one, it becomes necessary to use a large number of actuators and devices which leads to an increase in its mass and worsens the manipulator's technical characteristics, such as its speed of response, positioning accuracy, load-bearing capacity, etc. The solution to this problem amounts to positioning actuators beyond the elements and transmitting energy to a distance with the help of an adequate mechanical, pneumatic, or electric system. An original simplified manipulator design (Figs. 1a and b) and an analysis of some of its parameters are presented in this article. The manipulator contains base 1 which houses the following: stepping electric motor 2 and precision reduction gear 3 containing a satellite gear cluster 4 consisting of roller gear rims 5 and 6 and sun gears 8 and 9 installed on crank 7. Gear 8 is linked to the base while driven sun gear 9 with gear-type coupling 10 and clutch 11 is linked to the first link 12 after the base. The manipulator also contains moving links 13-15 connected to each other by ball and socket joints 16-18. Flexible tie 19 one of whose ends is connected through spring 20 to link 15 and the other end--to the screw of the ball and screw transmission 21 located in the hub of the driven sun gear 9 passes through moving links 12-15. Each moving link 12-15 is connected to the flexible tie by a centering mechanism. Fig. 1. Manipulator Design. Each centering mechanism is executed as two controlled fixtures: controlled fixtures 22 and 23 are installed in link 13, controlled fixtures 24 and 25 are installed in link 14, and controlled fixtures 26 and 27 are installed in link 15. The screw of the ball and screw transmission is connected to link 12 by the second clutch 28 while link 12 is connected to the flexible tie by controlled fixture 29. Each controlled fixture is executed as an electromagnet whose core is articulated with the flexible tie. The manipulator operates as follows. When the electric motor is switched on, the satellite gear cluster performs a precession movement whereby the roller gear rims engage the sun gears. Furthermore, driven sun gear 9 rotates with a reduction which is determined by the number of rollers in gear rims 5 and 6 and the number of teeth in sun gears 8 and 9. When the clutch is engaged, gear 9 begins to rotate, and rotation is converted by the ball and screw transmission into reciprocation motion of the screw linked to the flexible tie. Thus, given a certain combination of controlled fixture operations, one can obtain the necessary slope angle of any moving link. For example, if controlled fixtures are engaged simultaneously, the manipulator may assume the position shown in Fig. 1. In this case, the controlled fixtures operate in different directions in each pair. For example, in order to link 13 around the center of the ball and socket joint 16, it is necessary that controlled fixture 23 pull flexible tie 19 in one direction, while controlled fixture 24--in the other direction relative to the longitudinal axis of link 13. The link rotation angle is determined as the arc tangent of the ratio of the core displacement _D_ S to the distance between the center of the ball and socket joint 16 and the longitudinal axis of the corresponding controlled fixture Equation Thus, the procession reduction gear with the ball and screw transmission and centering mechanisms with the flexible tie make it possible to obtain any manipulator displacement in one plane bounded by the service area while the manipulator rotation around its axis is ensured by the procession reduction gear. This makes it possible to increase the positioning accuracy since the manipulator motions are determined by the kinematic accuracy of one procession reducer. The use of stepping electric motors is dictated by their good controllability which eliminates the need for using a sensor manipulator element position monitoring system. Equations Fig. 2. Manipulator's Coordinate Frame of Reference. It is expedient to use Euler's angles _ps_, _th_, and � which correspond to each element rotation around the axes of revolution in order to determine the manipulator arm position and orientation. Each element has a spherical contact surface (Fig. 2) and is fixed to the coordinate system of reference of the preceding i-1 element of Euler's angles _ps_, _th_, � which correspond to elementary geometrical rotations around the axes OZ[.sup]i[/], OX[.sub]i[/], and OY[.sub]i[/]. The geometrical rotation around point O is characterized by the rotation angle _ps_. The transformation matrix in this case assumes the form of: This matrix is also referred to as the elementary rotation matrix. Likewise, rotation around the OX[.sup]i[/] axis has the following rotation matrix: Equation The matrix of rotation around the OZ[.sup]i[/] = OZ[.sup]i[/] axis is similar to matrix (2): Equation The elementary matrix of rotation around the OY[.sup]i1[/] matrix is expressed as Equation Having obtained elementary rotation matrices, one can obtain the transformation matrix R, which is also referred to as the rotation matrix or transition probability matrix. For an orthogonal initial system of coordinates, we obtain the following dependence: Equation Dependence (6) corresponds to elementary rotations around the OZ[.sup]i[/], OX[.sub]i[/], and OZ[.sub]l[/] axes. Likewise, one can determine five more combinations of Euler's angles which differ from those cited above. Similar computations can be performed for any element i of the flexible manipulator. Consequently, the manipulator gripper position can be analytically described and programmed at any moment in time and at any point in the service area. This significantly simplifies the manipulator control system. For existing ``elephant trunk'' manipulators, the proposed design is the simplest and has the best quality indicators. The manipulator positioning accuracy can be increased by decreasing the number of actuators and improving the element controllability. An analytical description of the current position of any manipulator element in space ensures stored-program manipulator control.
