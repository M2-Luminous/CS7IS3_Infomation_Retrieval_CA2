In the interview to be published in the May's magazine supplement, the minister talked about the Moroccan Government's policy to restructure and modernize economy, fiscal and monetary policies, relations with the European Union [EU], the privatisation program and moves to create more job opportunities. To a question on the state's priorities to restructure and modernize its economy, the finance minister listed four priorities: The state's new role [words indistinct] the economy, speeding up the liberalization of the financial sector to become more competitive and attractive to the European Union's partners and social problems, particularly unemployment, in addition to the acceleration of new policy of taking many state-financed activities off-budget. The minister also explained that a new strategy has been devised to deal with social problems and that the government is ready to make some concessions as long as they don't threaten the basic stability Morocco has attained. On relations with the European Union, Sagou pointed out that two-thirds of Morocco's foreign trade is conducted with the EU and 800,000 Moroccan migrant workers--80 percent of the total--are employed there. Similarly, 80 percent of all foreign investment in Morocco comes from EU countries. In northern Morocco, especially around Tangier, he explained, Spanish companies have established assembly plants comparable to the U.S. enterprises operating just south of the Mexican border. He however conceded that the GATT agreement might threaten Morocco's relatively privileged position with the European Union by effectively enabling other countries to export to the EU under the same conditions. To a question voicing fears that the quest to attract foreign investment may open the way to undue foreign ownership and influence, the Moroccan minister answered that right now only 4 percent of Morocco's gross capital formation is of foreign provenance. We have a comfortable absorptive margin for the next ten years, though in sectors like banking and insurance foreign interests can already acquire control of [word indistinct] enterprises, he added. On the Kingdom's fiscal system and the informal sector, he said personal and corporate tax rates have been reduced for four or five years, and over the next four or five years, individuals and companies will be encouraged to declare their tax liability. But viewed pragmatically, the informal economy is creating jobs and wealth, he explained. To a question on how the government will simultaneously finance increased social spending and reduce tax revenues, without plunging the state's finances back into serious deficit, he replied that "global budget deficit is only about 2.2 percent of gross domestic product against 13 percent in 1983. In figures it amounts to around USD 600 million, a mere USD 25 million over last year. We are confident that lower taxes will actually increase fiscal revenues by encouraging more people to pay up, and by increasing company profits in the long term. Receipts from privatisation sales will also bridge the gap, though that is not the motive behind our privatisation campaign. We are prepared to seek external financing but only for the private sector. The government has declined offers from London and New York bankers to raise loans in excess of USD 100 million, and suggested they fund our private sector instead. Growth will bring in revenue long term, and in the short term we shall proceed cautiously step by step with necessary fiscal expansion. Meanwhile, we hope to get the private sector to take more of the budgetary strain in sectors like agriculture, energy, infrastructure and even education. In areas like public housing, which we shall continue to subsidize, falling interest rates will lessen the state's burden. The minister outlined that the biggest problem is creating more jobs for Moroccan growing population and bringing down unemployment, a problem which solution he described as "the key to everything."
