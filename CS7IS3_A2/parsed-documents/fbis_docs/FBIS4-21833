Imset] [Excerpts] Diyarbakir--Over 250,000 Turkish troops are set to launch a historic military operation against Kurdish rebels in southeastern Turkey immediately after the March 27 local elections. The operation, dubbed ``operation cleansing'' in 1991, was postponed at least three times before Prime Minister Tansu Ciller recently approved it. Security forces said the main aim of the attack was to block logistical support to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and to deliver ``the final blow'' to the organization by August, just before the retirement of Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures and other senior Turkish senior Turkish force commanders. The first stage, or ``ground-breaking level'' of the operation, has already been completed over the past year, aiming to curb local sympathy and support to the PKK. As part of this major plan, which resembles Turkey's past policies of repressing 28 separate Kurdish rebellions, a total of 900 villages in this troubled region have already been evacuated and burned down. [passage omitted] According to sources close to the Ankara government, the proposal for the upcoming operation, which is expected to be launched next week, was first made to Mesut Yilmaz, who was prime minister of Turkey in 1991. Yilmaz, now the chairman of the main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP), stalled his approval with an indirect refusal, owing mainly to the risks involved. Sources say the proposal for a ``regional cleansing'' of ``PKK militants and sympathizers'' was later put to Yilmaz's successor Suleyman Demirel at the end of 1991, but although he rejected it twice, it was still put underway as a plan. [passage omitted] In the coming weeks, Turkey is to concentrate mainly on cutting logistic supply routes to the separatists, hitting the ``mountain units'' and arming local villagers against them. In many areas, villagers have been informed that they can either accept state-issued weapons to combat the PKK or will be regarded and treated as ``members of PKK.'' Sources say the military now has the full backing and authority to conduct operations in the region to ``solve'' the crisis. Local authorities reportedly regard the situation as a ``Tansu Ciller-military'' coalition ``open card'' to the Armed Forces. [passage omitted]
