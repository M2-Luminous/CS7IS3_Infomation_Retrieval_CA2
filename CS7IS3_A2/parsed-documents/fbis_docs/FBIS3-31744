The tour is continuing. Virgil Magureanu yesterday replaced the SRI director in Valcea, the official reason being the inefficient use of state funds. Sources close to the SRI leadership have informed us that in the coming days Virgil Magureanu will visit the counties of Braila and Galati for the same purpose: to replace the chiefs of the SRI in these two counties. It is worth mentioning that the five chiefs of SRI branches are joined by a further two such chiefs, who were replaced in the counties of Neamt and Vaslui a few weeks ago.
