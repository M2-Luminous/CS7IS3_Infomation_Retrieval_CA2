The scheme, with a budget of DM499 million (around ECU257 million) up to 1999, finances fundamental research, basic industrial research and applied research and development. The aid is given in the form of outright grants. Information technology is the science of recording, processing, storing and transferring information using technical resources. The aid measures under the information technology programme 1994-99 focus on certain main areas: -- software technology/reliable information systems -- parallel high-performance computing -- bioinformation technology -- neuroinformation technology -- knowledge processing (artificial intelligence) -- telecooperation Beneficiaries are enterprises and research institutes. Projects supported may receive 100-percent gross when they are considered to be fundamental research. The maximum aid intensity amounts to 50 percent for projects of basic industrial research and 25 percent for projects of applied research and development. Enhancements are foreseen when projects are carried out by SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] (plus 10 percentage points), in the former GDR (plus 10 percentage points) or by SMEs in the ex-GDR (plsu 15 percentage points). The Commission examined the notified programme in the context of the relevant treaty articles and the Community framework for state aids for R&D. The programme respects the criteria laid down in the above-mentioned framework and, consequently, the Commission raised no objections under the application of article 92(3)(c) of the EC-Treaty and article 61(3)(c) of the EEA-Treaty.
