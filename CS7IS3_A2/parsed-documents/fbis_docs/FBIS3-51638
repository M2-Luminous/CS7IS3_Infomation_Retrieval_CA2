The recommendations of the seven workshops at the Congress for National Salvation provide for the immediate formation of a government of public security, setting aside the 1987 Constitution, dissolving the parliament, and enforcing the 1950 Constitution. On this second working day, Jean Luckenson met with Herve Leveille. Let us listen to his report: [Luckenson] We met with druggist Herve Leveille, secretary general of the national congress, for explanation. Leveille said that they have held this congress in order to find a final solution to the crisis that the country has been experiencing for over two years. The participants in the national congress have come from the nine geographic departments of the country and will have to form a government of public security that can work with the international community in finding a real solution to the sociopolitical crisis being experienced by the country. [Leveille] In the face of the imminent peril to the country, in the face of the danger that the country might disappear, we need the formation of a government of public security. [Luckenson] If I understand rightly, you have held this national congress in order to form a government of public security. [Leveille] Yes, but it will be a beginning, it will be a beginning because I must also give you additional explanation. This congress is held by persons who.... It is mostly groups of citizens who met in the nine departments and sent delegations. As delegations from the civil society, they will meet to see whether they can form a government that can confer with the international community, can start a dialogue with the international community so we can resolve the crisis. [Luckenson] Leveille went on to say that no institutions -- whether the Army or in the democratic sector -- have representatives at the congress and that those who are present have participated as simple citizens of the country. But what can we expect from this national congress? Let us listen to Leveille. [Leveille] The only thing I would like this congress to accomplish is that everybody become aware of the fact that all of us are wrong, that all of us have put the country in this situation, and that all of us should try to see what we can do by putting our personal interests aside for a while. [Luckenson] We saw in the room citizens from various departments. We also saw political personalities such as Dr. Montalvo Despeignes [former minister without portfolio under the Nerette-Honorat government]; the Rev. Richard Vladimir Jeanty, leader of the Haitian Party of God; Vanes Cherestal, national coordinator of the National Confederation of the People's Organizations of the Country; and General Philippe Biamby.
