In a meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Mondale said he strongly hopes a planned meeting between U.S. and Japanese trade officials in Washington on Thursday will successfully find ways to resume the stalled economic framework talks, the official told reporters. The meeting, involving senior officials from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Foreign Ministry and their U.S. counterparts, marks the first attempt by the new government in Tokyo to resolve differences with Washington over the stalled trade talks. The U.S. envoy also reportedly spoke of the need for both sides to try to flexibly meet each other halfway in a bid to restart the negotiations on establishing a new framework for bilateral trade. Noting that healthy economic relations between the two economic superpowers is crucial, Hata also expressed hope for early resumption of the framework talks, the official said. The bilateral negotiations on ways to widen foreign access to the Japanese market were suspended after the two countries clashed at the February meeting of U.S. President Bill Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington. At the summit, Hosokawa rejected U.S. proposals for "objective criteria" or numerical targets to measure the progress of Japanese imports. Mondale and Hata also agreed on the need for cooperation between the U.S. and Japan to encourage North Korea to remove concerns about the communist country's suspected nuclear weapons development program, the official said.
