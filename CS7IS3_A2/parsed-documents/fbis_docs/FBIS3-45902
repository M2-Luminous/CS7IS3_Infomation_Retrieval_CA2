C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 25 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang Tuesday [25 January] said the government will respond within two weeks to the US request for lower tariffs in Taiwan. The government will initially cut customs duties on certain products in accordance with the customs tariffs law, under which tariff reductions are subject to approval by the Legislative Yuan, Chiang noted. Chiang pledged that the Executive Branch will seek the legislature's cooperation in bringing down customs duties in order to ensure Taiwan's full membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year. Taiwan's bid to join the Geneva-based trade regulating body calls for tariff concession negotiations with GATT contracting parties. Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992. Meanwhile, Taiwan's bilateral tariff concession talks with the United States under the GATT framework are likely to be held as scheduled in February. Huang Yen-chao, Director general of the Board of Foreign Trade, made the remark late Monday upon his return from tariff consultations with US officials in Washington, D.C. During last week's consultations, Huang said he told the American side that Taiwan could lower import duties on 70 industrial products in accordance with the customs tariffs law. But whether the tariffs could be slashed up to 50 percent was unknown, he added. The United States demanded in November that Taiwan cut customs duties on 699 items by up to 50 percent. Of the 699 items, 514 are industrial goods and 185 are agricultural products. Though no concrete agreements were reached during the consultations, Huang pointed out, the two sides have exchanged views on tariff reductions. "I therefore would not rule out the possibility of holding GATT tariff negotiations with the United States next month," he said. The US originally said it would not talk with Taiwan on GATT- related tariff issues until its own tariff-cut request was met. The United States viewed its request for lower tariffs on the 699 items as separate from the GATT tariff talks.
