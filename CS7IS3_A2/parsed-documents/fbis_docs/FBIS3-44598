On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, expressed greetings to all workers involved in the renovation. The Potala Palace in Lhasa city, capital of Tibet Autonomous Region, had not been renovated for 300 years. In 1988, the Chinese government decided to set up a leading group, headed by Li Tieying, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, to take charge of the renovation program. The central government also allocated more than 50 million yuan and large quantities of materials to the project. Work began in October 1989. By now 86 projects in the renovation program have been completed, and work on 17 is still going on. Hu said that the Potala Palace is the outstanding work of Tibetan culture and one of the treasures in the culture of Chinese nation. He said that the palace is not only the symbol of Tibet, but also marks the unity of the Tibetan people and the Han people. He said that the palace renovation showed that the CPC and the government respect the excellent cultural tradition of Tibet and it also showed the party's policies toward nationalities and religion. He urged the people working on the renovation to make greater efforts to complete it. After the renovation is completed, all departments concerned should strengthen the management of the palace so as to promote the unity of nationalities and to contribute to the development of Tibet. Li Tieying, who is also a state councillor, said that the renovation program is a rarely-seen project in the world. He said that the renovation with modern science and technology and Tibetan traditional techniques will certainly produce important impact at home and abroad. According to a renovation group leader, in the past five years of renovation work, no ancient art or religious objects were damaged or lost. When the renovation of the palace is completed, the government of the Tibet Autonomous Region is planning to hold celebrations.
