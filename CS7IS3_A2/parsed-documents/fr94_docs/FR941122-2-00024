FR941122-2-00024 FR941122-2-00015 [Docket No. CP93&hyph;564&hyph;002, et al.] ANR Pipeline Co., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings November 14, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. ANR Pipeline Company [Docket No. CP93&hyph;564&hyph;002] Take notice that on November 9, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243, filed an amendment pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to its July 19, 1993 application, as amended February 18, 1994, for authorization to construct and operate pipeline and related facilities at the United States-Canada International Boundary proximate to St. Clair, Michigan, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. ANR states that its project has been restructured. First, ANR states that two shippers, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon) and The Consumers' Gas Company Limited (Consumers Gas), will now transport up to 75,000 Mcf per day. (Consumers Gas was the only shipper in the original application with a maximum transportation volume of 66,000 Mcf per day.) Second, Consumers Gas now intends to construct and operate the facilities in Canada necessary to transport gas delivered by ANR. Third, ANR has eliminated the ANR/Great Lakes Gas Transmission custody transfer measurement facilities proposed in the original application, included the cost of the ANR/MichCon Columbus Meter Station, and has reflected new pipe material specifications and 1995 cost adjustments in its cost of facilities. This results in an estimated cost of facilities of $15,298,000. Comment date: December 5, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation [Docket No. CP95&hyph;56&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 4, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (Natural), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;56&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to abandon certain delivery point connections, under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;4&hyph;000, 1 all as more fully set forth in the request for authorization on file with the Commission and open for public inspection. 1 See, 21 FERC ¶62,298 (1982). Natural seeks authorization to abandon various delivery point connections located in Clarion, Forest and Jefferson Counties, Pennsylvania. These delivery points currently serve 26 residential gas customers of National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution). Natural states that these delivery points are located along non-jurisdictional production pipelines that will be conveyed to G & G Gas, Incorporated, a local production company in Pennsylvania. Natural states that Clarion River Gas Company (CRG), a Pennsylvania public utility will assume service obligations to these 26 customers following the conveyance. Natural also states that Distribution and all 26 affected customers have consented to the abandonment. Natural states that the facilities were authorized in Docket Nos. CP73&hyph;294&hyph;000 and CP90&hyph;1399&hyph;000. Pursuant to §157.216(b), National confirms that it has provided notice of the proposed abandonments to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PaPUC), which is the state commission having jurisdiction over Distribution in this proceeding. In addition, the transfer of customers from Distribution to CRG will require approval of the PaPUC. Natural states that an application for such approval has been filed by Distribution. Comment date: December 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 3. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation [Docket No. CP95&hyph;62&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 4, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) filed an abbreviated application in Docket No. CP95&hyph;62&hyph;000, pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Commission's regulations, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of certain natural gas storage facilities at its existing Crawford Storage Field. Columbia seeks authorization to increase annual turnover by approximately 8.2 Bcf with an associated increase in design day deliverability of approximately 67 MMcfd. Columbia proposes to increase storage capacity of its Crawford Storage Field to offset the temporary deactivation of storage operations at Columbia's Majorsville Storage Complex located on the West Virginia and Pennsylvania border. Columbia's proposal is more fully described in its application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Columbia seeks a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing: (a) Increased operations at the Crawford Storage Field located in Hocking and Fairfield Counties, Ohio with a maximum storage capacity of 52 Bcf excluding 9 Bcf of native gas with 17.65 Bcf of annual turnover and 232.2 MMcfd of design day deliverability; (b) the construction and operation of four additional storage wells; and (c) the construction and operation of 5.01 miles of replacement and new pipelines and appurtenances if the Crawford Storage Field and at the Crawford Compressor Station in Hocking and Fairfield Counties, Ohio. Columbia states that the increase in Crawford's storage capabilities is necessary due to the allocation of all Columbia's storage capacity to its customers as part of the implementation of Order No. 636. If Columbia does not replace the lost storage capability at Majorsville Storage Complex with an equivalent capability at Crawford, then it will have less storage to meet its long-term Firm Storage Service (FSS) commitments than was approved by the Commission in Columbia's Order No. 636 proceeding.
