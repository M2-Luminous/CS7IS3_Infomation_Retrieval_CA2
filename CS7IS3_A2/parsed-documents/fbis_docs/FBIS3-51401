The event was attended by Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation, and Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government. Union leaders, deputies, and delegates to the People's Government in the province held an intense debate on the economic problems being confronted and the possible solutions. It was stressed that the most important thing is to seek efficiency at each work place and labor post. The meeting, held prior to the beginning of the process in the work centers, was presided over by Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon and Pedro Ross. It was stated that Matanzas Province has a budget deficit of 120 million pesos and that 11 local enterprises received subsidies totaling 213 million pesos during 1993. The money in circulation totals 1.12 billion pesos, which is equivalent to the salary of 20 months. Confronting these problems demands intelligence, creativity, and, above all, work. [Begin Alarcon recording] In the meetings in which we have participated so far, we have seen clearly how the workers are capable of identifying in each place how costs can be reduced, and how to increase production and economic efficiency. This is how the entire nation, everyone, everywhere, pulling together, confronts and ought to truly confront the situation we are currently facing. I believe that this is how we all truly participate in the parliamentary process. [end recording]
