FBIS4-25054 "drchi108_q_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 Southwest Region More Tibetan Children Returning to School More Tibetan Children Returning to School OW0506074494 Beijing XINHUA in English 0709 GMT 5 Jun 94 OW0506074494 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Lhasa, June 5 (XINHUA) -- Over 2,000 children who could not afford to continue school have resumed their schooling as the region has collected donations totalling two million yuan in the "Hope Project", a nationwide program to help drop-outs return school. Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the people's government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, said that Tibet has built eight Hope schools and two Hope classes with the donations and another seven such schools are under construction. But being one of the most underdeveloped parts in China, about one third of the school-age children could not afford to go to school in Tibet by the end of 1993, he pointed out. This mainly arises from Tibet's poor transport conditions, fewer schools and poor schooling conditions, he said. In the light of the backward education, the regional people's government has decided to put education on the top agenda. The most concrete step for this move is to build at least one middle school in each county and at least one primary school in each township so as to provide 80 percent of the region's school-age children with proper education. To this end, Gyaincain Norbu called on the efforts of different social circles to help build the project, since governments at different levels have but small budgets. He suggested some detailed fund-raising ideas, such as auctions, benefit performances and charity bazaars, which have already proved effective in other parts of China.
