FR940927-0-00092 FR940927-0-00012 (7) Long-term v. Short-term-debts. All known debts and obligations including any alimony and/or child support payments of the borrower and spouse must be documented. Significant liabilities to be deducted from the total income in determining ability to meet the mortgage payments are accounts that, generally, are of a relatively long-term; i.e., 6 months or over. Other accounts for terms of less than 6 months must, of course, be considered in determining ability to meet family expenses. Certainly any account with less than 6 months' duration which requires payments so large as to cause a severe impact on the family's resources for any period of time must be considered in the loan analysis. For example, monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan with a remaining balance of $1,500 would be included in those obligations to be deducted from the total income regardless of the fact that the account can be expected to pay out in 5 months. It is clear that the applicant will, in this case, continue to carry the burden of those $300 payments for the first, most critical, months of the home loan. Similarly, when the credit information shows open accounts of several years' duration which are clearly of a revolving or open-end type, the regular monthly payment for such accounts should be considered as a long-term obligation to be deducted from income. (8) Requirements for verification. If the credit investigation reveals debts or obligations of a material nature which were not divulged by the applicant, lenders must be certain to obtain clarification as to the status of such debts from the borrower. A proper analysis is obviously not possible unless there is total correlation between the obligations claimed by the borrower and those revealed by a credit report or deposit verification. Conversely, significant debts and obligations reported by the borrower must be dated. If the credit report fails to provide necessary information on such accounts, lenders will be expected to obtain their own verifications of those debts directly from the creditors. Credit reports and verifications must be no more than 90 days old to be considered valid. For loans closed automatically, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the credit report or verification is within 90 days of the date of the veteran's application to the lender. Of major significance are the applicant's rental history and outstanding, assumed, or recently retired mortgages, if any, particularly prior VA loans. Lenders should be sure ratings on such accounts are obtained; a written explanation is reburied when ratings are not available. A determination is necessary as to whether alimony and/or child support payments are required. Verification of the amount of such obligations should be obtained, although documentation concerning an applicant's divorce should not be obtained automatically unless it is necessary to verify the amount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the applicant. If in the routine course of processing the loan application, however, direct evidence is received (e.g., from the credit report) that an obligation to pay alimony or child support exists (as opposed to mere evidence that the veteran was previously divorced), the discrepancy between the loan application and credit report can and should be fully resolved in the same manner as any other such discrepancy would be handled.
