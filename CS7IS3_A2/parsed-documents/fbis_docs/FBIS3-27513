The relevant department in the State Council has issued an order that all the plans of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities for holding investment attraction activities in Hong Kong and other places abroad must be submitted to the relevant authorities in the State Council for examination and approval. Such examination will be even stricter with applications filed by counties, cities (at the county level), and individual enterprises. Besides reporting to the government immediately above them for examination, they must also seek approval from the relevant authorities in the State Council. This injunction emphasizes that all kinds of investment attraction activities must put practical results first. In the meantime, the relevant authorities in the State Council also stated that all forms of investment attraction activities and all kinds of festivals that let "economic and trade activities steal the show on the stage of cultural events" conducted by various localities must be brought under overall planning. This measure is taken because the excessive amount of investment attraction activities in the past have caused many negative consequences. One is that there are too many "sham foreign investors." Many investments supposedly made by foreign investors and foreign-funded enterprises are actually the funds of mainland organizations that have returned after being taken outside the border to get a different signature. The purpose is to avoid profit delivery and to enjoy the preferential policies applicable to foreign investments in such areas as taxation and goods import and export. The other result is that the percentage of foreign investments that were actually fed into the projects when required is extremely low. The flooding investment attraction activities have led to an unhealthy tendency of boasting, exaggeration, and lying. As a result, letters of intent and agreements involving huge investments that cannot be materialized are all over the place. The third consequence is the appalling waste of money in organizing such activities. At some investment attraction events outside the country (or border), the size of the delegations is getting bigger and bigger and they are going in for escalating ostentation and extravagance. Some of them enjoy sightseeing abroad at public expense under the pretext of inviting investments and even go so far as to resort to fraud and deception. In view of this, in order to put an end to the corrupt tendencies in economic activities, the State Council, in good time, issued to all localities in the country a "red-letterhead document" containing stern measures, putting a firm check on investment attraction activities held in Hong Kong and other places abroad. Whoever disobeys the order will be prosecuted.
