This signifies, first of all, that the complex military organism is not working as it should and, second, that the forms and methods we have chosen to strengthen military discipline have not been effective. The low level of military discipline by no means testifies to the healthy and strong moral-psychological state of the troops--an indicator that, as world experience shows, has no less significance for the Armed Forces than modern weaponry. So what the moral-psychological state of the troops mean? It is, on a general plane, the set of spiritual qualities of the personnel that signifies its conformity to the tasks of military service. The moral-psychological state of the troops, that is, is reduced to the so-called "human factor," with all of its multitude of components. The military person should have not only a national and political awareness that is psychologically well grounded and emotionally committed to his Fatherland, but should also be well fed, dressed, armed and physically and professionally prepared for the performance of his duties. The moral-psychological state of the troops is based on a whole series of components. We are talking first and foremost namely about those, since we are primarily interested in the areas of practical work. And the components of a strong moral-psychological state, and not its traits, goes back to that. Science shows that, first, it is impossible to formulate specifically any trait of a strong moral-psychological state, and second, that any of these traits can be formulated only through all-round influence on all of the constituent elements that make it up. In order to form such an integral trait as courage, for example, among the personnel, it is necessary to foster a thrust toward certain values, psychological tempering and physical durability, the people must be well armed, since courage relies on confidence in one's powers, and so forth. The indicator of the moral-psychological state encompasses a very broad circle of areas of work, and reacts with sensitivity to a great many of the factors under which the military person operates. It is, that is to say, an integrating indicator in which a multitude of components are focused, each of which proceeds from the satisfaction of these or those requirements of people starting with the biological and ending with the spiritual. The level of development of spiritual requirements itself is definitive in the evaluation of the moral-psychological state. These views lead us to the conclusion that strengthening the moral-psychological state of the troops will require work with areas that lie outside the jurisdiction of the bodies for indoctrination work as well. It must thus be acknowledged that overall responsibility for the moral-psychological state of the personnel lies with the commander as the chief organizer and sole ultimate authority. There exists a fundamentally important general law for us, however--the same way that certain factors affect the moral-psychological state of the troops, that state also affects the perception of any factor in their everyday conditions by the personnel, the level of insecurity in housing, a narrow circle of association etc. The level of development of spiritual requirements and a streamlined system for satisfying them are able to compensate for even the substantial problems that military-professional activity, and the conduct of combat operations in particular, entails. That is why the bodies for indoctrination work occupy a central place in the cause of strengthening the moral-psychological state of the troops. We will be able to reach a better indicator of the military discipline only through purposeful influence on the moral-psychological state of the troops. That influence should be exercised by all the elements of field command and control. The methods of that influence differ in accordance with the specific tasks. How can military discipline be maintained at a more or less satisfactory level under conditions where the level of discipline among the personnel remains low? We have always been trying to do just that by directing our efforts in raising military discipline mainly toward the creation of conditions where an undisciplined--that is, psychologically ready for an offense--serviceman was forced to uphold stipulated norms through the intensification of monitoring, increased exactingness etc. Life has shown that we were not able to achieve a radical change in the situation with such an approach. So the way to strengthen military discipline, from the scientific point of view, lies in influencing the moral-psychological state of the troops as one with the level of discipline of the personnel--the main precondition for strong military discipline. We understand that educational influences on the personnel on the part of indoctrination bodies alone are insufficient to achieve positive indicators of the moral-psychological state of the troops. There is, by the way, another positive element connected with our orientation toward the concept of the moral-psychological state in the cause of strengthening military discipline, as well as the fighting ability of the troops--such an orientation allows us not to destroy the important components of practical work and not to focus on indoctrination alone. We proceed from the fact that the formation of the level of discipline as a socio-psychological trait should be accomplished at both the conscious and the subconscious levels of each individual consciousness. This is achieved in practice thanks to the combination of measures of an indoctrinational, including ideological, work and measures for the socio-psychological support of military service in an interconnected system. Indoctrination work in the Armed Forces is directed toward the formation of such personality traits as patriotism, ideological loyalty to the cause of building and protecting the Ukrainian state, respect for the law, and a conscientious attitude toward service obligations. Both commanders at all levels and the corresponding officials of the bodies for indoctrination work--the deputy commanders, ethnic studies specialists, and workers in culture and education--are working on namely those tasks. A great deal has been done in particular with regard to the development of guiding documents and the institution of standards for indoctrination work in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The standard complements of the Centers for Culture, Education and Leisure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been developed in accordance with the areas and amounts of their work. The Minister of Defense has signed the order "The Conduct of a Review Competition of the Centers of Culture, Education and Leisure, Collectives of Artistic Amateur Activities, Clubs and Ethnic-Studies Rooms," the provisions and requirements of which have been adopted by the troops for fulfillment, with the aim of a qualitative rise in the level of cultural and indoctrination work. But it must be acknowledged as a whole that indoctrination work on our part is still unfortunately reduced to the ordinary informing of the personnel, while it should be emotionally amusing, should incite deep passions in servicemen, a historical memory of their people, a universal perception of their forefathers, and be based on subconscious national traits and models of behavior. Then the indoctrination work will bring significantly better results in the cause of strengthening the moral-psychological state of the troops and the level of discipline of the personnel. We are thus directing ourselves toward a search for and re-creation of new, vital forms of indoctrination work. An organizational structure of the bodies for indoctrination work has been developed and incorporated for this purpose that makes it possible to encompass all of these areas. We are devoting primary attention to the training of officials in practical work and the satisfaction of the needs of the Armed Forces for methodological support for the work with personnel--both in the form of practical recommendations, making use for that purpose of the capabilities of the Scientific-Research and Methodological Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and special issues of the newspapers NARODNA ARMIYA and ZVYTYAZHETS, and in the form of specialized techniques and tests, oriented first and foremost toward those questions that are the most pressing. Some questions of practical work require further scientific study, which would make it possible to reach a level of support of social technologies in work with the personnel. In order for the process of transition to those technologies to begin as soon as possible, we have ordered and are coordinating the corresponding research programs. They are being carried out both by our own military specialists, and by leading scholars of the Institute of Sociology and Psychology of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The question not only of scientific-methodological support for the work with personnel, but raising the psychological and pedagogical competence of all officer personnel, is an ever more pressing one on the agenda. Each officer is an educator and pedagogue in the broad understanding of those words, and life requires today--and will require in the future--that we place emphasis on that. The deputy commander for indoctrination work cannot stand apart from the broad circle of questions that pertain one way or another to the interests and needs of the person. And this in turn requires a reliance on the mechanism for the administration of bodies of indoctrination work. We do not have such an opportunity today even in some very important areas. The fact is that some extremely necessary structures do not even exist, they have not been created. I have in mind the departments for indoctrination work of the administration of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. The definition of indicators for evaluating the quality of work of the bodies for military administration in this area, as well as the set-up of a system for the corresponding information support, that is, a system of accounting for the work, is a fundamentally important issue in the cause of strengthening military discipline. The importance of this question is connected with the fact that it pertains to feedback, without which positive results in the activity of administrative bodies cannot be achieved. The principal requirement for any feedback is that it should correspond to the substance of the practical work. A scientific approach to this question is such, and we are oriented namely toward that. Structuring feedback using indicators of the quantity of violations of military discipline and crimes is renewing the erroneous system of concealment and focus on secondary measures and areas of work that will never provide stable and profound positive results.
