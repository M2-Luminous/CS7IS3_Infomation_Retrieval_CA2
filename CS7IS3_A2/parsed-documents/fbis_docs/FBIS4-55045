The Ministry of Defense Press Department confirmed this to our daily. The inquiry, which focused on the 1990-93 period, ascertained numerous violations of laws, decrees, and legal regulations. The final NKU report refers to systemic shortcomings appearing, in particular, in the years 1990-92. For example, the Army unlawfully sold the Struzna, Kanice, and Neznasov chateaux, which are registered as historical monuments, although it was under an obligation to offer them to the state before selling them. The Ministry of Defense confirmed that the data contained in the NKU report conforms with reality. According to the ministry's Press Department, "the NKU officials' specific findings cannot be called in question." The Press Department statement notes that, after assuming office, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys arrived at the same results, which is why he banned all property transfers until a new system of management with surplus property is worked out. According to the ministry, the new system is transparent, easily verifiable, and fully in accordance with valid laws. All officials responsible for violations of legal norms had without exception been recalled from their posts, according to Ministry of Defense data. Antonin Baudys also asked the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office to investigate whether criminal offenses had been committed when transferring the Army's real estate to other persons. The Chief Military Prosecutor's Office stated, however, that the facts that have been ascertained are not sufficient to warrant criminal proceedings. The Military Police has therefore been charged with investigating the matter further. The results of its efforts thus far have been negative, however, according to the Ministry of Defense Press Department.
