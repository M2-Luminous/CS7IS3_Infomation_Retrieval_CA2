FR940620-0-00005 FR940620-0-00002 Federal Grain Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 801 FGIS to Change Protein Reference Method AGENCY: Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule revises the regulations under the United States Grain Standards Act, as amended, concerning the Tolerances for Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Analyzers. It incorporates by reference the AOAC International (formerly known as the Association of Official Analytical Chemists) Method 992.23, Crude Protein in Cereal Grains and Oilseeds Generic Combustion Method (1992), into the regulations. FGIS will use the Combustion method as the chemical reference method for determining the protein content in both wheat and soybeans. This rule also eliminates the use of the Kjeldahl method for official protein inspections and more clearly describes the application of tolerances to official NIRS type instruments. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective July 20, 1994. The incorporation by reference of the publication listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George W. Wollam, Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA, Room 0624, South Building, P.O. Box 96454, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6454; Telephone (202) 720&hyph;0292. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. The United States Grain Standards Act provides in Section 87g that no State or subdivision may require or impose any requirements or restrictions concerning the inspection, weighing, or description of grain under the Act. Otherwise, this final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification David R. Shipman, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), because most users of the official inspection and weighing services and those entities that perform these services do not meet the requirements for small entities.
