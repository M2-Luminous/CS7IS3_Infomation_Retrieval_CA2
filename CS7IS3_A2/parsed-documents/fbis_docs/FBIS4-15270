"I believe that the rouble's rate should be at a level which would not force Russian exporters to leave foreign markets," he continued. "If they are forced to do so, this will mean that the rate is rigged." The governor said that the CBR's hard currency reserves now total 4.5 billion dollars. They somewhat dropped due to the active policy of pegging up the rouble vis-a-vis the dollar in January. The present task is to boost the CBR's hard currency reserves to nine billion dollars by the end of the current year. There were some 13,000 billion roubles in circulation in the country, as of January 1, 1994. Gerashchenko noted that the 100,000-rouble bill "should not be put into circulation for the time being".
