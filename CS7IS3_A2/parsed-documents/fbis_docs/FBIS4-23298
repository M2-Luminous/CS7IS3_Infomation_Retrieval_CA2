On one side are the African leaders; on the other are the donor countries, and between them a climate of Afro-pessimism reigns. The international powers are becoming increasingly tired of the conflicts on the African continent and the aid is changing direction, namely it is being directed toward east European countries. This was confirmed by Briosa e Gala, Portuguese secretary of state for foreign affairs, who is representing our government at the meeting. [Begin Briosa e Gala recording] Today, an Afro-pessimism is gradually growing about the state of Africa's development on the part of many European countries and of the United States. Unfortunately, Africa now represents only 1 percent of world trade, it continues to be affected by violent and cruel wars, and all this creates a certain fatigue in the international community, which in many cases prefers to support other areas, for example eastern Europe.
