No potential future exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two floating indices, that is, so called floating/floating or basis swaps. The credit exposure on these contracts is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen days or less are excluded. Instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin are also excluded.

Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. a. The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with section III.E.5. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure (sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract; and an (ii) estimate of the potential future credit exposure over the remaining life of the contract. b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current exposure is that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in the relevant rates, as well as counterparty credit quality. c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factors. Banking organizations should, subject to examiner review, use the effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation. The conversion factors are: ␣ 1Remaining maturity 1Interest rate contracts (percent) 1Exchange rate contracts (percent) One year or less 0 1.0 Over one year 0.5 5.0 d. Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for these instruments are contained in Attachment V of this appendix A.
