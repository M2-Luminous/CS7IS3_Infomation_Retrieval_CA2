In comments to journalists here, Andreatta explained that the timetable for economic integration with the six former Soviet satellites would be dictated by "economic factors and therefore be rather slow." But "threats of instability in Europe, such as those deriving from the situation in Moscow," he said, made "speeding up the timetable for political cooperation" essential. Andreatta voiced hopes that the plan would soon be extended beyond Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania and Hungary to take in the three Baltic states as well.
