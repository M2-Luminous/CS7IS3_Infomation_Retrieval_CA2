The figures are for the end of September and the picture looks certain to worsen over the winter months as hospitals stop or reduce operations on the grounds that their contracts for the financial year have been fulfilled. The quarterly September data show 1,030,763 people waiting for treatment in England at the end of the month. This was an increase of 1.3 percent on the total for the end of June, an annualised rate of 5.2 percent. Of the total, 70,512 people had been waiting between one and two years, an increase of 7.7 percent since June, or 30.8 percent on an annualised basis. Another 335 had been waiting more than two years in breach of the Patient's Charter, 334 of them awaiting treatment by a specialist hospital run as a special health authority and one awaiting general admission in the South West Thames health region. The number of people waiting less than a year rose by 0.8 percent between June and September, or 3.2 percent on an annualised basis, to a total 959,916. David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, described the figures as bad news for patients and an indictment of the National Health Service market changes lauded by Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary. With cancelled operations and cuts becoming widespread, the queues represented the tip of the iceberg. Dr. Brian Mawhinney, the Health Minister, said that, compared with September 1992, there were still almost 10,000 fewer patients waiting more than a year. Compared with September 1991, the drop was almost 100,000. Guardian Newspapers Limited, November 2, 1992
