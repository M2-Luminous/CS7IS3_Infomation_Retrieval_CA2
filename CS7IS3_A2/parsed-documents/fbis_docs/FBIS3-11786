He read a communique which states: Regarding the assessment of the situation outlined in the 10-point communique issued by the EZLN (Zapatist National Liberation Army] on 24 March 1994, I consider it appropriate to present the mediator's views on the communique. 1. We understand the EZLN communique does not announce a break in the peace talks or an end to the cease-fire. On the contrary, the EZLN expressed its determination to maintain the cease-fire in keeping with its communique dated 12 January 1994. 2. We do not view the contents of the EZLN communique as a break in the dialogue but, rather, as a notification of an interruption in the consultation process, the second stage of which was to be held in the jungle. Regarding the text of the government's commitments and the next step for the dialogue, a path toward peace must be sought. 3. While denouncing hostile actions, which indeed could become possible in the wake of the grave attack on Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, the EZLN made public its determination to declare a state of maximum alert in light of a possible confrontation. [Begin Ruiz recording] After stating these points, we believe it is necessary to make a general appeal, considering the gravity of the situation, in order not to block those avenues leading toward peace. The exceptional circumstances we are experiencing demand we all seek the truth to guide our freedom [as heard]. False or distorted reports, ill-intentioned rumors, and slanderous attacks weaken the foundations of an atmosphere of understanding and good faith which is indispensable to engendering the birth of the new country we all desire. [end recording] Bishop Samuel Ruiz made the aforementioned clarification because here in San Cristobal there are rumors that attacks are under way in various areas of Chiapas. These rumors were immediately denied, particularly after confirmation was sought in Ocosingo. The San Cristobal bishop called on the media to act responsibly, because some media sources have reported unfounded rumors that have lead nowhere. [Begin Ruiz recording] We all trust that the in-depth investigation regarding the events leading to the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio be objective, persuasive, and in accordance with the law. We hope that this will not become a pretext that might enable military thinking and its high social and human costs to once again prevail over rational dialogue and political negotiations. [end recording] In the end, Samuel Ruiz said that at this time, society, social organizations, and mediation efforts must serve the path of peace and dialogue, adding that these efforts should again be reaffirmed and redirected toward their proper ends. He concluded that at this point in time, there is indeed a state of alert, but that this could be terminated quickly if we can hold a new dialogue to attain a long-awaited peace in Chiapas.
