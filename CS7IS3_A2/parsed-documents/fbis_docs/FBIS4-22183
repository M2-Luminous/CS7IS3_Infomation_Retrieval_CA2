Someone wishes to render the peacekeeping operations Russia is carrying out in nearby countries problematic relative to Moscow's relations with our more geographically distant partners. Ever more frequent are statements made by public figures and the news media to the effect that Russia's peacekeeping activities constitute some kind of "dual nature." The matter in essence amounts to allegations that we are using the peacekeeping operations as a cover for "neoimperial ambitions", in that Russia is demanding the right to interfere in her neighbors' internal affairs. This kind of allegation is expressed succinctly in an amendment passed several days ago by the U.S. Senate without benefit of vote. Included in the part of the draft legislation, which deals with defense and foreign policy expenditures, is the following provision: "The United States will oppose, employing suitable measures, any efforts made by the Russian Federation to employ intimidation by the application of military force or economic pressure to create a sphere of influence in the republics of the former Soviet Union..." What is amazing here is that the document's authors are doing nothing more than shadowboxing. No one has yet been able to furnish any kind of convincing proof of Russia's interfering in the internal affairs of her neighboring states. Nonetheless, this kind of allegation is not without harm, since it creates the dangerous impression that Moscow "must be contained." The above is why Russia's defense and foreign affairs ministries considered it necessary to issue a joint statement explaining Moscow's approach to the conduct of peacekeeping operations. Stressed in the statement is the following: "The actions taken by Russia are intended to merely effect a cessation of armed conflicts in a number of new and independent states, stabilize the situation there, and create conditions conducive to a lasting and stable settlement." Indeed, Russia, which more than other countries is interested in the cessation of all military activities occurring on her borders, is shouldering a heavy burden in carrying out her peacekeeping operations. This is not to mention the approximate amount of 26 billion rubles spent for these purposes in only the last 10 months. Russia is risking the lives of her young men. In this connection, and this is something of special importance in this situation, Russia's peacekeeping operations are not actions arbitrarily taken. They are being carried out in direct response to requests made by, and with the consent of, the respective states and sides engaged in conflict. The point here is that those who perceive the Russian peacekeeping as a "threat" are raising the question of mounting these operations exclusively on the basis of securing permission from the U.N. or the CSCE. And in this they are mixing two issues. Yes, Russia is in favor of the widest possible participation by the U.N. and the CSCE in the settling of conflicts occurring in CIS member countries. However, there is no need to secure any "permission" from these or any other organizations or obtain any other legitimation of peacekeeping operations. It would be another matter to effect cooperation with international organizations such that the latters' active and substantial support would constitute meaningful assistance in the realization of more effective and rapid settlement of conflicts. In this regard, it is unfortunately necessary to state that international institutions, in addition to the individual states that are so apprehensive of Russian peacekeeping, are not in any way anxious to demonstrate initiative in conflict settlement. Thus, our diplomats were unable to obtain a mandate for Russian troops from the U.N. or the CSCE for the conduct of peacekeeping operations. In addition, other states are definitely not enthusiastic about bringing peace to post-Soviet areas. Russia, however, is willing to participate in U.N. and CSCE peacekeeping operations in the territory of the former USSR. Thus, as stressed in the joint statement issued by the MO [Ministry of Defense] and the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], Russia is not pitting its efforts against anyone at all. We are not demanding that we be accorded a special position or exclusive role. However, Russia at the same time has no intention of backing away from her responsibility for her position in this key geographic area.
