A year ago the analogous index amounted to only 19.3 percent. About 5,000 enterprises were forced to suspend production in the first quarter in the majority of cases because of problems with the sale of output. INTERFAX notes that at the beginning of last year the analogous stoppages occurred for lack of components, fuel, and raw materials.
