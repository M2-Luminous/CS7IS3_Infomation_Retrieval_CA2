FR941028-2-00176 FR941028-2-00109 • Cough-inducing procedures should not be performed on patients who may have infectious TB unless the procedures are absolutely necessary and can be performed with appropriate precautions. •All cough-inducing procedures performed on patients who may have infectious TB should be performed using local exhaust ventilation devices (e.g., booths or special enclosures) or, if this is not feasible, in a room that meets the ventilation requirements for TB isolation. •HCWs should wear respiratory protection when present in rooms or enclosures in which cough-inducing procedures are being performed on patients who may have infectious TB. •After completion of cough-inducing procedures, patients who may have infectious TB should remain in their isolation rooms or enclosures and not return to common waiting areas until coughing subsides. They should be given tissues and instructed to cover their mouths and noses with the tissues when coughing. If TB patients must recover from sedatives or anesthesia after a procedure (e.g, after a bronchoscopy), they should be placed in separate isolation rooms (and not in recovery rooms with other patients) while they are being monitored. •Before the booth, enclosure, or room is used for another patient, enough time should be allowed to pass for at least 99% of airborne contaminants to be removed. This time will vary according to the efficiency of the ventilation or filtration used (Suppl. 3, Table S3&hyph;1). 2. Special Considerations for Bronchoscopy •If performing bronchoscopy in positive-pressure rooms (e.g., operating rooms) is unavoidable, TB should be ruled out as a diagnosis before the procedure is performed. If the bronchoscopy is being performed for the purpose of diagnosing pulmonary disease and that diagnosis could include TB, the procedure should be performed in a room that meets TB isolation ventilation requirements. 3. Special Considerations for the Administration of Aerosolized Pentamidine •Patients should be screened for active TB before prophylactic therapy with aerosolized pentamidine is initiated. Screening should include obtaining a medical history and performing skin testing and chest radiography. •Before each subsequent treatment with aerosolized pentamidine, patients should be screened for symptoms suggestive of TB (e.g., development of a productive cough). If such symptoms are elicited, a diagnostic evaluation for TB should be initiated. •Patients who have suspected or confirmed active TB should take, if clinically practical, oral prophylaxis for P. carinii pneumonia. I. Education and Training of HCWs All HCWs, including physicians, should receive education regarding TB that is relevant to persons in their particular occupational group. Ideally, training should be conducted before initial assignment, and the need for additional training should be reevaluated periodically (e.g., once a year). The level and detail of this education will vary according to the HCW's work responsibilities and the level of risk in the facility (or area of the facility) in which the HCW works. However, the program may include the following elements: •The basic concepts of M. tuberculosis transmission, pathogenesis, and diagnosis, including information concerning the difference between latent TB infection and active TB disease, the signs and symptoms of TB, and the possibility of reinfection. •The potential for occupational exposure to persons who have infectious TB in the health-care facility, including information concerning the prevalence of TB in the community and facility, the ability of the facility to properly isolate patients who have active TB, and situations with increased risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis. •The principles and practices of infection control that reduce the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis, including information concerning the hierarchy of TB infection-control measures and the written policies and procedures of the facility. Site-specific control measures should be provided to HCWs working in areas that require control measures in addition to those of the basic TB infection-control program. •The purpose of PPD skin testing, the significance of a positive PPD test result, and the importance of participating in the skin-test program. •The principles of preventive therapy for latent TB infection. These principles include the indications, use, effectiveness, and the potential adverse effects of the drugs (Suppl. 2). •The HCW's responsibility to seek prompt medical evaluation if a PPD test conversion occurs or if symptoms develop that could be caused by TB. Medical evaluation will enable HCWs who have TB to receive appropriate therapy and will help to prevent transmission of M. tuberculosis to patients and other HCWs. •The principles of drug therapy for active TB. •The importance of notifying the facility if the HCW is diagnosed with active TB so that contact investigation procedures can be initiated. •The responsibilities of the facility to maintain the confidentiality of the HCW while ensuring that the HCW who has TB receives appropriate therapy and is noninfectious before returning to duty. •The higher risks associated with TB infection in persons who have HIV infection or other causes of severely impaired cell-mediated immunity, including (a) the more frequent and rapid development of clinical TB after infection with M. tuberculosis, (b) the differences in the clinical presentation of disease, and (c) the high mortality rate associated with MDR&hyph;TB in such persons. •The potential development of cutaneous anergy as immune function (as measured by CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts) declines. •Information regarding the efficacy and safety of BCG vaccination and the principles of PPD screening among BCG recipients. •The facility's policy on voluntary work reassignment options for immunocompromised HCWs. J. HCW Counseling, Screening, and Evaluation A TB counseling, screening, and prevention program for HCWs should be established to protect both HCWs and patients. HCWs who have positive PPD test results, PPD test conversions, or symptoms suggestive of TB should be identified, evaluated to rule out a diagnosis of active TB, and started on therapy or preventive therapy if indicated ( 5 ). In addition, the results of the HCW PPD screening program will contribute to evaluation of the effectiveness of current infection-control practices. 1. Counseling HCWs Regarding TB •Because of the increased risk for rapid progression from latent TB infection to active TB in HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunocompromised persons, all HCWs should know if they have a medical condition or are receiving a medical treatment that may lead to severely impaired cell-mediated immunity. HCWs who may be at risk for HIV infection should know their HIV status (i.e., they should be encouraged to voluntarily seek counseling and testing for HIV antibody status). Existing guidelines for counseling and testing should be followed routinely ( 56 ). Knowledge of these conditions allows the HCW to seek the appropriate preventive measures outlined in this document and to consider voluntary work reassignments. Of particular importance is that HCWs need to know their HIV status if they are at risk for HIV infection and they work in settings where patients who have drug-resistant TB may be encountered. •All HCWs should be informed about the need to follow existing recommendations for infection control to minimize the risk for exposure to infectious agents; implementation of these recommendations will greatly reduce the risk for occupational infections among HCWs ( 57 ). All HCWs should also be informed about the potential risks to severely immunocompromised persons associated with caring for patients who have some infectious diseases, including TB. It should be emphasized that limiting exposure to TB patients is the most protective measure that severely immunosuppressed HCWs can take to avoid becoming infected with M. tuberculosis . HCWs who have severely impaired cell-mediated immunity and who may be exposed to M. tuberculosis may consider a change in job setting to avoid such exposure. HCWs should be advised of the option that severely immunocompromised HCWs can choose to transfer voluntarily to areas and work activities in which there is the lowest possible risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis . This choice should be a personal decision for HCWs after they have been informed of the risks to their health. •Employers should make reasonable accommodations (e.g., alternative job assignments) for employees who have a health condition that compromises cell-mediated immunity and who work in settings where they may be exposed to M. tuberculosis . HCWs who are known to be immunocompromised should be referred to employee health professionals who can individually counsel the employees regarding their risk for TB. Upon the request of the immunocompromised HCW, employers should offer, but not compel, a work setting in which the HCW would have the lowest possible risk for occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis. Evaluation of these situations should also include consideration of the provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990* and other applicable federal, state, and local laws. *Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. P.L. 101&hyph;336, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq. •All HCWs should be informed that immunosuppressed HCWs should have appropriate follow-up and screening for infectious diseases, including TB, provided by their medical practitioner. HCWs who are known to be HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunosuppressed should be tested for cutaneous anergy at the time of PPD testing (Suppl. 2). Consideration should be given to retesting, at least every 6 months, those immunocompromised HCWs who are potentially exposed to M. tuberculosis because of the high risk for rapid progression to active TB if they become infected. •Information provided by HCWs regarding their immune status should be treated confidentially. If the HCW requests voluntary job reassignment, the confidentiality of the HCW should be maintained. Facilities should have written procedures on confidential handling of such information. 2. Screening HCWs for Active TB •Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other signs or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, or fever), should be evaluated promptly for TB. The HCW should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB has been excluded or until the HCW is on therapy and a determination has been made that the HCW is noninfectious. 3. Screening HCWs for Latent TB Infection •The risk assessment should identify which HCWs have potential for exposure to M. tuberculosis and the frequency with which the exposure may occur. This information is used to determine which HCWs to include in the skin-testing program and the frequency with which they should be tested (Table 2).
