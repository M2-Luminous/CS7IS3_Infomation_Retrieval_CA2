A Foreign Office spokesman expressed deep concern over the escalation of fighting between rival factions in Kabul and Mazar-e Sharif. The spokesman said the use of force is not the right method to resolve political differences and disputes. The military success of one faction over another will only be temporary and it can widen the area of confrontation, thereby affecting national unity. He said the Afghan leaders should resume the process of reconciliation in order to meet the need of the hour. He said the Islamabad and Jalalabad accords reached between mojahedin organizations last year were based on national consensus and they provide the base for a durable political settlement that can restore peace in Afghanistan.
