The document was signed at the Cuban Foreign Ministry by Alberto Lestelle, Argentine programming and coordination secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and for the antinarcotics struggle, and Cuban Minister of Justice Carlos Amat. In exclusive statements to journalist Josefa Bussi, the justice minister talked about the U.S. State Department document that acknowledged Cuba's cooperation in the struggle against drug traffic. [Begin Amat recording] Well, we read the statements. We have assessed this as something positive because it does recognize the effort our country has been making, and is continuing to make, despite the existing difficulties in turning into concrete action all these things that, actually, have to do with the political will to fight drug trafficking, thinking not only of our own people but also about all mankind. We think that, indeed, this recognition could constitute the possibility of continuing to enter deeper [continuar profundizando] relations that, in an unofficial way, are being established at certain moments with U.S. authorities. And, in the last analysis, it is indeed everyone's duty to continue working in that direction. [end recording] According to the specialists, Cuba's cooperation in this struggle extends to intercepting planes and ships in its air and maritime space, as well as in supplying information to the U.S. services in charge of confronting that problem.
