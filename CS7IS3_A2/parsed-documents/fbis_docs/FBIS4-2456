Wang, Bao Ge and Yang Zhou were able to return home Sunday, but were placed under house arrest for most of the day and their telephones were cut until Monday morning so that they could not speak with the press, the dissidents said. They were released after the departure Sunday of Balladur from Shanghai, they added. "We were arrested because of Balladur's visit," Yang Zhou, 50, the association's spokesman, told AFP over the phone. Bao Ge, 31, added: "The government was scared we would do something to upset the visit." Wang, 39, detained the first time on Friday, was released and then arrested again Saturday. He spent two nights in the police station and said he was mistreated. "During my second arrest Saturday afternoon, I was beaten for 20 minutes by three plain-clothed policemen," he said. Bao and Yang were first taken to the police station and each spent Saturday night in a different hotel under police surveillance and were restricted from leaving.
