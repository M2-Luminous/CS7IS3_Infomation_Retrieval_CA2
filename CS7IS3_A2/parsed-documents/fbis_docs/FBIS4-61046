It designs missiles of all ranges for combat aircraft. In this type of armament Russia still maintains its superiority -- to a large extent thanks to Vympel. For example, not even the U.S. Army has a reverse start missile like our R-73E [AA-11 `Archer' class], which is designed for close-range dogfights. The air-to-air AAM-AE missile [AA-X-12] is equal in quality to its U.S. counterpart, [AIM-120 A] AMRAAM, while costing only half as much. There are missiles capable of hitting targets at a range of hundreds of miles. The list can go on and on. But like most defense industry enterprises, Vympel finds it hard to work now. Because of a shortage of funds, it is continually forced to reduce long-term research, which gives an impetus to the creation of new types of armament. Yet the acclaimed design bureau still manages to maintain its reputation. The newest missile system was tested recently on the MiG-31M [`Foxhound-B'] aircraft. The Russian president himself congratulated the work force on the success of the experiment. Now Vympel cherishes justifiable hopes for serious support.
