The article describes a "dialogue" between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and several Egyptian Government and opposition figures, writers, journalists, and artists during a late-night Ramadan banquet hosted by Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's Office for Political Affairs. The banquet is also attended by Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to 'Arafat, and a number of unnamed 'Arafat "aides." The date and place of the banquet is not given, but the writer notes that the al-Baz' banquet was preceded by an earlier banquet to break the fast hosted by President Mubarak, which suggests that the dialogue was held on 6 March. The writer begins the article by giving background information on the Hebron massacre and 'Arafat's contacts with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. He then notes that in times of crisis, 'Arafat's mind is "clear" and that he acts in a cool manner. He then quotes some of 'Arafat's remarks during the dialogue. 'Arafat says: "I am not a man who lives in dreams. Undoubtedly, mean and violent incidents disturb me; they make me angry and outraged. But during a crisis, I always sit down and think with my mind, not my emotions. In a crisis, I am governed by my mind and the sense of responsibility wins me over. This is because I am required to make a decision and take a stand, a decision and a stand that will affect the destiny of a people and a homeland. Thus, I can never allow myself to make a decision with such magnitude and influence under the pressure of anger or the inspiration of emotions and outrage." 'Arafat then sheds light on his telephone conversation with Christopher. He says: "U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned me. After expressing his regrets and condemnation of the crime and after conveying President Clinton's condolences, he said: Could you send a high-level envoy to discuss all the details of the situation? I immediately answered: Yes. I will send Nabil Sha'th. This is despite the anger, the outrage, and the extreme grief. For I do not allow anger to govern politics. Anger does not make politics." 'Arafat is then asked by journalists Makram Muhammad Ahmad, Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad, National Progressive Unionist Group leader Khalid Muhiy-al-Din, and Lawyers Association President Ahmad al-Khawajah about the results of Sha'th's mission in Washington. He says: "Our people are passing through the most difficult and complicated stage of their lives. Either they will win their struggle and battle or lose everything. Thus, for the thousandth time, there is no place for outrage and there is no room for a decision motivated or dictated by anger. Work to regain the land and rights must not stop. To be clear, Christopher was not the only one who contacted me after the massacre. Rabin did, too, and said a lot of things. I could have declined to take the call, and I had reasons to, but I did not. I told my colleagues in the occupied territories: Do not reject the contacts and do not stop the work, and it is going on day and night. The fact is that if the situation is viewed in a reasonable and sane way we will find that Israel, particularly after the massacre, is in a real predicament. It is trying to get out of the situation by all means--the extremists and the moderates, the political and governmental forces--although each party is trying to get out of it in its own way." The writer then notes that 'Arafat explains the "political and technical details" of the Oslo agreement. 'Arafat discloses how Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, in one of his diplomatic missions in Tel Aviv, managed to "obtain Rabin's and Peres' approval to grant the East Jerusalem Palestinians the rights to run and vote in elections and that Rabin agreed to allocate two ballot boxes for the Jerusalem residents, one in front of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and another in front of the al-Aqsa Mosque." The writer then notes that al-Baz is asked about Egyptian press reports calling for speeding up normalization with Israel. After noting that decisions on such issues as normalization are not made by the state, since it involves relations between peoples, al-Baz says: "The Egyptian state is linked to Israeli by a peace agreement. Egypt is loyal to its pledges and agreements. The magnitude of cooperation and dealings, which is known as normalization, is governed by practices and responses. It is not made by an administrative or political decision." He adds: "I believe that some writers have noticed that some Arab states, which are advocating the boycott and have discussed with us several joint projects, have hastened to announce various cooperation projects between themselves and Israel. I believe that some of our writers, in the hope of reaching a quick peace and a near solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, thought that everybody was rushing to gain the benefits of peace while Egypt remained faithful to its Arab principles and commitments to Palestine. This is the whole situation and there is nothing more to it. Common interests are too great to be made or motivated by decisions." 'Arafat is then pressed to disclose the U.S. position and the answers brought back from Washington by Nabil Sha'th. He says: "I disagree with Nabil. He is always optimistic and he says good things about the position of Christopher and the U.S. Administration. But at the same time, he brought us many U.S. reservations regarding the failure of the Security Council to issue a resolution, because of the Americans, following a horrible massacre. We did not ask the United States for anything new. We asked it to make a reference to what it had already agreed to in Security Council Resolution 799 on Jerusalem issued in 1992. The strange thing is that the United States, the sponsor of this resolution, refuses to mention it in the new resolution. It also does not want to announce anything before obtaining Israel's prior approval, particularly with respect to the international monitoring or the international troops. We do not want troops equipped with heavy weapons and tanks, we just want two platoons [fasilatyn]. And I have an approval from Russia, France, England, and Belgium for approximately 1,000 soldiers. This would be a multinational force, like the one in Sinai, armed with personal weapons to only undertake protection and monitoring. The sad thing is that, while we are waging this fierce and tough battle to maintain the momentum, preserve the rights, and regain the land, many come out and make the most horrendous accusations against us. For instance, they call Nabil a traitor and say that he surrendered, but the fact is that he is waging a tough battle of negotiations and defense." 'Arafat adds: "The agreement on the occupied territories is the beginning of the establishment of a Palestinian state. When I found hesitation from the United States because it was waiting for Rabin's approval of international troops in the occupied territories, I told them that the land is my land. The land is Palestinian and sovereignty is for the Palestinians. Those who have the right to approve or disapprove of the presence of troops on the land are the Palestinians, the PLO, and we accept it to protect our people. The agreement signed stipulates withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 12 April. In July we should start discussions about measures for the withdrawal of Israelis from the remaining area of the occupied territories. Thus, I say it loud and clear: I, and no one else, am the one who has a right to accept or reject the international troops." 'Arafat is then asked if he thinks the Israeli Government is involved in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 'Arafat says: "Frankly, the Zionist extremist and fanatical forces are still in control of the situation in Israel; in the Army, the government, and the institutions. It is true that the majority supported the agreement and stands strongly behind peace and a settlement, but the extremists still have a strong opinion and hidden tools that they could use at any time, like what happened in Hebron." 'Arafat adds: "Some say that the Army was behind the crime, and I believe this is not accurate. The fact is that some Army factions, not the entire Army, must have acted in collusion. I also refuse to believe that it was an individual act." Asked if he could still control the Palestinians despite the tragedy, 'Arafat says: "I am confident about the awareness of the Palestinian people, their wisdom, and their sane and rational revolution that refrains from excesses. I am sure that meeting our legitimate and just demands, which must be stipulated in a Security Council resolution, could restore confidence to the Palestinians so that they can proceed toward regaining their rights. The Palestinians are tired of war and displacement and want stability and reconstruction, without surrendering or one-upmanship. But for Israel to maneuver or try to improve its image by minor resolutions, this will solve nothing. We have shown the entire world our goodwill in the saddest moment of the massacre and in the darkest hours of disappointment. If Israel responds, we will return to the negotiations on the basis of a just resolution by the Security Council on the condition that all the Arab parties--meaning Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan--will return to the negotiating table, too. We are in touch with them and I have called for a five-party meeting among Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon to coordinate our stances before any new step is taken." Asked if this requires a meeting with Rabin, 'Arafat says: "I do not refuse to meet with Rabin, but shall we meet just to take a picture for the masses? I cannot accept this. But if the meeting is intended to adopt practical steps that could remedy the flaw of the old resolution and open the door for the new rounds, I believe that the awaited Security Council resolution could pave the way for such a meeting." Asked if he still has pressure cards to negotiate from a strong position, 'Arafat says: "Of course, we still have cards in our hands. Who said peace is our only option? We say it clearly and simply: If you change your mind, we will. If you do not want peace, this is your choice and we are ready with all means. We have shown the world our intentions and the world has seen the crime. On this occasion, I would like to say that this is not the time for ending the Arab boycott, particularly after what happened in Hebron, which could be repeated by the Zionist extremists. I repeat once again that the Palestinians are intelligent and cultured. They want to get rid of the occupation, but at the same time they can endure a great deal. They can endure appalling crimes, such as the Hebron massacre and others, if this is the price for its freedom." Asked if the Palestinian extremist current will engage in one-upmanship against him, particularly now, 'Arafat said: "Unfortunately, this current is violent against their fellow Palestinians, not the Israelis. We refused the proposal that PLO and Fatah supporters be freed from Israeli prisons and insisted that Israel release everybody without exception. As a result, our cadres are still in prison, while the Islamic current negotiated the release of its cadres alone in a separate agreement with the Israeli authorities."
