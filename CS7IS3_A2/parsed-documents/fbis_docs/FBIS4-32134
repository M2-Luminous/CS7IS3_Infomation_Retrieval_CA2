However, one interesting aspect has been discussed, namely the position of coalition deputy prime minister. This appears to be an unusual solution and, at first sight, it reveals compromises. The question is how this political position can be fitted into the public law? [Hack] The coalition deputy prime minister is an institution that is half-way between the current setup and, let us say, the solution in Germany, where the institution of deputy chancellor is known, and this position was, for a long time, filled by the smaller coalition partner. In terms of public law, we do not wish to establish this position of "deputy chancellor" -- deputy prime minister. At the same time, in the government's statute, we wish to mention the fact that, during the operation of this government, there will be a minister within the cabinet who will have the right to agree on certain issues. I would add that his rights will not be decided by the ministry he heads, but rather by the fact that he is the person nominated by the smaller coalition partner. However, this will not be the minister who deputizes for the prime minister when he is absent. The government decree on the order of substitution can, without any problems, regulate that some other minister, rather than the interior minister -- if this position is filled by the coalition deputy prime minister -- should substitute for the prime minister in his absence. [Bodnar] The disputed issues would be taken to a coalition conciliation committee in which both parties would have one vote. Do you think that this seems like a hallway to the right of veto? [Hack] I would not put it as sharply as a right of veto. At any rate, the constraints to create consensus are included in the way of operation. Therefore, we agree on a solution that will, at one point, definitely bring the disputes to a consensus. [Bodnar] The two parties made an important gesture to the future opposition in the distribution of the committee places. Does this have any risks, and in view of the known power structure, does it have a real stake? [Hack] It definitely has a stake because the parties preparing for coalition offer higher positions and a bigger chance for participation to the opposition than what would be warranted by the proportion of their mandates. In my view, this is an important gesture and the majority in 1990 did not do this. It has a value and the opposition parties appear to appreciate it. I add that the six-party agreement will lay down these extra rights that will be due to the opposition only while the coalition stands. We have agreed that, in certain parliamentary committees, the proportion of opposition and government will be 50 percent each. One of these is the national security committee that was set up in proportion to the mandates in the previous cycle. We also agreed that if Parliament is to set up an investigation committee, the proportion of government and opposition in it will again be 50 percent each. [passage omitted]
