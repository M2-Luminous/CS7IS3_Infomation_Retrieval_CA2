PRC national affairs experts Hu Angang [5170 7254 6921] and Wang Shaoguang [3769 4801 0342] disclosed certain facts about them a few months ago. A pertinent PRC party has also transmitted their substance internally. On 2 July 1993, the PRC's "top ace" in solving knotty problems -- Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, took the helm as the president of the Peoples' Bank of China [PBOC]. As Zhu has been responsible in recent years for curing various complicated cases, such as inflation and state enterprise losses, the liquidation of triangular debt, and the suppression of peasant wrath, there have been both official and unofficial expectations that this grand master could cure today's "national disaster" -- all economic problems, such as the "empty" treasury coffers caused by financial corruption. But while the collapse of a tall building is hard to prop up with just one log, the magic wand wielded by Zhu Rongji could not go wrong. He was going to rectify the financial order to adjust the investment orientation, with the efficacy of this magic wand completely dependent on the financial regulation and control capability of the central government. So in this "perilous autumn" of Zhu Rongji's emergence, what is the state of the PRC central government's financial capability? PRC affairs expert Hu Angang and a U.S. PRC scholar, Wang Shaoguang, recently disclosed certain facts in a "Report on China's National Capability." How Strong Is the Central Revenue Capability? Hu and Wang pointed out in this report that: "Since the general separate revenue' package system was instituted in 1980, the state's financial capability has declined rapidly, with government revenues extremely decentralized, and the center's macroeconomic control capability down." This has shown up in detail as: 1. The ratio of revenues to GNP has dropped steadily, already being less than one-half that of industrialized countries with market economies. This revenue ratio had dropped from 31.2 percent in 1978 to 14.7 percent by 1992, and is projected to be down to 11.3 percent by the year 2000. But in 1989, it was 34.6 percent in the United States, 45.9 percent in Germany, 46.1 percent in France, and 37.1 percent in Australia. 2. Revenue growth elasticity is down, being in a state of low elasticity. From 1986 to 1991, revenues grew only 0.66 percent per 1 percent growth of GNP. In comparison, from 1979 to 1988, this revenue-growth elasticity value was 0.95 percent in the United States, 1.094 percent in Britain, 2.821 percent in Japan, 1.143 percent in India, and 0.899 percent in Indonesia which, while ranking lowest, was still higher than China's for the period. 3. Central government revenue capability is down to its lowest point in PRC history. In 1989, China's ratio of central revenue spending to GNP was only 1.6 points higher than that of the former Yugoslavia, or one-fifth to two-fifths that of large developing countries with populations of up to hundreds of millions, such as India. Revenues and expenditures are quite decentralized. While the ratio of central revenues to all revenues during the Seventh Five-Year Plan was about 40 percent, with local revenues at 60 percent, IMF data for the period show the ratio of central to all revenues at 88 percent in France, 63 percent in Germany, 59 percent in the United States, 69 percent in India, and 97 percent in Indonesia, with the only exception being Yugoslavia, where it was 28 percent. If we include extrabudgetary funds in revenues, then central revenues make up only one-fifth of all revenues, with local revenues accounting for the other four-fifths. World Bank experts have come to the conclusion that "there is probably no other country in the world where revenues and expenditures are more decentralized than in China." Having made this comparison, Hu and Wang point out that: "In comparison to industrialized nations with market economies or large developing countries with populations of hundreds of millions, the Chinese Government's central revenue capability is severely inadequate, meaning that unless it takes resolute steps, it will be hard for it to fulfill its missions of market economy development during its conversion period." As to the causes of the Central Government's declined financial capability, Hu and Wang hold unanimously that: As opposed to the contemporary revenue systems in general use in industrialized nations with market economies -- tax separation and uniform taxation, Mainland China's current revenue package system has the severe defects of being nonstandard, unscientific, and not uniform. Where Is State Revenue Flowing? Due to the revenue shortage, the long-hoped-for sharp increase in salaries for employees in institutions and state organs will again not occur in the short-term. Mainland China's revenue losses are all through the following channels: 1. Tax Erosion. Under mainland China's current separate-revenue package system, the phenomenon of localities and enterprises acting out of local interests to arbitrarily institute tax reductions and exemptions is unstoppable, with enterprise tax evasion and avoidance quite common. A pertinent poll and projection shows that tax evasion and avoidance exists in about 50-60 percent of China's state and collective enterprises, and in over 90 percent of its individual and private enterprises, with China's annual tax losses amounting to about 50 billion yuan. 2. Profit-Payment Losses. This is seen mainly in the interception and shift of profits that should be paid to the government, through the following common methods: After fulfilling contracted profits, some intercept and shift surplus profits, even to the point of artificially fabricating book losses; some "accomodate" through counterfeit documents (not only are such counterfeit invoices and documents boldly fabricated by certain operating sectors, but they are also openly offered for sale on markets), making fraudulent applications and claims, and shifting income; some shift general-account income, such as joint-venture or tertiary enterprise income and unit nonoperating income, fine and confiscation income, and even some business income, to unit "small treasuries," or even "fly it across the sea," shifting it to temporary deposits in overseas units; and others include nonproduction expenses in costs. Such losses are so large that they are hard to even investigate or measure. 3. Dual-Track-Price Erosion. In the process of economic and financial reform, some units, groups, and individuals that hold great authority over commodities have accurately seen the opportunity of "dual-track prices," taking advantage of their authority to buy long and sell short, and seeking exorbitant profits without personal participation, with over 70 percent of such income flowing into private pockets. Data beginning in 1988 show that such revenue erosion has reached a high of about 100 billion yuan. In recent years, the reduction in state revenues due to dual-track prices has again expanded from the field of circulation into other fields. 4. Rebate Losses. Mainland China's rebates [commissions, kickbacks] are certainly not like those in other market-economy countries, i.e., a form of profit concession between industrial and commercial enterprises. The "rebates" prevalent in China's purchase and marketing field are actually "advantage fees," landing directly in private purses. Incomplete data from one small Chinese city show that the accumulated spending on rebate fees in 1991 of over 5,000 industrial and commercial enterprises topped 100 million yuan. 5. Interest Losses From Private Deposits of Public Funds. A typical poll published on a certain province finds that private deposits of public funds make up about 5-10 percent of financial-institution deposits. Projecting from this, China has private deposits of public funds topping 100 billion yuan, causing annual interest losses of about 3 billion yuan. Certain local finance and banking departments act in collusion, using state-revenue funds for phoney commissioning, lending, and division of interest. Banks collude with enterprises to profit from financing, which losses are also sizeable. 6. Grey Distribution. This refers mainly to certain enterprises and institutions violating state policy, by recklessly issuing property to employees. A poll and estimation by a concerned department finds that the wage income of employees throughout China shot up from its 1985 level of 20.08 billion yuan (15 percent of payrolls) to 77.3 billion yuan by 1990 (26.2 percent of payrolls). Grey distribution is now still expanding, in some cases making up 40-50 percent of all employee income, and even as high as several or dozens of times. 7. Entertaining. The variety of pretexts for and ways of entertaining at public expense in China can be said to be unmatched anywhere else in the world. The State Statistical Bureau estimates that 60-70 percent of the business turnover of large- and mid-sized hotels and restaurants throughout China comes from entertaining at public expense. The most conservative estimate is that China loses as much as 80 billion yuan a year in public funds through entertainment. 8. Conferences and Publicly Funded Tourism. The current various forms of exchange conferences, demonstration meetings, appraisal gatherings, cooperation get-togethers, and symposiums, as well as investigation groups leaving the country mostly for tourism, are innumerable, with the size of their spending leaving one speechless. The Ministry of Finance has disclosed that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan, domestic conference spending grew at an average of 21 percent a year. 9. Group Consumption. Many government organs and enterprise units compete with each other to see "which can consume the most." Some units compete in purchasing air conditioners, color TVs, and expensive cars, indiscriminately installing telephones, going in for ostentation and extravagance, and parading wealth, with all sorts of extravagance and waste prevalent, and social group consumption up sharply. In the first three quarters of 1992, nonproductive group-consumption spending grew over 30 percent in 21 mainland Chinese provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. There is basically no way to calculate the group-consumption spending through other channels. Corruption and Abuse of Power Are the Causes. This revenue erosion is essentially due to those with varying amounts of power and influence taking advantage of their authority to plunder public assets unscrupulously, with the opening of all ways being subject to the means of corruption and bribery. In recent years, there have been numerous major cases of graft and bribetaking involving millions and tens of millions of yuan, with such graft and corruption having spread to all government-authority sectors, such as public security, industrial commercial, taxation, banking, land management, administration and law enforcement, and labor and personnel. This lamentable reality shows that the mainland Chinese government is beyond cure. It could be said that it is precisely the corrupt political system that has created this corrupt bureaucracy, with China's current overall situation being the result of the "endeavors" of those so corrupted. The Chinese Government also seems to have awakened to the cause of its current plight, with its "rectification of the financial order" being accompanied by an "anti-corruption struggle," which the people call anti-corruption led by the corrupt," so whose effects will certainly be suspect. As so many central figures of authority have princes, princesses, and sons-in-law doing their utmost to get by improper means, what hope is there that those below will not follow the example of those above throughout China? As China is now on the verge of paying for its autumn grain harvest, with peasants holding IOUs for years angry to the point of bursting, any further passing out of IOUs will be bound to touch off an "autumn-harvest uprising." So in order to bridge this pass, all specialized banks throughout China have turned over to the PBC all of their savings that are not out on loan (it is still not known how interest is to be paid on this), with recent transfers of 13 billion yuan from Guangdong and nearly 8 billion yuan from Jiangsu. While this is injecting a little blood into the exhausted state revenues, it is undoubtedly merely a drop in the bucket. With such a state financial capability to undertake the many heavy duties in the conversion period, such as stopping the slide in agricultural production, adjusting the slanted investment structure, easing the increasing inflation pressures, and opening up the bottleneck restraints in areas such as transportation and energy, even if Zhu Rongji had the nerve to "clear up the whole mess thoroughly," it is feared that he lacks such tremendous power.
