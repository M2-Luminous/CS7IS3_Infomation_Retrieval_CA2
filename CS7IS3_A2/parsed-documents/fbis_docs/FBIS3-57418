The appointment came some days after Yakovlev had been telephoned by Sergey Filatov, head of the president's administration, who had offered him the post, saying that the offer had come from Boris Yeltsin personally. Asked by IZVESTIYA what his official duties would be and what was behind the establishment of the post, Aleksandr Yakovlev made the following comment: "It is not a new post. It was filled in the Russian Supreme Soviet by Anatoliy Sliva, deputy chief of the State Law Administration. The functions of the president's representative in the Federal Assembly stem from the constitutional rights and duties of the head of state in relation to the legislative body. As is known, the president is entitled to initiate legislation. Moreover, according to article 83, he will submit for approval by the Federal Assembly candidates for the following posts -- government chairman, chairman of the Central Bank, judges of the Constitutional, Supreme, and Supreme Arbitration Courts, and also general prosecutor. The president needs a skilled lawyer to successfully perform the aforementioned functions. [IZVESTIYA] Does this mean that this is the president's way of avoiding constant contacts with legislators? [Yakovlev] Of course not. Depending on the importance of the question under consideration, the president will address the deputies of both parliaments. For example, he will soon be delivering a message to parliament. My role is to help with legal advice and consultations, ensure feedback betweenm the head of state and the Federal Assembly, and break down information barriers. And, if need be, put the lid on any conflicts that might be brewing. [IZVESTIYA] How often do you intend to visit the Duma and the Federation Council? [Yakovlev] I will have to go there regularly. At any rate, whenever presidential draft laws are being examined. Aleksandr Yakovlev is a doctor of juridical sciences. Since 1975 he has headed the criminal law and criminology sector at the Institute of State and Law, where he will continue to work on half pay. Yakovlev links the inivtation to join the president's team to his recent conspicuous participation in the work of the Constitutional Conference as one of the coordinators of the group of representatives of the federal organs of authority. The post of representative of the head of state in the Federal Assembly is an addition to the structure of the president's administration. Aleksandr Yakovlev and his apparatus, comprising several lawyers, will be located in Staraya Ploshchad.
