Tsai] [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Domestic farmers will suffer greatly from Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), according to a study published Tuesday [21 June]. The study, conducted by Professor Peng Tzuo-kuei of National Chung Hsing University under the Commission of the Council of Agriculture, found that the opening of the domestic rice market could mean an income loss to farmers of at least 20 percent within six years. Taiwan must gradually open its various markets to smooth its bid to join GATT, which is expected by the end of the year. The government is currently mulling over how best to accomplish a rice-market opening in line with GATT while sparing Taiwan rice farmers extensive harm. Professor Peng's study says that if Taiwan adopts the "Japanese formula," which allows rice imports of up to 4 percent of domestic consumption in the first year of market opening and gradually increases the imports to 8 percent in the sixth year, farm losses could top NT [New Taiwan] $2.6 billion (US$95.94 million) by the year 2000. If the "Korean formula" is adopted, the study says, Taiwan farmers are expected to suffer a loss of NT$3.2 billion (US$118.08 million) by the year 2004. Under the Korean formula, rice imports will account for only 1 percent of domestic consumption in the first year of market opening and the import ratio will rise to 4 percent in the 10th year. Farm losses will be even higher if expected reductions in government farm subsidies were included in the figures, the study notes. The professor recommended that the government lower its guaranteed purchase price of rice by 20 percent in six years to comply with the GATT Uruguay round codes reached last December. The study was the first analysis of the negative impact the opening of the rice market will have on Taiwan farmers.
