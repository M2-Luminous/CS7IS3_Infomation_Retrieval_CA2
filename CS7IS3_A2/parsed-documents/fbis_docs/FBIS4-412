Ntibantunyanya, who made the announcement on national radio, gave no detail on the type and number of planes expected in the Burundian capital. He only said that immediately the Americans applied for landing, the Crisis Committee met urgently and gave the go-ahead to the U.S. planes. The speaker appealed for understanding saying it was purely a humanitarian gesture. "The American planes have no other mission than to repatriate U.S. nationals who risk death in Rwanda", he explained. The speaker, who under the Constitution is to lead the country for an interim period of between 45 days and three months, ended his short radio address by commending the Burundian people for "the dignity they have shown so far in these times of trial". He urged them to continue to safeguard "peace which honors Burundi in the eyes of the international community". The Crisis Committee comprises six eminent personalities, including Ntibantunganya, Defense Minister Colonel Cedeon Fyroko, and Armed Forces general chief of staff, Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu.
