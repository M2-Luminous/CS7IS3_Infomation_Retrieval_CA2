Korean Authorities Demanded" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean rulers, if they truly want to turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone, must acknowledge, though belatedly, that their heavy water reactor, multipurpose research reactor and fast breeder reactor are for developing nuclear weapons, and apologize for this at home and abroad, and take a step to scrap them," said Chang Chae- chol, chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Korean Roman Catholics Association, in a statement on Tuesday. Noting that Kim Yong-sam the traitor recently concluded an agreement with Japan on a joint nuclear development and is hastening the development of a fast breeder reactor, the statement said: "The development of nuclear weapons in South Korea has assumed a full-fledged scale because the International Atomic Energy Agency, applying a double standard, has connived at the puppets' development of nuclear arms which has actually reached a dangerous stage, not publishing even the inspection results, while taking issue with the DPRK's nuclear facilities for a peaceful purpose. "Not contented with the introduction of over 1,000 pieces of U.S. nuclear weapons, which have turned South Korea into the largest nuclear depot in the Far East, the Kim Yong-sam group is stepping up the development of nuclear weapons by itself. This is an unpardonable heinous anti-national crime. "I call upon all the Roman Catholics and Catholic communities and people of conscience of the world to pay due attention to the nuclear development in South Korea and lift up voices of justice denouncing it," the statement concluded.
