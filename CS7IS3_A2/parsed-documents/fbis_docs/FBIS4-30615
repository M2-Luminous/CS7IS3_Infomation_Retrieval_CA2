The yen has been on an uptrend [upward trend] against the U.S. currency, closing in Tokyo Monday at a postwar high of 99.93 yen against the dollar. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., are now considering importing rolled steel from South Korea for use in their vehicles, the sources said. They said rolled steel imported from South Korea is about 20 percent cheaper than the domestic product. Mitsubishi plans to use South Korean rolled steel for the interior of its cars, such as the inner face of doors, they said. In addition, domestic shipbuilders, facing rising competition from South Korea, launched a study last year to import low-priced steel materials, the sources said. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. has decided to import steel materials from South Korea and Brazil on a spot deal, and its imports of shipbuilding materials this year are expected to account for around 5 percent of the procurement, they said. Shipbuilding firms are in a dilemma over the increasing use of imported materials, however, as customers want prices to be cut in line with cheaper production costs. For similar reasons, construction and other industries are hesitating to increase imports of raw materials from overseas, the sources said. They said automobile makers and shipbuilders are using low-priced imports as a tool for price bargaining with domestic steelmakers. Export-oriented industries have been hit hard by the strong yen. Kyushu Matsushita Electric Co., an affiliate of the world's leading consumer electronics maker Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., said the yen's rise by 1.00 yen per dollar will produce a loss of 1.8 billion yen per year. The company has mapped out its business projection for the current year on the yen-dollar exchange level of 105 yen per dollar. Yoshihiro Yasui, president of Japan's top sewing machine maker Brother Industries Ltd., described the yen's rise above the 100 yen per dollar level as epoch-making. Yasui said dollar-yen exchange rates are moving on speculation regardless of fundamental economic factors.
