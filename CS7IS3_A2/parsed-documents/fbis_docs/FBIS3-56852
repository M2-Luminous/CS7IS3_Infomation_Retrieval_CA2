ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent, who analyses reasons for Gaydar's resignation, believes that the resignation itself speaks volumes. It is now a question of "two basically different tactics of reformers. The first one is to remain in the government and fulfil their promises: to secure a 5-7 percent inflation rate by the end of the year, financial stabilisation, a favourable investment climate, a slowdown in production downturn, and a gradual rise in production on a basis not connected with an additional emission of money." "The reformers lack confidence that they will manage to implement this programme. Naturally, they have no desire to share responsibility with inflationists for economic failures. It means that it is essential to quit the government -- hence the second tactic of reformers." TRUD is of the opinion that "although the government composition remains unknown so far, the reform-minded wing is rapidly dwindling. The newspaper corroborates this thought by maintaining that "government executives, apparently, increasingly incline towards cooperation with the Agrarian Party's parliamentary group who support Aleksandr Zaveryukha, and with the industrial chiefs. "At any rate, Oleg Soskovets on Tuesday attended a meeting with regional industrialists who were summoned by Arkady Volsky, while Viktor Chernomyrdin gave preference to Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Viktor Gerashchenko over Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fyodorov". IZVESTIYA on Yegor Gaydar's resignation: "The money market reacted with panic to the chief monetarist's resignation". "It is obvious that the present panic on the money market has been caused by a government reshuffle. The voluntary resignation of Yegor Gaydar, who personifies the policy of rigid financial stabilisation, has influenced the money market situation most of all". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the formation of the State Duma committees. The newspaper points out that "Andrey Kozyrev states that Russia's foreign policy is a presidential one. However, following the formation of the Duma committees, this postulate is not so unambiguous. At least, four of the committees can, and are likely to, lay claim to securing that their opinion are taken into account: on security, international affairs, on CIS affairs, and on geopolitical issues. The latter committee is sure to go farther in this respect than others, if only because it is headed by Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) representatives Viktor Ustinov and his deputy Mikhail Sidorov. The LDPR did not manifest even a hint of agreement with the Yeltsin-Kozyrev foreign policy course" "Thus, there are all prerequisites for the shaping of a Duma-president opposition over his minister of foreign affairs on practically all foreign policy aspects". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Federation Council: "Battles in the upper house of parliament lie ahead". "The lack of conflicts at the beginning of the federation councils's work led parliament analysts to conclude: The federation council is fully controlled by the president. "However, Russian senators themselves do not think so. `The president simply had no occasion to get to know the true colours of the federation council, because the deputies themselves, primarily regional leaders, have no clear idea of their role in the upper house of parliament', a Federation Council member told the newspaper". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on prospects for Russian-U.S. cooperation in space research. The newspaper points out that in the middle of December last year, the two main space-faring powers determined a program for 10 U.S. space shuttle flights to the orbital complex Mir. At the same time U.S. astronauts are to work aboard the Mir station for an aggregate of about two years, "drawing on our experience in long- duration space expeditions. A date for the blast-off of a U.S space shuttle, with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev on board, has also been decided upon. The weeklong flight is scheduled for the beginning of February 1994.". PRAVDA carries a statement by the leaders of some parties and public organisations "on the non-legitimate nature of the constitution brought up for the referendum by President Boris Yeltsin". "The text of the constitution brought up for the referendum of December 12, 1993, revives an authoritarian system in the Russian Federation. During the holding of the referendum on the draft constitution, most flagrant breaches of the Russian Federation's 1978 constitution (with subsequent changes) and the 1990 law on referenda were committed," the statement said. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, analysing the forthcoming transfer by Ukraine of all of its 2,000 nuclear weapons to Russia for subsequent dismantling and elimination, observes that "it is well known what will be the benefits of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament for the whole world. The 'nuclear club' will not expand. There will be no precedent that would enable Pakistan, India or Israel to join it. It is unclear, though, how will Russia benefit from that". "For the sake of eliminating Ukrainian nuclear weapons, the United States assigns 60 million dollars to Russia in the form of an advance payment for its yet unsold uranium". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA frontpages an interview with Tajikistan parliament chief Emomali Rakhmanov who said: "Of course, the country is still far from complete tranquility in the political life and order in the economy. The main thing that we strove to do was to unite the people".
