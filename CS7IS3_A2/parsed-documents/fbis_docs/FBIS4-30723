[24 June] -- DAP [Democratic Action Party] secretary-general Lim Kit Siang today urged the Cabinet to review the Home Ministry's ban on the Tamil biweekly newspaper THOOTHAN, following its publication of reports extremely embarrassing to MIC [Malaysian Indian Congress] president Datuk Sri S. Samy Vellu. In its latest issue dated June 22, which could not hit the news-stands because of the June 21 ban, THOOTHAN reported that about 50 taxi permits meant for the Indian community had been "diverted" to a company. In the last three months, THOOTHAN had published exclusive interviews with former Samy Vellu confidant and MIC public relations committee chairman V. Subramaniam Barat Maniam, who had confessed to being the main "co-ordinator" in the Maika Telekom shares issue. Lim, in a statement, said the banning of THOOTHAN for exposing political and financial scandals would make a mockery of the fight against money politics. "Apart from raising the fundamental issue of Press freedom, democracy and human rights, it also raises the question as to whether the Government is serious about fighting corruption in all forms."
