In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Rexrodt said they discussed joint projects, all in all 15, ways to boost bilateral trade and increase german investments in Russia. Special attention was paid to the creation of a favourable climate for German investors. However, this will require the Russian parliament to adopt certain laws, he added. The German minister believes that economic issues will feature prominently during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's upcoming visit to Germany scheduled for May. Some of the projects that were discussed today will be considered by Yeltsin and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn. It is unclear as yet whether or not cooperation agreements will be signed during his visit. It is much more important that the talks in Germany should give a new impetus to bilateral economic relations. Germany welcomes Russia's willingness to conclude an agreement on partnership and cooperation with the European Union. However, this will take some time as it is necessary to take into account the interests of eu countries and meet some conditions, including adopt certain laws in Russia, the minister said.
