He evaluated positively the fact that Ukraine is losing the artificially created image of a nuclear monster and its international isolation, which had begun to form. He expressed satisfaction that Ukraine will get the opportunity for wide economic cooperation and will get compensation for dismantling its nuclear weapons. Volodymyr Chernyak stressed that the future agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States is not an agreement on nuclear disarmament in general, but solely on the disarmament of Ukraine. In his opinion, there is not a single norm whereby Russia can have weapons but Ukraine cannot. This is not a normal situation, all the more so when such an odious figures as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy can come to power in Russia. "The `partnership for peace' formula," said Volodymyar Chernyak, "was adopted by the United States under pressure from Russia so as not to accept countries of Central and Eastern Europe into NATO. There is nothing realistic in this formula. It does not guarantee security, not even for Ukraine."
