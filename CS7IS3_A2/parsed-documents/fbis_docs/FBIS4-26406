There was bright prospects for development of China's textile industry. --Since the textile industry in China has plunged into a temporary predicament, a dispute on whether the textile industry in China is a declining industry has been going on among specialists in the economic circle. Elaborating on this question, Ms Wu said it was wrong to call the textile industry a declining one. Up to date, the output value of the textile industry remained one-sixth of the total industrial value of the country. Tax on its profit and the total income from its retail sales made up one-sixth each of those of the whole country. Its export value was even grater, making up 30 percent of that of the country. Since the reform and the open-door policy started fifteen years before, Ms Wu said, profit from and tax levied on the textile industry was as high as RMB 310 billion [renminbi] for the country and earned U.S.$160 billion from its export, unmatchable by any other industry in China. Even in 1993 which was the most difficult year for the industry, it still handed over more than 20 billion renminbi to the state and earned U.S.$27 billion from its export, indicating the textile industry remained one of the pillar industries of China. -- Ms Wu said any country in the world would have to start from the light and textile industries in its course from a developing country to a developed one. China was still a big agricultural country and its productive forces remained at the primary stage of development. It was impossible for China's hi-tech industries to catch up with the level of the developed countries overnight. China must depend on the light and textile industries to accumulate wealth and to lay a strong foundation. Therefore, Ms Wu said, the textile industry would still function as one of the pillar industries before China became a developed country by mid-21st century. -- Ms Wu said in view of the situation that the top-notch fashionable dress and materials for clothes-making were mostly imported, there existed great potential in the textile industry in China. Besides, the two fields including the decorative cloth and cloth for industrial use needed to be developed. In the developed countries, Ms Wu said, garment, textile products for decoration and for industrial use usually made up one-third of products of the textile industry respectively. In China, however, only garment made up 70 percent of the textile industry products. Therefore, there was bright prospects for the development of the textile industry in China.
