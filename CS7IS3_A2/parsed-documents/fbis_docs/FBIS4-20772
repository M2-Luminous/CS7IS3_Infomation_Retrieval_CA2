The CIA was involved in the dreadful violence and bomb blasts in Bombay after the 6 December 1992 incident. This is the conclusion the Indian intelligence agencies have reached. According to the conclusions reached after confidential investigations, the CIA used the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, the Mafia gangs in Bombay, and some leaders for this purpose. According to these sources, the CIA helped the communal organizations and the Mafia gangs with money and weapons. These sources revealed that the purpose for the dreadful violence and bomb blasts in Bombay was to sabotage the market here. they went as far as to say that the CIA is trying to split up India. These sources expressed the concern that Madras was the next target after the destruction in Bombay. A red alert has been declared in the state after this information was received. The state government has issued a special appeal to the people to remain peaceful. According to these sources, the CIA is inciting innocent people in addition to using anti-social and communal elements to make its conspiracies successful. The intelligence agencies have prepared a list that includes names of important persons in politics and other fields. Their activities are being closely monitored now. The intelligence agencies have collected all possible information related to the terrible riots in December 1992 and January 1993 as well as to the March bomb blasts. What happened in Bombay after 6 December was not coincidental. The plans to spread violence were made before 6 December. A local intelligence official was aware of a meeting held in a minority section of city to plan a strategy for spreading violence after the mosque was destroyed. However, he did not try to get information about the decisions made in that meeting. The sources revealed that this plan to spread violence brought the Muslims who were wounded in the riots to public attention. The CIA had made plans to have the majority group commit violence in retaliation to the violent activities of the minority group. It has supplied weapons to both sides. It used communal organizations on both sides and anti-social elements for this purpose. The widespread violence that the foreign powers had assumed would take place after the March bomb blasts did not take place. The sources said that additional violence did not occur because of the change in political atmosphere after the change in leadership and the measures taken after the police received additional information about riots. The CIA and the ISI worked together to provide finance and weapons for bomb blasts. In additional to the Mafia members, young people suffering from riots were used for this purpose. The home and foreign ministries needed to work together to apprehend the real criminals behind that 12 March bomb blasts. The investigation was not very successful because of the lack of cooperation. That disheartened the investigating officials. High-level officials have said that the local communal organizations interfere in their efforts to foil CIA and ISI plans. Whenever plans to take serious action against anti-social elements are made, the related communal organizations raise a lot of hue and cry against it. After last year's major bomb blasts, there were nine smaller blasts in public places in Bombay in August and September. The goal of these blasts was to spread fear among the people. The Bombay police arrested a Pakistani citizen trying to place a bomb in the Ahmedabad Janata Express at Bombay Central station. This member of the Jamaatul Mujaheddin is a resident of Lahore. Several persons suspected to be Kashmiri terrorists were also arrested in Bombay. According to police sources, the BJP was planning a demonstration outside the Vidha Bhavan on 12 July 1993. At that time, some Bajrang Dal members with Indian-made revolvers were arrested. These people had threatened the minority community store owners. A similar incident took place on 6 December 1993 when the All India Ulema-e Council had organized a strike. The police had expected communal hatred to erupt on both these occasions. One report recommended that the police should be fully prepared for every important religious holiday and minor confrontations.
