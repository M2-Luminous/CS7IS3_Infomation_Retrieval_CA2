In the Vancouver declaration on the results of the meeting of the Russian and U.S. presidents on 3-4 April, the leaders of the two countries acknowledged the great importance of preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery vehicles. They reaffirmed their determination to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to turn it into an open-ended and global pact.[.sup]1[/] Despite the good intentions of Russia and the United States and of the majority of countries in the world community, however, North Korea's actions have given rise to the most severe crisis in international non-proliferation policy since the time the treaty first went into effect (in 1968). On 12 March 1993 the DPRK officially notified the UN Security Council of its intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and thereby free itself from its political obligation not to develop nuclear weapons. The DPRK became the first country in the world to announce its planned withdrawal from the treaty. This decision could set a dangerous precedent and have a negative effect on the nuclear non-proliferation framework, which is overseen by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A letter to the foreign ministers of the states party to the treaty says that the DPRK decided to withdraw from the treaty in connection with the state of emergency that arose in the country as a result of the American-South Korean "Team Spirit" maneuvers and with the "unfair resolution" the IAEA Board of Governors passed on 25 February, demanding that military installations with no relationship to nuclear activity be opened for inspection. Article 10 of the treaty says: "Each party to this treaty shall, in exercising its national sovereignty, have the right to withdraw from the treaty if it decides that extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country. It shall give notice of such withdrawal to all other parties to the treaty and to the UN Security Council three months in advance. Such notice shall include a statement of the extraordinary events it regards as having jeopardized its supreme interests." When the DPRK made the announcement, it also put its army on red alert, and the Republic of Korea responded by doing the same. "A war between the DPRK and the United States could break out at any moment," the DPRK ambassador to the United Nations declared. Many experts believed just a short time ago that the threat of a North Korean nuclear weapon was considerably diminished, if not completely non-existent. After signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985, the DPRK agreed to put its nuclear facilities under IAEA control in 1992. Inspections created strong suspicions, however, that the declared quantity of plutonium was far smaller than the amount actually produced. On 25 February this year the IAEA decided to conduct a "special inspection," envisaging access to any and all facilities and gave the DPRK a month to open two facilities where the undeclared plutonium might be located. The DPRK responded by announcing its withdrawal from the treaty. This was the beginning of the crisis in the nuclear non-proliferation framework, which was then alleviated in a somewhat unexpected manner. Just one day before Pyongyang's decision would become a reality, on 11 June, a joint American-North Korean statement was published and said that the DPRK "is unilaterally postponing any action on its intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons for the period of time it deems necessary." The nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula had tremendous repercussions in the world community. There is widespread interest in assessments of the DPRK's technological capabilities for the development of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, the motives behind its announced withdrawal from the treaty, the implications of this decision for the non-proliferation framework, and the role of the world's leading countries, the United Nations, and the IAEA in resolving this crisis. Arsenal and Potential Nuclear potential: Experts agree that Pyongyang has the industrial potential to build nuclear weapons. The network of atomic industry facilities that was built up over almost three decades of work on the nuclear program in the DPRK could be used for military purposes. A 200-MW gas-graphite natural-uranium reactor is being built, for example, and sites are being chosen for the construction of three 635-MW reactors. There are two plants for the enrichment of uranium. There are uranium mines in Pakch'on and Pengason. Uranium reserves have been estimated at 26 million tonnes of ore (over 15,000 tonnes of uranium). With the help of the USSR and the PRC, the DPRK used its existing crude resources to build a scientific-experimental infrastructure in the 1950s and 1960s and began training the necessary group of specialists. The DPRK has several specialized scientific research institutes, including the nuclear power engineering and radiology institutes, the Nuclear Physics Department of Pyongyang University, and the School of Nuclear Research Technology at the Kimch'aek Polytechnical Institute. History and the Present Day: North Korea's nuclear research began right after World War II. Attracted by the DPRK's deposits of uranium ore, the Soviet Union assisted in geological prospecting and the assessment of reserves for the possible development of an atomic industry. Western experts believe that the ore began to be mined and exported to the USSR in the late 1940s. In 1952, at the height of the Korean War, China took an interest in North Korea as a source of uranium for its own nuclear bomb. At that time the USSR and the PRC were working together closely in the atomic field, including its military spheres. In 1955 researchers from the North Korean Academy of Sciences addressed an international conference on the development of atomic energy in Moscow. In 1956 the USSR and DPRK concluded an agreement (which was renewed several times) on cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. In accordance with this document, scientists and experts from North Korea received instruction and training at atomic facilities in the USSR, particularly in Dubna. Pyongyang signed the same kind of agreement with the PRC. According to some reports, Korean specialists were trained in the Chinese nuclear research center in Lop Nor and were even present when nuclear weapons were tested. The Atomic Research Center, where the main nuclear projects were conducted, was established in Nenben in 1964. In 1965 the USSR supplied the DPRK with a 5-MW research nuclear reactor, which has been under IAEA control since 1977. The North Koreans began building their own reactor in Nenben in the beginning of the 1980s. This 50-MW reactor is scheduled to begin operating in 1995. It is significant that both reactors, the 5-MW and the 50-MW, are categorized as dual-purpose reactors and can be used to generate electricity and to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Israel and India used the same kind of reactors for this purpose. Experts agree that light-water reactors are preferable for civilian needs and gas-graphite reactors are the best choice for military use.[.sup]2[/] According to estimates, the research reactor began operating in the middle of the 1980s and is capable of producing 4-7 kilograms of plutonium a year. The more powerful reactor in Nenben can produce 40-60 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium each year. The gas-graphite natural-uranium reactor in T'aech'on (around 80 kilometers from Pyongyang) is capable of producing 160-200 kilograms of plutonium a year. The combined product of the three reactors would amount to around 200-260 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium a year. Before the plutonium from reactors can be used to produce nuclear weapons or in breeders, it has to be extracted from the spent fuel in special radiochemical plants. The construction of this kind of enterprise began at the end of the 1980s in Nenben. Experts have estimated that it will be capable of processing several hundred tonnes of nuclear waste a year. According to DPRK spokesmen, the plutonium regeneration enterprise is being built as part of the program for the development of breeders and is a laboratory rather than a plant. Western experts doubt Pyongyang's ability to carry out this kind of program. Only a few industrially developed countries, such as Japan, could afford the high cost of this kind of program. On 22 July 1992, IAEA Director General J. Blix said that this enterprise meets all of the criteria of a plutonium regeneration plant, and not a laboratory. According to IAEA estimates, 80 percent of the construction and 40 percent of the installation and adjustment work have already been completed. It will begin operating at full capacity within 4-5 years and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. In March 1990 North Korea reported that a gram of plutonium had been isolated from the spent fuel of the 5-MW research reactor in the regeneration plant. In connection with this, Western experts suggested that the plutonium isolation projects could have been going on for a long time, and not only in the facility in Nenben, but also in special laboratories at Pyongyang University, with its projects in experimental nuclear physics, and the so-called "hot cells" the USSR had delivered to the DPRK in the 1970s as elements of the research reactor. In addition, they did not exclude the possibility of an underground plant for the regeneration of plutonium, serving as a unique link between laboratory projects and the industrial production of plutonium. None of this answered the main question: How much weapons-grade plutonium does the DPRK have, and how close is it to a nuclear weapon of its own? Reports of intelligence services: A report of the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service had this to say: "At this time the DPRK does not have a nuclear weapon.... Available data...indicate that the widespread speculation regarding the 'breakthrough' in the DPRK's development of its own nuclear weapons is seriously doubtful. There is a gap in the technological chain the DPRK built back in the 1970s: the development of the raw material base--experimental research--the generation of fissionable material--the creation of an explosive device--tests of the device--the `perfection' of delivery vehicles--the development of a nuclear weapon. The break occurred in the plutonium generation link."[.sup]3[/] The CIA has a different opinion. According to the head of this agency, J. Woolsey, there is the real danger that North Korea has enough fissionable material to build at least one nuclear device and conceal it from the IAEA. Defense Secretary L. Aspin admitted on "Meet the Press" on 14 March 1993 that U.S. intelligence had come up with conflicting estimates of the amount of plutonium North Korea had produced and conflicting opinions as to whether it had enough to build a bomb. The intelligence data the South Korean defense minister cited when he addressed parliament on 16 March 1993 indicate that Pyongyang has the basic nuclear technology and has even tested detonators for nuclear devices. Some of the missiles in the DPRK arsenal could carry nuclear warheads and could reach any part of South Korea, and one type could even reach western Japan. At this time the DPRK is working on the SCUD-X missile.[.sup]4[/] According to a report the Japanese Foreign Ministry prepared in March 1993, the DPRK is completely capable of obtaining from 16 to 24 kilograms of plutonium--enough to build an atomic bomb. Missile delivery systems: Short-range missiles of the Frog-5 and Frog-7 categories, acquired from the USSR in the late 1950s, and updated Soviet-produced SCUD-B missiles and the North Korean SCUD-C model make up the basis of North Korea's delivery vehicle potential. The DPRK is using technology from Egypt to upgrade SCUD missiles acquired earlier from the USSR and is exporting them to countries in the Near and Middle East, thereby violating the framework set up in 1987 by the leading industrially developed countries to control the spread of missiles and missile technology. The importers of the missiles include Syria, Iraq, and Iran. According to L. Spector from the Carnegie Foundation, the DPRK and Iran concluded a special agreement on cooperation in missile engineering in 1990, and the PRC assisted the DPRK in missile development projects.[.sup]5[/] The North Korean medium-range Nodom missile with a range of around 1,000 kilometers is in the testing stage. According to the Japan Defense Agency, in May 1993 North Korea tested the Nodom-1 medium-range ballistic missile. Experts noted that the missile was close to completion and could be deployed soon. All of this has led experts to believe that the DPRK has its own missile industry, producing models which might be used as delivery vehicles for chemical weapons, and then for nuclear weapons after the necessary modifications. The Foreign Intelligence Service reports that the DPRK has encountered several objective difficulties in the development of the missile industry, primarily due to the shortage of skilled personnel, scientists, and engineers and the comparatively low technical level of industry. This is why the DPRK is actively seeking specialists abroad to attain greater success in missile engineering and turn it into a competitive branch.[.sup]6[/] The territory of the former Soviet Union has been named as one of the locations of this search. With a view to contacts of long standing, the DPRK expects the crisis in the military industry to result in a brain drain and the solicitation of export orders. Russian Security Minister V. Barannikov reported in December 1992 that his service had thwarted the attempts of more than 30 rocket scientists to cross the border in order to go to work in a third country. A more specific later report said that they were going to the DPRK.[.sup]7[/] The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a protest to the DPRK and threatened the severance of relations unless Pyongyang stopped its attempts to lure Russian scientists and specialists to the DPRK. The DPRK's airborne delivery systems are MIG-25 and MIG-29 planes it bought from the USSR. IAEA control: As mentioned above, it was not until January 1992 that a delegation from the DPRK signed an agreement on nuclear safeguards with the IAEA in Vienna. Pyongyang pledged to grant IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear facilities. This occurred more than seven years after the DPRK had become party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The main reason for this long delay was North Korea's demand for the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from the southern half of the Korean peninsula. The U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea were covered by the U.S.-USSR agreement (September 1991) on the elimination of land- and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons. In December 1991 Seoul officially announced that all American nuclear weapons had been withdrawn. That was also the time when the DPRK and the Republic of Korea signed an agreement on reconciliation, non-aggression, bilateral exchanges, and cooperation and the document declaring the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone. In 1992 there were several official announcements by the President and defense secretary of the United States that tactical nuclear weapons had been withdrawn from Asia and Europe. Independent American experts W. Arkin and R. Norris confirmed the fact that 151 nuclear weapons had been removed from South Korea. In 1992 the United States and South Korea cancelled the "Team Spirit" annual combat maneuvers as a goodwill gesture. When the DPRK was signing the agreement with the IAEA, it submitted a list of nuclear facilities and the nuclear materials in its possession. The list said that North Korea had derived several grams of plutonium from the spent fuel of an experimental reactor. Pyongyang assured the IAEA that representatives of the agency could visit any sites they wished, including installations which were not on the official list of facilities subject to inspection. In November 1992 IAEA technical experts were studying the discrepancy between the radioactive content of the small quantity of plutonium and the products of reactor waste. Although the quantity of plutonium North Korea had declared was far below the amount required to build a nuclear weapon, the discrepancy led to the understandable suspicion that the amount of plutonium produced might exceed the amount declared. The IAEA inspectors hoped to answer this question by first gaining access to the reactor core, to check how many fuel rods had been removed for the extraction of plutonium, and then visiting two suspicious facilities in Nenben. North Korean spokesmen said the reactor could not be inspected until it had been shut down, so that the rods could be removed. The agency hoped that the scheduled replacement and, consequently, the inspection might occur between April and October 1993. Meanwhile, the North Korean Government had refused the IAEA access to the suspected nuclear waste storage sites on the grounds that these were military installations and that they had no connection to the nuclear program. The North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the heads of the IAEA had no right to use U.S. intelligence information as grounds for a so-called "special inspection," presupposing the inspection of non-nuclear facilities. The IAEA stood its ground and warned the DPRK that the matter would be discussed by the IAEA Board of Governors, which passed a resolution on 25 February 1993, requesting the DPRK to grant IAEA inspectors access to the suspicious facilities within a month. The arguments between the DPRK and IAEA reached their peak when the United States and South Korea resumed the annual "Team Spirit" maneuvers. It was then that Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. A DPRK Foreign Ministry note of 15 March stressed that the discrepancy between official information and the results of agency measurements was the product of the IAEA Secretariat's fabrications. The DPRK protested the 25 February resolution on the "special inspection" and said it was withdrawing from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in defense of its own sovereignty. At a special meeting on 18 March 1993 the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution expressing concern over the DPRK's announced withdrawal from the treaty, stressing that the agreement on safeguards with the DPRK was still in force, and requesting the DPRK to reconsider its decision and help the agency clear up the inconsistencies the inspections had revealed. This was the main topic of discussion at another meeting of the board on 31 March 1993. Experts have said that it is of fundamental importance for the IAEA to learn the truth about the DPRK's nuclear program. After the IAEA failed to detect Iraq's nuclear weapons program before the war in the Persian Gulf, it became the target of harsh criticism and its effectiveness was in doubt. In the case of the DPRK, the agency intended to do its job thoroughly, and if North Korea were to refuse inspections in the three months remaining before the expiration of its treaty membership, the IAEA was prepared to turn the matter over to the UN Security Council. Possible Motives Experts and specialists have three explanations for the DPRK's decision to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The first explanation essentially says that Pyongyang wants to continue working on the military atomic program it adopted in the 1970s without being bound by political commitments or feeling the need to conceal its nuclear preparations from the IAEA. In this case, the decision to deny the inspectors access to the suspect facilities and prevent the determination of the precise quantity of plutonium produced seems completely logical. After the lessons the IAEA had learned from the inspections of nuclear installations in Iraq, when the latter had managed to conceal the degree and scales of its progress in the development of nuclear weapons, Pyongyang could hardly expect to fool the agency experts for long. Eventually, sooner or later, the IAEA would discover the military atomic program, and then the Security Council would take the same measures it had taken in the case of Iraq. These denuclearization measures still do not apply to countries which are not party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and do have secret military nuclear programs, such as Israel, India, and Pakistan. That meant that it was politically more convenient for a country striving to develop a nuclear weapon not to be a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. What lay behind the decision to create atomic potential? When American nuclear weapons had been deployed in South Korea and American military and political leaders had implied several times during the cold war that they were prepared to launch them at the first sign of hostilities between North and South Korea, the DPRK's motives had been unequivocal--it wanted to neutralize the nuclear threat from the south with its own weapons. The main motive for the development of nuclear weapons disappeared, however, after the removal of the American weapons from the peninsula. In spite of this, experts have noted that military and political factors are still influencing the DPRK's choice in favor of nuclear weapons. After Russia's denunciation of the treaty on friendship and mutual assistance with the DPRK in 1992, accompanied by its development of political and economic relations with the Republic of Korea, and after the PRC had recognized the Republic of Korea, self-reliance, including reliance on its own potential nuclear strength, acquired decisive significance. At a time when the north was clearly losing the economic competition, people in Pyongyang may have believed that atomic potential could become the main political instrument and means of leverage in bilateral relations with Seoul. They probably expected the development of weapons of mass destruction to confer greater stability on the regime of Kim Il-song and his dynasty in the country. In addition to all of this, as long as nuclear weapons are a symbol of military and political might, they will be a cherished dream of states hoping to play a prominent role in their own regions and in international affairs. This applies not only to the DPRK, but also to Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya, not to mention such de facto nuclear states as Israel, India, and Pakistan. All kinds of surprises can be expected from these states--from the secret development of atomic potential to open withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This has been pointed out repeatedly by prominent experts in the United States and in Russia.[.sup]8[/] The second explanation is that the DPRK wants to gain maximum advantage from a promise to give up its advanced nuclear arms program in exchange for military, political, and economic dividends in its relations with South Korea, the United States, and Japan. People in Pyongyang might believe that these states will pay a higher price for access to the DPRK's atomic facilities than the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the southern half of the Korean peninsula. Pursuant to the declaration of the nuclear-free zone, the DPRK and the Republic of Korea established a joint commission for nuclear verification. It was supposed to define the scales and principles of bilateral inspections. The commission met several times in 1992, but its work reached an impasse when the two sides could not reconcile their differences of opinion: South Korea, with its diversified atomic industry, including 10 nuclear power plants which have been covered by IAEA safeguards since 1975, proposed an equal number of inspections of atomic facilities and other military installations; the DPRK said the facilities in Nenben could be inspected in exchange for access to all American bases in South Korea, to verify the absence of nuclear weapons there. North Korea continued to allege that there were nuclear weapons in the south of the peninsula, despite South Korean President Roh Tae Woo's statement about the lack of those weapons in the country, and asserted that nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear weapons on board were still sailing into the American submarine base in Chinju. The South Korean representatives responded by denying the existence of nuclear weapons and military bases for nuclear submarines on their territory and said that Seoul would agree to mutual inspections of installations, but the demand for unilateral inspections of the South Korean military bases was unacceptable. Some experts feel that Pyongyang might decide to return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty if it gets firm guarantees of the absence of nuclear weapons on American bases and of the withdrawal of all American troops (36,000 men) from the territory of South Korea. The idea of turning the Korean peninsula into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weapons, could contribute to the security of the peninsula. This opinion was expressed by Russian President B. Yeltsin in the South Korean National Assembly in November 1992. The only question concerns the means of accomplishing this. The resumption of the "Team Spirit" maneuvers had an indisputably negative effect on the North-South dialogue on nuclear verification issues. The United States' declared willingness to reduce its military presence on the Korean peninsula dramatically by the year 2000, however, could be a step in the right direction. It is precisely the American military presence and the security of the DPRK that could be used, according to some experts, as bargaining chips to encourage the DPRK to return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The third explanation combines elements of the first and second. On the one hand, Pyongyang may have decided that withdrawal from the treaty would give it more freedom to pursue its nuclear preparations and, on the other, the further it progresses in the development of weapons of mass destruction, the higher price it can charge for its return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Furthermore, it is even possible that Pyongyang has chosen the extremely risky course of openly declaring itself a nuclear state at some time in the future, so that it can negotiate security issues on the Korean peninsula on a fundamentally new level and demand the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops in exchange for the renunciation of its nuclear status. Today it is difficult to judge which of these explanations is an accurate description of the motives behind the DPRK's decision to withdraw from the treaty. International Reaction The overwhelming majority of countries in the world, both industrially developed states and developing countries, expressed serious misgivings about the DPRK's announcement. The United States: At a press conference on 16 March this year, President B. Clinton expressed the "deep concern" of the United States, and the hope that Pyongyang would reconsider its decision during the 90 days between the announcement and the date the decision would go into effect. Observers noted the subdued nature of the U.S. reaction. When Secretary of State W. Christopher addressed the House Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs on 25 March, he said: "The United States is still working with the IAEA, the United Nations, and the Asian countries to persuade North Korea not to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its inspection framework. There is still time for this work to produce results. We feel that sanctions against North Korea might be effective. If we reach the point of UN actions against North Korea, there will be several ways of exerting pressure.... We do not want to reach that point, however, and we hope that North Korea will acknowledge its error." Meanwhile, U.S. military and political leaders were suggesting that if the DPRK did not change its mind, it might be advisable to consider launching a "limited strike" at its nuclear installations. In particular, Congressman J. Murtha suggested this. Commentators said, however, that this could start a war on the Korean peninsula. The Clinton administration does not want this to happen. Russia: Russian Foreign Ministry spokesmen described the DPRK's decision as an unprecedented, disturbing, and dangerous move and expressed the hope that North Korea would change its mind. A special meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors was convened at Russia's suggestion. The idea of convening a special conference of five states--North and South Korea, the United States, the PRC, and Russia--was discussed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Commentators have noted, however, that Russia has had no major way of influencing the DPRK after the almost complete cessation of shipments of Russian raw materials and arms to North Korea. The PRC: As an ally of the DPRK, Beijing did not express its opinion, and it did not confirm its role as a mediator in the DPRK's relations with the United States. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did stress, however, its support for a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula. Japan: On 19 March 1993 Prime Minister K. Miyazawa expressed deep regret over the DPRK's announcement, but he asked the international community to give Pyongyang a chance to reconsider its decision before taking any measures against the DPRK. Japanese Defense Minister M. Sukuma said that the chance of war on the Korean peninsula was slim, although it could not be called non-existent. Tokyo implied that economic aid to the DPRK would be out of the question until the nuclear issue had been settled. According to reports in newspapers, Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea agreed to submit the "Korean question" to the Security Council for consideration unless the DPRK changed its mind. Republic of Korea: Seoul had the most frightened reaction. It asked the countries of the world to exert pressure on Pyongyang. South Korea put the 650,000 personnel in its armed forces (the DPRK has 1.1 million) on red alert. According to reports in the press, Seoul planned to ask Washington not to withdraw the 14,000 American soldiers participating in the "Team Spirit" maneuvers, its B-1B bombers, and the Patriot air defense systems from the country and to keep the aircraft carrier Independence near the Korean coastline. Seoul warned that it would refuse to finance economic cooperation with Pyongyang if the latter did not change its mind. Expenditures on cooperation were supposed to amount to 1.2 billion dollars in 1995, as compared to 126 million in 1992. Implications: The DPRK's decision could have far-reaching negative implications for the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It could set a dangerous precedent, and North Korea's example could be followed by the states that have been irritated by IAEA inspections for a long time because they complicate secret projects in the nuclear sphere. Experts have included Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya among the future "deserters." This could reinforce the reluctance of several "threshold" countries, such as Brazil and Argentina, to become party to the treaty, and it could strengthen the determination of such countries as Israel, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan to stay outside the non-proliferation framework. If the DPRK continues to follow the nuclear path and acquires nuclear weapons of its own, this event, experts agree, could have the most dramatic implications for the non-proliferation framework. In this case, South Korea will have to reconsider its attitude toward nuclear weapons and might decide to develop them, particularly in view of the fact that it has the industrial base for this. If an arms race starts on the Korean peninsula, Japan is unlikely to stay out of it, and it might have to begin the agonizing reassessment of its own traditional non-nuclear stance. Experts believe that Japan could have its own nuclear weapon within a year after this decision has been made. This would have global implications. Other Asian countries, especially Taiwan, are also likely to join the race. Experts have pointed out the fact that the DPRK is already capable of exporting technology and materials to other states in violation of the nuclear non-proliferation framework. This capability will grow stronger with time. Developments: After the DPRK refused to allow the inspection of the suspicious facilities, the IAEA asked the UN Security Council for help. The council met behind closed doors on 12 May. The press reported that two definite points of view were expressed during the discussion of this issue. The supporters of the first (the United States and other Western countries) insisted on severe economic sanctions against the DPRK for its refusal to allow the IAEA inspection and its decision to withdraw from the treaty. The advocates of the second (the PRC and Pakistan) took a more neutral stance by proposing a resolution requesting the DPRK to reconsider its decision and return to the treaty ranks. The result was a comparatively mild resolution, simply mentioning that the Security Council would consider taking concrete and severe measures if the DPRK did not comply with the request to return to the treaty. It was passed by 13 votes, with two abstentions (China and Pakistan), and it requested North Korea's observance of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Paradoxically, the failure of the Security Council to approve economic sanctions against the DPRK could be of great benefit to the prestige and the future of the non-proliferation framework. A resolution on economic sanctions might have compromised the treaty itself and invalidated Article 10, acknowledging the right of parties to withdraw from the treaty. In this case, the treaty would have lost one of its fundamental principles--the principle of voluntary membership. Instead of remaining a free association, it might have turned into a compulsory union, which is certain to have undermined its prestige. The very fact that this problem arose is an indication that the mere existence of the treaty is not enough to guarantee the actual non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United Nations has to have a stronger role in enforcing the treaty. This can only be done if the Security Council adopts a special declaration on non-proliferation, stipulating possible responses to similar problems in the future, whether they involve withdrawal from the treaty or the open declaration of nuclear status. The five permanent members of the Security Council should begin drafting a declaration obligating the nuclear states to eliminate their arsenals, and the non-nuclear states to never create them. This declaration could be the deciding factor in the reinforcement of the non-proliferation framework. During the discussion in the Security Council, the DPRK complained to the United States that Washington was continuing to deploy nuclear weapons in South Korea and that the discussion of nuclear issues could only be continued within the framework of bilateral talks with the United States. The American representative to the United Nations said that Washington was willing to conduct these negotiations and stressed that the United States had no intention of attacking North Korea and did not have any nuclear weapons in South Korea. The apparent possibility of breaking the deadlock was realized in bilateral American-North Korean talks in New York and Geneva (June-July). The first round resulted in the publication of a joint statement, which said that the DPRK was rescinding its announced withdrawal from the treaty. This certainly can be viewed as a victory in the struggle to uphold the authority and prestige of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is too early, however, to say that the crisis has been surmounted, because the DPRK is still insisting that IAEA inspectors will not be allowed access to the suspect facilities. Prospects: At this time it is difficult for experts to guess how the crisis will end. On the one hand, Pyongyang's political ambitions and the scales and progress of its nuclear program indicate an obvious desire to acquire nuclear weapons of its own. On the other, the fact that all five permanent members of the UN Security Council are party to the treaty, and that they acknowledged the need for a consistent fight against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in January 1992, suggests that the crisis might be resolved through joint efforts, especially now that the overwhelming majority of industrially developed and developing non-nuclear countries share the "big five's" insistence on the need to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its framework. Experts believe that the international community is facing its first test since the war in the Persian Gulf, and only time will tell how it will end. FOOTNOTES 1. IZVESTIYA, 6 April 1993. 2. L.
