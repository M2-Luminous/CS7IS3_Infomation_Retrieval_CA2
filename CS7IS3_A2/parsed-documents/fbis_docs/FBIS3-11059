Jorge Arturo Luna, a leader of the Independent Peasants Central Organization [CCI], reported that the peasant demand for greater participation in agricultural issues should be reinforced with enhanced grain crop yield and land tenure protection controls. Therefore, they say, Article 27 of the Constitution should be reformed. They added that Article 4 should also be changed to give Indian communities more rights and greater recognition of their worth and political participation nationwide. The peasant organizations announced that another national meeting will be held on 22 March in Mexico City. Agricultural and Indian organizations from all over the country will participate in this meeting. The important thing now, though, is that the Catholic Church is said to be justifying the recent land invasions. We spoke with Father Joel Padron, parish priest of Simon Jovel, which is a community about three and one half hours away from San Cristobal de Las Casas. It is noteworthy that Fr. Joel Padron said that the hunger, poverty, and destitution among Indians and peasants is high and explained that this is why they are seeking some way to support their families. He added that the church has no part in the issue of land invasion or the armed movement of last January. He went on to say that the church is not to blame for the hunger and, especially, for the deaths of thousands of children, or for the indigence of thousands of Indians. Joel Padron also said that the church must also change is attitude, because it -- along with the political parties -- has been left behind by society in general and by a community that has organized itself to struggle in defense of its rights. [Begin Padron recording] The civilian population is awakening with the events in Chiapas and claiming its rightful place. I believe the political parties must feel left behind by the civilian society. They have new challenges at every turn. How can they offer these discontented groups, who have been rejected for so long any truly dependable solutions? How can they respond to the civilian population? The community is capable of making a more constructive contribution to the peace process. I believe the civilian population, as such, which goes beyond any political party, does not respond to any specific group interest or any political interest. It is more interested in creating a new Mexico. [end recording] He said that a new Chiapas should rise from the movement that began in January. It should become a new state where justice is pure; deprivation is left behind; peasants are given their rights, especially their right to speak out, because they were never allowed to do so. Joel Padron added that one guarantee that must be secured in order to attain peace in this state is that the community in general be allowed to participate in the peace process. The church cannot remove itself from this process and must become a true promoter of peace, and never extricate itself. He responded to those critics who are calling for Monsignor Samuel Ruiz and himself to resign. Those demanding this are mistaken, because the church does not promote violence. Violence has appeared because of the hunger and poverty of thousands of people who are seeking some way to support their families.
