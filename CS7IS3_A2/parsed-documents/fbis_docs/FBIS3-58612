The socialist president condemned Balladur's "unfortunate initiative" in rushing a bill through the senate that granted unlimited use of public funds to the country's private, mainly Catholic, schools. In an interview with the socialist weekly VENDREDI, Mitterrand said the state education system felt unfairly treated and that he "understood" the anger of teachers and parents. Teachers unions and parents associations as well as left-wing organisations are planning a big demonstration against the new legislation on Sunday and hope to draw 300,000 people on to the Paris boulevards.
