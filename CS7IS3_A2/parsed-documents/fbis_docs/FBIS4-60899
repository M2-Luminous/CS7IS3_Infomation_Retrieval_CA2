From now on it will become our flag-carrier, a status set forth in the government decree "On Approving the Charter of the "Aeroflot -- Russian International Airlines" Joint-Stock Company." While vesting Aeroflot with the right to represent the country's interests on the world air-travel market, the government is at the same time tightening state control over its activity. The "Aeroflot -- Russian International Airlines" Joint-Stock Company was set up following the reorganization of the "Aeroflot -- Soviet Airlines" commercial association, the Central International Civil Aviation Air Traffic Administration, the International Commercial Civil Aviation Administration, the Sheremetyevo Technical Aviation Enterprise, the International Payments Center, and the "Rossiya" Interregional Agency of International Air Services. According to the charter, Sheremetyevo international airport and the Moscow Airlines company will be separated from Aeroflot to become independent state-owned firms. The authorized capital of the newly created open-end joint-stock company is 2,186,394,000 rubles. Before privatization begins, however, all Aeroflot stock will be kept in federal ownership and will not be offered for sale until the government so authorizes. The documents envision the possibility of selling 49 percent of the stock to the airline's workers, but the period of denationalization is not specified: the White House has not yet worked out a clear stance on the subject. Dividends accrued on shares remaining in federal ownership must be paid exclusively to the joint-stock company for three years, to be spent on aviation technology and equipment purchases. According to the concept devised by government experts, apart from "protecting economic and other (which? -- KOMMERSANT-DAILY) interests" of Russia, Aeroflot's objective is to make profits not only by "meeting requirements for international and domestic air travel," but also by providing other services. By so doing the government gives in advance the go-ahead to any commercial activity by the leading airline. This makes sense. Aeroflot is the sole Russian company that can boast long years of operation on a highly competitive world market. Such experience cannot be acquired by sitting in government offices. Aeroflot's competitiveness has not been dented by the emergence of other Russian airlines on the international market. This was confirmed, for instance, by the fact that Aeroflot was among two airlines operating international services that ended last year with a profit (over 200 billion rubles), the other one being British Airways, which earned around $100 million. The government, however, thought it necessary to tighten control over the activity of the enterprise. This will be achieved primarily by changing the form of management. The status of a joint-stock company calls for a board of directors (seven people), whose chairman and members are appointed by the government. The government will therefore be able to control the entire day-to-day financial activity of a profitable company. thus creating conditions for raising federal budget revenues from its operations. This is why Aeroflot, of course, will be in a privileged position when obtaining air-travel licenses. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that state protection will affect Aeroflot's pricing policy of setting the prices of its services too high by comparison with their quality.
