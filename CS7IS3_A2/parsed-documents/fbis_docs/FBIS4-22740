Demchenko, administrative head of Derzhsilhosprod, by B. Polishchuk, correspondent: "How Will We Sow the Fields With Spring Seeds?"] [Text] [Polishchuk] Borys Veniaminovych, what's the situation now with regard to developments on the spring fields? [Demchenko] It is a complex matter. In connection with the fact that last autumn considerable areas were not plowed due to a lack of fuel, as well as shortfalls and spillages of winter wheat from freight cars for technical reasons, we must increase the sowing by a factor of 1.5 at a minimum. [Polishchuk] How many hectares, in particular, must be resown in winter wheat? [Demchenko] Approximately 2,600,000 hectares. That includes areas which were insufficiently sown last autumn. [Polishchuk] What's the situation with regard to seeds? [Demchenko] In my opinion, we will have no problems with regard to seeds for the spring sowing. We need 2 million tonnes of them; the farms already have 1,788,000 tonnes; and approximately 300,000 tonnes of such seeds will be released from the state reserves. [Polishchuk] But the farms are entering upon the springtime period with empty cash-boxes. [Demchenko] We have taken that into account, and several variant solutions have been proposed. If the grain-products system owes a particular farm money for grain that the latter sold to it last year, such a farm will be able to obtain seeds by way of a mutually agreed-upon procedure. Provisions have been made to loan seeds at a certain interest rate, payable after the crop has been harvested. And if a particular farm has money of its own, it can simply buy seeds. [Polishchuk] But what about prices? Won't it be the case that a farm sold a tonne of wheat last year for 500,000 krb [karbovantsy], but now it will have to pay triple that amount for an equivalent number of seeds? [Demchenko] The prices are tolerable. A tonne of seeds for spring crops will have a price ranging from 1.5 to 2 million krb. [Polishchuk] And what about corn seeds? Because, of course, a great deal of land will also be planted in this crop. [Demchenko] It was planned to sow 1.5 million hectares in this grain crop. But it is now clear from all the evidence in connection with the spillage losses of winter wheat that we will have to sow 1.8 million hectares in corn--that plus 3 million hectares for silage. Therefore, there will be a total of 4.8 million hectares sown in corn. With regard to seeds there is--so to speak--good news and bad news. As a whole, there are enough corn seeds in Ukraine. We need 120,000 tonnes of them, and the state reserves contain 125,000 tonnes. It is stored and can be delivered to various sites in accordance with the following procedure: Whoever has the means to buy corn seeds can do so. For example, more than 10,000 tonnes from the Cherkassy region and 7,500 tonnes from the Vinnitsa region. The terms of agreement are the same as for the spring-wheat seeds: sales, mutually agreed upon considerations, or loans. Agreement has been reached with the railroads about providing freight cars. [Polishchuk] But why did you say that there is also some "bad news"? [Demchenko] There are two things that I'm afraid of. First, that we may not collect these seeds rapidly enough. Spring is already knocking on our door. And second: that a great deal of harm may be done to us by a kind of selfish provincialism. This already happened last year, when certain farmers sold to foreign countries a portion of the corn seeds which had been distributed to them by our state. At present corn seeds are primarily located in seven oblasts. Let me repeat that there are enough of them for all Ukraine. But some persons may be tempted again by the lure of easy money, even though here in our country the price of a tonne of corn seed is really quite decent--ranging from 15 to 18 million krb. We must clearly inform people as follows: Ukraine anticipates a difficult year in agriculture and in the economy as a whole; it would be a sin to complicate matters even more than they already are.
