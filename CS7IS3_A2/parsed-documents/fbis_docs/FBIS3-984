[passage omitted] Still on the legislative elections, here is a clarification by the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]: The UTD Steering Committee expresses satisfaction with the proclamation of the results of the 6 and 20 February legislative elections by the Supreme Court. The UTD lauds this proclamation which in itself constitutes a new victory for the democratic opposition. It congratulates and thanks the Togolese people for their courage and their determination. Through their unequivocal vote, they opted for change. Contrary to the AFP dispatch which appeared on 15 March 1994 and was signed by Francis Ahouadi, the UTD is and remains a party that belongs to the democratic opposition. The UTD has, under no circumstance, sold off the victory of the Togolese people in the February legislative elections through any alliance with the forces that it has fought up until this point. However, the UTD wishes to make the following clarification: Before the proclamation of the results, it held informal discussions with the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR]. During the discussions, several proposals were examined by both sides. All the same, before any agreement is reached, the CAR contacted the presidential side to suggest to it a broad alliance within which the post of speaker of the national assembly will come to the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT]. But with the refusal of the RPT to negotiate with its party and working around the UTD national chairman, the CAR chairman, in a second move, suggested the post of the speaker of the National Assembly to the UTD secretary general who declined the offer. The CAR later refused the alternative proposition for settlement made by the UTD. In light of all this, the UTD was forced to assert its specificity and demonstrated its determination to place itself above the fray. The UTD is ready, in accordance with all the components of the new majority in the elections, to assume all its responsibilities concerning the future of the country. This country is faced with serious political, economic, and social challenges and which it must meet. This demands that the UTD be treated with respect and dignity in its discussions with the CAR. Also consensus must be sought in the fundamental decisions concerning, particularly, the government of the country. For the UTD, it is very important that the victory of the people be absolutely preserved and administered within an atmosphere of indispensable harmony. [Signed] Edem Kodjo, for the Steering Committee.
