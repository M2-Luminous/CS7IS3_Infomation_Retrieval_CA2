The Western community thus demonstrates that it is not prepared to accept the "Bosnian Serbs' continual violations of international law," Kinkel said in Bonn today. At the same time, the Western community said it was not prepared to accept developments like those in Gorazde in other parts of Bosnia. It is necessary, "alongside the military measures," to get the negotiating process into motion again, said Kinkel. The United Nations, the European Union, the United States, and Russia were jointly called upon to take a fresh initiative to get the warring parties to the negotiating table.
