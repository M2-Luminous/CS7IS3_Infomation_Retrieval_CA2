You have to be General Morillon to give such a title -- at a time of such disillusionment -- to a book about the war in Bosnia. But, although he is seeking to bring a message of hope, particularly to the younger generations who may be tempted to believe that the world has gone mad in the former Yugoslavia, the former commander of UN peacekeeping operations in Bosnia qualifies these words six months after his departure from Sarajevo. "Today, I would be inclined to say `dare to believe' as this is something which is becoming increasingly difficult to do," admits Philippe Morillon in an interview granted to LA LIBRE BELGIQUE. "I refuse to despair. I want to believe that peace is still possible, that the ethnic divisions are not so deep as to prevent a return to community life in the future. In the field, in any case, our men believe in this because they see the usefulness of what they are doing. But they need the full backing of public opinion; if ever doubt takes hold, then we must pull them out." Reply And Retaliation Such doubt could stem from what General Morillon refers to as "a misunderstanding, or lack of understanding," among the general public and also on the part of certain politicians "to whom we have not sufficiently explained exactly what the military is calling for in Bosnia." "We need a sufficient reply capability, which should not be confused with a retaliation capability which we are not asking for. It is a question of guaranteeing legitimate defense and to do that air power is essential. It is the only way of replying to artillery attacks with the necessary precision as the batteries which must be taken out are often located behind civilian shields -- hospitals and schools, etc. -- which must not be touched. An armed plane or helicopter can fulfill this mission as was shown in the Gulf War. Also, this force would also have a deterrent value. People may be brave, they are not necessarily reckless." The Somali Trap "The one thing we must avoid," continues Philippe Morillon, "is to confuse intervention and humanitarian aid as we did in Somalia. That is a mistake, a disastrous confusion of different kinds of activity. Our task is to see that humanitarian aid gets through, without which no survival is possible -- at least during winter -- and we must not fall into the trap of those who claim that by providing this aid we are simply prolonging the war. And if we have chosen not to intervene -- that is not to side with any of the belligerent parties -- it is because we believe the remedy would be worse than the disease, that we would be serving to deepen the divide between the communities." There Is Still Time General Morillon believes that "it is not too late to stop the ethnic cleansing, but the situation gets worse by the day, due to the continuing destruction which deepens the divide, and people being exiled. This is an absolute necessity. We must, for example, oppose the creation of a Muslim state in the heart of Bosnia because that would give a doomed hope to Muslim fundamentalism and create a Gaza Strip in Europe. This is why the Western objective is to reestablish a multicultural democracy in the former Yugoslavia." Despite the protracted Bosnian conflict, Philippe Morillon wants to believe that this objective can still be met but, he stresses: "We must be careful not to become impatient. The new international order cannot be established overnight. This country will escape from its present drama when its citizens have understood that they must no longer allow themselves to be led to collective suicide by a handful of extremists who hold power. I believe that if free elections were held in Bosnia today, the extremists would be driven from office. Failing this, we must give notice to all the protagonists to act in accordance with the desire for peace they profess." Stop the Hypocrisy In the meantime, concludes the hero of Srebrenica, "countries must stop the hypocrisy of refusing to grant the United Nations the necessary resources to implement the missions they confer upon it. Countries which do not even pay their debts with respect to an international organization which -- in any event -- we simply cannot do without."
