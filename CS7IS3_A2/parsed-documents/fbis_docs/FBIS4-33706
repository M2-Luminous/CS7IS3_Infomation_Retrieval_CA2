In a homily against the government, it demanded that society be allowed to participate in the drafting and application of laws to change the country. In a homily to celebrate Corpus Christi, La Paz Archbishop Luis Sainz Hinojosa said: "A better distribution of wealth, a real opening to allow the participation of society, and the drafting of a modern education system requires the participation of all Bolivians." President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, who attended mass accompanied by their wives and ministers of state, listened carefully to the Archbishop's homily. From the pulpit, Sainz Hinojosa faced the highest Bolivian authorities. He did not miss the opportunity to ask the government to focus its attention on "improving salaries and job opportunities, and thus improving the living standards of the Bolivian people." He reiterated the demands of the Bolivian Episcopal Conference Education Commission, whose main representative protested because the National Education Council (Coned) drafted alterations to the Education Reform Framework law. Referring to the amendment -- which was made without any consultation -- to the framework law that was submitted to Congress for approval, Sainz stated: "The Education Reform, which will change the education of our people, is a national priority and a social responsibility that needs the unselfish participation of all." The points about making municipalities responsible for the education service, eliminating teachers schools, and the drafting of an ideological and political framework for the education system are the most controversial points confronting the government and the involved sectors that are against them. Aware of the problems affecting Bolivian society, the La Paz archbishop urged Bolivians to reconcile their viewpoint in favor of the unity of the country, which is affected by a serious economic crisis. As he stared at the government officials praying before the alter, Sainz said: "The Body of Christ invites us to be united, to cooperate, to wholeheartedly serve our people who must be rescued from so much slavery, so many sins, and so much corruption."
