Gonzalez thus denied that the government could accede to the People's Party's desire to renew the RTVE board of directors in return for the People's Party's allowing the filling of vacancies in the judiciary body -- the General Council of the Judiciary [CGPJ] -- and that of the ombudsman. On the course of the above-mentioned negotiations, the prime minister said during his joint appearance with Argentine President Carlos Menem: "I am interested in an agreement, and since I am interested, I wish to create no declarative obstacle or obstructive declaration, so I will be cautious. I believe that the filling of posts in bodies such as the CGPJ or that of the ombudsman is not interchangeable with the discussion on how Spanish Television should operate. I am also prepared to change radically the RTVE charter, and for there to be a completely different board of directors. So I am completely open to negotiation, but it seems to me that the need to fill the vacancies in the judiciary bodies or that of the ombudsman cannot be lumped together with it." New Executive Committee In government circles it is asserted that the government is prepared to accept that the RTVE parliamentary oversight committee must confirm the appointment of the public corporation's director general, who is appointed by the government itself. In addition, Gonzalez also gave a new clue to his ideas on the future PSOE leadership, in asserting that the current incompatibilities, which now limit -- and more so, if many of the amendments put forward for debate at the party congress succeed -- the prospects of, among others, the members of the government and regional leaders attaining the Executive Committee group, should be annulled. "I believe," he stated, "that the incompatibilities should be those laid down by the law on a general basis for all citizens, and, within the parties' functioning, the minimum ones in order to ensure that they are observed. Therefore, I would abolish even the incompatibility which exists right now between holding public office and the so-called area secretaries in the Executive Committee (or between a regional organizational post and a national organizational post)." With respect to the existence or otherwise of profound differences between Guerraists and renewalists, with a view to the federal congress, Gonzalez denied "that there are major ideological differences. Ideologically distant stances are sometimes sought because there are personal disagreements, which are wrapped up with ideas." "But I believe," he added, "that there are no major ideological differences. There is a lively debate on some aspects which are very specific, such as the welfare state in a modern society or the role played by enterprises' competitiveness. I claim," he stated, "the right to be able to promote enterprises' competitiveness from a progressive stance, and for that to be introduced absolutely naturally and smoothly into social democratic language, since it must be modernized." With respect to the High Court of Justice of Catalonia's ruling on the use of Catalan in education, the prime minister said that he respects it. "I believe," he added, "that it will pose no especially delicate problem, either of relations (with Convergence and Union) or, of course, of implementation. It is certainly a ruling which everybody will be prepared to implement."
