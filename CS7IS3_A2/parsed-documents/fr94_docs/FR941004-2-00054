FR941004-2-00054 FR941004-2-00030 6. PetroCorp Incorporated [Docket No. CP94&hyph;804&hyph;000] Take notice that on September 26, 1994, PetroCorp Incorporated (PetroCorp), 16800 Greenspoint Park Drive, Suite 300, North Atrium, Houston, Texas 77060&hyph;2391, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94&hyph;804&hyph;000, requesting that the Commission declare that facilities to be constructed in Montezuma County, Colorado to be called the Anasazi Gathering System (Anasazi) would have the primary function of gathering natural gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. PetroCorp states that it and other operators have discovered a new gas producing area in the Paradox Basin, Montezuma County, Colorado. PetroCorp indicates that it has proposed the construction of a gathering system from three existing wells in this area, plus other wells which are expected to be drilled, to connect with the gathering system of Western Gas Resources, Inc. (Western) in San Juan County, New Mexico. It is stated that the gas would be transported through Western's system to connect with the transmission facilities of El Paso Natural Gas Company. In support of its request, PetroCorp points out how the facilities meet the primary function test set out in Farmland Industries, Inc., 23 FERC Â¶ 61,063 (1983), as later modified. Length and Diameter of the Line PetroCorp points out that the Anasazi Gathering System will consist of 22.2 miles of 41/2 inch pipe. It is also indicated that, as additional wells are completed, additional lateral 41/2 inch pipelines will be built. Central Point in the Field and Geographic Configuration PetroCorp states that the boundaries of the field are not yet defined. PetroCorp indicates that it plans to build a trunkline or spine across the producing area, constructing lateral pipelines as necessary to connect new producing wells as they are drilled. PetroCorp states that the field has no central point, but is configured similarly to the system in Amerada Hess Corporation, Docket No. CP91&hyph;1314&hyph;003, which it indicates the Commission determined to be gathering in an order issued on May 27, 1994. Location of Compressors and Processing Plants PetroCorp states that temporary portable compressor facilities will be installed at each well until the total number of wells to be served by the system is determined. It is indicated that at that time an appropriate permanent compression unit would be located on the gathering system at an appropriate downstream point. PetroCorp states that no processing plant is contemplated. PetroCorp points out, however, that, if sufficient liquid and liquefiable hydrocarbons are contained in the gas stream to make their extraction economically attractive, a processing plant may be constructed at a downstream point. Location of Wells and Operating Pressure of the Line PetroCorp states that a number of wells are located along the proposed spine. It is also indicated that the operating pressure of the proposed system will be approximately 100 psig at the wellhead and approximately 400 psig at the delivery point to Western. Comment date: October 18, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
