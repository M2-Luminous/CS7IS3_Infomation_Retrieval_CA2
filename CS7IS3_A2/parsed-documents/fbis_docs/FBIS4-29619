City That Fulfills Wishes Chief executive officers (CEO) from General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler hosted the party. On the list of invitees were leading representatives and senators from Congress and other influential figures in Washington. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was also present at the party. The AAMA held the party to declare to officials of the U.S. Government and members of Congress that it has moved its headquarters from Detroit, the automobile city, to Washington, a city of politics. Last October, the AAMA appointed as managing director Andrew Card, who is well versed in the Washington situation and served as secretary of transportation in the Bush administration, and decided to move its headquarters to Washington. The AAMA has wielded great influence on the U.S. trade policy toward Japan by vigorously lobbying the administration and Congress for Japan's voluntary restraint on automobile exports to the United States. The AAMA had a reason to move its headquarters to Washington. An American lobbyist has pointed out that "Motorola has succeed in prying open the Japanese carphone market through collusive ties with the administration, and the way Motorola has pried open the Japanese carphone market has become a model for other American corporations." When the AAMA decided to move its headquarters to Washington, Harold Poling, former chairman of Ford Motor Company, said, "Things that matter to us will be decided in Washington." The AAMA is trying to learn how Motorola has successfully pried open the Japanese carphone market and, according to concerned American officials in Washington, the major points of the strategy Motorola adopted to crack the Japanese market are as follows: First, Motorola gains access to a certain foreign market it targets. Then it widely sells its competitiveness and technological capability and lead while surveying the ideosyncrasies of the foreign market. Motorola wages alternatively a negative campaign to taint the image of the foreign market and a positive campaign to sell its own image, as seen in the American presidential elections. Second, Motorola sends its officials to key posts in the administration who are charged with handling trade negotiations and policies. Incumbent President Christopher Garbing [name as published] of Motorola is a member on the USTR Advisory Committee on Investment Policy. Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Ira Wolf had worked for Japan Motorola until just before taking his present post with the USTR. Spurred by the Clinton administration's policies to bolster the competitiveness of American industry and promote exports of American products, many American industries are already showing their intention to embrace the strategy that has generated positive trade results in the semiconductor and carphone areas. Japan, A Nation of Hope A Japanese company employee in Washington has revealed his sense of crisis, saying: "Recently, top executives from AT&T, MCI and other American telecommunications companies have frequently visited the office of Vice President Gore. Their visits to the vice president's office may sow the seeds of future trade friction between Japan and the United States." In the United States, long- distance telephone companies are suffering a drop in profits because of the fierce price competition among them. Long-distance phone companies are lagging behing local ones CATV [cable TV] business, which is considered the backbone of information in the multimedia age. They see as a new frontier the market in Japan, which has begun moving toward relaxing bureaucratic regulations. There is a high possibility they will use the Motorola strategy as a model for charting their own strategies to pry open the Japanese market. Mark Holland [name as published], author of the book "Top Management Goes To Washington," has written in the NEW YORK TIMES that "the Clinton administration's intervention in economic matters means that all American businesses can reap profits in Washington." With the Clinton administration trying to embrace trade requests from American businesses and the advent of American companies trying to learn from the Motorola strategy to crack the Japanese market, American corporations have further consolidated their preparedness to pry open foreign markets. Tsuneharu Takeda, chief of the Washington Office of Itochu International, has pointed out: "During the Cold War era, the United States tolerated Japan's rejection of its trade demands out of security considerations. The Clinton administration, which was inaugurated on a platform of revitalizing the American economy, has no intention of tolerating Japan's rejection." President Clinton, who places importance on resolving domestic economic problems, has unequivocally stated: "In the present world, expanding exports is the only way for an affluent nation to make itself more affluent." Close Government-Business Ties Result in Weakening Competitiveness In response, the Japanese Government is frantically trying to relax bureaucratic regulations, prompting the business community to distance itself from the government. To cite an example, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] asked automobile companies in late March to draw up their respective plans for the purchase of foreign-made auto parts. In reaction, top executives of several automobile companies said in distress, "We will no longer comply with any requests from MITI." The Japanese automobile industry, which has grown while maintaining close ties with MITI, has begun to refuse to go along with what MITI requests. The close ties between the administration and the business community in the United States and the alienation of the business community from the government in Japan appear to carry the risk of causing one trade friction after another between Japan and the United States. The Motorola-style strategy, which aims to exploit the close government-business ties to let business use the government's influence, is nothing but a "strategy designed to reap short-term profits by spending money in Washington." The money spent in Washington would not serve to improve the quality of American manufactured goods, but to weaken American industrial competitiveness in the long run. There is no reason for Japanese enterprises to excessively fear the Motorola-style strategy.
