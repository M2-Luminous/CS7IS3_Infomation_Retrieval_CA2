The government had taken a number of major steps to ensure the public would be able to vote as safely as possible over the next three days He said the government condemned the bombings in the strongest possible terms. "It must be stated quite categorically that, despite these evil acts of terrorism, South Africans will vote on April 26, 27 and 28," he said. "I would like to assure the public that the government, the SAP [South African Police] and other security forces will not fail in their duty to safeguard the transition to a democracy in South Africa." The SAP had already offered R1 million [rand] for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Steps taken to promote voting safety included: - immediate nationwide cordon and search operations by the SA Police and other security forces to reduce the chances of further bomb blasts and other atrocities; - more than 100,000 police would be deployed to ensure the safety of polling booths and stations throughout South Africa; - in the largest peace-time call-up yet in South Africa thousands of SA Defence Force members would be deployed to assist the SAP safeguard the election process; and - implementation of contingency planning to deal with the situation. Mr Myburgh said no police force in the world could guarantee that acts of terrorism would not take place, "but I would like to state quite clearly that the SAP and other security forces can and will ensure that the election process as a whole is not derailed". "I therefore urge the public to stay calm and to fully co-operate with the security forces in their task of ensuring that the election process is not derailed." Mr Myburgh said he would like to express his and the government's condolences to the family and friends of the victims of all the bomb blasts. Answering questions, he said it seemed quite logical that there was a pattern in the bombings, but he could not comment at this stage on who police thought might be behind it. The police had assigned their most competent detectives to the investigation. The explosive devices used in the blasts had been home-made, but were professional in the sense that they "did detonate". There was no indication that any grouping like a third force had been involved. On election precautions, he said ballots and voting stations, at which police would be deployed, would be closely guarded as routes to them. Polling stations were to be checked out the day before voting and closely guarded right until the last person had left at the end of the voting. The same measures as in the past were being taken to protect political personalities.
