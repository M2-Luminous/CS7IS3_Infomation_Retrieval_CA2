If any RPF delegations go to Tanzania, (?it is not) to hold any talks with the fictitious government, but only to (?ask) President Ali Hassan Mwinyi for explanations about the situation, which is making any contact with [words indistinct] impossible. In addition to this [words indistinct] Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the UN secretary general, asking the UN Security Council to meet in order to take a decision. Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali wants foreign troops sent to Rwanda, however, not one European country wants to release a single soldier, and the United Nations, which fears another Somali-style experience, considers that the issue should be dealt with by the OAU. [passage omitted] Regarding OAU forces, the RPF's position remains crystal clear: At this point, any intervention by foreign troops is really useless. Whether they are UN or OAU forces, they are all the more useless because genocide has already been committed. It is too late, it is really insane, to hear the United Nations pretending to be willing to send its troops in, when it has withdrawn UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] troops while huge numbers of Rwandans were being massacred in front of their eyes. [passage omitted] Everybody can remember the manner in which the UNAMIR Blue Berets abandoned more than 2,000 people at (Kituitsiro) Technical School, while these people were under their protection, thus abandoning them to the barbarity of the Presidential Guards and the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militias] militias, who immediately massacred them. Whoever remembers this case -- and we are mentioning only this specific case -- wonders what the UN Security Council has in mind when it dares to suggest the dispatch of foreign troops to Rwanda. Is it to protect hundreds of thousands of corpses in a state of decomposition? Or to protect old residential buildings? Why does the UN Security Council not think of rescuing those who have escaped the massacres but are still stranded in ravines, or those who are dying a slow death at the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali, dying from hunger, from thirst, from lack of medical care and from lack of hygiene? [passage omitted] The RPF believes that, if the international community intends to carry out any form of intervention in Rwanda, it should come within the scope of humanitarian aid, notably food and health aspects, given the famine and all its consequences which are causing the death of those who have escaped the massacres and the lack of medical care for the wounded as well as the threat of epidemics due to the decomposition of corpses which are littered throughout the country. It is in that framework that international intervention is necessary, otherwise foreign armed forces would have only been useful if deployed in time to prevent the slaughter of such a large proportion of the population. At the moment their intervention is useless. The time for this has passed.
