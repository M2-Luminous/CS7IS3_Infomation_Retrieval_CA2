I am sincerely grateful to Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz for his support and to all the people's deputies who asked me long before my nomination as the proposed head of government to agree to this proposal. I hope that they intend to support me during the voting. In agreeing to lead the government, if I am appointed today to do so, I am fully aware of the enormous responsibility placed on anyone making this decision during this difficult period that our young independent state is undergoing. I would like to assure you in all frankness that my intention and consent to take this important state office, if the nomination is successful, is not based on some personal ambition or selfish interest, but is based solely on an understandable desire to use my intelligence, my experience, and my skill to overcome the economic difficulties, improve the people's living standards, and strengthen our statehood. This was the main purpose for which our electors sent us to Ukraine's top legislative body in an expression of supreme confidence and perhaps their last hope. You understand that each of the possible candidates for this post simply cannot today have a specific program of action for the future government. Such a document may be drawn up on the basis of an in-depth professional analysis of the state of the economy and the practical needs of our development with due account of proposals coming from the commissions and individual people's deputies. All members of the government who will be involved in the implementation of the program should take part in its preparation. Taking this into account, let me only dwell on the key conceptual approaches and certain organizational and practical issues which in my opinion require urgent solutions, and set out my position, my views, on the most important sociopolitical problems facing our state. I believe I should also outline my ideas as to the principles of forming the new government and organizing its work. That is, of course, if you should trust me to head the government. Esteemed deputies, my political orientation is based on the premise that Ukraine must continue to develop as an independent, law-governed, democratic state. Our common cause, regardless of party affiliation, must be a concern for the strengthening of Ukraine's sovereignty, preservation of its territorial integrity, and inviolability of its borders. This is the most important task for Ukraine's budding statehood. Ukraine is a market economy, a state that cares for the social protection of its citizens. Ukraine means privatization. The economic crisis that we are going through has in the recent years enriched us with a considerable, though, unfortunately, mostly negative experience. To a great extent, it has become clearer what should not be done. We have come to realize particularly well that economic isolationism in all its forms and the breaking of economic ties with our age-old partners and neighbors were the main causes of the state's economic decline. I am convinced that, while preserving its sovereignty and independence, Ukraine must, in its development, maintain good, equal, and friendly relations with all CIS countries, and above all, with Russia. Recognition of our national identity, our historic traditions, and our place in the world civilization must not lead us toward self-isolation and naive complacency. On the contrary, under certain conditions, it can become a reliable basis and a necessary condition for sovereign Ukraine's friendly relations with all peoples and nations, for our further coexistence and cooperation in an interrelated and interdependent world. Bearing the heavy burden of building Ukraine's statehood, we must at the same time accelerate the reforms in our economy and the transition to market relations, provide genuine safeguards for the proclaimed equality of different forms of ownership, and open the doors for enterprising, industrious, and bold people. The monopolized economy has lately been hounded into a dead end; we need to find a way out of it as soon as possible. That should be done primarily by improving the health of state policy, increasing labor motivation, and halting the decline in production. Of course, this will take some time, something that we, unfortunately, of which we have almost run out. I am profoundly convinced that, without implementing a program of wide-ranging support for entrepreneurship, particularly that which is evolving in the sphere of production and innovation, it will simply be impossible for us to carry out in-depth economic reforms in the very near future. Alongside forming various funds and centers to provide this support, including those with the participation of foreign investors, the government must introduce tax concessions for the entrepreneurial structures that are performing their activities in our state's priority spheres, such as agricultural growing and processing, construction and development in the construction industry, and the production of drugs and consumer goods. A clear system of credit support, concessions in the provision of banking services, and commercial risk insurance should function here. I believe that the entrepreneurs working in industries of primary importance could be given wider opportunities in the use of facilities within the production infrastructure owned by the state. If we fail to do this, the development of economic reforms in Ukraine, as well as our entire economy, will for a long time remain in a state of decline and stagnation. It is precisely this current situation that is well demonstrated by the results of the national economy's work in the five months of this year. The economy's performance, I would say, has been supernegative. What is more, contrary to (?pseudo-) optimistic statements being made publicly of late, the national economy's decline and crisis are constantly on the increase. Out of considerations of an ethical and moral nature and for certain personal reasons, contrary to how things are very often done, I would not like to start analyzing the state of the economy by criticizing the previous government and quoting figures in order to confirm the rate of our speedy decline. I hope they are well known to you anyway. Everyone of us, naturally, cannot help but ask the question: What can explain this agonizing state of our economy, and what are the main reasons for the steady rise in the tendency of decomposition, chaos, and disintegration that has been observed by us in the course of the last few years? I am absolutely certain that if we do not find the real causes of this and do not make the right diagnosis of our economy's prolonged disease, we shall not be able to find effective remedies for it. Nor shall we be able to take the right path to lead us out of the economic crisis in the shortest possible time. Anything other than that today not only has no future, but also poses an extreme threat to the fate of Ukraine. Let me expound my reasons for saying this: I believe that the main reason is a lack of political will, courage, and a clear plan for reforming the economy, which are required and which for a long time now have not been found in our leadership structures; and the fact that we are constantly throwing ourselves from one economic program to another. For a long time, we trailed behind Gaydar's reforms and copied them, which led eventually to the stalling and blocking of important decisions. I also believe that the catastrophic state of our economy can be explained not only by various power structures' tactical mistakes, but also, to a considerable extent, by a disregard for strategic macroeconomic thinking that could develop an acceptable model of Ukraine's national economy and determine the optimal means of moving toward curbing the crisis. Even if we were doing something at the microeconomic level, such as handing out credits, granting tax concessions, distributing hard currency, providing subsidies, and so on, almost no work was being done at the macroeconomic level. I think that the budgetary and financial policy that has been pursued by our state for quite a long time now is not only politically, socially, and organizationally ill-considered, but also is fundamentally flawed and has effectively led to the collapse of the financial system. Although the emergency measures that have been taken lately to check inflationary processes have had some positive results, I still consider them temporary because they are based on erroneous principles and approaches. Inflation today has simply been driven underground, and that has been done artificially. To a considerable degree, it is hidden, which was achieved by causing what I think is an equally distressing phenomenon: the artifically created absolute insolvency of most of our enterprises and essentially the whole of our population. The payment thrombus that has formed in our economy's financial arteries will ruin it utterly. Can you tell me, please, who needed the budget without a deficit for 1994, contrived by (?the cabinet) and approved by the previous Supreme Council? Given the present state of our economy, it can be achieved only on paper. By our ill-considered actions in the sphere of taxation, we have introduced, I will say openly, a wild system for taxing all subjects of economic management. If 22 percent of income is today being deducted from all enterprises, or more than 55 percent of profits, then there cannot be any talk of entrepreneurship, particularly in the sphere of production. Such an ill-thought-out approach only causes profits to be concealed. It became the reason for the economic suppression of production and almost the complete suspension of Ukraine's investment process. The government's shortsighted policy with regard to the so-called fixed regulated exchange rate of the dollar and the quite liberal manipulation of the hard currency legislation have led to the collapse of the domestic hard currency market. The concealment of hard-currency earning abroad is taking on an even larger dimension. According to IMF experts, hard currency receipts worth $1.3 billion were not returned to Ukraine in 1993. That is, despite our difficulties in obtaining hard currency, last year we continued to invest our hard currency in production in Russia, European countries and generally anywhere so long as it is not here. Hard currency that remains abroad does not work for the benefit of Ukraine's economy. Life itself forces exporters to do this, for today it is the only way to somehow preserve the production of goods that are exported, because due to the high taxes and wild differences in exchange rates, Ukraine's export potential is being reduced everyday. According to foreign experts, we lose around $100 million every month for these reasons. I consider that the government and the National Bank were not able to elaborate a clear monetary and credit doctrine, did not create a market of credit resources that was accessible to all, and took to this important affair in an amateurish way regardless of the fact that credits are one of the most powerful sources for the growth in the monetary mass. To a considerable extent, it was precisely because of this that today our karbovanets is no longer able to fulfill its main role as a means of accumulation and of financially guaranteeing investment and foreign economic activity. People do not trust, so to speak, our national currency and in conditions of crippling inflation have stopped saving their money in savings banks. Our money does not work for our economy. But you know that under market relations the most important thing is that money should work. Esteemed colleagues, analyzing the state of affairs, one cannot help but ask oneself: Where is the way out? What is to be done in the first instance to rectify the situation? What are the main processes in our socioeconomic and spiritual revival? In the economic sphere, we must, first of all, work out a clear program of macroeconomic transformations, define their content, their stages, their speed and order, all of which would accord with a socially oriented model of market relations. Only on this basis will we be able to stop the destructive tendency toward the collapse of the country's productive forces and its intellectual and productive potential, and to minimize the social casualties of our reforms. While giving the reforms a stronger impetus, the government must ensure state regulation of the economy, especially in strategic industries, which is being done in every market-oriented country. For us, these key sectors are power engineering, the coal, metal, and chemical industries. The state sector in this case would act as one of the players in market relations, while the state on the whole, without losing its administrative function, would have a greater influence on the regulation of economic processes. But the situation that has emerged in the national economy today requires most radical and urgent measures of direct action, so to speak. First of all, it is necessary to launch as soon as possible the production of domestic goods at full capacity. This must be done using all possible stimulative factors that will encourage the manufacturer to produce the necessary goods that are affordable to most people. The main task today is not to collect enormous taxes and form an unrealistic budget, but to revive the economy as soon as possible by relieving the tax pressure, to allow labor collectives to work normally and allow people to receive what they have earned. I would like to stress for deputies and for everybody else -- an earned salary and not one received through speculation in hard currency. If somebody today still has some hope that this can be done only by artificially speeding up payments between enterprises, by granting them more cheap credits to replenish their circulating resources, then I can assure them that these are illusionary expectations. The process of collapse and chaos has gone so far that a purely monetary approach can no longer change or rectify anything. I consider that we must now act not with traditional methods, but with those which at first glance seem almost paradoxical. It is necessary to change the entire philosophy and methodology of our state's financial and budgetary system. What is meant by this? First of all, we must reject the pillaging principle of taxation, of collecting as much from taxpayers as possible, and to go over to the principle of leaving them with as much of the earned profit as possible. The policy of liberalizing taxation is fairly simple here: The more we leave for the taxpayer today, in the end, the more the state will receive tomorrow. I consider that the critical level of taxation from each enterprise should be about 15-17 percent of income -- but this is an issue for the future. Today, we should attempt to increase the profit part of the budget by increasing the level of production. At the moment, this is the main way of reducing taxation. Second, while the state should support individual priority sectors of industry, we should nevertheless refuse to give subsidies to the majority of loss-making enterprises and organizations. As of today, they amount to about 25 percent of the total amount. We should finally understand that a philosophy based on supporting the weak, on enterprises that are incapable of working profitably, leads nowhere. On the contrary, brave, hard-working, and talented workers need every kind of support and encouragement at the state level. Incidentally, bankruptcy, contrary to the understanding that is widespread in Ukraine, is, first of all, a financial and not a social concept. It does not mean that an enterprise will be liquidated without fail. Not at all. Simply that this factory or plant will experience a change in ownership. A new director will arrive and will make it profitable. In my view, already today some of these enterprises could be sold even to foreign investors, and not necessarily for a high price, but definitely with one firm demand: the new owner should invest as many resources in the production process that are required to ensure that the enterprise makes a profit and provides people with work. Third, we need to define more clearly the priorities in deciding the most important economic problems. Among them, most attention should be paid to the development of the fuel and energy complex; power engineering, including atomic energy; and overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. The government is obliged to develop and implement a long-term program of providing Ukraine with resources and critical imports -- first of all, oil and gas. Today this problem, in my view, is usually being decided by the enthusiasm and personal possibilities of individual officials who, during periodic visits to Moscow after being warned in a threatening manner, succeed in asking for another round of credits or extract a postponement in payments and sink deeper into debt. They have already succeeded in selling off our national wealth. I consider that such a short-term policy is not only degrading for our state but is also generally extremely dangerous for our economic and state independence. You will agree that there is no bigger theat to us today than the $6 billion or or so that we owe mainly to Russia. Esteemed people's deputies, I think you will agree that the former Supreme Council paid considerable attention to the development of the agro-industrial complex and the food processing industry and to solving the problems in these vital sectors. But in my opinion, these issues were separated from each other, there was no comprehensive approach and no strategic course was worked out toward resolving such complex issues as price parity between industrial and agricultural products; the form and size of the state procurement order; payment for farmers' products supplied to the state; as well as the tax, financial, and credit policy in the countryside. No decision has been made as yet on land privatization. I believe that two approaches are possible. First, and this can be done in the near future, we can allow a 49-year lease of land for the construction of various social facilities. That will also be extended to foreign investors who can build hotels and everything else needed to develop our social sector. The second option is to make land available for lifelong use with the right of inheritance, but only to those who have worked in the countryside for a certain period and who have relevant experience and education to use the land efficiently. In this way, we will prevent speculation and the takeover of land by various rich dealers. Undoubtedly, our electorate expect that the new Supreme Council will return to these problems in order to prepare concrete laws to boost the formation of a market economy and a viable market environment in the countryside. Flexible legislative work should demonopolize the food processing sector. I believe that it is due to the stalling of this process that food prices today are not free. I am sure that a comprehensive approach to these issues will allow us to create a reliable and efficient market mechanism to reduce food prices. It is extremely urgent today. Esteemed colleagues, in the several days that our new Supreme Council has been in session, we have said a lot about the social protection of the population and the numerous complex issues that have cropped up and require immediate solutions. This is indeed so. In my opinion, the socioeconomic situation remains the most acute problem on which the government must focus its attention. The main task is to stop further decline in the people's living standards by means of resolute measures in pricing policy, and to search for opportunities for selective reduction of wholesale and retail prices for vital consumer products. I believe that the entire government policy must be based on the principle that rich citizens make a rich country. While I stand firmly in favor of deep economic transformations in our society, I nevertheless emphatically disagree with those politicians who believe that before starting on a civilized road of development, we must wade through a swamp: economic and political degradation and drastic impoverishment of a considerable group of people who are denied reliable social protection, while an isolated group of slick dealers accumulate unseen wealth. I believe you will agree that we did not have to make people extremely poor and promise them that maybe some day they will become rich. It is time to realize that millions of poverty-stricken and faithless people will not create a rich and powerful state. We all saw that for ourselves during numerous meetings with voters. We all remember how difficult it was to face reproachful questions from pensioners whose pension is not adequate to make ends meet. I do not know about you, but I was rather ashamed to face people who are living on pitiful minimum wages, especially educators, doctors, veterans of labor, members of large families, invalids, and other low-income groups of the population. Undoubtedly, all these issues require urgent discussion in parliament and practical actions on the part of the government to resolve them as soon as possible. But to be frank, as a human being, I was most amazed by the horrible state of our humanitarian sector, first of all, science, health care, and education, especially in rural areas and areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster. We must do our best to improve the environmental situation in the state. I think, with all our differences and economic troubles, we will have no excuse if we do not break the standstill in these areas by means of relevant legislative acts. We are obliged to regain lost prestige in these sectors as soon as possible and give the people hope for an improvement in the situation, because the health of our people, their future intellectual potential, and our priceless possession, the nation's gene pool, in every sense depends on our ability to resolve these problems. I am convinced that the country's government must pay more attention to the implementation of the program for the conversion of the military-industrial complex, problems existing in our army, its financial provision, and social protection of the military. You will agree that the Army's efficiency, reputation, and the respect it commands in society depend to a great extent on the way we manage to remove the existing difficulties and the way we care for our servicemen. I hope that all of us, irrespective to which political party we belong, will act in a like-minded fashion on these issues and will make mutual concessions to resolve them as soon as possible. Another problem of overall state importance which has come to the fore and requires the Supreme Council's urgent intervention is the fight against crime, especially organized crime, bribery, corruption, and widespread economic criminal activity. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the criminal web is spreading a thick layer over our entire young, fledgling state. What are the proposed priority measures to be taken by the government and the Supreme Council? First of all, I believe that we need to strive for unity and consistency in the actions of law enforcement bodies and improve our penal legislation, which is clearly lagging behind in the crime marathon; and this is not least through the fault of the top legislative body, which was very slow in passing all the additions and amendments to the laws proposed in recent years. Finally, I believe we need to considerably reduce budget expenditures for the state apparatus; revise the size of staff in our ministries, departments, and state committees; and adjust their functions to keep up with market conditions and the demands of the present time. We must be bolder in the transition from the sectoral to the functional management principle; quicker in renouncing interference in every detail of the work of enterprises, in renouncing sheer administrative control, authoritarianism, and pressure on production units. The structure and mechanism of executive power must fully accord with the deep transformations taking place in the economy, the society, and the state. On the basis of the results of local elections which are soon to be held, we must work out and pass legislation on the concept of regional economic management and build a flexible and strong vertical structure of executive power. We must consider and introduce strict accountability of all these structures, from the Cabinet of Ministers to the village council. I also believe it very important that the key posts in state administration should be held by highly professional, competent people, with sufficient hands-on experience in management at the relevant level, trained for state leadership, who will take resolute and principled actions on the basis of their rights and the laws, will not be afraid to take bold decisions, and will be ready to bear responsibility for the results of their activities. If I am elected to the post of prime minister, I will be prepared to assist the appointment to government and other leadership positions of young and talented specialists, reformers in spirit, with sufficient hands-on experience in the sphere of management, and train them to be top-level leaders, irrespective of their political views. Esteemed people's deputies, our internal economic policy is tied closely with our state's external economic and diplomatic activities and the fulfilment of its obligations to the world business community. I believe that the future government must continue active and balanced cooperation with international financial organizations. Ukraine's membership in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will help create favorable conditions for the implementation of our internal economic policy and our plans to reform the economy. Apart from this, active membership in these reputable institutions entitles us to participate in decision-making with regard to international financial policies and opens access to economic information. I would also like to support the main principles and guidelines for the development of Ukraine's economy in the period of crisis set out by Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz. In conclusion, I would like to stress once again that I have outlined here the main essential, conceptual points of the economic program that I will pursue, defend, and implement if I am elected prime minister. I would like to particularly stress that it can only be fulfilled by joint efforts of both branches of power, with your understanding, and with the Supreme Council's support of our state's new government, which in its work will be guided by the Cabinet of Ministers law, which is among the first that needs to be discussed and passed. Thank you for your attention.
