The committee, which held a meeting over the weekend to discuss the political report presented by the assistant first secretary of the party Mohamed el-Yazghi, renewed attachment to the stands it explained in the statement adopted last December saying the December statement remains the basic platform for the USFP political action as there are no new data likely to dictate a change of these stands. The committee which examined the latest political developments in light of the appointment of Abdellatif Filali as prime minister and the latter's consultations with political parties, took note of some of Filali's laudable commitments and intentions but saw no sign of a genuine change. The committee therefore discards the possibility to participate in the government. The political report that was run Monday by the USFP daily 'AL ITTIHAD AL ICHTIRAKI' on the other hand stressed the need to usher in political and constitutional reforms and pointed out that the credibility of any government is intrinsically linked to the genuine practice of democracy and the genuine respect of human rights. The report also deemed it necessary for the government to carry on social dialog to reach solutions to pending problems. The central committee of another opposition party, the Party for Progress and Socialism (PPS), held an extraordinary meeting Sunday during which the PPS secretary general informed the committee members on the consultations held by Filali with Moroccan political parties.
