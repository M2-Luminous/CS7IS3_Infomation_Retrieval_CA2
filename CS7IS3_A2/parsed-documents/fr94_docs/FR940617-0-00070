FR940617-0-00070 FR940617-0-00016 The majority of comments centered on four major issues in the proposed 261 and 290 rules: scope of the rule, including the definition and manner of determining the significance of a cave; confidentiality of cave information; public participation; and differences with the proposed rule (57 FR 1344) published by Department of the Interior on January 13, 1992. Several comments also referred to information contained in a document entitled ``Proposed Procedure for Listing Significant Caves,'' which was circulated at the same time as the proposed rule but was not intended for codification in the regulations. This document described a proposed implementation process in greater detail. These comments also were considered as part of the rulemaking record to the extent that they were relevant to the provisions of the rulemaking. General Comments on 36 CFR Part 290 Under the proposed rule, cave protection regulations would be set out in title 36, part 290, of the Code of Federal Regulations. The following summarizes general comments received on the proposed rule and the Department's response to them. 1. Cooperation and Consultation With the Department of Interior Many respondents noted disparities between the Forest Service proposed rule and the proposed rule issued at the same time by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI). Most respondents recommended that the final rule of both agencies be as similar as possible. Response. Throughout the rulemaking process, the Forest Service and USDI land managing agencies have been participating in an interagency committee to agree on cave resource standards and procedures. The goal has been to adopt rules as similar as possible. However, each agency has a different statutory background and mission which result in some procedural differences such as in integrating cave resource protection into planning processes, delegations of authority, and information requirements. In these instances, the language may differ to reflect the specific authorities of the agencies involved. 2. Public Participation The majority of respondents felt the proposed rule completely ignored Section 2(b)(2) of the Act which states that one purpose of the Act is ``to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information between governmental authorities and those who utilize caves for scientific, education, or recreational purposes.'' Respondents believed the proposed rule denied the caving community access to cave information thus discouraging the exchange of information. Many respondents recommended that public interaction occur through establishment of an advisory committee and the development of volunteer agreements. Some respondents felt that these two actions were required by the Act in Sections 4(b)(3) and 4(b)(4). Response. Under §290.3 of the proposed rule, the agency intended that the public be given the opportunity to nominate significant caves. Additionally, proposed §290.4 provided a process by which information on caves and their location could be disclosed to bona fide educational or research organizations although not to the general cave recreationing community. Additionally, under the proposed rule, the agency envisioned addressing cave resource protection standards in forest plans pursuant to National Forest Management Act and implementing regulations. Forest plans are developed with full public participation; however, in response to comments on the proposed rule, the final rule does strengthen and encourage greater cooperation and exchange of information in the nomination and evaluation process as well as in a new provision permitting the disclosure of cave information to groups who assist the Federal land managing agencies with cave management. These changes are discussed in the section-by-section discussion of comments which follows. The suggestion to form an advisory committee has not been adopted. It is not at all clear that such advisory groups are needed either nationally or locally. Whether local advisory groups are needed is a decision best left to the local land manager. Should the Forest Supervisor determine that an advisory committee would be helpful in achieving the purposes of the Cave Resources Protection Act, the Department has ample authority and procedures in place to establish such advisory committees. 3. Scope and Detail of the Regulations Many respondents felt that the proposed rule should have provided more details on how to manage and protect significant caves. Most of these respondents understood that significant caves would be managed ``to the extent practical'' using current management plans, but wanted the final rule to incorporate or further clarify portions of the proposed rule. Respondents asked questions such as: how will significant cave listings and significant cave management concerns be integrated into forest plans; how will specific management concerns about significant caves be identified; how will ecosystem considerations, including protection of karst features and hydrological recharge areas, be made; and how will the Forest Service address proposed projects that potentially impact caves. Another respondent requested that goals and standards for cave resource protection and management be described in the rule and that language be added emphasizing that land management decisions should balance consideration of cave resource protection with consideration of human activity. Response. Through section 4(c)(1) of the Act, Congress made clear that caves should be managed through the agency's land and resource management planning process, and not through the significant cave designation process. Section 4(c)(1) states that significant caves are to be ``.␣.␣. considered in the preparation of any land management plan if the preparation or revision of the plan began after the enactment of this Act.'' Forest land and resource management planning is a continuous, dynamic process which is dependent on monitoring and evaluation of actions taken under the plan. The agency keeps plans current and updated through amendment or revision and maintains ongoing and meaningful communication with the public and other government entities. New data such as an inventory of significant caves is new information that Forest Supervisors consider as forest plans are implemented to determine if forest plan direction needs to be changed. Designating caves as significant will not automatically trigger the need to amend or revise forest plans. Upon development of the initial listing of significant caves on National Forest System lands, the Forest Supervisor will review the forest plan and determine if it is adequate to ensure protection of significant cave resources. If not, the Supervisor would initiate amendment or revision of the plan to address the protection of significant cave resources on the forest. The public must be involved in amendment or revision. Thus, any special management concerns for significant caves, including connected ecosystem considerations, can and should be identified by the public so that the comments can be analyzed and considered through the forest planning process. The forest planning process is already adequately regulated by the provisions of 36 CFR part 219; therefore, no additional change to this rule was made. Where a proposed project might impact a significant cave or cave yet to be evaluated for significance, the effects of the project would be analyzed in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations. Public input is solicited to identify environmental issues relevant to a proposed action (project). Agency policy and procedures under the NEPA in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 require that decision documents (Decision Memo, Decision Notice, Record of Decision) contain ``Findings required by other laws.'' If a decision affects a significant cave, a finding will be disclosed describing how the decision considered this cave.
