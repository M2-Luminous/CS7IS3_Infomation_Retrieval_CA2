In contrast, the "Macedonian" issue is an example of demagoguery and delusion, with political leaders "saying one thing and doing another," Linardhatos continues. To illustrate, he quotes a letter from former Prime Minister Mitsotakis to the Athens weekly OIKONOMIKOS TAKHIDHROMOS, in which Mitsotakis admitted that the "Skopje problem" should heve been settled by his government through an advantageous compromise based on a "composite name" and the fulfillment of conditions on "the symbol, the constitution, and propaganda." However, Mitsotakis continued, a settlement did not occur because "until the New Democracy (ND) government fell, the required parliamentary majority to solve the issue was lacking." The former prime minister failed to explain why the people were not told a compromise with Skopje was necessary and that continuing confrontation over the name issue was harmful to Greece's national interests, Linardhatos comments. The present Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government doubtlessly knows that such an "advantageous "--or at least "not harmful"--compromise will allow the country to face important domestic and foreign problems, on which Greece's place in the world and the people's welfare depend, Linardhatos notes. Dialogue and international support could produce satisfactory results, for the Greek "countermeasures" adopted against Skopje have caused problems, notably in the Greek European Union (EU) presidency. More importantly, the continuing crisis strengthens Balkan countries inimical to Greece and fosters domestic antidemocratic tendencies by intensifying nationalistic sentiment and expressions of "intolerance and ideological terrorism" like the demand by three deputies for punitive measures against academics calling for a compromise, Linardhatos concludes. Calling Greece's position in the Balkans "problematic," K.I. Angelopoulos notes in the 20 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou interrupted the UN process on Skopje and "spectacularly" imposed an embargo on that country. At the same time, Papandreou is attempting to start a dialogue that would omit the name issue despite the resulting difficulties. According to Angelopoulos, the prime minister believes that even if the name is a "lost cause," he lacks the requisite strength to give up his rejection of "Macedonia or a byproduct" and prefers to set the issue aside. It should be noted, Angelopoulos adds, that the prime minister does not wish to link any development in the Skopje affair with his official April visit to Washington, in the belief that a "pending issue" will not affect Greek-American talks. Angelopoulos cites unidentified Papandreou aides as saying that the prime minister will only ask President Clinton to exert more pressure on Skopje President Kiro Gligorov. According to the same sources, Papandreou is more interested in promoting Greek-American cooperation in the Balkans and will go for the "best possible" contacts in this regard during his U.S. visit. However, Angelopoulos comments that it may be difficult to fulfill Greek ambitions for a central role in the Balkans if Greece persists in not recognizing the Skopje republic, given the demonstrated interest in that country by its Balkan neighbors, Europe, and the United States. The problem is not only diplomatic, Angelopoulos continues. While Skopje is affected by the Greek embargo, Greek economic and political losses are becoming increasingly obvious and Athens is watching Balkan developments from the sidelines. While Papandreou "hears" Washington extolling the advantages of a Greek intervention in the area, he remains "trapped" in the Skopje issue, as did his predecessors in the past two years, Angelopoulos concludes.
