FBIS4-56199 "drlat084_c_94014" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 MEXICO Fernandez Describes Campaign Platform Fernandez Describes Campaign Platform PA3004003994 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 26 Apr 94 PA3004003994 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de Las Casas; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live] [Text] The National Action Party's [PAN] presidential campaign tour through Chiapas today could be described as a three-part operation. The first part was a meeting between presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz. It was funny because those of us trying to follow him found this rather difficult. By driving a little fast, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos managed to avoid the reporters' pursuit. We later learned what he discussed with the bishop during the meeting. His main question about the peace process was why we have someone who has no relation with Chiapas on one side and someone whose identity is unknown on the other negotiating peace and reconciliation in Chiapas? Diego Fernandez de Cevallos called on the political parties to participate in the process because it is urgent and necessary for them to be a part of the talks. After midday, he moved on to the community of Navenchauc and met with PAN members, who voiced their woes and petitions. They complained that they were not allowed to go to a specific temple, just for being PAN members. The people say they are not allowed to build any community projects. The municipal presidents of San Juan Chamula and Xinacatan, primarily, will not grant them any loans or provide the resources they need because they are not members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. They also say they are barred from the community decisionmaking process. They believe they are worth nothing. Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said something that caught many people's attention: I am not God, nor do I have the gift of magic, but I hereby promise to talk with you and settle these differences, especially with your authorities. Without a doubt, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos' main event of the day was to take place in San Cristobal de Las Casas. And that it was, because it has already concluded. He gave what he called his famous San Cristobal de Las Casas Proclamation of April 1994. These are the six main points of his proclamation, which was broadcast live by a local radio station here in Chiapas and beamed nationwide, via satellite. These are his words: [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] Ladies and gentlemen: I deeply thank you for being here, and I thank Radio 640 for the opportunity to broadcast this message to the people of Chiapas. It is also being broadcast to the whole nation via satellite. This is a manifesto to the people of Mexico from the PAN. 1. The PAN hereby and definitively reaffirms today, as it always has, its humanistic, pacifist, and democratic proposal. We therefore call upon all Mexicans of good faith to join a grand national effort directed at giving the nation a truly democratic government, a government that will promote unyielding respect for human rights, encourage the community to produce for the benefit of the people, contribute to improving our judicial system, and guarantee the full implementation of the state of law. 2. We strive for a profound change in the way the government exercises its power, so that power will always and without excuse be subjected to just laws for the benefit of the people. 3. We reject the current economic model, because it has concentrated wealth in a disgusting way and has impoverished 40 million Mexicans. We demand and propose an economic system that will serve all human beings, always be subjected to ethical standards, and generate equal opportunity for all in the generation and distribution of national wealth. 4. We intend to seriously and extensively promote the states of the Federation and all of the country's municipalities, by way of a true political, economic, and social federalist system. Presidential centralism is the source of all the evil and injustice that oppress and degrade the nation's life. It denies the sovereign rights of the states of the Federation; it subordinates the country's municipalities by way of a rampant and often murderous autocracy. 5. We call for an educational program, in which the government and the community must work together. We must encourage the overall development of all human beings, but with respect for their dignity. This we must attain while strengthening the cultural, ethnic, religious, and ideological plurality that characterizes Mexico. 6. The PAN, in keeping with its history of democratic civic spirit, strongly says no to violence. It supports an honest, respectful, and sincere dialogue in favor of justice and peace. We reiterate the need to achieve the maximum participation of Mexican society and its institutions in a dialogue based on truth that can lead us to a national understanding. We emphasize the importance for peace of a dialogue between the government and the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. We categorically support the dialogue and we hope honorable agreements result from it. We refuse, however, to even believe that representatives of the president of the republic and of the EZLN can define and compromise the life and institutions of Chiapas and of Mexico. In our opinion, ladies and gentlemen, from this dialogue we must expect a civilized agreement between the government and the EZLN to legally promote without delay the duties aimed at resolving the conflict. We believe the argument that hunger and injustice generate violence. We insist that peace cannot be attained if justice is not achieved first. True peace is based on reason. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the message of the PAN in San Cristobal de Las Casas on 25 April 1994. [Signed] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate to the presidency of the republic.
