The Army's 7th Brigade reported that Rissin was relaxing at a resort hacienda in Puerto Lleras, some 300 km from Santa Fe de Bogota, when he was abducted by six men who identified themselves as Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, members. With Rissin's abduction, the number of U.S. citizens kidnapped by FARC in Meta increases to three. In January, guerrillas took missionaries Steve Welch and Timothy Vandyck hostage while at a camp near Villavicencio. The Army report says that FARC political propaganda was found at the site where Rissin was taken captive. The FARC is Colombia's largest and oldest rebel organization. "We can confirm Rissin's kidnapping, but we do not know the reasons for it," a 7th Brigade source said. He added that a special operation was mounted in the area to try to find Rissin. On 3 March, National Liberation Army, ELN, guerrillas released, safe and sound, U.S. citizen Manning Lowis, who had been taken captive in the jungle of Choco Department, on the border with Panama, one year earlier. The FARC and ELN are part of the Simon Bolivar Coordinating Guerrilla Board, CGSB, which two years ago abandoned the peace negotiations with the Colombian Government in Tlaxcala, Mexico.
