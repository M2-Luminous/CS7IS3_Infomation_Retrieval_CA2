He said in a telephone call with the Kuwaiti AL-SIYASAH newspaper today that it is impossible for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to enter Aden and that his forces are suffering from the shortage in water and foods. He added that the northerners looked at the unity as occupation and occupation is rejected. Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri pointed to the contradictions in 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's stand. He sought for an Arab solution to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in 1990 and now rejects the possible Arab solution to the Yemen crisis. Al-Jifri said there is no return to the unity with those who look for control and occupation, saying that DY [Democratic Yemen] has vast stocks of weapons and food supplies, while the north suffers from shortages in fuel and wheat. On 'Ali 'Abdaliah's conditions to stop the fighting in return for cancellation of the declaration of the Republic, al-Jifri said: There is no discussion of the cancellation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen.
