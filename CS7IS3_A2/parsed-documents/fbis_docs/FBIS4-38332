Moreover, there are signs of a political crisis in the republic as relations are worsening between the executive and legislative branches of power. These questions were the subject of an Interfax interview with the Vice-President of Tatarstan VASILIY LIKHACHYOV. INTERFAX: Having signed the treaty with Russia Kazan resolved its political problems: The new status of Tatarstan was recognized. But today the republic is facing domestic problems which are no less grave. More and more often politicians speak of a critical state of the Tatar economy, politics and ideology. What is your personal opinion of the situation? LIKHACHYOV: During the past few years the Tatar leadership has been quite energetically working on its strong socio-political potential. Its legal status is evident now. It has been formulated. But it so happened that political and legal developments went ahead of economic. This is objective reality. We had to carry out the tasks put forward in the declaration of sovereignty and in the new constitution of Tatarstan. The republic, now a truly sovereign state, is facing a number of contradictions some of which are quite deep. First of all, the legislative and executive branches of power worked together without conflicts toward a common objective: sovereignty and its recognition by Moscow. It is evident that the responsibility for the current situation in the republic, for the mistakes and shortcomings lie equally on the president, his staff, parliament and government. But they also should work together to overcome the crisis. Unfortunately, not all power structures are ready for such joint work and for reforming themselves. Under the constitution both the parliament and the government have supervising powers. It is incorrect, to say the least, for parliament to try to act separately. I would say it is politically wrong. Besides, after signing the treaty with Tatarstan the system of values is naturally and logically changing. Everyone was convinced that political achievements should open up broad prospects for economic reforms. But they should have been carried out with reliance on local resources which proved to be difficult. A financial, economic and technological collapse followed. On the other hand, we somewhat underestimated the high degree of Tatarstan's integration in the Russian economy. The weakness of our stance I think was that it was not comprehensive. Today the Tatar leadership is giving up the illusion that when a high rise building is on fire one can survive by closing one's own door. Tatarstan can hardly work out any independent original program of overcoming the crisis: we are in a common economic space with Russia, therefore federal processes should be taken into account. Speaking of a crisis one should bear in mind that the whole of the Russian Federation, Tatarstan being part of it, is facing political and economic difficulties. Besides, it is evident to me that the anti-crisis program now in the making might not work, if the approach to the selection of top officials is not changed. INTERFAX: Some analysts claim that a power crisis is moving on Tatarstan. Do you think the mutual accusations of parliament and government might develop into a more serious conflict that can end with the resignation of someone from the top echelon? LIKHACHYOV: Having resolved several important political questions the Tatar leadership unfortunately fell into euphoria taking the period of stabilization for actual reforms. However, the question of deep economic changes and the development of projects was never raised. It turned out that the political prerequisites for reforms were wonderful, but there was no noticeable advancement of economic thinking. Now in typically Russian traditions the republic has started looking for a scapegoat. Important matters were resolved better or worse during the stabilization period. It is a different matter that new versions of advancement should have been sought simultaneously. But is the government alone to blame for what did not happen? I would like to reiterate that the necessity of serious changes in all spheres, including appointments, is evident. One must face the truth. I think that many leaders, some quite high-ranking, should resign. But the process is always very painful and accompanied by personal tragedies. I think that a person should first of all realize one's own potential. If one feels having exhausted it and become only a professional instrument in the hands of others, he must resign. INTERFAX: In Tatarstan unlike many other parts of the Russian Federation the political elite did not change. Analysts say the party elite is actually still in power at all levels. Probably the stabilization period, as you called, it had its favorable effect allowing to keep the republic controllable and prevent a total collapse of the economy. But will President Mintimer Shaymiyev agree to radical changes in his staff? After all it was he who formed this team. LIKHACHYOV: Mintimer Shaymiyev will never become a hostage of his own associates. Today we can say that there are no so-called grey cardinals who could resolve their own problems behind his back. On the whole the administration reacts to changes in the situation quite adequately. The elite is not homogeneous at all. Many old regional party leaders in the new conditions have found their own niche. But now it turns out that some of them clearly lack training. And that is first of all a personal crisis. Besides, the administration itself is far from being perfect. On the one hand, it is highly responsible and disciplined, on the other, negative tendencies have appeared: territorial groups, regional lobbies. The change should begin with the presidential team. I see the way out in the appearance of striking, dynamic , unbiased persons. Shaymiyev is now facing a most difficult task because the constitutional provision that he is a guarantor of rights and liberties, a guarantor of stability requires a new interpretation. The Tatar economy can no longer be based on oil dollars and the Tatar leadership must realize the new standard of tasks facing the country. This requires the interference of the president and his closest circle that should change in an evolutionary as well as revolutionary manner. I think the management should be more democratic and open in its work. I know that the criminal world has started approaching certain government structures. In my opinion the time is ripe to set up a Security Council of Tatarstan. The republic needs a normal policy of choosing and appointing officials that would not be carried out by certain half-hidden persons. It should be an open policy covering the entire government mechanism, guaranteeing the change of generations in the Leadership and respect for those who are resigning. INTERFAX: The media claim that President Shaymiyev might find himself in a similar situation with Boris Yeltsin who in their opinion has successfully resolved Russia's foreign problems but fails in resolving domestic ones. LIKHACHYOV: I remain an optimist in this respect. I think that President Shaymiyev has the necessary willpower, energy, possibilities and potential.
