Monday [7 March] was "the first day of large-scale money collection" in regions for the strike fund. On each day now, there are supposed to be increasingly more serious strikes. Between 0900 and 1100 today, steel workers in 74 plants, primarily in Silesia, will go on strike. Beginning Wednesday, "the significant regions"--for example, the plants in the Lodz Region--will strike for two hours. At that time, in Lodz, the National Committee [KK] of Solidarity will debate the current situation and further steps concerning the action. On Thursday, pit-coal mines will strike for two hours and block coal shipments for the entire day. Strike for Minimum Wage According to Piotr Zak, press spokesman of the Solidarity KK, each member of the union will pay on average between 50,000 and 100,000 zlotys [Z] to the strike fund; the size of the remuneration for the participation in the strike has been initially set at approximately Z75,000 per day (minimum day's earning). However, everything will depend on the state of the account. On 7 March in Bialystok, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said that the Solidarity strikes are political and "disrespecting to the law." "No government established as a result of truly democratic elections can accept such a dictate," said Cimoszewicz, suggesting that Solidarity should ask itself a question concerning responsibility to the state. Stoppages and Flags According to "Solidarity," 95 percent of the work force of the Wood Industry Plants in Slawno and the Heat Energy Enterprise participated in the four-hour strike. In the latter action, the water temperature was lowered by 10 degrees Celsius. If the weather had been frosty, the strike would have been felt by town inhabitants. Head of the region, Edward Muller, said that next time "people will get 100 percent of the heat, industry--zero." In Elblag Voivodship, in Pieniezno, the supply of heat was completely cut off. A warning strike was also organized on 7 March in the Agricultural Machines Factory in Czarna Bialostocka. The strike alert has been announced in the Lomza and Suwalki Voivodships, where there will probably be no great strikes. The following regions are getting ready for active participation in the action: Bydgoszcz, Torun, and the region of Kujawy and Ziemia Dobrzynska (Wloclawek), which on 7 March announced a passive strike. The Swietokrzyski Region has announced a higher state of strike readiness. In Malopolska, strike readiness has already been reported by approximately 70 enterprises, including the metal branch and the Polish State Railroads. The first strike will probably be held there in the middle of this week. Also 12 enterprises of the Bialystok Voivodship and several of the biggest plants in the Bielsko Biala voivodships have announced their readiness for an active strike. In the Mazowsze Region, referendums among work forces are still under way. Steel Workers and Miners On 8 March, 74 plants of the National Steel Works' Section of Solidarity, including the Tadeusz Sedzimir Steel Works in Krakow, will go on strike. A several-hour-long progressive strike will be organized in several plants in Koszalin. Lodz will be on strike on 9 March, and the Silesian branch of Solidarity will continue its progressive strike. On 10 March, there will be a two-hour warning strike in all pit-coal mines; miners will block the shipment of coal for 24 hours. Miners' Solidarity Spokesman Adam Jawor did not rule out the possibility that in some mines the strike may last eight hours. On 10 March, a one-hour warning strike is supposed to be staged in Gdansk. On 7 March, Solidarity Head Marian Krzaklewski requested that the industry minister present him with data on the average demand for electricity in the morning and evening rush hours from the energy grid. This has to do with the possibility of a strike in the fuel-energy sector: "The data are indispensable for coordinating the supply of as much fuel as is needed by the system to ensure electricity production exclusively for individual customers," wrote the head of Solidarity.
