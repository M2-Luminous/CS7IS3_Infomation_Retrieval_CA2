In line with this version, the government would present the "Report on the Condition of the State" on 30 June and not toward the end of March. The ministers decided that in the first quarter of the year the tax-free wage increase would be 1.5 percent. The Ministry of National Defense [MON] and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have set up a working group which is tasked with analyzing the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. No decisions have been made with regard to this issue. At the government session on Tuesday [18 January], members discussed the results of the summit meeting in Prague. In the near future, deputy ministers of national defense and foreign affairs are supposed to "prepare conclusions for decisions" concerning the "Partnership for Peace." Council of Ministers Secretary Maciej Graniecki estimated that this would take from three to four weeks. In a radio interview, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak explained that the "Partnership" formula would be fixed by the partners during negotiations. Thus, the government cannot decide to participate in the program; it can merely decide whether to take part in work on it. Just before the session, head of MON Piotr Kolodziejczyk told journalists that our Army needs 500 billion zlotys to participate in the "Partnership." "Poland can afford it." However, in line with information we obtained, the prime minister does not want the expenditures on the program to be an additional burden on this year's budget. This would mean that the amount of money that has been earmarked for these ministries in this year's budget bill would have to be smaller, or that the additional money would have to be found "outside" (in various funds, for instance). Ministers suggest that the "Report on the Condition of the State," which they are obliged to draw up by the bill on amending the Constitution, be presented by the government toward the end of June and not on 31 March. Discussion on the "report" would then coincide with debate on the vote of acceptance of accounts for the previous year. It will be easier to prepare the "report" at that time because the Central Office of Statistics will have submitted all its data by that time. In line with the Tuesday resolution of the Pawlak Cabinet, the prime minister's Legislative Council is supposed to comprise fewer members: 35 instead of 60. The resolution also envisions departing from permanent working groups of the council. They are supposed to be replaced by ad hoc groups of experts. The council's members will receive fixed amounts of money. So far they have not been receiving any remuneration. If the Sejm accepts the government's proposal, the National Atomic Energy Agency will be financed directly from the state budget. So far it has been receiving money exclusively from the coffers of the Atomic Energy Research Committee. For the last time, the government set a monthly index of wage increase that is tax-free. In line with the decision of the Sejm, after the first quarter the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] will be abolished.
