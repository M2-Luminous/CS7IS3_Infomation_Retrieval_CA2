The two were meeting at the premier's official residence, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "They agreed that it is important for both sides to make further efforts" ahead to the meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Hosokawa in Washington on February 11, Takemura said. Hosokawa will confer with Clinton to assess progress in the economic talks being held under a bilateral accord concluded last July. Kantor expressed hope the Clinton-Hosokawa meeting will help the bilateral trade negotiations bear fruit, Takemura said. The U.S. administration hopes to successfully conclude the framework talks prior to the summit of the two leaders, who met twice last year. Negotiations on automobile and auto parts trade, government procurement and foreign access to the Japanese insurance market have been stalemated over a U.S. proposal on setting "objective criteria" to gauge the openness of Japanese markets. Tokyo has refused to accept the proposal, saying such measures would amount to setting aside a specific market share for foreign goods and services, tantamount to managed trade. Kantor, who came to Tokyo on Tuesday as Clinton's special envoy, did not directly voice dissatisfaction with Tokyo's stance. On the government's announcement of a 5.3 trillion yen income tax cut, Kantor said it was an appropriate decision but did not elaborate, Takemura said. Kantor congratulated Hosokawa on his success in getting onto the statute books a set of political reform bills aimed at rooting out corruption in Japanese public life, according to the chief cabinet secretary. Hosokawa narrowly pushed through his reforms, on which he had staked his political fortunes, by his stated deadline of Saturday, the closing date of the last extraordinary Diet session. On his arrival at the premier's official residence, Kantor told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that he welcomes Tokyo's decision to slash income tax by 5.3 trillion yen. "It is a useful step in the right direction," he said. After emerging from his 40-minute meeting with Hosokawa, the U.S. trade representative said it was "a very good meeting." W. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy, and Takemura were also present at the Kantor-Hosokawa talks. Asked if Clinton would move to revive the "Super 301" trade measure through an executive order, Kantor said only, "We'll save that conversation for later." Kantor said last month the Clinton administration may renew the punitive measure through an executive order in connection with the deadlocked trade talks between Japan and the United States. The super 301, in effect from 1988 to 1990, required the U.S. Government to conduct an annual review of trade barriers abroad and impose trade sanctions if those barriers were not removed within a year. On Wednesday, Kantor met with International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. He also conferred with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii earlier Thursday.
