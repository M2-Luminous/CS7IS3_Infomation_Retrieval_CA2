FR941019-1-00008 FR941019-1-00001 (6) Operating experience continues to show that the ability to maintain control of RCS level in PWRs during draindown and steady-state operation has been a problem. The principal contributor to events during some shutdown configurations has been identified as poor quality and reliability of reactor vessel level instrumentation. This problem is most significant during midloop operation, where a small variation in level can lead to a loss of DHR. PRAs have consistently found a higher risk associated with midloop operation than with other operational states. The requirements being proposed by the NRC are aimed directly at problems that have been repeatedly observed in operating experience, such as loss of decay heat removal, loss of ac power, loss of RCS inventory, fires, personnel errors, poor procedures, poor planning, and poor training. The proposed requirements reflect the NRC safety philosophy of defense in depth, in that they address: (1) prevention of credible challenges to safety functions through improvements in operations, fire protection and water level instrumentation in PWRs and (2) mitigation of challenges to redundant protection systems, through improved equipment controls. Equipment controls must be included in either technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). Requirements for specific equipment availability using plant procedures would be established by the licensee in a way that provides maximum flexibility by: (1) permitting the use of non-safety as well as safety equipment to provide safety functions; (2) permitting reduced decay heat levels to be a factor in developing such mitigating strategies as the selection of protective features and determination of when to put such protective features into service; and (3) allowing changes regarding the availability of equipment during the outage to be made without prior NRC review and approval. This particular resolution path has not been evaluated explicitly in the regulatory analysis; but the NRC believes that this approach to controlling mitigative equipment can produce a safety benefit comparable to that for the LCO approach. Relationship to Existing Requirements Technical Specifications Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule may result in changes to plant-specific technical specifications as well as to the standard technical specifications documented in NUREG&hyph;1430, NUREG&hyph;1431, NUREG&hyph;1432, NUREG&hyph;1433, and NUREG&hyph;1434 (STS for Babcock & Wilcox plants, Westinghouse plants, Combustion Engineering plants, General Electric BWR/4 plants, and General Electric BWR/6 plants, respectively). Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule requires identified equipment controls during shutdown or low-power conditions to be established in technical specifications or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls in support of specific safety functions, including such support functions as electric power. Section 50.67(c)(3)(ii) states that the controls must reflect sufficient redundancy in systems, subsystems, components, and features to ensure that, for the onsite electric power system in operation (assuming offsite power is not available), safety functions can be accomplished, assuming a single failure. LCOs currently used at some plants do not cover all of the safety functions recommended in the proposed rule. For some systems, under some conditions, standard technical specifications, as well as current plant-specific technical specifications, lack the redundancy called for in the proposed rule. Fire Protection The principal regulation covering fire protection is 10 CFR 50.48. It requires all plants to have a fire protection plan that satisfies General Design Criterion (GDC) 3 of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50. Appendix R to 10 CFR Part 50 gives specific requirements to be satisfied in complying with the regulation for plants licensed before 1979. Additionally, guidance for satisfying the regulation is found in the branch technical positions referenced in the regulation. However, this guidance was developed to ensure that the plant could be brought to a hot shutdown condition from power operation during a fire and does not address the condition of being in a shutdown or refueling mode at the time of a fire. Further, fire-protection criteria established by the regulations only require that at least one train of those systems important for ensuring an adequate level of DHR during cold shutdown and refueling be capable of being restored to service within 72 hours of a fire. In addition, NRC guidelines for performing a fire hazards analysis do not address shutdown and refueling conditions, or the potential impact a fire may have on the capability to maintain shutdown cooling. With the proposed requirements in the area of fire protection during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, it is the Commission's intent to supplement current requirements for fire protection with additional requirements to ensure that decay heat removal capability is not lost because of a fire during cold shutdown or refueling conditions. If the evaluation required by the proposed rule shows that fires would prevent accomplishment of normal decay heat removal capability, the licensee must either take measures to prevent the loss of normal decay heat removal by such fires or have a contingency plan in place that will ensure that an alternate decay heat removal capability exists during cold shutdown or a refueling condition. The contingency plan should describe the general steps to connect the alternate decay heat removal system to the RCS. The NRC staff recognizes that this could be done by revising existing regulations to include detailed supplemental requirements. However, the proposed requirements state that realistic fires during cold shutdown and refueling conditions should be evaluated rather than the more conservative fires that are analyzed under Appendix R. This realistic evaluation of available fire-protection features and the outage plan for possible fires should serve as the basis for further appropriate action. Permanent hardware fixes need not be employed as an option to reduce the risk of fire during cold shutdown and refueling conditions. On the contrary, if the evaluation results in the conclusion that some changes must be made, the licensee should consider less onerous options to reduce the risk of fire such as: (a) modifying or relocating the activities that might cause the fire; (b) constructing temporary fire barriers; or (c) revising plant procedures. Instrumentation The NRC believes the proposed action regarding installation in a PWR of new reactor vessel water level instrumentation, including an alarm, is a cost-justified substantial safety enhancement and the costs of implementation are justified in the view of the substantial benefit that is provided. 5 This action stems from a desire to eliminate losses of the RHR system due to air ingestion caused by operator error when lowering water level to achieve a midloop condition. The additional level instrumentation would supplement the improved level instrumentation adopted voluntarily by all affected licensees in response to GL 88&hyph;17, ``Loss of Decay Heat Removal.'' 5 The staff's regulatory analysis includes the assumption that BWR water level instrumentation will be operable during cold shutdown and refueling operations in accordance with current standard technical specifications. The results of the analysis support the conclusion that improvements in BWR water level instrumentation used during shutdown operations are not warranted. Recent concerns with the accuracy of BWR water level instrumentation are being addressed by utilities with actions in response to NRC Bulletin 93&hyph;03, dated May 28, 1993. Those actions will ensure that BWR water level instrumentation will function as assumed in the regulatory analysis.
