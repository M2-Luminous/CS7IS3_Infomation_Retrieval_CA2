Li Laizhu replaced Wang Chengbin to become the eighth commander of the Beijing MR. Yang Yong was the seventh commander of the Beijing MR for nine years. His tenure was the longest of all. Chen Xilian and Qin Jiwei were next. Both of them stayed on the post for seven years. The tenure of both Li Desheng and Zhou Yibing was the shortest one for less than three years. Wang Chengbin was at this post for three years and nine months, and the first commander of the Beijing MR Yang Chengwu stayed on his post for three and half years. Li Laizhu Comes From 2d Field Army Just like Yang Yong, Li Desheng, Chen Xilian and Qin Jiwei, Li Laizhu comes from the PLA 2d Field Army which was under the command of Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping. The only difference is that all the several predecessors of his were veteran Red Army members who fought hundreds of battles during the 10-year civil war, while Li Laizhu, just like his predecessor Wang Chengbin, were cadres of the 1938 era who joined the army in the later stage of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression. Li Laizhu's Hometown in Northwest Shandong Li Laizhu was born in 1932 in Shenxian County, located in northwest Shandong Province. Shenxian County was a part of the anti-Japanese base area in northwest Shandong built by the Chinese Communists during the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression . The Northwest Shandong District was originally under the administration of the Sixth Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shandong Province, which has jurisdiction over 12 counties including Liaocheng, Chiping, Boping, Tangyi, Kouxian, Shouzhang, Yanggu and Shenxian County. The district cut across the Yellow River and was located along the border of Hebei, Shandong and Honan. In November 1936, Fan Zhuxian was appointed Commissioner of the Sixth Shandong Provincial Special District of the Kuomintang Government. After the "Lugouqiao Incident" in 1937, Zhang Linzhi, Director of the Organization Department under the Shandong Provincial CPC Committee, led more than 70 Chinese Communist Party members and students who were forced to leave their native places to go to the Liaocheng Prefecture to carry out activities against Japanese aggression and for national salvation. They also built fine relations with Fan Zhuxian and formed a united front with him. Liaocheng fell into the Japanese hands on 15 November 1938. Fan Zhuxian, CPC member Zhang Yuguang and 600 soldiers and civilians died for the country during this campaign. Yang Yong Opened Up Northwest Shandong Base Area The Western Shandong Regional CPC Committee was established in January 1938. Zhang Linzhi was appointed secretary of the committee. The 686th Regiment of the 115th Division of the Eight Route Army (Regiment Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar Su Zhenhua) moved into the region and spread the War against Japanese Aggression to areas west of the Yun River. The main military forces boldly drove to the areas west of the Tai Mountains in April. In July, those PLA units in areas west of the Yun River became an independent brigade of the 115th Division. Yang Yong was appointed the brigade commander and concurrently political commissar of the brigade. Then, the area west of the Yun River and that west of the Tai Mountains joined together. The Juancheng-Juye-Heze-Jiaxiang-Wenshang-Yuncheng Border Region was established in August 1939. It stretched further toward northwest Shandong. In the winter of 1939, the Eighth Route Army troops which entered northwest Shandong opened up base areas in Shouzhang, Fanxian, Yanggu, Liaocheng, Shenxian, Chaocheng and Guancheng. The West Shandong Military District was established in April 1940. The 343rd Brigade (which became the 3rd Training Brigade later) with Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar Xiao Hua was stationed in the district. The area under its jurisdiction covered Jinan, Yanzhou, Juye, Juancheng, Guantao and Yucheng. At the end of 1940, this area was developed into a western Shandong anti-Japanese base area which covered the areas west and east of the Yun River, the area west of the Tai Mountains and the Northwest Shandong District . At that time, Shenxian was under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Shandong District. In addition to Shenxian, this district also covered Guanxian, Guantao, Chaocheng, Linqing, Qiuxian and other counties. After the founding of the West Shandong Military District, the Northwestern Shandong District became the 3d Military Sub-Command (Commander Bai Yun and Political Commissar Wang Leting). In April 1940, the Chinese Communist Party held a congress of representatives from 52 counties in western Shandong and set up the Western Shandong Administrative Office. Xiao Hua and Duan Juni were elected director and deputy director of the office. Li Laizhu Took Part in Revolution in Later Stage of War Against Japanese Aggression In July 1941, The Western Shandong District and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District merged. After that, they were placed under the command of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Anti-Japanese Base Area. In May 1944, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District merged with the South Hebei District, and the Northwest Shandong District became the 7th Hebei-Shandong-Henan Sub-District (Sub-District Commander Chao Jian-min and Political Commissar Xu Mengxia). Li Laizhu was doing some local anti-Japanese work in the 7th Sub-District in May 1944. He was only 12 years old at that time. Li Laizhu Joined PLA in February 1947 After Japan surrendered in October 1945, the 7th Hebei-Shandong-Henan Sub-District was incorporated into the southern Hebei area and became the 1st Southern Hebei Sub-District (Commander Bai Yun and Political Commissar Xu Mengxia). At the same time, the main army units in the Southern Hebei Military District formed the 2d Column (Commander Chen Zaidao and Political Commissar Song Renqiong) of the Shanxi-Hebei-Henan Military District (Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping) in Handan, Hebei. After the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communists started, this column took part in the Juancheng, Huaxian and other campaigns. In February 1947, the 2d Column and other columns moved to the north, and crossed the Yellow River for regrouping. They stationed in the areas northwest of Chaocheng and east of Daming which were under the command of the 1st Henan Sub-District. During the period of regrouping, the 2d Column recruited several thousand soldiers from southern Hebei. At that time, Li Laizhu who was doing some work for the 2d Southern Hebei Sub-District officially started to work for the army, and joined the PLA. He was 15 years old at that time. He joined the 11th Regiment (Regiment Commander Luo Chongfu and Political Commissar Li Xianzhong) of the 4th Brigade (Brigade Commander Kong Qingde and Political Commissar Liu Minghui) of the 2d Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Column as a fighter.

During the Huaihai Campaign, the 11th Regiment of the 4th Brigade of the 2d Column of the Central Plains Field Army, to which Li Lanzhu belonged, checked the assault from the Kuomintang Huang Wei Army Group at Dengjiadeng, northwest of Mengcheng. It fought for five hours and killed more than 300 enemy soldiers. The regiment distinguished itself in the entire Huaihai Campaign.

The 2d Column of the Central Plains Field Army changed its name to the 10th Army of the 2d Field Army (Army Commander Du Yide, Political Commissar Wang Weigang and Deputy Army Commander Fan Chaoli). Li Laizhu was a platoon leader of the 83rd Regiment of the 28th Division (Division Commander Chen Zhongmin and Political Commissar Yao Keyou) of the 10th Army.

After that, the division took part in the Korean War. In march 1951, Li Laizhu was promoted to deputy political instructor of a company under the 83rd Regiment of the 28th Division of the 10th Army. In April 1952, the 28th Division of the 10th Army was once again placed under the command of the 23rd Army Corps (Commander Dong Qiwu and Political Commissar Gao Kelin). Li Laizhu was promoted to a company-level political instructor. At that time, the official designation of the 10th Army was abolished, and the 30th Division originally placed under its command was transferred back to the Navy. Then the 23rd Army Corps was placed under the command of the North China Military District. The 23rd Army Corps was reorganized into the 69th Army and placed in command of the 28th Division and the 107th Division. Dong Qiwu was the Commander of the army.
