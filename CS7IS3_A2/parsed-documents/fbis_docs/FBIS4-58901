In a joint statement released simultaneously in Tehran and Johannesburg today, the two sides announced their readiness for resumption of ties after talks between South African Foreign Ministry officials and the Iranian interests section at the Swiss embassy in the South African capital. In Tehran, a foreign ministry spokesman congratulated the South African nation on the victory of the African National Congress (ANC) which polled 66.9 percent of the votes counted. Iran broke ties with South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1979. Switzerland had been looking after the interests of the two countries since then. Iran, which was South Africa's main oil supplier in the time of the defunct shah, stopped all oil supplies to the racist regime after the revolution. Thereafter the Islamic Republic supported the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination and sided fully with liberation groups at international forums.
