Russian authorities are at unease because the number of holders of Estonian passports is growing in the region, the leader of the Petserimaa league, Reet Tobre, said in a press conference today. She said Russia was demanding that these people formally gave up their Russian citizenship. But this would also strip them of the right to own real estate in the region. After giving up Russian citizenship they would also have to apply for a special permit from Russian authorities to enter the border zone. Tobre said Russia was constantly tightening its border regulations, thus making it more and more difficult for Estonian citizen residents to cross the border to Estonia. The leader of the lobbying group didn't tell the number of Estonian citizen residents of the Petseri region, an Estonian territory between the two World Wars, saying she would do so only after Russia reveals the names of Estonian residents who have become officially Russian citizens. The Soviet Union cut the region off from Estonia together with a strip of land in the North, east of the Narva river, and annexed the territories to Russia after World War II. The Russian embassy in Tallinn so far has only said more than 42,000 Russian citizens are living in Estonia. Embassy officials say they cannot reveal the names of Russian citizens, as Estonian authorities might begin a persecution of these people. Tobre said that was rather the case with the Estonian citizens living in Russia.
