A. Korotkov, Department of MathematicalPhysics; UDC 517.958:[535+537.812] [Abstract] A problem of determining the real characteristicsof the Earth's surface from its radar image, obtained by a radarwith a synthesized aperture is examined in this article. Theradar located on an aircraft moving in a straight line at aconstant elevation scans a section of the Earth surface in aprojection mode, where the transmitting and the receiving antennas are continuously directed to this section. The transmitting antenna radiates a probing signal, consisting of two electromagnetic waves with a parallel and perpendicular polarization; the receiving antenna records a signal, which is a combination of two waves generated by scattering of the probing signal by the Earth's surface. The problem consists of finding the scattering coefficient from the known radiating and received signals. With this information the Fourier form of the f(x,y)projection and the projection itselves can be determined, butonly for a narrow angular section. In order to reconstruct thef(x,y) function for the entire region, a method is developed fordetermining the scattering coefficient as a function of the characteristic of the Earth surface with a radar, making it possible to compute the desired coefficient using the data from apartial angular section, applying effective algorithms.
