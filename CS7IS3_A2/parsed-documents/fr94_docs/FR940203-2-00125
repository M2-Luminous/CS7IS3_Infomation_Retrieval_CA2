FR940203-2-00125 FR940203-2-00068 Changes: The definition of ``Career major'' has been revised to include reference to the ``equivalent'' of a high school diploma. Comment: One commenter felt that two years of secondary school and one or two years of post-secondary education would be too great a time commitment for many disadvantaged youth, particularly dropout youth. In the opinion of the commenter, disadvantaged youth with children or disadvantaged youth supporting themselves financially, necessarily require a faster route to employment. Accordingly, the commenter suggested that ``one plus one,'' or a condensed one year program, would better serve their needs. Discussion: The Secretaries believe that directing disadvantaged youth to abbreviated versions of the high quality programs being provided to all other students would serve only to short-change the disadvantaged students since abbreviated programs would fail to provide participants with the qualifications needed to obtain high-skill, high-wage employment. A high school diploma and, often, one or two years of further education or training are required for students to obtain the kinds of high-skill, high-wage employment envisioned by the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. It is important to note also that paid work experience_which is a basic program requirement of the School-to-Work Opportunities program's work-based learning component_can also serve to provide some amount of income to participating disadvantaged students. The students are also eligible for additional services under other programs such as the Job Training Partnership Act. Moreover, under this program, States and local partnerships retain the flexibility to develop innovative supportive services for disadvantaged students participating in School-to-Work Opportunities programs geared toward further assisting them to meet their financial and other needs. Changes: None. Definitions_Partnership Comment: Four commenters believed that the participation of community-based organizations (CBOs) should be required in program planning, implementation, and evaluation and, that to accomplish this, the term ``Partnership'' should be redefined to ensure that CBOs are not left out due to a definition that appears to make their involvement optional. A fifth commenter recommended that the definition of ``Partnership'' be modified to require the participation of ``teachers and related services personnel'' as a part of each partnership. The commenter believed that this was necessary to encourage the participation of certain individuals (including rehabilitation counselors, school counselors, psychologists, speech and language pathologists, audiologists, and social workers), who the commenter believes are necessary to the successful participation of students with disabilities in the School-to-Work Opportunities program. Discussion: The Secretaries agree with the commenters that CBOs will make important contributions to program planning, implementation, and evaluation of School-to-Work Opportunities programs and encourage partnerships to include them. Indeed, the Secretaries believe that most localities will choose to include CBOs because of the value that they are likely to bring to local partnerships. The Secretaries also believe that teachers and related services personnel are likely to be helpful as members of partnerships, and encourage localities to include them to the extent possible. However, the Secretaries are opposed to requiring the participation in all partnerships of either CBOs or teachers and related services personnel, and continue to believe that localities should be allowed to determine the membership in partnerships of entities or groups outside of those whose membership is specifically mandated through the notice's definition of the term ``Partnership.'' Changes: None. Comment: One commenter felt that the definition of the term ``Partnership'' appeared to call for the establishment of a separate local entity instead of a simple collaboration of entities and believed this to be an unnecessary bureaucratic layer. Discussion: Within the parameters and requirements specified in the notice, States and localities will determine whether partnerships are to be separate local entities or whether they are to consist of simple collaborations of existing entities or groups. The Secretaries do not intend the notice to require another bureaucratic layer or entity. Changes: None.
