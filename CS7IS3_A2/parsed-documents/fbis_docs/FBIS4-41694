Kvasov, Russian Federation minister and leader of the Government Apparatus, dated 20 June 1994, followed by reply from NYG Managing Editor Dmitriy Muratov under the "State Secrets" rubric: "We Report, Mr. Kvasov: This Is 1994!"] [Text] For official use To S.N. Kozheurov, chief [glavnyy] editor of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Dear Sergey Nikolayevich! On 16 June this year your newspaper carried a report divulging the contents of Russian Federation Government directives stamped "Not for the Press" on the purchase from the FRG and Austria of special property for the needs of the Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service]. I ask you to conduct an investigation and to report to the Russian Federation Government Apparatus on the source of the aforesaid information and the grounds on which it was printed. [Signed] V. Kvasov, minister of the Russian Federation and leader of the Russian Federation Government Apparatus. Dear Mr. Minister! In a letter sent by courier you demand an indication of the grounds on which the information about the government's purchase of a large quantity of foreign weapons (Walthers, Colts, Winchesters, Parabellums, etc.) and ammunition for them was published. I report: The grounds are that this is interesting information. You ask for its source to be reported. I reply: in accordance with the Law on the Press... only in court. If you deem it possible to shift onto us the responsibility for the regime of secrecy in the Government Apparatus, I will point out that it is not journalists who must keep your terrible secrets but you yourselves. We really do not understand very well why Tula or Vladimir "products" are not purchased for the FCS and the MVD and the government is evidently more attracted to deals outside Russia's "Golden Ring." Incidentally, as our newspaper reported 21 June, Boris Nikolayevich personally bought himself a rifle in Tula for 14 million rubles. A final point. The Government Apparatus has not reacted so harshly to NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA's articles about lobbyist edicts on the part of Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin in respect of a number of firms. But in general this makes me feel better: If there are state secrets, could this mean that the state exists? [Signed] [NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Managing (vedushchiy) Editor] Dmitriy Muratov.
