Britain is rightly proud of Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the man who has led the move from resolution to strength, from ceasefire into separation of forces. Yet John Major yesterday answered General Rose's plea for urgent reinforcements with a promise of no more than 60 mortar-locating experts. This is hardly the whole-hearted commitment to the NATO strategy of threatening force to halt the bombardment of Sarajevo which Mr Major was enjoining on President Yeltsin, although the Russians appeared to have reduced the tension last night. The Prime Minister insisted that Britain was meeting its obligations by redeploying two units from Vitez to Sarajevo. Britain already had over 2,300 troops in Bosnia, he said; it was now the turn of other nations to provide reinforcements to monitor the surrender of weapons. It is true that Britain responded quickly to the United Nations request for troops to protect the humanitarian convoys, and has the second largest contingent in Bosnia after the French. But Britain has also been consistent in its opposition to battlefield intervention and in its refusal to sanction either air strikes or a change in the role of UN troops. Last week Britain lost the argument in NATO, and agreed both to the threat of force and the de facto change in the terms of the UN mission from peace keeping to peace enforcement. Partly to cover its embarrassment and to demonstrate a resolution wholly lacking in its niggardly attitude to the new NATO strategy, the Government trumpeted its refusal to contemplate fresh contingents for Bosnia. General Rose wants British troops in Sarajevo because they have proved to be among the best in Bosnia. The attempt to secure Serb and Bosnian Government guns is the most ambitious military task yet undertaken by UNPROFOR [UN Protective Forces], the UN forces, demanding tact, resolution and courage as tensions and tempers rise. Largely because of Northern Ireland, British soldiers are more experienced than others in dealing with terrorist warlords and suspicious civilians; consequently they have proved themselves outstandingly capable in Central Bosnia. Commanders have brushed aside bureaucracy and rescued civilians. They have broken blockades on the convoy routes. They have remained impartial and uncorrupted. Redeployment from Vitez will leave a gap in an area as fought over as Sarajevo, where aid is as short and atrocities as common. Mr Major clearly believes that this gap should be filled by someone else -- Belgians perhaps, or non-European countries that might prove as effective as the Jordanians have been. This misses the point. Countries such as Jordan cannot send more troops because the UN is incapable of paying them. Britain can afford to wait for reimbursement. The latest opinion poll shows that the British public is far readier to accept air strikes than the Government appears to be. The American refusal to respond to the UN call confirms the confusion and double-standards that have marked out the Clinton Administration policy on Bosnia. The Russian decision to send troops may be helpful in persuading the Serbs to give up their weapons -- or it may encourage their resistance. Britain has long prided itself as "punching above its weight". All-round capability and a highly professional army mean that the country remains a formidable military power, one that has used this strength to reinforce Western values and UN resolutions. Mr Major's refusal to respond to a call for more troops just when their presence is most critical is yet another demonstration of half-heartedness over the NATO decision. It is a fudge that satisfies no one, least of all General Rose.
