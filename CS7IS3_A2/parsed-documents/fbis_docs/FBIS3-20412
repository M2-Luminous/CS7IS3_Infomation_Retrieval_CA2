On one hand, the basic needs of food and shelter for people living in towns and villages have been resolved, allowing them to progress toward a comparatively more well-off life. As a suitable balance between income and consumption levels has not been reached, a new state of heated consumption exists. Consequently, the people's overall consumption level is only in a temporary stage of stable growth, with part of the money transferred from the consumption base into the investment base. On the other hand, the people's economy is entering a new phase which is placing greater demands on the infrastructure. Add to this the need to revise the structure of enterprise and property, the opening up to the outside and the increasing use of foreign capital, all of which have sent the need for fixed asset investment into a relatively prosperous phase. This shows that growth in the national economy will increasingly depend on growth in capital investment to drive it. Such a leading investment model of economic activity has been maintained for three years. Since its beginning in 1991, fixed asset investment in China has continued its rapid growth, with fixed asset investment for the whole society that year showing a 23.8 percent growth over the year before. Growth for 1992 was 42.6 percent over that for the year before, and growth for the first half of 1993 was 61 percent over that for the same period a year ago (growth in some units was 70.7 percent). Historically, such rapid growth was seldom seen (except that during three years of the "Great Leap Forward"). Driven by this rapid growth in fixed asset investment, China's economic growth had also increased noticeably, so that the total value of the gross national product (GNP) in 1991 increased 8 percent over that for the year before; that for 1992 increased 13.2 percent; and that for the first half of 1993 increased 14.1 percent. Preliminary Results of Macroeconomic Control However, because overly rapid growth in fixed asset investment has exceeded the nation's present capacity to accommodate it, some outstanding problems accompanying this heated growth in the national economy have surfaced. Add to this the confusion in the financial order which has further precipitated a crisis in the supply of production materials because of this excessive investment growth. This was accompanied by serious inflation, import growth exceeding that of exports, a drop in foreign exchange and savings, market instability, and other such problems. As the result, beginning in June 1993, the Chinese government adopted measures to strengthen macroeconomic control, with hopes that by regulating the financial order and strengthening control over investment projects, it could control this overly rapid growth in fixed asset investment. During the last three months, exercise of related policies have seen some results, the chief of which are noted as follows: -- A marked drop in fixed asset investment. In June, fixed asset investment in state units showed growth of 76.7 percent over that for the same period a year ago, but the increase in July showed a drop of 71.7 percent; for August, a drop of 58.1 percent, and for September, 56.8 percent. For the third quarter, a total of 182.4 billion yuan (PRC currency) had been invested, a drop of nine percentage points from that for the first half of the year. Of this, investment in infrastructure increased 56.2 percent, investment in replacement and remodelling, 57.3 percent; and investment in commercial housing, 120.8 percent; each of which respectively fell back 11.7, 10.8, and 19 percentage points. From the first quarter to the third quarter, completed cumulative investment totalled 401.5 billion yuan, a growth of 66.4 percent over that for the same period a year ago, but a drop of 4.3 percentage points over that for the first half of the year. -- Slowdown in various types of privately raised capital and loans made domestically. In the third quarter, capital investment in infrastructure and replacements and improvements totalled 138.3 billion yuan, an increase of 48.9 percent over that for the same period a year ago, but a fall-back of 3.9 percentage points over that for the first half of the year. Of this, 33.9 billion yuan were domestic loans, an increase of 18.6 percent, but a fall-back of 5.4 percentage points. Various types of privately raised capital totalled 70.3 billion yuan, an increase of 75.8 percent, but a fall-back of 10 percentage points. -- Noticeable reduction in new projects. In the third quarter, new infrastructure construction and improvements totalled more than 14,400 projects, a reduction of 3,400 over the figure for the same period a year ago, and a great turnaround from the huge increase for the first half of the year. In particular, control was effective with a number of large new local projects, and major national construction projects also experienced a correspondingly smaller reduction. -- An investment slowdown in all regions. During the third quarter, completed fixed asset investment in the eastern region of the country totalled 101.4 billion yuan, an increase of 68.9 percent over that for the same period a year ago, though the increase fall-back was 12.3 percentage points of that for the first half of the year. For the central region, completed fixed asset investment totalled 43.8 billion yuan, an increase of 48.5 percent, with a fall-back of 4.6 percentage points. For the western region, such completed investment totalled 25.3 billion yuan, an increase of 48.6 percent, with a fall-back of 2.6 percentage points. While the investment situation in the eastern, central, and western regions does not show any greatly noticeable changes as a whole, it is still the eastern region by itself that shows much more rapid investment growth than the other two areas, the proportion of its growth comprising more than 60 percent of the total figure. -- Noticeable increase in availability of capital for major construction projects. During the first half of the year, because of the massive scope of investments and an excessive number of newly started projects, distribution of capital was scattered, so that major national construction projects experienced a capital shortage, with less than 20 percent of the total needed being available, and almost 20 percentage points lower than that usually available in other years. Since the third quarter, because of active regulatory measures taken by the state, this unfavorable picture has improved considerably. According to studies made, investment for major national construction projects had stepped up noticeably by September, and capital availability had risen to over 80 percent, of which 96 percent of the capital needed for railroad construction was available. Capital availability for nine major industries such as railroads, electrical power, steel, chemicals, petroleum, petrochemistry, coal, communications, and construction materials averaged 82.8 percent, an increase of 16.2 percentage points over the figure for the same period a year ago. Judging from present developments, it can be predicted that new increased productivity resulting from the major construction projects planned by the state will come to pass, which is favorable to enhancing the after effects of economic development. The changes described above show that the policy measures taken by the Chinese government to strengthen macroeconomic control of fixed asset investment are showing some preliminary results in the third quarter. There is no doubt that they will have an active effect in improving the macroeconomic environment. Remaining Problems At the same time, it should be seen that because reforms in the investment system have yet to be attained, present investment activity is still driven chiefly by the government, and enterprises have yet to truly become the principal body for investment. As the result, investment activity lacks understanding of risk, and blind investing with no thought of benefits is more commonly seen. The task to control investment growth and improve the investment structure is still rather arduous. Important problems remaining in the investment area are the following: 1. Increasing investment growth remains on the high side, and no noticeable change is seen in this picture. For the nine foregoing months, the rate of increasing investment growth remains over 60 percent. Preliminary figures for total investment by the society at large for the whole year may possibly exceed 1.1 trillion yuan, an increase of more than 360 billion yuan over the figure for the year before, an increasing growth of more than 46 percent, and expected to exceed the plan by more than 40 percent. Whether the increasing investments are in volume or in the rate of growth, they are the most numerous and the highest since the 1980's. The root cause of overly rapid investment growth for the year is the overly large scope of infrastructure construction. During the foregoing three quarters, the number of ongoing investment projects totalled more than 90,000, of which new projects comprised 38.6 percent, the highest proportion for the same period during the last few years. Infrastructure construction was allotted more than 1.7 trillion yuan, an increase of more than 500 billion yuan over last year, a growth of 40.2 percent. Because the scope is much too extensive, it will affect stable investment growth for some years to come. 2. The problem of investment structures not always being logical remains outstanding. Generally speaking, investment structures have undergone revision, with strengthening of some short-line assets, particularly transportation and telecommunications, which have shown noticeable growth. From the first quarter to the end of the third quarter, 71.5 billion yuan of investment capital were processed, a growth of 106.4 percent over that for the same period a year ago. The proportion of investment comprised rose to 20.5 percent from an earlier 15.8 percent. The pace to invest in major engineering projects such as the Beijing-Kowloon Railway was noticeably speeded up. But the problem of investment structures not being logical all the time remains, and this is manifested chiefly in three areas. First, investment growth in the third stage industries, with the exception of transportation and telecommunications, has been advancing too fast. In the foregoing nine months, completed investments in the third stage industries totalled 154.3 billion yuan, a growth of 95.7 percent over that for the same period a year ago, and 69.3 percentage points and 55.8 percentage points respectively, over that for investments in the first stage and second stage industries. The proportion of industrial investment rose from 36 percent to 44.1 percent. Except for the 82.7 billion yuan invested in transportation and telecommunications, this increasing investment in the third stage industries grew 87.3 percent, 27.7 percentage points higher than investment growth for the nation as a whole. The proportional investment was as high as 23.7 percent, a rise of 3.5 percentage points over that for the same period a year ago. Second is the fact that the proportion of investment in the infrastructure continues to drop. For the past three quarters, investment in the first stage industries was 7.9 billion yuan, a growth of 26.4 percent over that for the same period a year ago, the proportional investment dropping from 2.9 percent to 2.3 percent. Among the second stage industries, investments in energy and raw materials totalled 113.7 billion yuan, a growth of 33.6 percent and a proportional investment of 36.8 percent, a drop of 7.1 percentage points from the 43.9 percent figure for the same period a year ago. Third is inadequate emphasis on investments to be clear, and of good quality and high grade. From January to September, among investments made by state units, 135.9 billion yuan was invested on new construction projects, a growth of 86.5 percent over that for the same period a year ago, and 20 percentage points higher than the national average. The proportional investment rose from 33.3 percent to 38.8 percent. But investments used for remodeling and expansion totalled only 187.4 billion yuan, an increase of 50.7 percent, but a fall-back from a proportional investment of 56.7 percent to 53.6 percent. This does not agree with the state's regulatory goals. 3. The heat on real estate is still on. The disjointed contradictions in property sales is comparatively obvious. During the foregoing nine months, investments in commercial housing nationwide totalled 51.9 billion yuan, an increase of 134.2 percent over that for the same period a year ago, completing the state's 43 billion yuan plan ahead of time. For the year, this figure could possibly exceed 100 billion yuan, a one-fold increase over that a year ago. At the same time, the sale of commercial housing had been less than ideal, for total sales in the third quarter was only 14.4 billion yuan, a growth of only 35.6 percent over that for the same period a year ago. In comparison with growth in production, this was an almost one-fold slowdown. At present, commercial housing yet to be sold nationwide adds up to an area of more than 50 million square meters. This is due chiefly to overly rapid investment growth, illogical structure [poor design], oversupply of upscale buildings, and overly high prices which make such housing beyond the reach of average-salaried citizens. Of course the difficulty in selling commercial housing is also related to slow reforms in the low-rent system. Actually, there is not much construction of commercial housing on the Chinese mainland at present, for housing is far from adequate. Besides this, the phenomenon of capital defaults in the construction field still exists; this affects the requirements for the construction industry to operate normally. Important Countermeasures An extended look into the coming months sees growth in fixed asset investment continuing its steady decline, and the structure of fixed asset investment being further revised. However, for the state to achieve ideal macroeconomic control, further effort is still required. At present, it is most important to concentrate and improve on work in the following areas: First is sufficient scientific grasp of investment control to the extent that such growth will adapt to the need for stable and healthy growth of the people's economy. I feel that to maintain China's economy at a growth rate of about 10 percent, we must have fixed asset investment growth at a rate higher than 20 percent. An investment rate maintained around 35 percent actually nets investment growth around 10 percent. So it is not advisable to constrict investment too much. It is also important to avoid overly rapid investment growth, which may cause economic activity to lose control. This, in turn, will aggravate tension between various factors. Second is attention to improving the investment structure, so investment in infrastructure, basic industries and facilities can develop at an even faster pace. We must concentrate the necessary financial resources to strengthen the buildup in agriculture, transportation, energy, and important raw materials. While this is the driving force that assures stable economic growth, it is also the condition necessary to support the next cycle of rapid economic development in a healthy direction. Because of this, we must step up the pace of reform in the finance and investment system, and establish banks to finance and develop basic industries, expand the issuance of special bonds, encourage development of shareholder enterprises, further correct the pricing system, and stimulate and promote funneling of social capital toward construction of infrastructure and basic facilities. As to investment in most processing industries, all effort must be made to utilize available local resources, and manage them according to market rules. We must suitably reduce active investment by the state into these areas, to support development of short-line industries, and really loosen "bottleneck" restricting contradictions. Third is greater effort to improve investment efficiency, and cut down on loss and waste. Toward this end, we must step up legislative action pertaining to investment to improve the democratic and scientific aspects of investment policy, and systematically assure the efficiency of construction projects. At the same time, we must strengthen macroeconomic control of investment at the source, and exercise necessary management of capital flow, to guarantee the capital needs of the state's important construction projects. Furthermore, information on the state's property policies must be issued in a timely manner, to strengthen guidance, and to reduce blind investment by society. With respect to public investment and use of foreign capital, we must move gradually from ownership management to property policy management, and prepare corresponding policy measures to assure that the state's overall situation be scientific and logical. Basically speaking, we must implement a body of investment gradually, for it to evolve from the government toward enterprises and individuals, thereby overcoming the abuses of "everyone eating from the same pot."
