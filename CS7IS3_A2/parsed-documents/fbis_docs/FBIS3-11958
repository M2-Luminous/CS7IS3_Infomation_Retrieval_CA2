Those who are complaining that they cannot enjoy the service of Electricity of Haiti [EDH] are numerous. The fortunes of commerce, media, and other institutions are at their lowest ebb, waiting for God's help. On that score, we met on 22 March with Reynald Delerme, manager and owner of [television station] PVS Antenne 16, who did not conceal his concerns given this acute crisis. [Begin recording] [Delerme] "There are two ways for us to operate: Either we accept being forcesd to slowly stop because no more resources are possible or we cope with the situation the way it is and decide to work around the situation. As for us, we have adopted the second option. When there is power, we work; when there is no power, we do not work. [Unidentified reporter] "But EDH has been announcing for a few days that there will be power in about two months. This was implied. We have noted that there is no power at all anywhere. Personally, I am amazed to see Port-au-Prince experiencing blackouts. How have you been getting along for these 15 days? Have you used a generator? Or have you had some power? [Delerme] "No, as I told you, in Boutiliers [the mountain where Port-au-Prince FM radio and television stations maintain their transmitters], the power is on at least three or four times a week except for last week when it was actually out for five or six days. But in general, we manage to work three or four times a week. Now, if the power is on at 0600, we work at 0600; if it is on at 0900, we work at 0900. This is how we have managed to work because we are not willing to work any other way. To function another way.... [pauses] For the time being, a gallon of fuel oil costs $15 to 16. This means the expense has increased about 800% and there is no way to impose an additional 800% fee on the businessmen for their advertisements." [end recording]
