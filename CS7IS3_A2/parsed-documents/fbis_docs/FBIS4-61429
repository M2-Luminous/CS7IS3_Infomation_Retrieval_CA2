As became clear from the discussion, in 20 of the republic's rayons the bloc's activists had not yet submitted registration documents to rayon executive organs. In seven of them the documents have been submitted and the organizations have been registered. RiZ has postponed the question of compiling a consolidated list for the forthcoming elections to representative organs of power of the Republic of Tatarstan until the lists of candidate deputies in political organizations are coordinated. The greatest amount of discussion was evoked by the second question on the agenda, which was raised by republic People's Deputy Z. Latypov--on the RiZ voter bloc subscribing to the Agreement on Accord signed on 28 April in Moscow. Opinions differed sharply. The bloc's leader, State Duma Deputy I. Grachev, stated that because of his participation in the Yabloko faction he could not support Z. Latypov's initiative. But he feels all right about the signing. In the voting, I. Grachev and also RiZ acting chairman, I. Sultanov, and the leader of the city party organization created on the basis of Russia's Choice, D. Galyautdinov, abstained. As usual, the discussion and the outcome of the voting led the disputing parties to personal accusations. And although in the corridors things did not reach the point of "physical disagreement," during the recess certain hotheads lapsed into unprintable language. In our opinion, the ideological separation of liberals and democrats within the RiZ bloc is proceeding painfully but predictably. The position against signing the still unstudied text of the agreement was argued most consistently by the chairman of the Tatar division of the SDPR [Social Democratic Party of Russia], Deputy Chairman of Vakhitovskiy Rayon Soviet Yu. Rostovshikov, and the leader of the local organization of the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia], I. Konov? In the end 11 members of the council of the RiZ bloc voted in favor of joining the Agreement on Accord. They were one vote short of having enough to adopt a decision.
