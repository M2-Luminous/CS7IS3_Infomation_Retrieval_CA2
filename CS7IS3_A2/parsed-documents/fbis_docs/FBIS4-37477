That group, the sources said, offers itself as an alternative "to the current political line and is preparing to topple the present government." They quoted people close to Sifi's government as saying that "behind that move, there are judicial files against Selim Saadi who formed a number of companies in Tunisia in the names of his relatives when he was agriculture minister and then interior minister, as well as large files against Boubakr Belkaid and one of his in-laws since Boukaid was construction minister, then higher education minister, then information minister, and finally interior minister." They added that it is not unlikely that "the political activities of the trio opposed to dialogue and reconciliation with the Islamists are just a reaction to protect their political and financial interests." The sources believe that these figures "are trying to use the card of [the anniversary of] the late President Mohamed Boudiaf (former chairman of the Higher State Council) to support Saeed Saadi, leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy, in a move to stage a procession on 29 June despite Saadi's denial that he was exploiting Boudiaf's assassination anniversary to stage the procession." Media sources in Algeria say that Selim Saadi, interior minister under Redha Malek, "had seen himself as the successor to Ali Kafi (Higher State Council chairman) because of the support he was and still is getting from his ally Gen. Mohamed Touati and his group. That was clearly evident in the meetings Saadi held with local officials in Algerian provinces. It was noticed then that he was speaking not in his capacity as interior minister but rather more like a head of state, a matter which created extreme sensitivity between him and Ali Kafi and then between him and the current President Liamine Zeroual who dismissed Redha Malek's government because of the attitude of Saadi who exceeded his limits to the point of speaking on behalf of the military establishment." While the "trio" is planning to topple the government, the latter is proceeding with its plan to define its policies, solve new problems such as those related to the official certificate examinations, and introduce central administrative changes at Algiers University and some institutes.
