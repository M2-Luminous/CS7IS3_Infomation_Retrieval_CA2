Giurescu commentary: "Romanian-Russian Military Accord"] [Text] On 28 March the Russian minister of national defense, Army General Pavel Grachev, arrived in Romania. During his visit he signed a military accord between the two countries. The accord includes several domains of cooperation: technical cooperation, the training of expert cadres, operational cooperation, cooperation in the medical and military history domains, and so on. Romanian officials noted that the recently signed document is similar to the ones concluded by Romania with other states. At his 30 March news conference Army General Pavel Grachev made a number of statements that should be noted: a) "Russia," he said, "recognizes the sovereign right of every state to choose its own way, but it reserves the right to influence in a civilized way those evolutions that concern its own security." Romanian public opinion can remember very well that in the name of its own security the Soviet Government imposed communist regimes in all central-eastern and southeastern European countries. Those regimes were born in 1944-1945 and ended in 1989. Also perfectly well known are the armed involvement in November 1956 in Hungary and in August 1968 in Czechoslovakia, and currently the 14th Army's presence and action on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, merely 100 km from its border with Romania. The concept of "influencing in a civilized way those evolutions that concern its own security" can lead any time to most comprehensive and direct involvements in the affairs of the neighboring countries. b) At the same news conference Army General Pavel Grachev also stated: "Throughout its history Russia has never attacked anyone, never conquered anyone, but rather merely defended itself, as it was always the attacked party." That assertion baffles all people having some knowledge of history. It makes Romanian citizens and those of the neighboring countries even more fearful and suspicious, as they recall their not-so-long-ago history. However, the importance of the visit of Minister Pavel Grachev lies in the fact that it highlighted one of Romania's essential issues: its relations with Russia. To have good and stable relations with Russia is a sine qua non condition. However, Romania's renewed dependence -- even if it is a "civilized" one -- upon that Eastern superpower cannot be accepted, nor repeated any more. Be it "civilized" or not, dependence still means submission. The Romanian delegation conducting the talks with Army General Pavel Grachev reminded him, and did so rightly, that Romania opposes all theories intended to divide Europe into spheres of influence. However, that is not the end of the story. In Romania there are groups that politically incline toward the East. They directly manifested themselves when the friendship and cooperation treaty with the USSR was elaborated and initialed in April 1991. Those groups are also supported [by parties]. The left-wing and the nationalist-communist parties attract, according to recent IRSOP [Romanian Institute for Public Opinion] polling and IMAS [Applied Media Research Institute] polls, about 20-21 percent of the electorate. The domestic groups pursuing Romania's alignment to the East are acting within the somewhat confused situation in which the central-eastern and southeastern European countries find themselves with respect to their political and military security.
