FR940325-1-00085 FR940325-1-00008 The principal author of this proposed rule is George W. Ramey, Range Conservationist, BLM Washington Office (WO) Division of Rangeland Resources, assisted by other members of the WO Division of Rangeland Resources, numerous BLM field office personnel, personnel from the Washington Office and various field offices of the Forest Service, and Mark W. Stiles of the BLM WO Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management. The BLM and the Forest Service, as a cooperating agency, are preparing a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) on rangeland reform as announced in the Federal Register on July 13, 1993, and August 13, 1993. A notice of availability of the draft EIS will be published in the Federal Register . The draft EIS will invite public comment. Following the comment period on the draft EIS, a final EIS will be developed. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department has prepared an initial Small Entities Flexibility Assessment analyzing the economic impact of this rulemaking on small entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605 et seq. ). The initial assessment found that although some marginally profitable small livestock businesses that are highly dependent on public land grazing could experience significant economic impacts, most small businesses, organizations, and governments would not experience significant economic effects. The initial assessment is available at the address provided above. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12630, the Attorney General Guidelines, Department of the Interior Guidelines, and the Attorney General Supplemental Guidelines to determine the takings implications of the proposed rule if it were promulgated as currently drafted. Because the relevant statutes and regulations governing grazing on Federal land and case law interpreting said statutes and regulations have consistently recognized grazing on Federal land as a revocable license and not a property interest, it has been determined that this proposed rule does not present a risk of a taking. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The collections of information contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. and assigned clearance numbers: 1004&hyph;0005, 1004&hyph;0019, 1004&hyph;0020, 1004&hyph;0041, 1004&hyph;0047, 1004&hyph;0051, and 1004&hyph;0068.
