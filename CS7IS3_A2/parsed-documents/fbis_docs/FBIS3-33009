This is what Ambassador Jean De Ruyt, chairman of the circle of friends (the so-called Amicale) of Belgian diplomats wrote in a letter to the minister. Last week, De Ruyt published extracts from the letter in the Amicale's newsletter. The Staes affair concerns the visit of Muslim leader Amanullah Khan from Kashmir to Brussels in October 1993. [passage omitted] In his letter, De Ruyt adopts a particularly critical stance regarding Willy Claes. Among other things, he writes that in instances where the administrative responsibility of an ambassador is at issue, "this responsibility may not be personalized, nor may it lead to judgments relating to the individual involved." "To the extent that various people (in Brussels) were involved in the incident, we believe that it would have been better to wait until the investigation had yielded the necessary elements, before making ambassador responsible for what happened." "For someone who has devoted his entire career to the department, showing a professional commitment to which many of his colleagues could bear witness, these personal attacks (by Willy Claes -- DE STANDAARD editor's note), to which he was unable to respond, caused moral damage from which it will be difficult to recover." De Ruyt went on to indicate that the Amicale was considering whether or not to write a letter to the director general of the chancellery, in order to point out the problems arising with regard to the issuing of the visa. These problems include: A "complex mass" of circulars on the affairs, which "in some cases seem barely compatible"; the "difficulty of accessing" the equipment that provides the "black list," and the fact that only alphabetical lists in Roman type are used; and finally, the fact that the responsibility is divided between the head of station and the chancellor. Let us remember, in the chamber of deputies in recent months, Minister Claes has stated repeatedly that the instructions for issuing visas were "very clear," and "extremely precise."
