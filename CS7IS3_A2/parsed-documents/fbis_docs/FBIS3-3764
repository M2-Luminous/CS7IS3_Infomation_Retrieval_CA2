As part of China's economic reform, securities and futures markets came into being just a few years ago and are still at a fledgling stage. The event is aimed to popularize knowledge about securities and futures, promote the issuing of state bonds and vitalize the securities and futures markets, which have been running sluggishly of late. The exhibition will be sponsored by the Ministry of Finance, China Securities News, Beijing Commodities Exchange, China International Futures Broker Company, Beijing Institute for Research of Modern Economy, Beijing Securities Company and Beijing Siyuan Consultative Agency on Mergers and Bankruptcies.
