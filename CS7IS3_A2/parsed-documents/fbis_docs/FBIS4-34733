What Menem did in Cartagena, Colombia, was an act of provocation. He waited for the last moment of the Ibero-American Summit to create a disagreeable diplomatic situation in keeping with a political line that has become commonplace at all the international forums he attends -- and Menem attends all the forums he can. Menem, who is an exhibitionist, implements demagogic actions in foreign policy aimed at domestic campaigns in which he relies on voters' short memories to make them promises he will hardly be able to comply with later. Since the Persian Gulf War, when Argentina sent a small squadron to the theater of operations that did not do anything, through the controversial approval of NAFTA, Menem attempted to please the White House at any cost. He will make any deal for an interview with the U.S. President. On this occasion, Menem has visibly offered the United States to simultaneously bomb two candidacies for the WTO presidency: Ricupero, who represents the developing countries, and Renato Ruggero, the former Italian economy minister who represents the EC. Within this context, Salinas seems a docile candidate for the White House, which is willing to play the role of an interested friend. Menem's unexpected support for Salinas is a serious matter because 10 days earlier, Itamaraty had informed the Argentine and Mexican Governments that Ricupero would be a candidate for WTO chairman. In diplomatic language, Argentina and Mexico "got the message" of Brazil's intention. Within the context of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and relations among Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, which have been engaged in economic commitments since the beginning of the year, it was more than obvious that naming Ricupero should be an essential maneuver. During the last OAS meeting in Belem, when most of the countries that attended the meeting, including Brazil, spoke in favor of Cuba joining the organization, Menem went against the tide and automatically sided with the United States. He could not miss that chance. In an extravagant manner, he stands out from the other leaders of this part of the world. He is an apple polisher. Not even the United States is as resentful. Evidence of this is its economic closeness to Vietnam (where in the sixties it lost 50,000 men), Russia, and the PRC. To ignore Ricupero's candidacy and jump into the arms of Salinas is to openly support a policy that is ostensibly failing in Mexico. The Mexican electoral campaign has demonstrated that its political system is in crisis after one party's supremacy over the rest for 70 years. The alliance between Mexico and the United States through NAFTA is a desperate move to save a pretend democracy that clashes with the U.S. market economy system, political freedom, and free elections without fraud or violence. To support the Mexican regime at this point is the same as expressing distrust of the Mercosur partners. Menem has bet on an uncertain future. His words were like a green light to the Argentine business people who protest the invasion of Brazilian products and prefer to seek protection in a protectionist government instead of improving their competitiveness. This idea has prompted the formation of economic blocs like those in Europe and Asia, including the American continent, to overcome any obstacles to the world economy's growth. Since 1 January, Mercosur member countries have reduced their import tariffs 85 percent. On 30 June, they must reduce them 89 percent, and by the end of the year they must eliminate them completely. Mercosur is a reality that cannot be ignored. Chile, which first considered joining NAFTA, now is turning to Mercosur. Menem, by offering to serve the United States, is turning his back on his closest friends and undermining continental solidarity.
