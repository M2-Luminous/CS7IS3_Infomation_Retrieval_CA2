SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NHTSA has rigorously evaluated its major programs as a matter of policy since 1970. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) began in 1975. Executive Order 12866, issued in October 1993, is the formal government-wide requirement for Federal agencies to evaluate their existing regulations and programs. Since the mid-1970's NHTSA was a leader among Federal agencies in evaluating the effectiveness of its regulations. There are large data bases of motor vehicle accidents which can be analyzed to find out what vehicle and traffic safety programs works best. This five-year plan presents and discusses the programs, regulations, and related areas NHTSA proposes to evaluate, and it summarizes the findings of past evaluations. Depending on scope, evaluations typically take a year or more, counting initial planning, contracting for support, Office of Management and Budget clearance for surveys, internal review, approval, report publication for comment, and the last phase of preparing options for subsequent agency action. Most of NHTSA's crashworthiness and several crash avoidance standards have been evaluated at least once since 1975. A number of consumer-oriented regulations, e.g., bumpers, theft protection, and fuel economy, have also been evaluated. The plan for the next five years includes evaluations of new and existing safety and consumer information and protection regulations, plus assessments of specific enforcement and highway safety programs. NHTSA welcomes public review of the plan and invites the reviewers to comment about the selection, priority, and schedule of the regulations to be evaluated. The agency is interested in learning of any additional data that may be useful in the evaluations. The plan will be periodically updated in response to public and agency needs, with a complete revision scheduled very four years. Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose, in the envelope with their comments, a self-addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail. (15 U.S.C. 1392, 1401, 1407; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8) Issued on: June 3, 1994. Donald C.
