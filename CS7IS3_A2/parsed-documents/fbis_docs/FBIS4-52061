FBIS4-52061 "dreas088_c_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 North Korea South Said To Have Nuclear Bomb Capability South Said To Have Nuclear Bomb Capability SK0605110494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1054 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605110494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Preposterous Jargon" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam blared on May 4 that their "patience reached the limit" with regard to "the nuclear development of the North." Commenting on his remarks, MINJU CHOSON today says he must stop the development of nuclear weapons in South Korea, instead of charging others. The analyst says: In South Korea large quantities of plutonium enough for the manufacture of hundreds of nuclear bombs have been extracted from the pressurized heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and the multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok. Nevertheless, Kim Yong-sam is now hysterically crying over "the nuclear development" by the North, revealing his true color as a traitor to the nation. The traitor spoke ill of the peace overture made by the DPRK to the United States recently, alleging that the North "withdrew from the armistice commission" and it "is isolated." His preposterous jargon was aimed at balking the DPRK-U.S. negotiation, having the hostile relations maintained between the DPRK and the U.S., and stifling the North with the backing of outside forces. The analyst further says: His remarks are, in a nutshell, a thoughtless sophism of a fellow bereft of reason. The traitor, who is rejected by the people for his despicable policy of dependence on outside forces, North-South confrontation, irregularities and fighting within the quarters of power, made such remarks in the hope of diverting elsewhere the resentment directed at him. But, nobody takes him at his words.
