The measure is aimed at bringing the soaring prices of vegetables under control and guarantee vegetable supplies for Shanghai residents. According to a circular dispatched by the General Office of the Shanghai Municipality, only major construction projects and development zones planned by the municipal government are eligible to occupy a part of traditional vegetable-growing lands, with approval of the municipal vegetable leading group as a prerequisite. Also stipulated is that after being granted the right, land- occupants must pay occupation fees ranging from 450,000 to 900,000 yuan per ha. [hectare] in accordance with the varied grades of plots. The fees will be used for development of new vegetable- growing lands. In recent years, rapid urban construction and the economic boom in Shanghai have cast a shadow over the "vegetable basket" project suggested by local government aiming to supply residents with plenty of fresh vegetables and diary products. The past two years have seen more than 2,666 ha. of vegetable plots in the nearer suburbs of the city, which were important vegetable bases in the past, occupied by major construction projects and burgeoning township enterprises. The shrinkage of vegetable growing areas, coupled with the destruction of irrigation systems in existing vegetable plots, has affected the normal supply of vegetables to the city and caused a continuous price hike.
