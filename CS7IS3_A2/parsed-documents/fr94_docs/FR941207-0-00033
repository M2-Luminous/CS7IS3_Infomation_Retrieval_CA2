The credit equivalent amount of a rate contract is the sum of the current credit exposure of the contract and an estimate of potential future increases in credit exposure. The current exposure is the positive mark-to-market value of the contract (or zero if the mark-to-market value is zero or negative). For rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract the current exposure is, generally, the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of the contracts included in the netting contract (or zero if the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative). The potential future exposure is calculated by multiplying the effective notional amount of a contract by one of the following credit conversion factors, as appropriate: ‚ê£ 1Remaining maturity 1Interest rate contracts (percent) 1Exchange rate contracts (percent) One year or less 0 1.0 Over one year 0.5 5.0
