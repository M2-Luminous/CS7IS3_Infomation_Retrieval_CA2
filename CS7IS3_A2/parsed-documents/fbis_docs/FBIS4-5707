Seoul estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 North Koreans are virtually trapped in logging camps across Siberia, 120 to 170 of whom have escaped and are now seeking asylum in South Korea. Officials here are reluctant to even use the word "asylum" since North Koreans, under South Korea's Constitution, are its people. "Repatriation is probably a more appropriate word," says one Foreign Ministry official. Russia is said to make about 300 million U.S. dollars from the wood logged at the camps. It gives 100 million dollars worth of wood to North Korea to pay for labor. Escapees interviewed anonymously described how they and others had been deprived of food, beaten mercilessly and killed when caught trying to break out. A picture showing the chains binding these loggers set off widespread shudders. Both Seoul and Moscow are aware of rampant human rights violations inside the heavily guarded camps, but they have been unable to find an acceptable solution. Russia tried to press North Korea to improve conditions at the camps, threatening to cancel the logging contract that was to expire at the end of last year. The failure of negotiations, however, forced Moscow to extend the contract for another six months. Seoul had quietly tried to help the camp escapees, asking Moscow to issue residential permits and let them settle inside Russia, or look the other way for illegal stayers. But after stories began appearing in the media, North Korea went on guard and warned against any meddling by either Seoul or Moscow. In its latest statement, Pyongyang said it will hold Seoul responsible for "kidnapping" all loggers found missing in the future. South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, apparently conscious of Northern sensitivities, said last week he does not intend to allow repatriation of North Korean loggers at this point. "The escapees were quietly resettled, some in South Korea. But by bringing them to the public's attention, we ended up making North Korea nervous and forcing it to react," said the Foreign Ministry official. Even if Seoul boldly decided to accept the loggers, the problem would not go away but actually worsen. More North Koreans would try to settle in South Korea, worsening inter-Korean relations already strained by the nuclear row. Pyongyang could well accuse Seoul of attempting to absorb North Korea under the guise of human rights by taking in all of its people. Then there is the reality that Seoul would have to pay for the living expenses of the escapees if they were brought here. All of the 120 to 170 escapees would have to be properly housed, trained and employed on government money. Officials say it takes at least 10 years for a North Korean to fully adapt to South Korea. Some North Korean loggers are known criminal offenders, and accepting them would cause social problems, the officials say. Then there is a question of fairness. Seoul knows of an equal number of North Koreans in China hoping to settle in South Korea. Seoul cannot accept the loggers from Siberia while refusing North Koreans from China.
