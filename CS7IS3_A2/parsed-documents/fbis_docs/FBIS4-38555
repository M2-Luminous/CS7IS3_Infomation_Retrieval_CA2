Pavlovskis said that the agreement on conventional weapons in Europe, signed when the USSR existed, does not allow to displace troops in such a way; therefore Russia raised the question during the NATO meeting. The participants of the meeting decided that this issue could not be considered at the meeting. Nevertheless, the Nordic states' representatives were against Russia's proposal and they advised Russia to displace the troops from Kaliningrad to Russia's central regions, said Pavlovskis. In return, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev answered that Russia lacks money to dispalce troops that far and sustain them there. Pavlovskis stressed that Russia said it was willing to join NATO's Partnership For Peace program without dictating any rules. Pavlovskis noted that Denmark plans to include 40 Lithuanian soldiers in its army, who, after having finished a special training program, would take part at NATO operations in Bosnia together with Danish forces. Besides, participants of the meeting said they supported the formation of the Baltic Peacekeeping battalion, and they discussed political changes and security problems in Europe. After the meeting, the Baltic sea states' defense ministers met to discuss the cooperation between the Nordic and the Baltic states. On Thursday morning in Brussels, the meeting of the Baltic states' representatives took place. They coordinated one more time the Baltic states' stand in the first conference of the Nordic and the Baltic states' defense ministers, scheduled to take place next week in Visby.
