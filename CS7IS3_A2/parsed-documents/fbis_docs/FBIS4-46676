This 20-page text, which is fairly difficult to understand and analyze, was sent at the same time to the government and State Duma committees for remarks. In the opinion of the chairman of the Duma Committee on Economic Reform, Sergey Glazyev, the Law "On Advertising" should be a priority in the plans for legislative work. Legal regulation of the advertising market is a mandatory condition for its civilized development and protection of the consumer from unconscientious, not to mention false, advertising. In the United States, for example, the first judicial proceedings on unconscientious advertising were initiated in a case of the Federal Trade Commission (this state organization was especially created to combat monopolies and unfair competition as early as 1919). In the absence of domestic experience and the corresponding legal experts, we could make a big mess of the draft law. Actually, this occurred with the first version of the draft law (it was called "On Advertising and Advertising-Information Activity") prepared in November of last year by a work group consisting of workers of the Antimonopoly Committee. The isolated nature of the work on the document led to a number of legal errors and simply absurdities. A considerable portion of the draft amounted to assigning the Antimonopoly Committee an exceptional number of rights, including to impose fines. In essence, the draft (the first and second versions do not differ from one another here) introduces the position of a kind of "state advertising inspector" who has the right to give orders and impose fines for failure to fulfill them on advertisers, advertising agencies, and the mass media. And these fines are quite significant. In the second version of the draft the Antimonopoly Committee and its territorial organs may impose fines of up to 5,000 times the minimum wage (that is, as of today, up to 75 million rubles [R]) on a legal entity, and up to five times the salary on an individual. Let me note that for violation of the Law "On Competition and Restriction of Monopolistic Activity on Commodity Markets" of 22 March 1991 the fines possibly imposed by the Antimonopoly Committee are set in absolute figures and are much more modest (up to R1 million--the fine imposed on a legal entity; up to R2,000--on officials). Incidentally, the possibility of applying these punitive sanctions against unconscientious advertisers was first granted to the State Committee on Antimonopoy Policy and its territorial administrations two years ago. It is well known that Article 10 of the Law "On Competition and Restriction of Monopolistic Activity on Commodity Markets" includes in unfair competition deliberately false advertising, incorrect comparisons in advertising, unauthorized use of another's trademark or firm name, divulgence and use of trade secrets without the owner's permission... Nonetheless in two years the State Committee on Antimonopoly Policy and its territorial organs have not once taken advantage of these legal possibilities, and committee specialists in commentaries to antimonopoly legislation recommend combating unconscientious competition by filing charges with a general or arbitration court. What is keeping the Antimonopoly Committee, instead of signing letters to television authorities on the unconscientious advertising of MMM-Invest, from fining the "leader of Russian business" at least a token million rubles for the lie about the official approval of their "merits" by the King of Belgium and the European Economic Community? Why is it that while doing nothing to apply the rights they have in fighting against advertising piracy, committee specialists are demanding considerably greater ones? The real danger from introducing the post of "state advertising inspector" could be very, very great. On the one hand, as distinct, for example, from the tax inspector, the fire monitor, or the sanitary-epidemiological supervisor, the draft law does not provide him with any clear-cut criteria to use in his work. In complete contradiction to world practice, Point 2 of Article 23 of the draft establishes that "...in order to deem advertising unconscientious it is not necessary to show a fact of deception or a public danger of it. When there is a potential possibility as such, which must be proved by the organ of state administration (that is, the Antimonopoly Committee)...advertising may be categorized as unconscientious." In American judicial practice, for example, they clearly understood the falseness of this path even by 1931 (in the decision on the case "FTC v. Raladam," the U.S. Supreme Court developed a precedent according to which advertising may be deemed false or deceptive only if there is evidence of direct harm from it). On the other hand, anybody who is at all familiar with the ways of doing business here will easily understand what a desirable target for bribery the "state advertising inspector" will be. It will be possible not only to completely ruin the competitor but also line the pockets of one's own advertising agency or advertising department of the mass media through placement of counter-advertising, as it says in Point 4 of Article 25 of the draft, "through the same means of communication, using the same specifications of length, space, location, and order of presentation of advertising." Reading this, it is painful to recall our advertising realities: The rate for the smallest advertising space--1/64, for example in MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has already exceeded R2 million; and in order to begin any negotiations on advertising on central television you should be able to come up with at least 10 million. The Antimonopoly Committee is extremely timid and unwilling to share its rights with any professional association in this sphere. In Point 2 of Article 30 organs of "self-regulation of advertising activity" are given the right only to participate in overseeing the observance of legislation on unconscientious advertising "in conjunction with the corresponding organs of state administration." Yet, for example, in France it is the professional association of advertisers and representatives of the mass media that annually issue to the agencies the so-called accreditation card. Only possession of this card gives them the right to the traditional 15-percent rebate from advertising rates of the mass media. Such a practice of economic incentives for the advertising agency to observe legal and professional-ethnical norms would be more than appropriate for us. The clearly inadequate development of the draft in the professional environment is also indicated by such strange requirements as establishing the maximum volume of advertising in a newspaper no later than three months before the end of the subscription campaign or the need to store advertising materials for a year. Experience shows that the editors have extremely little chance of influencing the volume of the advertising flow; just as it shows that in practice there are no original-mockups of advertising in a form suitable for long-term storage, permanent changes made in a text by fax, telephone, etc. Fundamentally important norms in the draft are in need of concretization--the peculiarities of financial advertising (Point 6 of Article 18) and the prohibition of indirect advertising (Point 2 of Article 16). The Law "On Advertising" is among the normative documents which, on the one hand, are most important for forming a civilized market economy in Russia and, on the other, affect the interests of the majority of Russians who during the past three years have been forced, whether they liked it or not, to be active "consumers of advertising." The main thing here is to find the optimal combination of state intervention and professional public self-regulation which, in my view, the developers have not yet managed to do. It is not too late to rectify the situation--it necessary to publish the draft law for professional discussion and listen attentively to constructive criticism of it.
