FBIS3-19308 "drweu051__a94005" FBIS-WEU-94-051-A Document Type:Daily Report 16 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Bundeswehr Troop Strength AU1403195294 Hamburg DPA in German 1635 GMT 14 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1403195294 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bonn -- Despite its tough austerity course, the Federal Government will stick to the planned strength of the Bundeswehr of 370,000 men. According to the most recent white paper entitled "On the security of the FRG and on the situation and the future of the Bundeswehr," which will be presented by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe on Tuesday [15 March], the German armed forces will consist of 39,700 officers, 133,300 noncommissioned officers, 38,000 privates who sign up for a certain period of time, and 155,000 conscripts doing basic military service. A total of 4,000 reserve duty training places will be available. As DPA learned from reliable sources today, the establishment of the crisis reaction forces will be given top priority. "Together with its partners, the Bundeswehr must be in a position to transfer, deploy, control and support troop contingents to a limited extent but within a short time under extreme environmental conditions across long distances," the white paper stresses. The climate and geographic conditions outside Europe require suitable material equipment and personal outfit for the soldiers. To control operations of the crisis reaction forces of the Bundeswehr, far-reaching reconnaissance resources and communication are required. Air transport will play a major role in supporting the operations of the crisis reaction forces. "Air transport is an essential precondition for the extended tasks of all military services that support the operations of the crisis reaction forces, peace missions, and humanitarian operations," the comprehensive report points out. Regarding the future transport requirements of the crisis reaction forces, one must bear in mind that the bulk of the equipment and part of the personnel are usually transported by sea, but it must be possible to transfer troops with several battalions and their support units quickly and on a large-scale basis by air. According to the white paper, Germany's full sovereignty, resulting from the unification of both parts of Germany, and the extended tasks of the Bundeswehr represent a new challenge for the command and control organization of the armed forces. To make participation in peace missions under UN auspices and in humanitarian operations possible, the Federal Government must be able in the future to control the Bundeswehr as a sovereign army. The leadership structures in the Defense Ministry must be streamlined. The number of staff sections, subdivisions, and other sections will be "clearly reduced." The white paper contains clear support for compulsory military service because it ensure the operational readiness of the Bundeswehr. Because of the tight financial situation, the armed forces renounced important projects. For the period between 1995-1997, the defense budget will involve 47.5 billion German marks. The Bundeswehr will keep the three military services; army, air force, and navy.
