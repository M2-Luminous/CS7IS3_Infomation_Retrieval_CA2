Description of Amendment: State of California, Department of Water Resources, applied for an amendment of license to construct a new tunnel intake structure replacing an existing intake structure. The construction is necessary because the existing intake structure does not meet current seismic design standards and there would be an unacceptably long interruption in water deliveries if the intake structure be upgraded. The new intake structure will be constructed behind an earth plug, with the Silverwood Lake level lowered to elevation 3310 feet during construction. Upon completion of construction, the lake water level will be lowered to elevation of 3260 feet for removing the earth plug. The normal water elevation of the Silverwood Lake is 3320 feet. l.
