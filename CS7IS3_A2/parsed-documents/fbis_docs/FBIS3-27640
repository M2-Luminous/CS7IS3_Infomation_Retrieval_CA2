The meeting pointed out: The construction of these five economic zones and one economic corridor will play an important role in making Hunan rank among the country's top ten provinces. These five economic zones and one economic corridor will become the province's hi-tech industrial thoroughfare and export-oriented economic belt. Provincial party and government leaders Chen Bangzhu [governor], Chu Bo, Wang Keying, Tang Zhixiang, and Pan Guiyu attended the meeting and expressed high hopes for the five economic zones and one economic corridor. In 1993, the cities where these five economic zones and one economic corridor are located followed the requirements set by the provincial party committee and government for making breakthroughs and moving forward ahead of others in economic construction. They made marked achievements in reform, opening up, and economic construction. Calculated on 1990 comparable prices, the five cities' GNP's amounted to 46 billion yuan, an increase of 14.2 percent over the previous year and 1.6 percent higher than the province's average. Their proportion to the province's GNP increased. The meeting asked major departments directly under the provincial authorities to work out special plans to support the construction and development of the five economic zones and one economic corridor. The meeting explicitly demanded the following: The five economic zones and one economic corridor should directly transplant coastal areas' preferential policies on reform and opening up, as well as coastal areas' successful experience in this respect, and should apply them to large regions so they can turn themselves into a rapidly developing hi-tech industrial belt with strong functions and vitality. In accordance with the provincial leaders' requirements, the targets set for the five economic zones and one economic corridor leading up to the year 2000 will be divided into three parts: 1995, 1997, and 2000. At the meeting, the relevant prefectures and cities made the development program for the five economic zones and one economic corridor more specific.
