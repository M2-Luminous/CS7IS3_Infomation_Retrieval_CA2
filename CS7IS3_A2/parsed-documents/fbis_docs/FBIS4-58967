[Al-'Attas] It is regrettable to see such events taking place in Yemen. It is a war among brothers. Since the start of the political crisis last year, we have repeatedly warned against these events. We would like to emphasize that war is not the proper option or the suitable way to remedy problems. War will settle no issue; it will only spell destruction for the Yemeni people, which will affect every citizen. During the political dialogue, there has been an agreement in principle to define the main points of consensus, not to resort to violence or take up arms to tackle the existing problems, and to adopt political and democratic dialogue as an alternative. Unfortunately, and despite the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, the brothers in Sanaa, particularly the leadership represented by the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Reform Party, have persistently prevaricated over this issue and avoided implementing the Pledge and Accord Document. Instead, they opted for military confrontation as an alternative to the political and democratic dialogue. To enter a war is difficult. To get out of it is even more difficult. War could break out because of a thoughtless and hasty decision. But it is very difficult to get out of it. The situation cannot be decided militarily. There is indiscriminate bombardment by the brothers in Sanaa. Perhaps you have seen on television villages, children, and women being hit. I believe that serious action must be taken to end the war and resume the dialogue to tackle the problems facing Yemen. [Al-Jundi] Engineer al-'Attas: Both sides, in the North and South, have repeatedly voiced their support for Yemen's unity and vowed not to give it up. Is the ongoing war between the northern and southern troops for the sake of unity or is it a war to end the unity? [Al-'Attas] No war could be for the sake of unity. Military action is always against unity, because it results in rifts and problems and influences the political and moral elements that sway the feelings of the masses. Thus we have stated that any kind of military action is against unity and democratic practices. Nobody is thinking of seceding; this is not on the cards. The Pledge and Accord Document is the remedy that we have reached after an extensive political dialogue. The document remedies two basic points. The first is the current problems, particularly the military and security problems, and the second is the future of the regime and the state. But it is clear that there was rejection of this document from the day it was signed, despite the official signature on it and claims to the contrary. All actions prove that they are against it. They resorted to the military option by first striking at the 5th Brigade in the area of [name indistinct] in February immediately after the document was signed. [Al-Jundi] Some observers say the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] started the political crisis in the first place, when Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid decided to stay in Aden. As a YSP official, how do you see the issue? [Al-'Attas] This is not true. The crisis really started from the beginning of the unity, when the brothers in Sanaa disregarded the unity agreements, the small issues agreed upon to make this great Yemeni dream a reality. When these issues were ignored and the model of the Yemeni Arab Republic [North Yemen before unity] was imposed, the attempt to control everything and keep everything centralized in Sanaa. [sentence as heard]. [Al-Jundi] Some observers whisper that you, a prominent official in the YSP, were in Washington when the war started and that Salim Salih Muhammad, who is the YSP assistant secretary, was in London, that is, both of you were out of Yemen. Is there any significance in this? [Al-'Attas] First, brother Salim Salih went on an official mission to Arab countries and then stopped over in London. More visits were scheduled on his program. He intends to follow the program. As for me, I travelled abroad for treatment for acute pain in my spinal cord, which affected my right leg and hand. I attended the Cabinet meetings in Aden and in Ta'izz and took part in the meetings of the dialogue committee while suffering this extreme pain. Following the Ta'izz meetings, I left the country on 12 April, that is, before the crisis broke out. On 27 April, the brothers in Sanaa decided to initiate a military action when the president delivered a speech that day at the (?al-Sab'in) Square, giving the signal to start the war. The war started with a strike against the 3d Brigade, a southern brigade, in the area of 'Imran. This was followed by an attack against the Ba Suhayb Brigade in the area of (?Zamar). Despite the efforts we exerted within the Cabinet, at every meeting we faced problems obstructing the work of the Cabinet and preventing it from making any decision to implement the Pledge and Accord Document. [Al-Jundi] After Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Yemeni Defense Minister Haytham Qasim Tahir's dismissal, do you intend to return to Sanaa or to Aden when you finish your medical treatment in Washington? Will you take up your job as Yemeni prime minister? [Al-'Attas] First, the decisions made by parliament and the president are invalid, unlawful, and have absolutely no basis. This is because they disregarded the Pledge and Accord Document, which represents the core of national consensus, as well as everything else. Thus they are unconstitutional, invalid, and null and void. The Constitution gives no one the right to dismiss any person within the government. It gives parliament the right to withdraw confidence from the government. But this is not what parliament did. [Al-Jundi] Parliament dismissed al-Bid. [Al-'Attas] It had no right. There is nothing in the Constitution that says parliament is entitled to dismiss people. There is absolutely no clause in the Constitution that gives parliament the right to dismiss any member of the Presidential Council or government. Absolutely not. There is no such provision. These decisions are illegitimate and secessionist. They seek to consecrate the problem and the current military situation and to militarize the state, the machine the Pledge and Accord Document has tried to tackle. The document tried to build a modern and civic state, disengage the state and the military, and disengage the state and the tribes, so that a modern state could be established with equal rights given to all its citizens. [Al-Jundi] We thank our guest Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al- 'Attas on the line with us from Washington, where he is receiving treatment. We thank him. [Al-'Attas] Thank you very much.
