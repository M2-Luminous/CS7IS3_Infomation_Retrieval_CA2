"We are concerned that North Korea may not have understood very well the U.N. Security Council statement urging Pyongyang to comply with international nuclear safeguards," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "We want to urge North Korea again to take the statement seriously and actively take steps to resolve the issue," the top government spokesman said. The Security Council statement calls for efforts to help allay concerns that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons through dialogue, he said. Takemura's comment followed North Korea's accusation that the United Nations is "applying double standards" in issuing the statement last week. According to the (North) KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) monitored in Tokyo, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said pressure from the United States has forced Pyongyang to "normalize our peaceful nuclear activities unilaterally frozen" for North Korean-U.S. talks. Warning against any escalation of pressure, the spokesman said North Korea's policy is to answer "strength with strength, dialogue with dialogue." Last Thursday, the U.N. Security Council issued a statement urging Pyongyang to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of the capital, by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). North Korea has insisted the nuclear issue is not an international issue, but a problem to be worked out with the U.S. Japan's Foreign Ministry reacted calmly to North Korea's denunciation of the U.N. statement. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito described Pyongyang's statement as "not alarming" because it did not completely block room for negotiations to solve the problem of North Korea's alleged nuclear arms development. He noted that North Korea's statement said Pyongyang is still prepared to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem. "The international community will continue to expect North Korea to change its mind through dialogue," Saito told a news conference. He said the international community will continue to urge China to play an expanded role in solving the problem. He denied that Japan had asked Indonesia to mediate in solving the crisis or received requests from Indonesia to play a mediation role. Saito said the government is investigating the reported use of Japanese materials for stainless steel tanks that were installed at North Korea's new facility. THE WASHINGTON POST reported Saturday that an IAEA inspection team obtained evidence that high-quality materials imported from Japan were used for stainless steel tanks.
