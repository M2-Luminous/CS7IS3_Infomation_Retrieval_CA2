Speaking at the association's meeting on 19 April, Ingberg warned that adapting to enter the EU would place severe strain on an institution which has played a major role in assuring relative self-reliance and prosperity in rural areas since before Finnish independence. The cooperative movement, having weathered many problems over the past two decades, including the recent recession, must now face the challenge of a projected 1 January 1995 entry into the EU and must brace itself to end protective tariffs and to steadily reduce agricultural subsidies. Ingberg argues that cooperatives are going to have to implement many of the changes made by their domestic competitors, the larger "private" food conglomerates. Plants will need to increase the amount of processing value in their products to meet the import challenge, modernize their operations, and seek ties with both domestic and foreign companies which would permit specialization and allow the movement to continue it traditional place in helping to maintain viable small family farms and slowing rural depopulation. This, however, will require new sources of financing, since traditional sources--membership shares and domestic bank loans--will not be adequate. The size of investments needed will mean the movement is going to have to seek immediate infusions of venture capital, perhaps even from abroad since there are few Finnish venture capitalists. This may be a major hurdle, according to Ingberg. The cooperative movement will also need to change its marketing practices, never its strong suit, and become more demanding and market oriented, he concludes.

While the U.S. Government congratulates itself on strong growth and lower unemployment, Pourquery sees Wall Street reacting to projected inflationary risk and the Federal Reserve acting with "legendary prudence" to forestall such a possibility. The market--as well as Europe, which fears that higher U.S. rates will derail a hesitant recovery--is waiting once again for the Federal Reserve to make a gesture to fight against inflation. However, the gesture is late in coming and in the meantime the market's financial operators are distrustful of the Clinton administration's actions which they judge are often hesitant, sometime ill considered, and a bit "inexperienced," according to Pourquery. He concludes that the large majority of these operators, are dyed-in-the-wool liberals- -hardly "Clintonites"--who do not have confidence in this administration.

The authors imply that this report, in what it calls "a very official" publication, may have been an attempt by the Taiwanese Government to embarrass the French and to indicate its displeasure with France's renewed diplomacy with China which led to French promises not to sell arms to Taiwan. They suggest that the Taiwanese report contributed to Thomson losing the contract to arm the empty-shell frigates sold to Taiwan in 1991. The Taiwanese report claimed that Yin's assassination was "an affair of bribes and secret military sales." It argued that Thomson may have been involved since the principal suspect in the case was a Taiwanese citizen named Wang Chuan-Pu who was reportedly the local agent for several foreign companies, one of which was Thomson. "Captain Yin was assassinated after having threatened to reveal the misdeeds that he had discovered in the attribution of arms sales contracts," detailed the report. However, the authors note the report "temporized," stating that "Wang was not the legal agent of Thomson but simply an intermediary and that nothing allowed one to think at that time that the French company had been implicated in the death of Captain Yin." The publication of the Taiwanese report, which was destined for French readers, exacerbated French-Taiwanese relations even further, since it came only a few days after Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's trip to China, according to the authors. Furthermore, they add that it was published at the same time the U.S. Congress authorized President Bill Clinton to increase arms sales to Taiwan.

According to Seguin, the referendum would take place after the presidential elections next year and is necessary to unblock the social controversy over how best to solve France's high unemployment rate, much of which is not due to the recession but is blamed on structural rigidities in the French labor market. Labor unions unanimously criticized Seguin's plan. Secretary General of the French Democratic Confederation of Workers (CFDT) Nicole Notat claimed the plan was "too much" and that the question of employment was "too serious to be reduced to looking for a magic potion." Worker's Force President Marc Blondel complained, "The use of a referendum to go over the heads of the unions is a way to put us at odds with our representatives. ... It is no longer possible to allow double talk: to call for strong unions and then to destabilize them." The CFTC labor union noted that according to a BVA poll, 77 percent of the French think that unions are "an indispensable intermediary." Some political leaders also spoke against the referendum. Vice president of the Assembly's Union for French Democracy (UDF) group, Jacques Barrot warned that such a referendum would "risk a false and thus dangerous social debate that confines itself to announcing magic formulas." Former Socialist Labor Minister Martine Aubry claimed, "When I heard this proposition, I thought it was a joke." Furthermore Aubry noted, the search for solutions for unemployment "is the responsibility of politicians. If they do not think so, they should change occupations." (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 4 May 94 P 4) FURTHER REACTIONS TO EMPLOYMENT REFERENDUM--In an interview with former President and Union for French Democracy (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing by Patrick Jarreau appearing in the Paris daily LE MONDE, Giscard argued that a solution to the unemployment problem is "too urgent" to be left to a referendum. New measures are needed to respond to the French people's concerns, Giscard d'Estaing continued, noting that he will propose a number of them after the June European Parliament elections, "since one debate should not obscure the other." However, he concluded that Seguin's contribution is "worthwhile" because it raises people's consciousness on the need for an overall new approach to unemployment. According to Jean-Claude Vajou writing in the 3 May Paris daily LIBERATION, the Seguin-proposed referendum "appeals to those in the public who are against particular interests. .. by going over constituted bodies." Additionally, if a return to "direct democracy" through use of a referendum creates favorable conditions to oppose the "technostructure," it also may be a vote for or against the current government and raise questions of its continuing validity. In an interview with UDF parliamentary leader Charles Millon by Eric Zemmour for the Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN, Millon stated that he opposed a referendum, arguing that unless a simple question such as are you for or against unemployment" were asked--to which the answer is obvious--it is difficult to formulate a referendum on a subject as complex as unemployment. In addition, Millon noted that a referendum should not be applied to other than purely institutional issues, because extending it to societal problems would mean "increased undervaluation of representative democracy" at a time when France is already suffering from a weakening of such democracy. The natural result of a referendum, Millon concluded, is a democracy of opinion" or "democracy of the moment" aimed at any type of reform.

Although UAP was offered for sale at a time when the stock market was in a downturn and investor interest was weak--attracting only 1.9 million shareholders rather than the 2 to 3 million of previous privatizations--Leser contends that it was important to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to counter the failures of his 1986-87 privatization attempts. For him to delay the UAP privatization to wait for better market conditions would have also aroused doubts about his determination to pursue the program, permanently weakening the market for future privatizations. Additionally, it would have jeopardized the privatization of the second-ranked General Insurance Companies of France (AGF). Leser also writes that by offering a minimum price to shareholders, the Ministry of Finance also limited the risk of market prices undercutting the public offering price, as happened in previous privatizations. Institutional investors, and especially U.S. investors who play a major role on the Paris stock exchange, have recently complained of having purchased shares at higher prices than private investors. This time around, Leser remarked, "They are almost ensured in a couple of months, like small investors, of making a comfortable return on their investment.

An article in LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR characterized the results as surprising. While the article claimed most of the French were thought to be "individualistic and indifferent to militantism," a majority answered that labor unions are an "indispensable intermediary" between management and labor and that unions are the best means to defend workers' rights but only if they follow the German practice where unions manage companies in conjunction with owners. Respondents were asked the following questions: "These opinions are sometimes heard about labor unions. For each of them, tell me if you fully agree, rather agree, rather disagree or fully disagree." Total: fully or Total: fully or rather agree rather disagree France Germany France Germany Labor unions are an indispensable intermediary between workers and management. 77 79 22 15 To be unionized is the best way to defend one's rights and work conditions. 66 69 32 26 Without labor unions, there is no real solidarity in the work place. 55 63 43 32 Labor unions must participate more in management. 70 55 29 37 Labor unions are too politicized. 83 54 15 33 Today, labor unions are no longer adapted to the world of labor. 71 28 27 66 To be unionized is considered bad form. 50 27 47 62 "At this time, do you think that labor unions have too much power, not enough power, or just enough?"

According to the annual report of the National Federation of Safer, the average cost per hectare in 1993 dropped below 20,000 francs (Fr), reaching Fr19,970 compared to Fr20,500 in 1992, a 3-percent drop in constant 1956 francs. Actually, two facts should have favored a hike in prices. For one, farm revenue per hectare was maintained in 1993 and, according to forecasts, will remain stable at least until 1996. Secondly, to compensate for the CAP-mandated "land freeze," farmers are trying to increase the size of their farms. Despite this, the price of land (in current francs) continued to fall last year. Agriculture specialists explained the drop by noting the farmers' lack of confidence in their future and in the continuation of the level of direct aid by the reform of the CAP.

Skoda, a major manufacturer of heavy equipment and machine tools, has bought Umformtechnik Erfurt (UTE), a 1,600 employee metalworking firm with a 1993 sales volume of 202 million German marks (DM). Skoda agreed to save 1,000 jobs at UTE, to invest DM150 million, and to share ownership with the Trust Agency and the government-owned Thueringer Industriebeteiligungs company. The sales agreement permits ownership by additional partners, and Russian companies are said to be interested. Skoda's international relations manager, Jiri Kotina, claims that the company intends to expand its business with the automobile industry and that UTE, which supplies die presses to Audi, Mercedes-Benz, VW, and SEAT, is part of that strategy. Twenty-one percent of Skoda is held by the Czech Government and the balance by banks, investment funds and individuals and the firm functions as a holding company for 36 largely independent companies. (Charles W. x36473) (Berlin DIE WELT in German 2 May 94 p 12) EAST'S AGRICULTURE REBOUND OUTSTRIPS INDUSTRY' S--In an article in the daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Helmut Born, secretary general of the German Farmers' Association, characterizes the profits of privatized farms in eastern Germany as "respectable," noting that agriculture in the new laender had come out of the trough more rapidly than industry. He concedes that this was true only for crop farming and that livestock farming has not yet recovered from its "horrible bloodletting." The DM15.8 billion expended since 1990 to support and expand eastern German farming have led to unprecedented structural change and a reduction in the labor force from 850,000 to 180,000. For the farmers remaining in business, efforts are starting to pay off, partly due to the size of the farms in the east, which historically have been larger than those in the west. Now, however, a controversy is brewing between eastern and western Germany over the subsidies paid farmers. Eastern farms still have wide-reaching exemptions from taxes and fees and simplified rules for calculating valuation. Personal income per worker is higher for farmers in the east than for those in the west, the only exception being those belonging to cooperatives deriving from the GDR-era agricultural co-ops. With the upcoming expiration of the concessions, the farmers' association sees an opportunity to restructure agricultural supports. It is calling for a kind of mid- sized agricultural unit program extensively based on cheap credit that can be allotted to both eastern and western German businessmen according to uniform criteria. (Charles W. x36473) (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 10 May 94 p 18) TRUST AGENCY BOASTS MBO/MBI PRIVATIZATION SUCCESS--According to Trust Agency board member Klaus-Peter Wild, privatization by means of Management Buy Out (MBO) or Management Buy In (MBI)--the procedure by which some 20 percent of the 14,000 agency's companies were sold--has been a success. This counters rumors and speculation that MBO/MBI companies were facing a gloomy future due to frequently inadequate initial capital and short-term loan repayment obligations. These factors had not offset the advantage of selling to managers experienced in the respective firms and Wild said that the number of "serious problem cases" amounted to only 10 percent of the MBO/MBI sales, with a mere 2 percent involving bankruptcy or factory closings, although significant longer term problems were to be expected in about 25 percent of the companies. It was a matter of Trust Agency pride that MBO/MBI privatizations had achieved 115 percent of the guaranteed employment figures and that the value of investments reached 139 percent of the guaranteed figure. Wild noted that the Trust Agency continued to consult with company managements on current and ongoing operational problems, even if the firms had passed completely out of Agency control. (Charles W. x36473) (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 6-7 May 94 p 21) ITALY ECONOMIC CONCERNS OF NEW GOVERNMENT--According to an article in the Milan daily CORRIERE DELLA SERA, the new government will focus on solving Italy's unemployment and other economic problems. The article lists the main economic priorities and the government's plans on how to tackle them: Unemployment: Investments (which have been blocked during the "Clean Hands" investigation into public corruption) will be unblocked to create new employment opportunities. Laws will be introduced that will favor shorter work hours and part-time employment; apprenticeship programs will be modified to lower employers' costs; hiring practices will be liberalized, allowing companies with fewer than 15 employees to hire directly rather than from employment pools or agencies; the article of the 1994 Budget Law which established new criteria for awarding public contracts will be suspended. Tax Reform: Tax reform will be based on certain fundamental principles: The first 10 million lire of annual income will be totally tax exempt, personal income tax rates will be drastically reduced to favor middle- to low-income individuals, the tax payment system will be simplified, and personal income tax payments will be reduced from quarterly to semiannually. Privatizations: The new government will proceed with the rapid privatization of the National Insurance Institute (INA) and the National Electric Power Board (ENEL), fine-tuning the procedures for the concession of electric service and regulating ENEL's rates. Pensions: The law which allowed the creation of private pension funds will be revised to eliminate the tax burdens which have kept these funds from actually being established. However, the incentives to acquire private pensions do not exempt individuals from contributing to the public pension system. Only lower-income individuals will be guaranteed adequate living standards when they retire by tying pension payments to salary scales. Higher-income individuals will be compensated from available national funds only after lower-income individuals have been guaranteed adequate compensation. Health: Health benefit payments will be made directly to patients; a minimum level of assistance will be established, to be paid through taxation, which will be the same throughout the country. The service will be paid for directly by the patients with both private and public funds which will be disbursed to them by private insurance companies. Competition in the public health system will be stimulated by passing regional laws that allow hospitals to be run like private companies. Schools: A new method of financing schools will be established which will be equally valid for public and private institutions. Family: A new legislation that will favor families with children has already been drawn up, which will provide assistance in the form of "house coupons" for lower-income couples, extended mortgages for first-time home buyers, and a new system of tax deduction for lower- income families. To encourage the elderly to remain with their families, families who assist the elderly without burdening the state budget will be rewarded. --Immigrants: Immigrants will be given the same access to employment as citizens; they will be provided with adequate housing, Italian language instruction, and employment assistance.

Although it was expected that Alitalia would record substantial losses in 1993, the 345.6 billion lire actually lost was a surprise even to its president, Renato Riverso, and its CEO, Roberto Schisano. The loss amounted to 130 billion lire more than in 1992 and losses in the first quarter of 1994 already amount to 190 billion lire. Since the losses for 1993 amounted to more than one third of the company's capital, by law the board is obligated to call a meeting of the shareholders, which it has arranged for June. If by that time Alitalia has not reduced its losses to less than one third of its capital, the shareholders will have to authorize the company to restructure its capital. Reducing the losses, however, will not be an easy task and will require "great sacrifices," beginning with a complete revision of the company's reorganization which had been approved just six months ago. Alitalia's reorganization will be revised to include the following changes, which Schisano said should lead to increased profits within the short to medium term and will allow Alitalia to successfully compete on the international market: * Flight frequency and regional business, especially in the north at Milan's airports, will be increased. Romano Prodi, president of the Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry (IRI), Alitalia's main shareholder, said that because of the delay in increasing activities in Milan, Alitalia is losing 1 trillion lire yearly in business to Munich, Frankfurt, and Zurich airports. * Alitalia's fleet will be examined, possibly replacing the Jumbo B-747's with the more economical and flexible "twin-engine" jets. * Alitalia's assets will be reviewed. Alitalia will examine its sale of the Rome airports, for which there are already potential buyers. * General expenses will be cut and will include the probable dismissal of 2,000 employees through early retirements, incentives to resign, and "solidarity contracts." * Regulations for hiring aircraft crews will be reexamined, leading to expected increased productivity from pilots and other members of the crew, and may involve a cut in the number of pilots.

One way of determining this, das Neves contends, is to examine whether in the past Portugal showed financial stability in accordance with these criteria. Using available statistics, das Neves claims the following would be the picture of Portugal's economy based on historical performance: * Debt: Public debt below 60 percent of GDP. On average, Portugal's public debt during the 140 years between 1851 and 1992 was 54 percent of GDP, even if in 1993 it rose to 65.8 percent of GDP, higher than the Maastricht requirement. * Deficit: Budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP. The average government budget deficit in the same 1851-1992 period was 2.2 percent of GDP, again within permissible limits. It did rise to 8.25 percent in 1993. * Inflation: Differential between Portugal's inflation rate and the average EU inflation rate less than 1.5 percent. During the period 1870-1992, the long-term rate of inflation in Portugal was 4.6 percent. As the average inflation rate in EU countries during the same period was around 4.4 percent, the 0.2 percent differential meets EMU requirements. In 1993, the differential was about 3.1 percent, above the allowable limit. * Interest Rates: Differential between Portugal's long-term interest rates and average EU interest rates less than 2 percent. The average long-term EU interest rate during 1961-92 was about 9.3 percent. While it is difficult to gauge long-term interest rates in Portugal, as a result of using the Bank of Portugal's discount rate as an indicator it appears that the average rate for the same period was about 9.8 percent. * Exchange Rates: An exchange rate within the European Monetary System's (EMS's) original narrow band. This is the most difficult criterion to gauge, since Portugal does not have a long experience in EMS participation. However, it should be noted that Portugal did not experience difficulties in other systems of fixed exchange rates such as Bretton Woods, and that the Portuguese average annual devaluation rate in relation to the British pound--the currency used as a reference during most of the last 100 years--was 1.3 percent; by subtracting the last 20 years from that period, this rate becomes 0.14 percent, which shows significant stability. These historical trends indicate, according to das Neves, that Portugal is much stronger and more stable than recent events may make it seem. While it may not be easy to become part of EMU, it "will not be difficult to live in it," he continued, in contrast with other countries that may presently appear more stable than Portugal.

White-collar workers will have a 15-percent pay raise in July, followed by a 12- percent raise in October. * There will be no intervention in foreign exchange rates. * There will be no currency devaluation. * The General Directorate of the Office of State Equipment (DMO) and the Turkish Agricultural Equipment Board will be eliminated by the end of the year. * State-owned housing will be sold through bids. The occupants of the homes will have a preference in the bidding system. * Taxpayers will pay an additional one-time only 10-percent surtax on 1993 income and will have two years to pay. * Additional taxes on second homes and luxury cars will be levied. * The price of sugar will be increased 50 percent, gasoline 70 percent, and state monopolies, such as cigarettes and alcohol, 90 percent. All of the governors' offices will receive instructions from the office of the Council of Ministers, advising them to determine stocks, including sugar and fuel oil, and not to be lenient on hoarders. * The budget deficit will be reduced 100 trillion lira. * The growth rate will be reduced to 2.5 percent. * The government will increase its revenues by 300 trillion lira through the economic stability package.

She has given a promise to all of them and she is busying herself trying to keep her promise." * Republican Populist Party Chairman Deniz Baykal: Reported to be planning a trip to Karabuk to support the workers of the Karabuk Iron-Steel factory, which the economic program has proposed closing. * Motherland Party Group Deputy Chairman Hasan Korkmazcan: Stated that his party was not going to support the economic stability package, declaring that Ciller was a "political fraud." * Public Sector Workers Trade Unions: Members are cited as saying they were going to hold demonstrations on 11 April in Ankara Sakarya street to protest the stability package. * The Ankara Democracy Platform: This group--composed of the Turkish-Workers (Turk-Is), the Confederation of Revolutionary Workers Union (DISK), Public Sector Workers Union, and various associations and chambers related to the Turkish Union of Chambers of Architects and Engineers (TMM0B) and the Turkish Physicians Union (TTB)--is cited as criticizing the stability package. * The Istanbul branch of the Chambers of Construction Engineers: Members have stated, "Society will surely not take this bitter medicine without resistance."(Ender C. x36285) (Istanbul MILLIYET in Turkish 8 Apr 94 p 11) FORMER CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR PROPOSES SOLUTIONS--Rusdu Saracoglu, former governor of the Central Bank, speaking at the Institute of Banking and Insurance of the University of Marmara, provided some scenarios for the future of Turkey's economy: * If the True Path Party-Socialist Populist Party (DYP-SHP) Coalition continues, the markets will not have confidence in the government's economic stability program. The pressure on the Turkish lira will continue. Investors will be able to make up for their losses due to foreign currency appreciation only with overnight 500-1000 percent interest rates on Turkish Liras. * A Motherland Party (ANAP)-supported DYP minority government will be equally ineffective since the ANAP can withdraw its support at any time. A party which does not have a guaranteed majority can not carry out a stabilization program. * If DYP and ANAP form a coalition and endorse an early election, they will not be able to achieve economic stability. Recent local election indicate that these two parties both will have to go to their constituents with populist promises. If they go into the elections with separate partners, it is unlikely that they can convince people to support the stability package. After the elections, the administration still will have to undertake large public expenditures. * A technocrat government is completely absurd. Saracaglu points out that his name is mentioned in such scenarios but states that it is unrealistic. Such a government, installed just to reform the economy, would not run in the 1996 elections. It is hard to guess what is going to happen after 1996. Individuals are not going to change their present behaviors if they know that the reforms will be short-lived. And this kind of thinking will prevent the reforms from being successful. * A United ANAP-DYP would be the best solution, Saracaglu contends, and would be his choice of a new government. However, the parties on the Left also must unite. A united DYP and ANAP would have to assemble an able cadre, an economic program, and immediately call for early elections. The vote potential of these two parties is about 45 percent. Explaining the economic package to people prior to the elections may cause them to lose about 5 percent of the votes. However, such a coalition could win an election and govern for five years with their existing vote potential. In this case, a Turkey with a balanced budget, monetary discipline, based on the principle of a small but effective government, and with judicial and educational reform could result from this crisis.

He stated that the objectives of privatization to date have been to make money but in the future the real purpose of privatization will be to make the Public Sector Enterprises (PSE) productive. Furthermore, Yaramanci suggested that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller should prepare the legal basis for such a change "as soon as possible," adding that "all of the countries which have been successful in privatization owe it to the prime minister and the head of the technical team." He also stated that if a legal foundation is not established for the privatizations, foreign investors will be skeptical of the whole thing. He also thought that privatization lacked a cultural foundation and that a great majority of people did not have a sound understanding of it. Yaramanci said, "we will solve the problem of unemployment which might result from privatization by paying 15 percent of the income earned from privatization as unemployment benefits. Yaramanci listed the following as principles the KOI would follow in privatizing companies: * Government-owned companies will be privatized "in accordance with their own characteristics." If necessary, some should be leased. * Privatization will be implemented on the basis of market price rather than insisting on government-fixed prices. * PSE private purchasers will include an experienced group of shareholders who can take on managerial responsibility. * Foreign capital will be allowed to finance privatization since the total amount of capital needed is unlikely to be found domestically.

Additionally, he pointed out that the bank did not plan to give further credit to countries outside of the BSEC. He explained, for example, that about half of the $1.15-billion credit allocated the former USSR still remains, $599 million having been disbursed during 1989-91. For the BSEC countries, funds are allocated as follows: Romania: Of the $50-million export credits allocated to this country in 1990, $49 million have been used. A second credit line amounting to $75 million was opened to this country in 1993, none of which has been used so far. By sector, the credit has been applied: 44 percent for agricultural, 26 percent for machinery and electric material, and 11 percent for minerals and basic consumer goods. Albania: Some $13.8 million of the $15-million credit allocated in 1991 has been used to export iron and other metals, 16 percent for textile and clothing, 16 percent for machinery and electrical materials, 13 percent for chemicals, and the rest for basic consumer goods and other investments. Bulgaria: Of the $50-million credit allotted in 1991, $20.9 million of this has been used. Some 74.8 percent to finance export of construction materials, 18.7 percent for textile goods, and 6.3 percent for other goods. An agreement to open a second line of credit to Bulgaria for $50 million during 1993-94 has not been signed yet because Bulgarian officials have not yet completed the required procedures. Ukraine: Two separate credit agreements have been concluded to finance exports and projects in 1994, which are not to exceed $50 million. Moldavia: Loaned $10 million for 1994. Discussions with Moldavia about the loan has just started and Moldavia has asked that this credit be used to finance telecommunication projects to be realized in this country by Turkish companies. Georgia: A credit agreement amounting to $50 million has been concluded, $28 million of which will be used for consumer goods and $22 million for investments by Export-Import Bank of Georgia and Turk Eximbank in 1993. A list of products subject to these credits are being established by Georgia. Azerbaijan: Two credit agreements have been signed between the International Bank of Azerbaijan and Turkey's Eximbank. One was signed in 1993 to export goods amounting to $100 million and the other on 27 January 1994 to finance a project amounting to $150 million. The credit will cover food, medicine, medical supplies, and telecommunication equipment as well as the construction of telecommunication and industrial plants.
