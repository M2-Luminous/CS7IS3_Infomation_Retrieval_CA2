Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, after attending a forum of ruling and opposition party lawmakers held at Academy House in Seoul, said it is worth studying a de-linking of the two issues. Hong's remarks drew notice because the government is set to review its overall policy toward Pyongyang and decide on future policy following the adoption of a U.N. Security Council president's statement. The government held a senior officials' meeting late last week to discuss its strategy for inter-Korean talks and resumption of "Team Spirit," the South Korean-U.S. annual joint military exercise, and decided to make a final decision after Foreign Minister Han returns Monday evening from trips to the United States and Japan. The government has thus far maintained that an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys should be realized before the third round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks is held. Hong said, "We should study whether the government's linking of the special envoy exchange to the third round of high-level talks is helpful in solving the North Korean nuclear problem. "But if we stopped linking the two issues, there might be a problem of national sentiment that South Korea was being excluded from the nuclear issue and that the government's principles on the issue had changed." In spite of possible problems, Hong personally preferred de-linking the envoy exchange and the high-level talks. If North Korea did not ensure transparency of its nuclear program at talks with the United States despite South Korea having withdrawn the precondition of a special envoy exchange, the world would have a more solid foundation to impose sanctions on Pyongyang, according to Hong. In addition, Seoul does not have to link the two issues to improve inter-Korean relations, he added. If Washington and Pyongyang set up diplomatic ties, then inter-Korean relations would naturally improve: Conversely, if inter-Korean links improved, then Pyongyang-Washington relations would also get better, he said. "It doesn't matter which of the two comes first," he said.
