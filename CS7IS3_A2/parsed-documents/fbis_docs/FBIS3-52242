First, it is good that you have arranged this meeting in this tent, this family-like atmosphere, instead of having to make speeches in public squares. This is much better, a family-like, brotherly meeting. First, I am happy with your high morale and readiness for confrontation. This is not unusual for you as your kinfolk and your forefathers were the heroes of the battle of Sidi 'Abd al Samad, Al Dhlila, Sidi Said, Sidi 'Ali, Al Gdaline [against the Italian invading army in 1911]. History is a witness to the courage of your kinfolk, and their confrontation with foreign invasion, particularly after the fall of Zouara, and the enemy's attempt to advance toward Al 'Ujaylat, the mountains, and Fazzan. [passage omitted] Now there is another confrontation, in another era, with different methods. So far, the battle has not reached the level it had attained with the Italians, with rifles, bullets, and machine-guns. So far, the battle continues with the enemy, but with other weapons and other methods. We want to be very careful this time. We do not want the enemy to laugh at us. The enemy fears us. It says: This land has an armed and trained people, prepared for confrontation. It will bring us other methods. We must be careful about this. [Crowd chants slogans: "Hang them in the public square," "O leader, do not show mercy to any traitor"] Yes, the enemy sometimes takes into consideration the fact that we are a people prepared to fight, prepared for armed resistance. Sometimes it avoids military confrontation, but it enters the battle with us in another way. We must be vigilant to this. This is what we should be aware of as a people who want to be victorious in this battle, and this confrontation, and allow this period to pass without the enemy achieving victory over us. Our forefathers fought the Italians for years and years. The Italians had a super power state in those days in comparison to the Libyans. [passage omitted] We are now in better shape. We are a trained and armed people and more numerous in number. Our population is larger now than in the past. We have industry, agriculture, water, and potential. We can fight and continue the battle for a longer period. Your kinsfolk and forefathers here were the area's lions and protectors. They confronted the Italians and offered their lives in sacrifice to prevent them advancing to 'Ujaylat, Jabal Nafusa, and Fazzan. What is required of you in this place, which is called Al 'Assah, is that you be the guards...[crowd shouts slogans] What is required of you is that you will be protectors of the area once again as your fathers and forefathers had been. Defense is a patriotic duty to protect the economy, the national product, and the Libyan dinar. We are not going to sell our homeland for our stomach. We do not protect our borders by a police force, by helicopters, or desert vehicles. We protect them by our conscience and our patriotism. We are committed, not to do these things [encroach on borders] and we will prevent anyone from doing them. That is protection. [crowd chants] Our ancestors neither lived by smuggling nor did they rely on Italian goods. How could they have fought against Italy if they had been importing everything from it? We are now in a situation as if we were fighting against America, so we are not importing American goods. We are doing without them. We are as if we were fighting against France and Britain, and we are not importing goods from Paris and London. Our independence, sovereignty, and honor are above goods. [passage omitted] Those who stretched their hands and dealt in francs sold us out. They enabled the Italians to reach Fazzan [in southern Libya] and enabled them to trample over the bodies of our martyrs. The traitor now is not just afraid of being referred to public prosecution and the court, he is afraid that his family and his house may be burned, and the masses may storm him. Who can prevent the masses, when on a night of anger they stampede into a farm, a house, two houses, or a whole quarter, and burn and destroy them? In fact, neither the police nor anyone crying out over a loudspeaker is going to stop a deluge. However much you shout, you cannot stop a deluge. The masses are like a deluge. [crowd chants] There is no place for treachery now. One cannot say that those who have betrayed would be subject to the law and the court. No, there are the masses. All the Libyan tribes are determined to strom the house and property of a traitor, and to burn him and his family. The situation has become unbearable. In fact no one can prevent them. I regret that the situation should come to this, but those are the masses. Traitors used to be referred to the law and the court and that was sufficient for us. However, the masses are above the law, above courts and above everything. [passage omitted] The masses can storm any place without mercy or pity where treachery is concerned. This has occurred before my eyes. Al-Ja'akah's [a Libyan national reported to have supplied evidence concerning the Lockerbie incident to the West] family were about to be cut to pieces in front of me. The masses said: Even if you provide guards for any traitorous family, we will storm the guards. We will regard them as protectors of treachery. Confrontation is now in this manner. The Muslim brothers are treacherous; the Islamic Liberation Party is treacherous; al-Takfir wal Hijrah [Islamic movement in Egypt] is treacherous; the Da'wah, the Jihad, the Zandaqah, all these movements have foreign intelligence behind them. They are involved in smuggling; they deal in dollars, foreign exchange, consumer goods; they run after Western goods. All this is treason. If we were to face up to the enemy we must be at a high level of awareness, comprehension, and determination. We must know what weapons are required for the battle. If hundreds of kilometers separate you from the enemy, I do not believe that one should get hold of a rifle or a revolver, aim at the enemy and shoot him, because there is a weapon that corresponds with a long distance. When you are face to face with the enemy, sometimes even the rifle is no good, and steel weapons are used. That is the best weapon in this case. One should know the right weapon needed for close combat. We must know the right weapon for the battle now raging between us and the West so that we may defeat the enemy. If the enemy is shooting at you with a machine-gun and you have a revolver, then that is not it. The machine-gun has a range that a revolver cannot reach. You would not be able to touch the enemy, who would defeat you. Let us live like our forefathers used to live, a clean life, a life accepted by our own conscience, a life that allows us to be free with our heads held high, relying on our land, our animals, our farming, our trees, palm trees, olive trees, relying on ourselves, our own production. But if we keep looking across the sea at their consumer goods and then challenge them, we would not be able to do so. I have already told you: If our forefathers were relying on Italian canned food, or if they were dealing in Italian lire, then we would not have been able to fight Italy. How could we have fought Italy while eating, drinking, and dressing with its products? [passage omitted] Great, that is it, exactly. Great. In reality you people in Al 'Assah area do not need a speech from me. You do not need a long speech. You understand what I have been saying. [passage omitted]
