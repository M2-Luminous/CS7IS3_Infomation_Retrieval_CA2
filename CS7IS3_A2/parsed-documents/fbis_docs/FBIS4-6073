[Blix] What matters is that we failed to thoroughly check a radiochemical laboratory. Thus, we are not sure whether the laboratory has been used only for peaceful purposes. We need to know what North Koreans are doing in the laboratory. Although it is more important to check two undeclared nuclear facilities, the DPRK has rejected our request for special inspections. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The U.S. paper THE WASHINGTON POST reported that North Korea is constructing another nuclear reprocessing line. Is it true? [Blix] Yes, it is. IAEA inspectors confirmed a glove box in the facility. They also knew from experience that the facility was a nuclear reprocessing line when they checked the shapes of other facilities. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How much plutonium will North Korea be able to produce in a year when this facility is completed? [Blix] It could double the nation's current capacity. I cannot say the exact amount. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How much plutonium do you think the DPRK has extracted so far from the existing 5-megawatt reactor? [Blix] North Korea asserted that it took out broken fuel rods from the reactor and declared the removal of a certain amount of material. However, our sampling analysis found that they took out more fuel rods than they declared. The worst part is that we do not know how many times North Korea engaged in nuclear reprocessing and how much plutonium they extracted. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The DPRK is also constructing a 50-megawatt reactor. [Blix] The 50-megawatt reactor will soon go into operation. They are also constructing a 200-megawatt reactor outside of Yongbyon. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the DPRK should increase the openness of its nuclear program, including its future plans for use of nuclear energy? [Blix] Of course. Currently, their nuclear program is utterly unclear. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Japan has started the operation of the fast breeder reactor "Monju," thereby entering the era of plutonium use. What do you think of Japan's use of plutonium and its development of fast breeder reactors? [Blix] From a long-term viewpoint, the development of fast breeder reactors is a sound investment. However, it is not economical, since uranium is now less expensive and safety devices for fast breeder reactors are relatively expensive. I hope that Japan, France, and Russia will actively promote research on fast breeder reactors. The research is also significant for the rest of the world.
