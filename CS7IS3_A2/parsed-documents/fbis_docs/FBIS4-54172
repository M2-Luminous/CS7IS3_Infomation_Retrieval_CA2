FBIS4-54172 "dreas102_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 North Korea ROK Minister's Remarks on Denuclearization Denounced ROK Minister's Remarks on Denuclearization Denounced SK2605094794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1222 GMT 25 May 94 SK2605094794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1222 GMT 25 May 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "An Absurd Remark Reflecting Their Real Intention"] [Text] According to a report, on 23 May at the puppet national assembly's foreign affairs and national unification committee meeting, puppet national unification board [NUB] minister Yi Hong-ku, while laying the blame at our nuclear problem again, openly clamored that the North-South joint declaration of denuclearization has virtually become null and void. This is tantamount to promulgating the nullification of the joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula which was adopted in 1992 and is, therefore, a grave challenge to our fellow countrymen and the world's peace-loving people who want to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. Announcing the invalidity of the joint declaration of denuclearization, Yi Hong-ku babbled that it was because of what they call our nuclear problem. This is indeed a shameless sophistry designed to conceal their true colors. It is a widely known fact that since the joint declaration of denuclearization was adopted, the puppets have hindered by all means the implementation of the joint declaration, including withholding the realization of follow-up measures for the declaration, while laying the blame on our nuclear problem. Furthermore, the puppets have been mad only for their nuclear development manuevers while casting away the pledge they made before the nation. The fact that the puppets who have already secured a large amount of plutonium are now attempting to secure more plutonium by even developing fast-breeder reactors, the fact that the puppets have signed an agreement with Japan for a nuclear development program, the fact that clamoring that the time has come for them to have nuclear capability, the fact that the puppets are asserting that the national assembly should raise the voices calling for nuclear development, and the fact that they are openly talking about nucleaar sovereignty, all of these facts vividly show how frantically the puppets are running wild for nuclear development. In view of these facts, we can be clearly aware that it is precisely the South Korean puppets who have reduced the joint declaration of denuclearization to a scrap of paper and that it is also precisely the puppets themselves who should be blamed for the failure in realizing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This notwithstanding, the puppets are laying the blame at our nuclear problem. This is none other than a foolish trick designed to shift to others the resonsibility for their having nullified the joint declaration of denuclearization by misleading public opinion. Over 1,000 U.S. nuclear weapons are deployed in South Korea today, and the puppets, as well, are not only accelerating their own nuclear development program, but are also staging a nuclear war exercise everyday. Such being the situation, whether or not we can realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a very important problem which has the direct bearing not only on the survival of the nation, but also on the world's peace and stability. This is why the situation of the Korean peninsula today has become a focus of today's world's politics. Therefore, all of the Korean people, as well as the people of the world, are strongly calling for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from South Korea and for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Nevertheless, the puppets who have been raising even growing their own nuclear mushroom under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, are challenging to the joint declaration of denuclearization by openly announcing its nullification. The absurd remark of the puppet NUB minister who has promulgated the nullification of the joint declaration of denuclearization reveals their real intention to remove the burdensome obstacles to their nuclear weapon development project and, thus, to accelerate in earnest their nuclear weapon development. Therefore, his absurd remark is tantamount to a declaration for their virtual nuclear armaments. The puppets are interested neither in the nation's destiny nor in the country's peaceful reunification. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is a group of intolerable nuclear fanatics who are trying to increase the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and to drive the nation into the disaster of a nuclear war. The entire nation will not allow the puppets' dangerous maneuvers to make the Korean peninsula the site of a nuclear war in collusion with outside forces. The South Korean puppets will bear responsibility for all catastrophic consequences arising from their maneuvers to nullify the joint declaration of denuclearization. As long as the Kim Yong-sam ring, a ring of nuclear war fanatics, continues to exist, our nation will not be able to get rid of the disaster of a nuclear war. Those who really oppose a nuclear war and who think of the destiny of the country and the nation should rise up and sternly check and frustrate the puppet clique's maneuvers for nuclear weapons development.
