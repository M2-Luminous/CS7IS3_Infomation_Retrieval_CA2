FR940722-0-00077 FR940722-0-00018 With respect to ``editorial formatting,'' the FHWA does not review reports for this purpose. The FHWA agrees that the use of a report as evidence of work performed and approval for publication are two separate issues, but does not agree that they should not be combined. This comment implies that the report should be submitted to the FHWA after publication for acceptance as evidence of work performed. In addition to determining if the proposed work that was approved as part of the grant was performed, the FHWA should have an opportunity to determine if the contents of the report are supported by the work performed since the published report will include a credit reference to the FHWA. Also, submission prior to publication allows a State to use FHWA expertise, if desired, to identify any necessary technical corrections prior to publication and distribution. If, based on past performance, an FHWA field office is satisfied that prior review is unnecessary and a State requests a waiver of the prior review requirement, the field office may grant the waiver for all reports or for selected categories (e.g., State planning, MPO planning, all research, or bridge research). A waiver may be granted for an indefinite period of time, annually, or any other appropriate period. Whether or not a waiver is approved, appropriate reports that document work performed with FHWA planning and research funds must be prepared, the reports must include a credit reference and disclaimer statement, and copies must be provided to the FHWA as evidence of work performed. Section 420.119␣Fiscal Procedures This section includes fiscal requirements for administration, matching, and payment for FHWA planning and research funds. Paragraph (c) specifies that the statewide and, if appropriate, metropolitan transportation improvement program provisions of 23 CFR Part 450 need to be met for the use of NHS, STP, MA, or HBRRP funds for planning or RD&T purposes. Paragraph (d) includes provisions for waiver of matching requirements for SPR and PL funds (this option is not applicable for optional use of STP, NHS, MA, or HBRRP funds for planning or RD&T activities). If the FHWA determines that the interests of the Federal-aid program would be best served without matching, it may waive the matching requirement for individual activities or regional or national pooled-fund studies. Two commenters stated that authority to approve 100 percent Federal funding should be delegated to the FHWA regional offices. The approval authority for 100 percent Federal funding will remain with the Associate Administrator for Program Development (for planning activities) and the Associate Administrator for Research and Development (for RD&T activities) since these offices are in the best position to determine whether the interests of the Federal-aid highway program would be best served and whether the proposed work can be more effectively addressed if the matching requirement is waived. Several commenters stated that limiting the cost to a minimum of $50,000 for cooperatively (pooled) funded projects and requiring an agency's contribution to be at least $10,000 were inappropriate. Due to administrative costs and the time involved in coordinating pooled-fund studies, proposed national studies costing less than $50,000 will not be accepted. In response to the comments, the minimum agency contribution of $10,000 has been deleted. Agencies contributing less than $10,000 to a national pooled-fund study may participate in the technical committee meetings, but will not be reimbursed from the pooled funds for their expenses to attend the meetings. At the discretion of the FHWA regional offices and participating agencies, regional pooled-fund studies of less than $50,000 may be undertaken and travel costs may be reimbursed from the regional pooled funds for expenses for attendance at technical committee meetings of representatives of agencies that contribute less than $10,000. Section 420.121␣Other Requirements This section contains, mostly by cross reference, other legislative or regulatory requirements applicable to FHWA planning and research fund grants. Except as noted below, this section is unchanged from the NPRM. With respect to paragraph (d), one commenter stated that it appears that the regulation does not differ from present procedures with respect to the acquisition of research equipment. It was suggested that more latitude be given to the States for the purchase of research equipment with SPR funds when the equipment will clearly be devoted to research at a facility largely supported by SPR funds. In accordance with governmentwide grant management procedures and cost principles, equipment is eligible if the cost is necessary, reasonable, and it benefits the grant. Individual items of equipment must be identified in the grant application (i.e., the work program) and will be reviewed for eligibility on a case-by-case basis. In general, if the equipment will be used only for FHWA funded work, all of the cost may be eligible. If the equipment will be used for work funded by other sources, the cost should be shared on an equitable basis or through the establishment of rental/use rates. As noted above under the heading General Comments and Responses, paragraph (o) has been added to this section. This new paragraph specifies that subawards to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations will be administered by the State in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 (58 FR 62992) and the U.S. DOT's implementing regulations, 49 CFR part 19 (59 FR 15657). (Copies of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 and 49 CFR part 19 are available for review and copying in the file for FHWA docket number 93&hyph;18 at the address specified above under the caption FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT .) A new paragraph (p) has been added to specify that reports and other documents prepared under FHWA planning and research funded grants or subgrants awarded after the effective date of this regulation must be in metric units. Subpart B_Research, Development, and Technology Transfer Program Management General Comments and Responses Comment: Several commenters requested clarification concerning various aspects of the peer review process, including the purpose and use of the results of the reviews, funding of travel for review team members, and frequency of the reviews.
