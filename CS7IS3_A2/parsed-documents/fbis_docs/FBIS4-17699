In his opinion, when introducing a national currency "one should avoid the mistakes of Commonwealth nations whose currencies collapsed within several weeks". This measure requires a hard currency reserve or a gold stock equal to $500-700 million, which Belarus does not have. "That is why, we have so far decided on the Russian ruble. Time will show," said Linh. Asked whether the treaty on unification of Russian and Belarussian monetary systems violates the Belarussian Constitution, Parliament Speaker Mechyslaw Hryb said the juridical service of the Belarussian Supreme Soviet has made the following conclusion on the basis of the republican constitution: "An article of the Belarussian fundamental law on the Belarussian National Bank says it shall have the right to monetary emission but there is no indication of the currency unit. It can be either Belarussian money or money of any other state."
