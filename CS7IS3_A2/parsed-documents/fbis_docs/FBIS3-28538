FBIS3-28538 "dreas026_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-026 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 South Korea Daily Compares North, South Fighting Power SK0802133594 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean 8 Feb 94 p 5 SK0802133594 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Article by Kim Chun-pom] [Text] It has been learned that North Korea has succeeded in developing the Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 missiles, which have a firing range of more than 1,000 km, and that it has recently assembly-line produced Russian ultramodern MiG-29 jets. Thus, attention is focused on the ROK's counter strategy and on the balance of North- South forces. Remarkable progress in U.S.-North Korean negotiations over nuclear issues has not been made and the United States is reviewing sanctions against North Korea. This causes the people to worry that a war may break out once again on the Korean peninsula. It is clear that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the first offensive and defensive battle between the North and the South will be a air battle [kongjungjon]. Comparison of the North and South Air Force reveals that the South has 520 tactical planes [chonsulgi] and the North has 850 tactical planes; the South has 190 support planes [chiwongi] and the North has 480 support planes; and the South has 600 helicopters and the North has 290 helicopters. Thus, North Korea has approximately 320 [number as published] more planes than South Korea. The ROK plans to introduce and produce F-16 jets. It has been learned that North Korea has decided to introduce or produce 100 MiG-29's from Russia and that it has already introduced 14 MiG-29 jets. It is estimated the F-16 jets and MiG-29 jets rate the same in performance standards -- mobility, weapons-loading capacity, and radius of action. The superiority of the F-16 and MiG-29 jets will be determined by the ultramodern electronic equipment loaded in both jets and by the ability of its pilots. Both the South and the North are competing to introduce ultramodern fighters. Regarding the comparative strength of the North and South Air Force at the Military Demarcation Line, North Korea will, for the time being, maintain its superiority over South Korea. It is true the ROK is numerically inferior to North Korea when considering the fighting power of North and South. Regardless of the quantitative comparison, the U.S. Air Force has pride in the strength of its air supremacy in the ROK. Comparison of the index number [chollyok chisu] of fighting power -- one rifle equals one index number -- reveals the ROK's index number is 4.5, thus being superior to that of North Korea by approximately 1.5. Of course, the figures do not reflect intangible fighting power, such as pilots' ability and morale. The ability of ROK pilots has been estimated as greatly superior to that of North Korean pilots. Regarding the level of training and ability of South and North Korean pilots, average flying hours of an Air Force lieutenant colonel of South Korea is approximately 2,500 hours, that of a North Korean is approximately one-third that amount. Therefore, our Air Force has the confidence that "it will be a competent match" in the event of an air war between the South and North. North Korea possesses more than 470 aircraft, including the Russian-made fighter MiG-19/21 and SU-7/25, as its mainstay aircraft. The ROK has the F-4/E as its mainstay aircraft and the existing air firepower will be reinforced with F-16's at the end of this year. It is difficult to discriminate between the fighting power of North Korea's MiG and ROK's Chekong because they are almost the same. It has been learned that in the event a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces will apply the following five-step scenario according to the existing combined defense strategy of "Operational Plan 5027:" One, (Pre-war), the U.S. Rapid Deployment Forces will be deployed to the Korean peninsula to deter a war; if a war breaks out; Two (Rejection), the southward invasion will be blocked along the current front and strategic facilities at North Korea's rear will be destroyed; Three (Annihilation), major North Korean combat capabilities will be annihilated and large-scale landing operations will be conducted while breaking through battle lines to advance northward; Four (Isolation), Pyongyang will be isolated and occupied areas in North Korea will be placed under military rule; Five (Post-war), the reunification of the Korean peninsula will be achieved with the ROK's initiative.
