It became immediately obvious after the plebiscite that the people had cast their votes for independence without being in the least guided by the national idea, but by a hope for a better economic situation, in comparison with Russia, and a quick reformation of the economy of Ukraine, whose possibilities were being touted by prominent politicians and economists. The lack of economic reforms led with catastrophic speed to a drop in the standard of living and placed the economy of Ukraine on the brink of a crash. The Crimean parties and movements that came out for the independence of Crimea or annexation to Russia acquired a political weight in direct proportional dependence on a worsening of the economic situation. The most active was the Republican Movement of Crimea (later organized into the Republican Party of Crimea), headed by Yuriy Meshkov. Yuriy Meshkov, who won convincingly in the presidential elections, gained this victory most of all owing to economic promises: The inclusion of Crimea in the ruble zone and the establishment of close economic ties with Russia. One of Meshkov's main promises before the first round of voting was the conduct of a referendum on the status of Crimea; however, after the adoption by the Ukrainian parliament of amendments to the Constitution that allowed the president of Ukraine to revoke the decisions of the Crimean authorities that do not conform to Ukrainian legislation, Meshkov softened his position significantly regarding relations with Ukraine just before the second round, and he even began to say that there is no question of secession from Ukraine. Meshkov did not set forth a distinct economic program describing the mechanism of proposed reorganizations, either during the preelection campaign or after his victory. A reputation for an unpredictable policy, which was reinforced among many observers, was confirmed by Meshkov during the course of his visit to Moscow, already as president. The sensation of this visit was the offer to Russian economist Yevgeniy Saburov of the post of prime minister of the Republic of Crimea after a two-day acquaintanceship. A successful and quick reformation of the Crimean economy, which the newly elected president promises, is extremely problematic. There is no strong authority in Crimea now that is capable of implementing its decisions; there are no borders, customs, or an currency emissions bank. In fact, the Crimean economy cannot be fully fledged while being in strict dependence on the economy and monetary systems of Ukraine and Russia. Local observers note the rather tense mutual relations of the president and the old managerial apparatus. The Supreme Soviet of Crimea and the "party in power" that was formed, relying on Nikolay Bagrov, the speaker of parliament, a rival of Meshkov in the presidential elections, is in no hurry to support the radical steps of the newly elected president that are capable of leading to a confrontation with Ukrainian authorities. Moreover, the invitation to Yevgeniy Saburov to work in the Crimea aroused displeasure both among a significant part of the local political elite and in government circles. The first economic projects that could be heard from the lips of Yuriy Meshkov (the introduction of the ruble together with the Ukrainian coupon into monetary circulation, the use of Crimea as a landing site for "Shuttles" and "Burans") and Yevgeniy Saburov, who has assumed the duties of deputy prime minister (the establishment of a multiple currency regime, in which not only rubles and coupons will be in circulation simultaneously, but also dollars, marks, and others, and the speedy transformation of the Crimea into an international tourist health resort center) are unrealistic. Crimea's economy is rigidly tied to the Ukrainian economy. It is sufficient to mention two factors that are essential to the vital activity of the peninsula: The drinking water and electric power come from Ukraine. A change in the status of the Crimea will at least lead to a switch to world prices for water and electric power, which the Crimean economy cannot endure. On 24 February, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed the decree "On the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in Accordance with the Constitution and Legislation of Ukraine." The decree instructed the Supreme Council of Crimea in a month's time to bring the laws and Constitution of Crimea into conformity with Ukrainian legislation, and the president of Ukraine--to ensure the implementation of the law on the representation of the president of Ukraine in Crimea and together with the procurator general of Ukraine to react in a timely way to violations of the legislation of Ukraine by Crimean authorities. This document was Kiev's first reaction to the development of the Crimean situation after the election of the president, and it became a warning on the readiness of Ukrainian authorities to take harsh measures in the event of attempts to change the status of Crimea. The position of official Kiev is supported by the majlis of the Crimean Tatar people. It declared its nonrecognition of the institution of president, which is recorded in the Crimean Constitution, inasmuch as it was adopted without the participation of representatives of the indigenous people, and also nonrecognition of the presidential powers of persons whose policy will be directed at ignoring the right of the Crimean Tatars to self-determination. Thus, the Crimean Tatars reserve for themselves the right of acts of civil disobedience and even more resolute measures. It can be claimed that stability in the Republic of Crimea will depend to a significant degree on the position of Russia, which has not been clearly stated at an official level to this day. The attempts to strengthen Russian influence in Crimea on a state level will lead to serious complications in Russian-Ukrainian relations and will most likely arouse a negative reaction on the part of the world community. This variant is entirely possible: Ukraine will reject the removal of nuclear weapons from its territory in the event of unilateral actions by Russia with respect to Crimea, inasmuch as this will be a violation of the guarantees of security given by Russia in the signing of pertinent documents. Thus, Crimea becomes one of the important factors of the stability of the European part of the former USSR.
