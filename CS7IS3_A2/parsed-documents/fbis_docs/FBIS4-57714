This will also allow the bank to eliminate distortions in the price of U.S. currency. A mechanism for foreign currency exchange based on the real needs of the market will be implemented to replace the auction. The Central Bank of Venezuela will return to the single and floating exchange rate system, eliminating the 0.20-bolivar differential between the purchase and sale price. This new system is intended to eliminate the parallel market. Here is an excerpt of statements by Jose Bouza Izquierdo, National Banking Council president: [Begin Bouza recording, in progress]...in other words, it will not be a mechanism like those that have existed so far. It will be based on real market prices. The dollar will cost what it must cost to guarantee that those who need dollars to continue operating can obtain them. The difference is that this will not be an auction based on average prices; the banks will make offers based on prices. Later we will provide official information about the operational details of this mechanism, which will be worked out today. [end recording] Juan Tomas Santana, president of the Banking Association of Venezuela, insisted that the authorities are trying to perfect the system of [words indistinct] dollars for the commercial banks. [Begin Santana recording] [Words indistinct] that is why this is not being implemented. We don't know....[pauses] We want to implement this as soon as possible, but we cannot set an exact date. It must be done as soon as possible, because we want to clear up the market and allay the fears of the production sector, the general public, and the media about the auction mechanism. We want to eliminate those doubts, and it must be done as soon as possible. If this mechanism proves ineffective, it will be corrected along the way. There is nothing perfect on this earth. [end recording] This new mechanism of granting [word indistinct] to banks is also aimed at meeting the demand of the country's production sector, which, according to reports, has been seriously affected. More details will be given in the next few hours on this new scheme of foreign currency exchange.
