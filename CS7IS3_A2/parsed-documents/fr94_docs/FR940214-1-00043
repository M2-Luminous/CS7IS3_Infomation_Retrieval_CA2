(iii) Incorporation by reference of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation's ``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd edition) (ANSI/AAMI RD5&hyph;1992) was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

If any changes in ``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd edition) are also to be incorporated by reference, a document to that effect will be published in the Federal Register . * * * * * C. In §405.2150, the undesignated introductory text and paragraph (a) are revised, paragraph (b) is removed, paragraphs (c) and (d) are redesignated as paragraphs (b) and (c), respectively, and redesignated paragraph (c)(1) is revised to read as follows: §405.2150 Condition: Reuse of hemodialyzers and other dialysis supplies. An ESRD facility that reuses hemodialyzers and other dialysis supplies meets the requirements of this section. Failure to meet any of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section constitutes grounds for denial of payment for the dialysis treatment affected and termination from participation in the Medicare program. (a) Standard: Hemodialyzers. If the ESRD facility reuses hemodialyzers, it conforms to the following: (1) Reuse guidelines. Voluntary guidelines adopted by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (A.A.M.I.) 1993 edition (i.e., ``Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers''). Incorporation by reference of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation 1993 edition of the ``Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers'' (ANSI/AAMI RD47) was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. This publication is available for inspection at the HCFA Information Resource Center, 6325 Security Boulevard, Room G&hyph;10&hyph;A East High Rise Building, Baltimore, MD 21207 and the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Copies may be purchased from AAMI, 3300 Washington Boulevard, Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22201&hyph;4598. If any changes in the ``Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers'' are also to be incorporated by reference, a document to that effect will be published in the Federal Register. (2) Procedure for chemical germicides. To prevent any risk of dialyzer membrane leaks due to the combined action of different chemical germicides, dialyzers are exposed to only one chemical germicide during the reprocessing procedure. If a dialyzer is exposed to a second germicide, the dialyzer must be discarded. (3) Surveillance of patient reactions. In order to detect bacteremia and to maintain patient safety when unexplained events occur, the facility_ (i) Takes appropriate blood cultures at the time of a febrile response in a patient; and (ii) If pyrogenic reactions, bacteremia, or unexplained reactions associated with ineffective reprocessing are identified, terminates reuse of hemodialyzers in that setting and does not continue reuse until the entire reprocessing system has been evaluated. (b) *␣*␣* (c) *␣*␣* (1) Limit the reuse of bloodlines to the same patient; * * * * * (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 93.773, Medicare_Hospital Insurance; and Program No. 93.774, Medicare_Supplementary Medical Insurance Program) Dated: September 23, 1993.
