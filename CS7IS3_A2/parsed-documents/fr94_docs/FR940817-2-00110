The purpose of the temporary permit is to allow the applicant to measure consumer acceptance of the food. DATES: This permit is effective for 15 months, beginning on the date the test product is introduced or caused to be introduced into interstate commerce, but no later than November 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nannie H.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 21 CFR 130.17 concerning temporary permits to facilitate market testing of foods deviating from the requirements of the standards of identity promulgated under section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 341), FDA is giving notice that a temporary permit has been issued to The Pillsbury Co., Technology Center, 330 University Ave. SE., Minneapolis, MN 55414&hyph;2198. The permit covers limited interstate marketing tests of experimental packs of canned asparagus. The test product deviates from the U.S. standard of identity for canned asparagus (21 CFR 155.200) in that the test product will contain added zinc chloride in an amount necessary to retain the green color of the product (at a maximum level of 75 parts per million of zinc in the finished food). The test product meets all requirements of the standard, with the exception of the variation. This permit provides for the temporary marketing of 10 thousand cases, each containing 12 425-gram (15-ounce) cans, of the test product. The product will be manufactured at Green Giant Co., 711 East Main St., Dayton, WA 99328&hyph;0026. The product will be distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi. For the purpose of this permit, the name of the product is ``canned asparagus.'' Each of the ingredients used in the food must be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of 21 CFR parts 101 and 130. This permit is effective for 15 months, beginning on the date the test product is introduced or caused to be introduced into interstate commerce, but no later than November 15, 1994. Dated: August 8, 1994. Fred R. Shank, Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20130 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
