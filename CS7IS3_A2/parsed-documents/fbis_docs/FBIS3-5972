"I will remain in office until 1998. I must not step down on the way. Only after I deliver my accountability (before the people's congress) will I step down," He was quoted by the Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI) Chairman Hasan Basri as saying. Hasan Basri together with Azhar Bashir, chairman of the Islamic Organisation Muhammadiyah and Ilyas Rukiat of the Islamic Propagation Council (DDI), met with the president to discuss problem on how to determine the first day of the Arabic Shawal month, 1414 Hegira. Basri said that the president reiterated the remarks in response to the concern of Moslems in the country that he will step down before his tenure of presidential office is completed in 1998. Moslems in Indonesia raised concern over the matter following the remarks of a US author, Donald Wilson, who said in Jakarta recently that Suharto knew well when he steps down. Wilson's remarks provoked speculations that President Suharto will step down before his term of office is completed, the MUI chairman said. "Please do not try to engineer unclear things," the president was quoted by Hasan Basri as saying. The president said that the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) will find the correct new president in the future. "It is illogical if the MPR cannot elect a new president among the 180 million," the president told the Ulemas. On the occasion the president expressed hope that Ulemas would reach a common consensus on the first day of Shawal, 1414 Hegira. He asked the Ulemas to make their best in order that Moslems in the country can celebrate and say their 'id al-fitr prayers on the same day. In the past years, there had been differing views among the Ulemas on the first day of Shawal that Moslems celebrated it not on the same day.
