FR940407-0-00068 FR940407-0-00014 A well-designed EIP will achieve a number of different kinds of environmental benefits. For instance, a marketable emissions permit program, with mass emissions caps declining over time, may achieve several results. The declining cap aspect of the program can result in real emissions reductions creditable towards RFP milestones and attainment (to the extent that actual emissions are reduced). The marketable aspect of the program allows emission sources facing differing costs of further emission control to trade, lowering overall control costs. Such programs also encourage sources already able to meet their mass emissions caps to find ways of further reducing emissions beyond what would otherwise be required by traditional regulatory programs (e.g., through pollution prevention, technological innovation, or changes in operational procedures). Statutory EIP's, submitted because of failures in achieving required emissions reductions, must make a significant contribution to the required reductions, while not necessarily bearing the full burden of achieving all the required reductions or mandating any specific percentage reduction. A program producing no additional emissions reductions or one based solely on a directionally-sound strategy, without quantifiable benefits, would not satisfy these criteria for an acceptable statutory EIP. For discretionary EIP's, the final guidance relies upon the new State planning, quantitative progress, and attainment requirements in the Act to ensure expeditious attainment of the NAAQS, regardless of the type of programs that States may choose to include in their SIP's. Any EIP should include a rationale for how the incentive mechanism(s) will achieve the stated goal(s). A State can create a better overall program design by carefully examining and explaining the linkage between a program's provisions and the desired outcome. The provisions of a program must be sufficient to ensure the program goals are successfully achieved without creating unintended detrimental side effects. 2. Program Scope As with any regulatory program, an EIP must identify the affected sources covered by the program. The affected sources may be defined on the basis of source type (e.g., manufacturing operations), activity type (e.g., fuel storage tanks), location, firm size, quantity of emissions, or other such characteristics. In addition, a State may choose to grant exemptions from program requirements to sources meeting specified criteria. For example, States may consider exempting zero-emitting vehicles from a new parking price program. In establishing the affected source criteria, a State must assure that the resultant program is nondiscriminatory within the meaning given that term in these rules. The program must establish procedures for dealing with sources entering or exiting affected source categories. In order to promote economic growth consistent with achieving environmental goals, a regulatory program should not create unwarranted barriers to entry for new or expanding business entities. In addition, the program must establish criteria and procedures for sources voluntarily choosing to opt-in to or to be exempted from the program, to the extent that the program design allows for such movement into or out of the universe of affected sources. For example, the title IV acid rain allowance trading program includes provisions for sources not originally in the program to opt-in to the program in order to sell sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission allowances to sources already in the program. Certain EIP's may also provide criteria for exempting sources such that they can leave the program; such criteria must be described and the procedures for leaving the program must be included in the EIP. Any such procedures must ensure that movement into or out of the program will not interfere with other statutory requirements nor result in an increase in area-wide emissions that is not reflected in the plan's attainment or RFP demonstrations. Finally, the opt-in program language must specify that it will not allow sources to opt-in if the net result of the opt-in program as a whole is to increase area emissions, unless such increase has been accounted for in the development of the EIP, and is consistent with attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS, RFP, and all other SIP requirements. Affected sources in an EIP may also be covered by other Federal regulatory requirements. An EIP may not interfere with applicable requirements concerning attainment and RFP, or any other applicable requirements of the Act. Thus, the program scope must be defined so as not to interfere with any other Federal regulatory requirements which apply to the affected sources. Such requirements for stationary sources may include, but are not limited to, reasonably available control technology (RACT), PSD and new source review (NSR) offset requirements, lowest achievable emission rate (LAER), best available control technology (BACT), new source performance standards (NSPS), national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP's), acid deposition program requirements, reasonably available control measures (RACM), and best available control measures (BACM). Such requirements for mobile sources may include, but are not limited to, programs integral to vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M), clean-fueled fleets, reformulated gasoline, oxygenated fuels, employee commute options (ECO), TCM's, and Federal motor vehicle controls. In general, sources subject to these statutory requirements may participate in emissions trades pursuant to an EIP as long as, apart from their participation in such trades, they continue to meet the statutory requirements. Thus, if these sources reduce their emissions below what the applicable statutory requirements call for, the reductions beyond the requirements may furnish credits for the EIP. 5 Following is a more specific discussion of the interplay of the EIP rules with several of the statutory provisions listed above. 5 For example, since VOC reductions that occur as a result of controls put in place to meet NESHAP's are creditable to RFP, such VOC reductions cannot be considered as surplus to supply VOC credits through an EIP. However, if in such a case greater than required reductions are made, the incremental VOC reductions could furnish credits through an EIP.
