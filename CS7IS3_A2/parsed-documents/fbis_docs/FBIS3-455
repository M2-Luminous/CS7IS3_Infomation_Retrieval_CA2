FBIS3-455 "drafr045_c_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-045 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AVF Militants Reportedly Plan Viljoen Assassination MB0803112594 Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English 7 Mar 94 pp 1, 2 MB0803112594 Johannesburg THE CITIZEN Language: English Article Type:BFN [Report by Fred de Lange and SAPA] [Text] The pro-election faction the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] yesterday claimed there was a plot to assassinate General Constand Viljoen if he attempts to continue his efforts to take the Volksfront into the election. The plot allegedly has its origin in militant groups within the Volksfront who are violently opposed to the election. The president of the Volks [Afrikaner people] Representative Council of the Volksfront, Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, yesterday expressed his shock about the allegations and said immediate steps would be taken to improve security for Gen Viljoen. After a weekend of high drama which saw Gen Viljoen desperately trying to keep the Volksfront's options open by registering for the election without the permission of the executive of the Volksfront, Dr Hartzenberg reluctantly admitted there was now a small chance for the Volksfront to take part in the election. But sources in the Volksfront said Gen Viljoen's efforts now placed him in real danger of being assassinated. "We have information that elements within the Volksfront violently opposed to the election have made plans to murder Gen Viljoen should he decided to complete formalities on the registration of the Freedom Front," THE CITIZEN was told yesterday. Although the Volksraad [national council] vote was 72 to 20 against registration, it is claimed there is substantial grassroots support in favour of it. The pre-election group claim the Volksraad could be forced within the next couple of days to change its decision. There was also a strong possibility that Gen Viljoen could go ahead, in any case, to complete the registration even if the Volksraad did not change its decision. He would be supported, it is claimed, by a substantial number of members of the Volksfront who did not support the Conservative Party, but backed Gen Viljoen himself as "leader of the Afrikaner nation". Dr Hartzenberg yesterday admitted there still was a chance for the Volksfront to take part in the election. While the Volksfront was aiming for an election for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland], there was a "small possibility" of taking part in the mainstream constitutional process. This would depend on developments today and tomorrow on final agreements to get the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] to complete its registration for the election. Dr Hartzenberg said while he still maintained that international mediation was not necessary for a solution, it all depended on what was offered by the ANC [African National Congress] and the government before the final deadline for the submission of candidate lists expired on Wednesday evening. Should this be adequate -- and he doubted it would -- the Volksfront could still submit a candidate's list and complete the registration. He stressed, however, that an accommodation of the IFP did not automatically mean an accommodation of the Volksfront. "There is always time to save the process and we will look sympathetically to any proposal," said Dr Hartzenberg. He expressed his shock at the allegations of plans to assassinate Gen Viljoen and said he could hardly believe it. "I would believe this from our political opponents, but never from our own people", Dr Hartzenberg said. Although the security arrangements around Gen Viljoen had been stepped up in the past, Dr Hartzenberg said immediate action would be taken to improve this even further. General Tienie Groenewald, a member of the AVF directorate, said yesterday that, Afrikaner Volksfront members had not entirely surrendered their efforts to persuade hardliners to take part in the April elections. "There will be more efforts to convince people in the AVF that we shouldpkeep our options open," Gen Groenewald said. "There is little chance that the AVF as a front will register. But I don't think the matter has been put on ice," he said. Gen Groenewald said it was no secret that some AVF members supported taking part in the election and that they would continue efforts to get the election boycotters around to their point of view. Today's meeting with the alliance partners -- Bophuthatswana and the IFP -- would help determine the AVF's course of action. Gen Groenewald said the AVF would also be examining what results international mediation might be able to deliver. Talks with the African National Congress on a political accord on a volkstaat would continue. More successful talks on the issue on Friday might have secured AVF registration by giving Gen Viljoen something with which to convince his followers of the need to take part in the poll.
