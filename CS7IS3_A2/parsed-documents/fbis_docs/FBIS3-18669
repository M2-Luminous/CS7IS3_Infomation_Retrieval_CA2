Aktuna replied to correspondents' questions during a visit to the Trabzon Governor's Office. Answering a question on whether any action will be taken in connection with those who arrived from France in support of the Democracy Party deputies, Aktuna said: One cannot tell them not to come; one cannot tell them they cannot enter Turkey. One should be tolerant within a democracy. There is, however, a limit to tolerance. One cannot tolerate a stand directed against the independence of the country. Aktuna recalled in particular that France and Danielle Mitterrand remained silent while the most fundamental human right, namely the right to life, was being violated and while people were being taken from the mosques and massacred. Aktuna added: They should have sent representatives to investigate the incidents of terror. He noted that those who refer to the noncommissioned officers who were killed in the Tuzla bombing incident as military targets, those who issue statements supporting the terror organization instead of opposing it, and those who dare to insult Ataturk have exceeded the limits. Pointing out that recent statements have gone beyond the limits of the freedom of speech and belief, Aktuna added that no democrat can accept this. [passage omitted]
