The Seoul Government, having already examined two lists of arms Russia recently offered, has concluded that some would be useful in evaluating North Korea's weapons systems because they follow those of the former Soviet Union, informed sources here said. But Seoul would reject many others on the lists considering that its weapons systems are patterned after U.S. systems and that it maintains close relations with Washington, they added. In response to Russia's proposal, Seoul will shortly send a group of weapons specialists to Moscow to study any technical problems with the arms and negotiate the terms of receiving them in place of the defaulted loans. The Russian Army Chief of General Staff, Mikhail Kolesnikov, will visit Seoul in march to meet with Korean defense officials to discuss Russia's offer of weapons in payment for outstanding loans. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin said in a recent interview with YONHAP that Moscow is ready not only to offer many of its state-of-the-art weapons in payment for South Korean loans in arrears, but also to introduce Korean capital and marketing techniques in privatizing the Russian defense industry.
