The government decided this at an emergency countermeasure meeting held at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office at which working- level officials from the Ministry of Education, the National Security Planning Agency, and the National Police Headquarters participated under the presidency of Choe Hwan, superintendent public prosecutor at the Public Security Department of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office. In accordance with this, prosecutors have begun making a secret investigation into the Committee for the Fatherland Unification and the policy-making committee of the Korean Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon]--the two committees are virtually pulling the strings of the activities of the Hanchongnyon--to find out if their acts are benefiting the enemy. The government also decided to arrest core cadres of the students movement--such as Mr. Kim Hyon-chun, 24, senior in the Shipbuilding Engineering Department of Pusan National University, who is chairman of the Hanchongnyon; and Mr. Yang Tong-hun, 22, senior in the Public Administration Department of Choson University, who is chairman of the Hanchongnyon's Committee for the Fatherland Unification and concurrently chairman of the South Cholla Provincial Federation of General Student Councils; with advance arrest warrants where necessary. In addition, the government decided to arrest all those involved in trying to make contacts with the North, while thoroughly blocking acts of trying to make contacts with the North through the National Alliance for Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification. A rally launching the activities of the Hanchongnyon will be held at Choson University [in Kwangju] from 27 to 29 May and the National Children's Sports Meet will be held in Kwangju from 28 to 31 May. Therefore, the prosecutors are going to cope actively with this situation in cooperation with relevant organizations in the Kwangju area so the Hanchongnyon's rally will be held in a peaceful atmosphere and will not interfere with the sports meet. Since the inauguration of the new administration, the government has thus far maintained a conciliatory attitude toward those in the students movement. The government has now decided to make a swift hard-line change on the basis of its own analyses that recent activities by the students movements have reached a dangerous stage.
