FR940817-2-00179 FR940817-2-00087 [Release No. 34&hyph;34516; File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating To Disclosure of Pending Formal Exchange Disciplinary Proceedings to the Central Registration Depository August 10, 1994. I. Introduction On May 6, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to authorize the Exchange to provide information to the Central Registration Depository (``CDR'') concerning pending formal, Exchange disciplinary proceedings for disclosure to the public. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1994). The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34268 (June 28, 1994), 59 FR 34459 (July 5, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change. II. Description of the Proposal The CHX is adopting Rule 9 to Article XII of the Exchange's Rules to authorize the CHX to provide information to the CRD 3 concerning pending formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings for disclosure to the public. According to the Exchange, a formal disciplinary proceeding is considered to be pending from the time charges are issued 4 until the proceeding is completed. 5 Currently, the Exchange discloses information only on final Exchange disciplinary actions to the CRD. 6 3 The CRD is an automated industry database containing employment and disciplinary history of members and associated persons registered with self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') and state securities agencies. The CRD is operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') with input on policy and other matters from federal and state agencies and other SROs, including the Exchange. 4 CHX Article XII, Rule 1(b) provides, in part, that if in the judgment of the President it shall appear that an accused has committed a default or other offense in violation of the Constitution or Rules of the Exchange the President shall, except as hereinafter provided, direct the staff to prefer written charges against the accused. A copy of such charges shall be served upon the accused. The accused shall also be served with written notice of when and where the charges will be heard. 5 See CHX Article XII, Rule 7. 6 Information concerning final disciplinary actions taken by the Exchange, the NASD and other self-regulatory and regulatory organizations, as well as information concerning certain criminal convictions contained in the CRD, has been disclosed to the public pursuant to the NASD's 800 number service since October 1991. The Commission subsequently approved the NASD's procedures for operating its 800 number service in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30629 (April 23, 1992), 57 FR 18535 (April 30, 1992) (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;91&hyph;39) (``800 Number Service Plan Approved Order''). On July 1, 1993, the SEC approved an NASD rule change to make more information available to the general public regarding pending disciplinary proceedings or actions taken by federal or state securities agencies and SROs that relate to securities or commodities transactions, and regarding criminal indictments and information. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32568 (July 1, 1993), 58 FR 36723 (July 8, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;26) (``Pending Event Disclosure Approval Order''). Information on pending formal SRO disciplinary proceedings, among other events, is currently in the CRD, but only to the extent that reports are made by members, member organizations and associated persons pursuant to their reporting obligations on the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Form U&hyph;4) and Form BD, the uniform application form for broker-dealer registration. The proposal would expand the information available on pending disciplinary actions by requiring the Exchange to report such cases to the CRD. 7 7 On March 31, 1994, the Commission approved a similar proposal by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') which authorized the NYSE to provide information to the CRD concerning pending formal NYSE disciplinary proceedings, for disclosure to the public. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33844 (March 31, 1994), 59 FR 16669 (April 7, 1994) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;11). The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest. III. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 8 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) 9 requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 8 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). 9 25 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).
