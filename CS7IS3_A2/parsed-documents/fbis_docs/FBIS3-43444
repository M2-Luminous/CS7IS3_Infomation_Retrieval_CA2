"Voters must realise that in this election they do not vote for one candidate, but for a list of candidates," the NP said in a statement. It mentioned that McBride, sentenced to death three times for planting a bomb which killed three and injured scores in a Durban pub in 1986, was pardoned along with "Wit Wolf" Barend Strydom who killed seven blacks when he randomly opened fire on them in Pretoria in 1988. The NP added that the accommodation of radicals such as ANC Youth League President Peter Mokaba so high on ANC election lists was evidence of the stranglehold the South African Communist Party had on the ANC.
