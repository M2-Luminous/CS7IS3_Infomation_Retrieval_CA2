The possibility of an operation by the Western air forces should have been taken into account. Since April 1993 there has been a UN resolution which envisions the possibility of such a reaction to the violation of the air space over Bosnia. Since the spring of 1993 NATO has allowed the possibility of taking military action whose purpose goes beyond the defense of the territories of the "16." However, in the past as many as 500 cases of violating the no-fly zone were noted. Why, then, has NATO decided to shoot down the aircraft now? The information coming from the NATO headquarters suggests that the organization's strategists did that for military reasons. Their arguments boil down to the statement that there had never before been such a significant violation of the no-fly zone and that there had never been a need for an unambiguous reaction. Despite that, one can suppose that NATO undertook the operation for political reasons as well. Acting with the authorization of the greatest international organization--the United Nations--it decided to underscore that it is the only political-military grouping in the world which is able to take an effective military action, an action that corresponds to the challenges, threats, and needs of the present day. The NATO operation in Bosnia has no characteristic features of an offensive action (the organization excluded such a character of military operations also in the era of confrontation with the East) or of a revenge action. It is an action aimed at restoring peace in a regional conflict. It offers the Western alliance a chance to regain its credibility, which has been eroded by a lack of action since the beginning of the Yugoslav tragedy. NATO's action shows that this organization feels responsible for the security of the regions located outside of the traditional area of NATO operation. However, it may also show that the West does not want to leave such regions in the zone of Russia's influence.
