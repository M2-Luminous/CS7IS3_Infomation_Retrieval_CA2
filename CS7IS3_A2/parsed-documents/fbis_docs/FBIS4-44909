A blueprint for a future society was supposed to be drawn by superconductivity technology when high-temperature oxide superconductivity was discovered. Finally, significant technical achievements in Japan, such as the success in long-awaited pulling of a superconductor's single crystal and the development of technology for superconducting thin-film synthesis, are reported to have lifted the technical level closer to the level of implementation. In 1993, we saw a great breakthrough in high-temperature superconductivity technology. Having successfully pulled high-temperature superconducting single crystals, the Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL) developed a new process to control crystal orientation by applying a temperature gradient and achieved a magnetic levitative force of 20 kg with an yttrium-based (yttrium-barium-copper-oxygen) superconducting bulk material. At the same time, in the private sector, Japan Steel Corp. developed a production method for a superconductor without any crystalline boundaries and produced an yttrium-based superconducting bulk material that also manifested a magnetic levitative force of 20 kg. Superconductivity is a phenomenon in which electrical resistance becomes zero. Thus, superconductivity permits the passage of large currents without loss, and superconductive magnets generate extremely high magnetic repulsion to lift gigantic objects. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, numerous industrial applications have been conceptualized, e.g., superconducting magnetic electricity storage systems (SMES) to store huge amounts of electric power for power electronics and energy fields; linear motor cars and electromagnetically propelled ships for new transportation systems on land and sea; no-contact belt conveyor systems for distribution systems; new medical diagnostic devices based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device); and superconducting bearings. However, at the time of the discovery of the superconductivity phenomenon, the phenomenon was observed only in liquid helium, or the ultra-low temperature region of 4.2K (-268.8�C) or below, which severely restricted application and peripheral devices. In 1986, the group led by then-Professor Shoji Tanaka, Tokyo University (currently, Professor Emeritus, Tokyo University, and Director, SRL), discovered a high-temperature oxide superconductor that made it possible to use the superconductivity phenomenon at an easier-to-handle liquid-nitrogen temperature. Thus, the dream of superconductivity implementation was instantaneously broadened. Nevertheless, it was still difficult to develop materials that were ready for practical application, and application development was progressing in a stop-and-go fashion. However, the recent achievements at SRL spurred further development of industrial applications of superconductivity. A joint R&D project concerning SMES has already been under way between SRL and electric power companies; and a bearing maker is reportedly on the verge of commercializing a superconducting bearing after having successfully test-produced it from an SRL-developed, yttrium-based, high-temperature superconductor. At the same time, the successful preparation of thin films from a high-temperature oxide superconductor made it possible to develop superconducting semiconductors for ultrahigh-speed computers, such as Josephson devices. R&D is soon expected to accelerate as makers of computers and semiconductors. Big Contribution to Medicine Superconductivity technology is actively contributing not only to the advanced science and technology fields, but also to fields that are closer to our daily lives. Superconducting magnets containing a superconducting wire coil are used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices capable of diagnosing "sliced" sections of a human body. The usefulness of the MRI device in medicine, particularly in diagnosis and treatment, is immeasurable. Furthermore, in medicine, SQUID is expected to help in clarifying the sophisticated functions and mechanisms of the human brain and in diagnosing functional impediments caused by cerebral infarction and senile dementia, Alzheimer disease, and central nervous system diseases. Recently, a high-quality, biological magnetic field measurement system using SQUID was developed, and in April 1994, the Superconductive Sensor Research Institute is scheduled to start full-scale tests, including clinical tests to gather data for practical application. Today, the worldwide market for superconductivity technology, primarily consisting of MRIs and NMRs for material analysis, is estimated to be $1.5 billion (¥165 billion). This market is expected to grow rapidly with accelerated application of the recently advanced high-temperature superconductivity technology in such fields as new energy, next-generation electronics, information/communication, travel and transportation systems, and medicine. Thus, the market is predicted to grow to $12 billion (¥1.4 trillion) by the year 2000 and to $90 billion (¥10 trillion) by the year 2010. Japan is currently leading the world in superconductivity R&D and is also expected to do the same in practical application development.
